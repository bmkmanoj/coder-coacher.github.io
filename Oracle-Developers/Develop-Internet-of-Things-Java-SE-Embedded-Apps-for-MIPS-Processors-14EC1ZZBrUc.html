within the Java engineer with the java
SE team and we talking about java SE
embedded eps on on mips processors and
i'm here with machine the man he and i
know it's going to mess it up sorry and
he'll be talking about the future of
mips processors k typical safe harbor
statement this is in a promise or
commitment for products or features or
anything like that so i'm going to go
over jut what java SE embedded as
quickly we'll talk about java issues
about java running on myths and and give
a quick demo vet talk about some
opportunities for people possible
applications for java running out nips
and then mushy will be talking about the
whole range of things that mips is doing
in the future
okay so first of all how many people
here have worked with Java is he
embedded particular before okay we got a
few so we're going quickly over what it
is it's Oracle's commercial product for
developing embedded systems with Java
it's free for development and it
supports a wide range of different
platforms out there and and it's also
optimized for those platforms whether
regular Java distributions are not so we
have arm of various flavors including
64-bit we have x86 PowerPC typically I'm
running on Linux and nips is in progress
okay in java SE embedded is used in a
lot of different areas only building
automation smart grid a health systems
multifunction printer controllers i
think might have Java Sea and running in
your printer in your office let's see
James Gosling's Thomas Marine sailboat
that our boat that he has showing in the
demo floor that's running java sea
embedded and even Larry's gigantic
multi-million dollar sailing boat and
it's got java SE embedded with hundreds
of sensors and running all over some of
the features that are that are in it
that make it a little bit different it
includes a normal head full support for
GUI applications but typically for the
embedded market you go with a headless
platform which lets you reduce the size
of the distribution in the memory
requirements and includes a full set of
java SE 8 features so we got lambdas
which are built on little dynamic
support and compact profiles
so there's three compact profiles in
java SE embedded eight compact one has
sort of the most the most basic and
typical API is that you need for java
applications as compact to add support
for the larger system with xml support
GBC and RM I and finally got a compact 3
adds a lot of management support and the
management support allows you to use a
lot of the modern full-fledged Java
tools like visualvm some profilers
jconsole all that kind of stuff and
finally you can add full java SE support
with desktop apps and everything else so
what do you get out of making its
compact profiles you can actually reduce
the set whether the size required on
device quite quite a bit so if one of
your twenty to twenty eight megabytes is
quite a big difference than 62 on some
of these really small devices that often
just a flash memory ok so now talk about
Java running on mips and a little bit of
background in mips for developers this
is stuff that i found will be
fascinating no it's a classic RISC
architecture just like back in the old
school days it's a very similar to the
spark spark architecture though it
doesn't have those silly register window
things that we had it has a good old
branch delay slots which were which are
fun in fact from a Java point of view we
realized for up to optimizing java on
multi-threaded processors such as the
Nagra course when they first came out
that doing some of these old
optimizations with branch delay slots
still paid off a system as it was
designed for workstation class
environments so even though it's used in
embedded devices now it has really
powerful 32 general-purpose registers
which makes it real easy to to make a
make pretty efficient code they're also
used with big endian at little italy a
little endian support it's not one of
the other in them in the MIPS world a
lot of times the networking processors
will have a beginning and support and
more multimedia kind of devices dust
set-top boxes and blu-ray players might
be more Little India
but of the systems and the tools around
them I'd have to be prepared for birth
both and one of the things that I found
really interesting is that there's both
32-bit and 64-bit nips but the 32-bit
nips is a subset of 64 in fact we take
advanced Allah compatible and we take
advantage of that and run to the 32-bit
applications on it 64 systems for
testing ok given with that there's also
a lot of a a lot of parameters now to
configuration options between things you
have 32 or 64 bit what C library is on
the system is your floating point so you
have soft float or hard float
multi-threading is optional but it is
I'm quite partial that it's the kind of
for very little hardware resources you
can get good speed ups on sign up some
applications there's a 16 bit version of
the instruction set for more compact
applications there's so many other
extensions that you might find simdi and
DSP kind of optional features so Java
actually been running on mips for quite
a while in different with different
places Java ME CDC has been running on
mips for a long time and in fact is the
basis for java running on most on
blu-ray players which which is an
interesting environment but it's kind of
hard to unless you're in the blu-ray
space to take advantage of that on
furthermore there's a job engineering
services group which puts together
different ports for customers on an
as-needed basis someone examples the
system with a broadcom processor running
jdk six had this version on there many
many others
so what we're trying to do now for java
SE 8 is port Java to run on particular
targets omits 32-bit version revision 2
of beginning support soft floating point
using Linux with the UC Lib C library
will talk about that in a second and in
order to do that we needed some devices
that sort of matches configurational I
talked a bit about some devices that
worked well for us not that it's an
endorsement to purchase ease but they
work well for us and finally a lot of
these networking based systems use a
variant of Lennox called open wrt all
right that's built on this on a build
root system which is a system that
generates very customized versions of
Linux four different different devices
so it actually generates a tool chain a
kernel the root file system and the
bootloader to run on a particular
devices and it's tuned for these really
small devices that have embedded flesh a
lot of them also have very interesting
file systems they might have an a
read-only file system overlaid with a
rewrite file system and it can be a
little bit surprising sometimes the hell
how code runs on that instead of your
typical Linux with lots of little
binaries for for doing your standard
UNIX command line utilities they as busy
box which sort of compresses all those
into one and like I said open wrt can
run with you see lipsy orgy lipsy who've
been using the you see let's see version
okay so enough about nuff about that
it's you see lipsy is a really small
version of G lipsy library a really
extreme case of that is you know 570 k
vs megabytes and a lot of that is
students or locale data compression
choices that they made but they've
optimized for sides instead of speed
some of the issues with this is that
there are many features that are
optional depending how you configure TC
lipsy and there's some features that
just left out and not even optional
so when you're trying to implement
something like java virtual machine
which is a fairly complicated system
that reaches into a lot of parts of the
operating system that kind of gave us
some trouble as some things were
sometimes things are two stripped down
one of the issues that came up was with
threading support with pthread library
on different versions of you see lipsy
are missing some important features like
understanding where the stack size what
the stack sizes are or the stack bounds
are and sewed for earlier versions auc
lipsy we had to have a lot of customized
code and things change fairly quickly
between different versions ec lipsy so
the later versions actually had what we
wanted that gets us to the backward
compatibility thing it was a stated on
goal of ec lipsy to have a lot of binary
compatibility between versions so that
that rod gives us some complications as
well and then finally some of the
floating-point stuff libraries are not
as precise Java has extremely precise
floating-point semantics so when you
multiply two floating point numbers
together there's exactly one bit value
that you can get a new fresh off by a
bit that's not a compliant Java system
so we have to work around some of the
inconsistencies of the built-in support
and provide a lot of our own floating
point support
for development purposes we needed to
have some boards that were so large
enough to do JVM development because we
can't just provide the compact profile
but we're going to be building all the
different profiles and full system so we
need to make sure that the artist system
would run on the device and that
furthermore the sqe team has even larger
constraints they want to have whole test
harnesses and lots of other
infrastructure around to doing their
testing so we pick some somewhat larger
systems then you might need to do
deployment but we're looking for things
are commercially available easy to buy
things that we could get to a purchase
is going to department and let go for
those so one of the first ones that came
up with is your typical Aaron netgear
polymer desktop router the other
complication when you try and do
development work with a a Wi-Fi router
at work is how to be very careful to not
want to follow the I the networking
police so I have to stand here not a
router the Wi-Fi is turned off don't
confiscate this don't come blasting
through the wall the windows but it's a
nice device it's got you know that a
medium speedy the MIPS processor the big
endian it's got plenty of ram and flash
for it for running java it has a USB
port in the back so you can put in a
flash drive and put in lots and lots of
test programs and then everything that
so it's worked out pretty well thanks oh
and it's running open wrt
okay right then we have another advice
we're using here is this you Piketty
edge router light comes a nice box in
fact it's running right here this is a
dual-core processor and in fact it's a
64-bit processor so it's it's faster
it's dual core it has even more RAM and
flash and in fact there's actually two
gig drive inside the inside the case
that we could swap out and they can run
a full-blown debian distribution so
that's a much more convenient
environment for us okay so in these
boxes are also not just good for
development but they're also good for if
you think of prototyping Internet of
Things gateways or being a hub for local
devices that it could be kind of handy
so this point of the demo were supposed
to be doing an einer of things demo
unfortunately there was a feature that
slipped which virtually without wouldn't
be a big deal the invoke dynamic
bytecode all the other byte codes work
fine and a job at c7 that wouldn't be a
big deal because invoke dynamic is only
used to run like Jai thon and JRuby and
stuff on top of the JVM but now with the
java SE eight features with lambdas
they're just heavily by the lambeth
feature and the lambda features used
heavily by everything so a networking
particular had a bit of a glitch so
instead we have i'm just going to show
it simple you know proof of concept that
yes we are running java right so java
version so this is talking to this edge
router device here and at such of eight
and there's a classic benchmark spec JVM
98 that doesn't use any new byte codes
from quite a long time ago and so that
runs this is a debug version of the
system but it it goes and runs and does
lots of different pretty much CPU bound
computation
so that's something good fun
okay so what next so what are some
things that with this technology that
what can it do for you and what are some
opportunities that you could make
systems and applications so one of the
things that's kind of interesting is
using really ready readily available
devices like this you can do lots of
simple prototyping of IOT systems
without developing your own hardware
they're very inexpensive 100 buck 60
bucks whatever they are there's an
active developer community around these
networking systems so that whole open
wrt thing there's a big group of people
that developing not java software but
doing all the other kind of software
around many kinds of networking devices
like that and you can also think about
possibly considering that the millions
of these devices out there in your homes
and your businesses that there might be
an opportunity for putting Java add-on
services on those devices and there's
also many new thank you it's a new
opportunity so this is a board that's
just came out it's in its creator it has
a dual core mips32 processor on here it
runs debian linux and and other versions
of linux it has a lot of general-purpose
i/o stuff a taxi has a Raspberry Pi
compatible expansion slot a lot of RAM
let a flash so this is a pretty
interesting system when you want to
think about customizing hardware and
custom doing a custom hardware design
this could be a good basis on a good
prototype it's running ingenix processor
so it has a pretty fast dual-core system
it actually has optimized GPU in there
and many many many high I o devices
so the this to wrap up my part of the
thing the benefits a job on mips so it
opens up a wide range of the MIPS
devices from these all the way up to
server class MIPS devices could all be
running java it lets people use their
common skills your java skills or
readily available java skills instead of
sort of hard to find embedded c
programmers lets you use a wide range of
java libraries if you need an XML parts
saying if you need an application server
if you need just about anything there's
a chance as an open source java
implementation they can run fine on your
device then also lets you have common
code between your Internet of Things
devices your gateways and your back-end
servers which might typically be running
java so you can run the same libraries
instead of having to have different
implementations of code on both sides
and finally it's lets you use all the
java programming tools that you might be
used to so your IDs profilers debuggers
and management tools for multiple device
management sorts of things including the
Java Mission Control product ok and with
that I'm going to move it over to Majid
thank you
so just wanted to make sure a few points
I worked with a lot of operators and
service providers and the next
generation gateway routers are going to
be a concentration or aggregation for
lot of IOT devices there's a lot of
effort that's going on to make the
gateway to the center of the hub or
authenticating connecting to IOT devices
and what I would like to do is to thank
you guys to some of our activities
within the space and some of the
capabilities that offers and then we
came to some Q&amp;amp;A obviously Derek talked
about what we're doing with the current
and activities with Oracle we are we've
engaged roughly about six months and
reporting or mips32 revision to I saw
into the the middle java SE eight is
being ported to mips32 or r2 and follow
on there are plans to go pee on and
address the most recent instruction sets
for for mips as well with that I'd like
to give you an overview of the company I
have you guys may not have heard of
imagination imagination has been around
for many years over 20 years in the
industry the claim to fame is the GPU
lots of mobile devices that you see
today Kerry imaginations a GPU we are an
IP company we ranked number three this
arm synopsis and imagination the
obviously a target high-volume we also
have a brand called pure if you go to
bestbuy or amazon you'll find our brand
pure which is a digital radio and a home
automation capabilities and pure is
actually a channel for us to take our IP
and validate
before we see our other customers to do
that it's been established in the UK
headquarters and the other thing is that
about 18 months ago imagination
purchased mips technologies and as a
result they got combined now we have it
you know capability for both cpu and GPU
technology plus a lot of other things we
talked about we are clearly engaged with
many market segments today and and to
have a long history and track record in
many of these markets which I'll talk
about more in that try to segment the
markets into mobile consumer compute
networking and you know clearly we have
billions of units to have been shipped
the combination of GPU and CPU being a
mobile devices obviously or for that
matter in the case of the stuff that we
working with java is falls into this
category so the significant number of
devices that are shipping based on lips
this part is more mainly the GPU
activity and the rest are the
combination of the GPU and cpu there are
children collectively there's seven
billion devices that are shipping or
shipped already and we run about three
million devices per day
oh I see okay so basic and and also
there is in a long list of customers we
work with the name brands that are not
this is a subset and also partners
including Oracle that make up our
customer base and partner base you could
work closely with our customers to
define products work with our partners
to define establish the ecosystem our
products or simply into four categories
we have the power of ER as i mentioned
our GPU technology that's used heavily
in mobile there are there have been
announcements with apple and others that
utilize the technology or power we we
are in the area of vision is more of a
dish you know in for the cameras miss
products and then sigma is another
technology for communication a flow
cloud connectivity is basically bringing
iot type of capability and connectivity
from the cloud so combination of these
make up or offering within our portfolio
clearly out there prolly three things
that are important here to note between
the mips power we are proud of you or
graphic graphics and display and
communication is that one is coherency
you know we need to make sure that these
devices are coherent and we put in a lot
of effort to make sure that cpu GPU
coherency is their second is the
virtualization going going forward with
a lot of these int activities and
integration a lot of these devices you
need to be able to virtualize and on top
of virtualization into a deployed
security so these three things are
heavily are on our roadmap and i'll be
working on it so you're making
announcements on our cpu is being
virtualized fully virtualized GPUs being
fully virtualized and we can para
virtualized today and future be able to
further visualize elements within the
SOC
as a result we can isolate traffic of
Netflix from your digital wallet from
your payment system and so forth I'm
guarantee that are completely isolated
isolated and protected and secure
transactions so those are the efforts
that we're putting in e2 and to our
products in the case of IOT these are
clear areas that we are have
traditionally as I mentioned we have
millions of units that are shipping in
these areas as a classical products
mixes and deployed into this product and
going forward we clearly are putting
effort into making sure that for the
next generation IOT we are payable to
address the requirements at IOT which is
low power and virtualization security
all of those features are being
implemented in the processor and the GPU
to addressed in next generation products
diving into MIPS load more in detail
basically we are one of the leaders in
the 64 bits has been around for 20 years
we have three class of products from the
MIPS what we call warrior class there's
m-class I class MP class in class is the
more about jelly bean processors you see
in lot of control applications
behaviorally using the IOT a and
variables or I classes or mid-range
that's kind of canoe balance of
performance on power an empty class is
more performance where you need to know
tomorrow for compute and server type
application we offer a blessed PPA
performance power area and for Luud
applications we demonstrate that we can
I should clearly provide what forty
percent
in the area versus calm composition what
multi-threading is another key have
value-added we bring into the
architecture or ability to run multiple
threads with the processor is specially
for networking and storage is crucial
and allows you to get as much as fifty
percent improvement in in your in your
processing power so these are the MIPS
classical you guys are probably familiar
with this is where right now be putting
the effort into porta Java the reason is
that we're shooting millions of units
today are based on the routers and other
devices and we have customers that are
actually not looking for an indo java SE
8 from what used to be at c-6 so the
effort is going on here to port the java
going forward we are actually
introducing new class of products we
actually introduced last month class of
products called warrior and good warrior
is a new instruction so that's also
being introduced called r6 amid are six
is the effort that we will put together
with it Oracle to port from the
classical to the new version I will talk
about what the features of some of these
cores are as Derek mentioned basically
the nice thing about mips architecture
is that the leapster it is a subset and
you can effectively run in 32 and 64
environments and that's what we're doing
also has we gonna pour to 64-bit we take
exactly that a little bit drop it in 64
I will actually work it won't be able to
address the 64-bit spacing however will
actually operate and run 32-bit fashion
and talking about the what I just
mentioned that last introduction of our
processor is called nips I 6400 this is
an age range
processor time 6400 is it's got four
threads and also has two pipelines to
instruction pipelines so you can take
advantage of 24 threat and two pipelines
effectively for almost ten percent
increase of this for threat you get
about fifty percent plus throughput
that's the key for a lot of networking
very dispatching dispatch in a request
into a memory or i/o it takes time so
you can actually use another threat to
occupy the pipe so quite an effective
day of utilizing the SOC is a dual issue
with multi threading the nine stage
pipeline the supports cindy instruction
binding branch prediction and obviously
very low literacy the other thing i
thought it would be interesting to
mention is that in order to really
enhance the ecosystem you started a
foundation called purple purple
foundation.org is an initiation by
imagination to bring bleep players that
actually utilize mips in the
architecture and bring them together and
create a comment foot platform to do
optimization to develop tools and
effectively address a lot of market
segments and accelerate the development
so we have the folks here that come to
the truth to a same organization for a
common cause meaning you know get the
compilers optimized getting the tools in
in order and I actually be a platform
for upstream as well as a common
platform on a location for gathering
your data so i encourage you guys to
look at the purple foundation org and if
possible join or participate in the
event it's a excellent place for
enhancing the MIPS ecosystem and finally
just to mention that you currently
working with Oracle very effectively to
port a mips 32 and its work in progress
I think sometimes so we're going to beta
engaging with the likes of many of the
customers that are not named here and
then after that we were starting
beginning of next year move move into
doing 64-bit port so it's going quite
well you're quite happy and interested
in actually seeing you guys participate
in if you have questions or support or
how can you know help you guys pretty
much sums the presentation and we have
time for and addressing any specific
questions you have between Derek one
Derek and myself yes sir how much
yeah we see tourism okay pick it up
I don't know exactly what the minimum
number is a compact profile itself for
looking at 20 sun-baked for java so then
there's you know what what kind of linux
distribution do you have on the board
it's it's a medium sized thing it's a
Java ME would be a smaller system for
that but but I don't think there's a
mips version in progress right now are
you gay development or nobody for the
smaller version yeah yeah I think we're
working on on sort of these size
platforms may get tiny bit smaller but
not not really really tight systems is
your interest for what kind of
application regularly the devices which
are quite small all of those yoooo
straight but they don't have a lot of
classf it'll be about next not cancel
next the blue manager of storage and if
I can't
application there yeah job yep so the
charity bars for tea bag and there's no
way we better tell is nothing short
unfortunate yeah I mean I've worked in
that I've done Java and a 32 k 32
kilobyte keep before and that it's tight
but you know I've made Java work in
smaller systems but that was that was a
research system is not in production
Canada questions about java or mips or i
see embedded 8 yeah it sounds like this
is not actually yeah there we don't have
an early access or release date yet
specified sir on these they always like
every byte code button book dynamic was
working just fine unfortunate that
cascades into a bunch of the AP is that
that start falling over after afterwards
so without giving me a date on this fall
sort of timeline with wink wink yeah I
don't think idea there are aspects of
the Java release cycle which are quite
time consuming the extremely rigorous
testing process so and I don't I haven't
been through release cycle with that I'm
sort of a new to this part of the group
so like I can't hazard a guess it would
be clearly first off next year that's
not my another book people in so say
that is that yeah that's a better test
for me yeah just just a class I can
follow that point so right now I can't
go and buy a head router and run driver
I just uh yeah yeah I'm fortunate out
here what is the tiniest you guys
looking for Oh Russ it would be now we
do have a 90-day weigh out there
we were looking in sizing it down
substantially to dry out so it's but we
just use the improbable duck but now
which is way too big
we want to sell as a gateway something
that looked like a really just a
platform gateway yeah so we had now now
to a set up I guess okay well it's good
to hear I've got a good good good seen
interest these are the same for yourself
you can take this offline and get a
religious matter okay anything else okay
I guess we can wrap this up if you have
any questions and come on up okay thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
