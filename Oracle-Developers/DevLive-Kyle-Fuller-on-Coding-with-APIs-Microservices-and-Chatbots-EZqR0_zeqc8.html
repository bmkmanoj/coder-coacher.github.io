technology Network and here we are live
from Oracle code Brussels and today I've
got Kyle fuller here with us hey Kyle
how's it going pretty good good so um
you are in our keynote just a few
minutes ago with James and it was great
fun because you showed off probably one
of the coolest applications for anybody
from Oracle or in the Bay Area these
days because Kyle knows the guys who
have written the application for the
Golden State Warriors so tell us a
little bit about the concept behind that
application right so people are like oh
we're building a chatbot and so
basically on facebook Messenger you'd be
able to request that you want to buy
some tickets the next Club game and you
can go through see what's available and
it will hit an API and give you a
listing of all the possible seats so
that of left because they go pretty
quickly
and then it will tell you the price and
then you can go and pick and then go
make your booking directly from the
Facebook app nice and doesn't integrate
with any of the social channel so I
think it's just on facebook Messenger
that's what that's still cool that's
still pretty broad that's wonderful so
how did they you know how did the
architecture come to be on this I mean
starting from which content they wanted
to be integrating or collecting or how
did the concept build so I'm not too
familiar with how it built but from
where I see is the I had an idea of how
the API would look and they used to a3
the platform I work on to design an API
and using that API they use the rest of
Oracle's infrastructure so there's a
basically very easy way to create chat
BOTS with the Oracle cloud you can pull
in components that you can deal with
your chat infrastructure
and then you just link it for Facebook
or black or any chat provider you would
like really easy to get go it's very
cool well it's a very popular app right
now I'm sure and so and that's really it
was really neat to have you you know
kind of walk us through it during the
keynote so that's you know that was fun
so let's talk a little bit about about
chat box okay so what I mean is it just
like a G Winston or if it's like you
know a very it's a trick or is this
something that is an enduring piece of
communication software for any
application there seems to be a lot to
push on the having like Amazon echo or
Siri in your home on a speaker and this
allows you to take those chat box
directly and talk to them so I can walk
home and our theory to do some action
for me and it ties all into the services
and the Oracle infrastructure allows you
to do that well why what it what
attracted you to this technology and
wanting to go after this is this
something that you just found you know
easy and simpler is this something that
you have really been focused on
developing so I'm in my past I've been
really interested in iOS and application
development so I will experience there
and Apple and do like sort of a company
to kind of push in this new way so an
iOS application can really integrate
with Siri and you can invoke your
application using Siri so it's just
another way to utilize an existing
application nice so what are some of the
other apps that you've written it posted
up in the Apple Store
alright so many years ago I got
frustrated with to make this into
applications that will kind of into
functionality so I went off and built my
own and IRC client which is a chat
protocol which is really old five years
older like the 80s other nine okay and a
lot of those concepts have been
reapplied to the modern age like slang
it was very similar to IRC in the way it
works so I built an application for that
and Europe is
you're not tied into any specific
provider so it's not like you have to
use Facebook you can use one app with
another server as you wish
so that allows you to write an
application just for that and you don't
have to maintain a server writing
outside because you can connect to
anyone nice would you write that in so I
originally wrote in a kqc and then I
rewrote it in cliffs we're not all
really certain two years back all right
that sounds good
that's very good so what what do you
think that makes this an exciting time
for developers in general I mean when
you come across some of your you know
people at conferences or even you know
in some of your chatroom stuff what
makes this really exciting time for
developers so I think it's a really
exciting time because there's lots of
open source projects that you can
utilize to build offers you don't have
to go build the entire stack these days
you can make use of existing components
just in cloud services like most of the
work is done for you you can actually
just focus on your idea not running
services and the rest of the stuff you
are interested in you can just focus on
the code on your product so it's a great
time to really innovate because you're
not wasting your time in elsewhere when
you don't need to write a lot of that
over heads getting taken away through
either frameworks or through containers
and that sort of thing yeah lots of
projects that is like you can now deploy
code with docker on Oracle cloud it's
like a single command as go back ten
years ago it wasn't so simple you have
to do like releases sequentially and
these days you have companies like a
free which uses continuous delivery so
we're supplying multiple times a day
maybe an hour so this just wasn't a
thing ten years ago yeah that's great
that is really great I wonder what do
you think the next big the next big
thing will be for developers I mean is
it going I mean for a long time it was
like let's get an app in the App Store
but I mean are there any big projects of
open source cloud
whether your favorites that you're
keeping an eye on because they're
working on something big so I'm pretty
interested in twist which is apples
language because it gives a lot of
safety so it really helps you to reduce
the amount of bugs in your code because
it kind of removes them as a possibility
it forces you to handle errors in touch
so this makes writing code gives you the
confidence that you are in street bug so
I'd like to see more safety around and
that you won't leave you you want to fly
an app the user where it will crash and
launch because it wouldn't even be
possible in my language to crash right
so I think there's a lot to go there and
stability summit but I think everyone
would like to see all right well keep an
eye on that project and you might find
Kyle fuller there thank you for joining
me today this is great fun thank you
alright talk to you soon we're here at
dev live at Oracle code Brussels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
