a yellow one so who is the CTO of Amos
work so Lucas you want to tell us a
little bit about what you do and how you
arrived here that Oracle code which was
very bright and early
it was very bright and early I started
the day at 3:30 UK time - home it is all
very smooth but of course it's wrong way
from Jumeirah Netherlands - in the heart
of London got it
well thank you so much for coming over
oh you're welcome it's very nice to be
here great so you're gonna be presenting
today I think it's something about
service worse and micro services can use
a long title can you it is can you help
educators are you good
I just consider this the trailer for
your actual visitation yeah well that's
me and it's not micro services uh-huh
and it's about how micro services have
to work together in order to accomplish
more than a complex piece for example
how to do a business process together
okay but they need to be standalone
micro services are isolated so without
being aware of each other
how can they together form a certain
process and we do it using events and
the bus you were talking about the bus
and the title is an event bus by
exchanging events via the bus the micro
services can do a choreography fairly
complex business processes in which each
of the micro services takes their own
role that they stay completely
independent and I can swap one
implementation of a micro service for
another and the whole choreography will
still continue to work so it's like kind
of like a plug-and-play all the micro
services become the plug and play actors
and they fiddling a little bit with the
sound you have trying to get your volume
up
okay hopefully that's a little better
okay and what's also interesting is that
some of these micro services run on
premise in this case on premise means
mine
my laptop and some of them run in the
cloud can the Oracle cloud and the
events are exchanged between the clouds
and on-premise the laptop and the
backbone of the event bus in both cases
both in the cloud and on-premise is
Apache Kafka the micro services are
implemented most of them using no GS
that's running in a docker container and
all the docker containers together are
running on Cuban ETS that's the
container management platform ever and
that takes care all scaling them
starting them restarting them and also
linking them up in terms of the network
and what's the API is just like through
how how these are all of these services
communicating well they aren't
communicating with each other or they
are but only via the event bus okay all
the micro services publish a restful api
which is on using nodejs any express
framework that's where we can interact
with the functionality of the micro
service and if you want to from the
outside but then at the same time with
the other ear so with one ear they're
listening to incoming HTTP requests on
their REST API okay with the other ear
they listening to the event bus for any
events that may trigger them into action
so if as part of the choreography as
part of the business process in which
they have to play a part there will be
an event that says something needs to be
done and the micro servers knows I'm the
guy who can do this particular thing
then they will also react to the event
do their thing and republish the event
with their own results added to it to
the routing slip of the workflow so are
there some particular kind of
applications that the service person
this kind of architecture with using
micro services plays very well to is a
kind of a sweet spot for something like
that I mean I know you both mentioned
both on promises and clouds but is there
some kind of something that is well
targeted for or is this data leave at
anything and everything that's out there
we are still figuring out as a community
I think
what microservices can bring us together
and the objectives I think are clear it
has to deal with agility with DevOps
with the ability to have teams take
control over not just the functionality
they provide but also the operations of
that functionality micro services are a
means to that end to be able to evolve
software much more quickly than we have
been able to do in the past and now the
question is these micro services are not
completely standalone functionally
speaking they need to interact but if
they call each other's api's then they
still have a direct dependency by using
events we further reduce the
dependencies that's one of one of the
objectives how exactly we're going to
use it what we going to do with the
micro service really exact scope is and
granularity of the micro services are
they small as the name suggests or are
they big as their objective maybe
suggest we don't really know yet and
being able to use the eventbus being
able to exchange information between
micro services in a very d-cup of
fashion seems to be something that we
need to make proper use of micro
services but how exactly we're going to
use it we don't know yet so it's a story
that's still unfolding it is it is and
that's also what makes it so interesting
I can take a look at the first denote
session today by Adam bian he explains
how you can do micro services that
contain the java ee platform and that's
also part of the story and which
platforms can be used inside a micro
service which platform facilities do
micro services need with are not part of
the Microsoft are part of the micro
service platform that's also something
we still are debating and I it's my
position my statement that the eventbus
is a facility that's not part of the
micro service but at is part of the
micro services platform so any
organization who wants to do micro
services should have any vendors
available to all the micro services ok
great so what time is your presentation
today
about three and a bit 15 I guess so
stay tuned and please check out Lucas
yellow man's visitation yeah you're
surely good okay and go and get yourself
a cup of coffee if nothing else I will
okay thank you so much for coming thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
