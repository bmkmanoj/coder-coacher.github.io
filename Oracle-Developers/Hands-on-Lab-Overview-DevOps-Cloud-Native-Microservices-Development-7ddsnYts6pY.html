software development life cycle SDLC for
a cloud native project that will create
and use several micro services
throughout our journey we will assume
roles inside a fictitious company called
alpha office and perform the actions of
each persona as we progress through the
DevOps like cycle as one of the leading
off supply retailers in the country
alpha office is focused on growing the
bottom line and providing a modern by an
experience to consumers today leadership
has asked IT to tap into the voice of
the consumer and merge social media
directly into the company's legacy
product catalog the goal is to create a
next generation by an experience that
feeds consumers relevant information and
helps consumers make a better buying
decision IT has less than a month to
produce a prototype in order to meet the
deadlines they will not only be
leveraging the cloud but for the first
time they will be implementing the agile
development methodology agile
development enables alpha office to
produce and release parts of the
enhanced product catalog inside of
smaller more frequent deliverables
called Sprint's our first print will be
led managed and monitored by our product
manager Lisa Jones within the developer
cloud service Lisa will have a
360-degree view of not only her
development team but also a full peer
review into the agile development tools
required to execute including issue
tracking code versioning wiki's and
continuous integration and delivery
automation scripts to build the new
product catalog let's take a look under
the covers at the architecture that
powers the developer cloud service the
service directly integrates with
JDeveloper Eclipse and NetBeans enabling
developers to interact with the cloud
for a variety of development tasks code
is stored inside a native external git
repo and this sprint is documented
through wikis markdown confluence pages
or through third-party systems like JIRA
or slack the entire continuous
integration and continuous delivery
framework is automated using tools like
Hudson maven ant Gradle and nodejs
inside the Sprint Lisa signs her first
task to a Java developer Bala Gupta Paul
will be creating a new micro service you
will need to develop a small modular
segment of code to access Twitter
information once accessed his code needs
to format the Twitter result into a new
JSON object that will be exposed as a
get method inside the deployed rest
service to ensure alpha office can
easily enhance this functionality over
time
Bhalla micro service will be developed
as a Java SE container on the
application container cloud service
PCCs beacon application container cloud
service is a polyglot to pull a
deployment platform that conforms to the
12 factor application methodology and
implements a continuous integration and
deployment process for Bhalla rest
service a ccs also enables Bala to
easily script out the build and
deployment process once and then at the
push of a button
syn code updates directly to the cloud
the application container cloud service
consumes the developers code places the
code in a pre-configured docker
container and deploys the application to
the cloud a load balancer is auto
configured in front of the container to
enable the container to scale from 1 to
as many containers as required over time
the Sprint's next set of tasks will be
assigned to a full stack developer role
in two boys Roland will modernize the
channels by which the company's product
catalog is exposed to alpha alpha sis
development community by developing a
single JSON object to expose the catalog
inside a rest service alpha office will
enable all future applications to focus
on data display as opposed to a
connection pooling or other data access
tasks Roland's new rest service will be
developed inside nodejs
he will leverage the my sequel drivers
to connect to the required tables and
expose the data as a get method
correspondent get methods will be
created as well to filter the product
catalog based on the product name or ID
when the rest services are complete
Roland will write the build and
deployment process steps inside the
developer cloud service and ensure the
code is deployed inside the application
container cloud service
Lisa's last set of tasks will be routed
to the user interface developer John
Dunbar John will write code in nodejs
that consumes and merges information
from both the Twitter feed rest service
and the product catalog rest service
into a single website providing the
first version of alpha offices next
generation by an experienced John's UI
will be deployed into a third container
running inside the application container
cloud service by isolating the
application to three separate containers
as opposed to one larger monolithic
application alpha office will be able to
more easily fix bugs test the code and
provide functional enhancements to
individual micro services or or the UI
without impacting the entire application
itself thus exposing the true power of a
cloud native micro service application
let's take a look at the labs that we'll
cover in today's session and lab 100 you
will learn how the developer cloud
service helps Lisa foster communication
promote innovation and coordinate the
delivery of a micro service sprint from
start to finish and lab 200 we will step
into Bala Gupta's Java development role
and here we will use Eclipse to write
code that Affinia Kate's and exposes
Twitter data as a rest service once the
code is complete a merge request will be
sent to Lisa and after her approval a
build and deployment process will
initiate and Bhalla code will be
deployed to the application container
cloud service in lab 300 we will step
into Roland's full stack developer and
role and accept tasks assigned by Lisa
inside of our sprint we will sign into
the developer cloud service and import
code from our git repository and access
the company's database and construct
rest services to expose and search
through the company's product catalog
and lab 400 you will assume the role of
John Dunbar and leverage the brackets
code editor to create the next
generation product catalog the product
catalog will combine both the Twitter
feed micro service and the product
catalog micro service into a single
unified view for the consumer your UI
will be deployed into the node.js
container running in the application
container cloud service thus completing
your first
native microservice application our
final lab of the day will be performed
by Lisa Jones and with our micro
services up and running Lisa will close
out the sprint and view the agile
reports provided by the Oracle developer
cloud service
