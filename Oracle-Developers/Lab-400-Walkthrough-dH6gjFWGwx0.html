this lab we will be showing you how you
can use curl commands to fetch
information and create services I will
start by just telling you you need to
have a notepad close by I put a mine
outside the image I'm just showing you
how you would put it inside the image if
you wish to do so and the first command
we're going to cut and paste from our
lab doc is a fetch a list of access
rules and it shows you comes back as a
JSON file we can format that but in its
basic form its raw now the next one is a
list of all instances again it comes
back as a JSON formatted file and you
can modify that this next one's a list
of all the image files if you're storing
an image those are all the image files
and now finally the de list the details
of DVCS instance alpha o1 BBC s now we
can actually format the results as well
if we parse that results set out using
I'm just using awk and set in bash and
you can isolate the result and you can
see now we've retrieved the IP address
of the DB CS instance so you can
programmatically intervene and parse the
output to create something different now
we're going to create an access rule and
the access role is 1523 you'll see that
there we've done that through the cloud
console now we're gonna do it
programmatically by único command and
after this execute we'll go back into
the cloud console and confirm that that
rule was in fact created so go back up
and open your browser login to your
cloud console
it's cloud.oracle.com log in with your
user ID and password
cloud user ID and password and when you
log in you go to the database services
open the DVCS console and select access
rules we're just not quite in yet
logging in as cloud admin that's the
user you've been using all along and
you're going to come to the dashboard go
to the dashboard and in there you'll see
on the left the database services and
the database services you know we have
two we have the workshop image and we
have the alpha 0 1 a and that's the one
we created from back up back and lab 100
that's the one were modifying through
the curl commands and as we did in the
past we'll select the menu on the right
it's the hamburger menu we select access
rules and you'll notice that we have in
fact created an opened access role
access to Ford 1523 there it is at the
bottom this concludes our set of labs in
the workshop BBC s4 DB DBAs hope you've
enjoyed it and call us if you want to
have a trial account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
