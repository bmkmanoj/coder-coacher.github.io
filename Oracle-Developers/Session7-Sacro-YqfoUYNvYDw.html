and distributed ledger technology in
combination with PDF documents and
presenting it will be me so short
information about me I always find it
weird to have like third-person
statements about URIs is and so on so
we'll just do this with an empty slide
and brief information I'm a software
developer I text head of innovation of
research I focused mostly on new
technologies I love machine learning and
I work for a company that works with PDF
documents shortly about I text so we're
a company that started in Belgium with
the company behind the PDF library I
text we were founded in 2008 we have
offices across the globe and we have
30-something employees so software
toolkit in Java or.net we allow you to
integrate PDF functionalities with
applications processes workflows etc and
we create pf' that is compliant with PDF
standards we're available both
commercial and a GPL and latest releases
I took seven now the reason I'm telling
you all of this is not to give you the
whole marketing rundown but I think it's
important that you have an idea of where
does our interest in blockchain come
from why are we interested in it and is
it more than just a hype that we are
jumping into or is there a well-founded
argument for our interest in it so I
tech seven is the latest rewrite of our
code we started with our text 5 before
that for some reason we are stuck with
prime numbers and now that we've
developed 7 we pretty much implement the
entire PDF standard so it was time to
start branching out into other areas so
we have the main product which is core
and aside from that we saw that there is
a need in certain of our customers to do
things that are only applicable to a
subset of our clientele so for instance
automatically redacted documents work
with invoices extract data
these don't make sense to put into our
core library but they do make sense as a
small atom and it's in that context that
we are interested in blockchain we do
not intend to become a blockchain
company we don't put all our hopes and
efforts and financial gain into
blockchain but it is something that we
are aware of and it is something that we
think might help part of our customer
base so as a company we've been
interested in new and disruptive
technology for quite a while now
for instance structure recognition is
something that I'm particularly
interested in getting from an
unstructured format like PDF which only
has information on how a viewer should
render a document and going back to
something like HTML which is insanely
difficult applying artificial
intelligence in order to do that optical
character recognition and the latest
brainchild blockchain so today we will
focus on only one of those aspect which
is blockchain before we start this is
sort of the basis for this presentation
and what we've built we currently have
four patents which have been granted to
us so the first one is about
registration and verification of a file
so typically you can think of an invoice
or a document of which you want to prove
the validity or prove that you are the
owner of that document so that's the
first one second one is collective
signing as we will see there are several
downsides when you are doing digital
signatures in a PDF document and the
second patent is about solving that the
third one is about long term validation
so recently we received the news along
with the rest of the developer community
that sha-1 is not safe and we knew this
beforehand we knew this a long time
going in but then the proof of concept
where somebody actually managed to
change a document and not have the
signature break I think was an
eye-opener for everyone so I text oh
nine is about maintaining validity of a
file even if the hashing
the more the encryption algorithm goes
at the date and number 10 is about
solving reference rot and a classic use
case for that is DUI a digital object
identifier but let's focus on the core
attributes that you see returning in all
of these so why are we interested in
technology like this or digital
signatures or be it blockchain there are
essentially three aspects of a document
that we are interested in so the first
is integrity meaning that if I attach my
name to a document by signing it I want
the document to constantly exhibit the
same content if I am sending an invoice
to somebody I don't want a third party
to be able to change that without having
my signature break the second is
authentication meaning that if I say I
created this document I want some way of
being able to prove it I want more than
just my name or my signature as an image
I want to be able to say this must have
been me there is no other way that this
document can be created this way and
lastly is non-repudiation which is
actually about granting rights to the
receiving end of my document so the
receiving end can say this person
created the document and regardless of
what they say I can prove that this
person created it now the typical use
case for that is that you do this with
hashing so I created this hash value of
this document and here is the
transaction which contains the hash
value and I've created it according to
this formula from this file and by doing
that we assure that its integrity is
valid that there is authentication
because I can sign the hash value with
public and private key cryptography
there is no repudiation because again
it's my private key that is associated
with it so only I should have access to
my private key and lastly it's
automatically time-stamped I assume that
everyone is familiar with some of these
basic concepts if you are not feel free
ask questions if you are this will be an
entertaining recap so hashing we turn an
arbitrary block of data into a fixed
sized bit string popular algorithm sha-1
char 2 and we use it for verification of
data integrity think of it as a
fingerprint of a document it's a very
small piece of information a very few
amount of bytes that actually
corresponds to your document and any
small change to your document has a huge
effect on the hash value now typically a
hash value is non-reversible so if I
give you a hash value you cannot
reconstruct the document back now how
does that help well as we see in the
diagram below if I give you a document
and it's hash value that means that you
will forever have the opportunity of
checking whether that document
corresponds to the hash value that I
gave you and similarly if somebody gives
you a document and you have the correct
hash value you can easily identify
whether that document is correct or not
assuming that the hash is secure now
during this presentation I will also use
the concept of private and public key
cryptography think of it as having two
keys one public one private and
everything that I do with one can be
undone with the other and as the name
implies the public key is known to
everyone or should be known to everyone
and the private key is private only to
me that means that if I encrypt a piece
of information with my private key
anyone else can decrypt it with my
public key now what's the use of that if
everyone can decrypt it well it means
that at least the person who encoded the
information knew my private key and as
I've just said your private key is
supposed to be yours alone
so by encrypting something with your
private key you are essentially
guaranteeing that this piece of
information was created by you and
similarly you can do the reverse and
that can be used to assign data now
what's the relation to PDF a PDF
document can be digitally signed this is
an iso standard that's been into effect
ever since the first version of PDF
the problems with PDF signatures I've
listed here so it requires a certificate
authority as we saw earlier if you
encrypt a piece of information you are
essentially saying that this public key
belongs to a certain person but there is
no guarantee that it actually is the
case and in order to solve this problem
the classic approach is to have a
certificate authority meaning that for
instance my public key is verified by
the public key of I text and I text key
is verified by Adobe and Adobe is the
root key holder so if you want to check
whether a document was signed by me
actually belongs to the physical person
me Adobe viewer will start downloading
all these certificates and it will say
okay this entire chain of encryption
checks out this person is actually this
it also requires a time server because
obviously for contracts that carry any
legal value it's important to know when
a document was signed and that means
that we can't simply use the time on
your computer since you can actually
change that another disadvantage of PDF
signatures is that they must be done in
sequence so like I said you are
essentially creating a hash value of the
document so as soon as you sign it you
change the content if multiple people
want to sign a document that means that
they have to all sign a slightly
different hash value and as a result
they can only sign sequentially whereas
we would prefer to be able to do this in
parallel we've noticed certainly among
our users that if a document needs to be
signed by five or more people there
exists a beautiful email chain of people
telling each other hey do you have the
latest version no I think it's still in
that office and it usually ends up with
five different versions of the document
all being signed by some people and not
one version that is signed by everyone
and lastly the signatures live in the
document that means that if you lose the
document you actually lose the
signatures and it also means that if a
document is signed by a few people
instead of
all of them there is no way to merge all
of these signatures back into one
document so what are the opportunities
if we use the mechanism described
earlier and we put the signature entry
which is just an amount of bytes that is
injected into the PDF document if we
were to put that in a blockchain then
again we can sign it and decrypt it and
use public and private key cryptography
with a known infrastructure so from that
point of view nothing changes secondly
due to the nature of blockchain this
data is automatically validated and
time-stamped we no longer need a
certificate authority and we no longer
need a time stamping service thirdly
depending on who your blockchain is
viewable by you can use a public or an
in company blockchain the signatures can
be viewed by everyone and you can
restrict access simply by having a
separate blockchain for separate
documents or like I described earlier by
encrypting the information and the most
beautiful part of it is that the
signature lives even if the document is
no longer there it also means that all
of the signatures can be merged back
into one document and that knowing
whether or not somebody signed a
document no longer requires you to have
the document it only requires a lookup
on a blockchain so let's turn that into
a very concrete example you initially
create a document using any PDF library
or tool that you want the ID every PDF
document has one it gets registered on
the blockchain now this ID already
exists in a PDF this is something that a
PDF is already supposed to have but the
PDF spec says that the ID should be
unique the PDF spec is rather vague
about that it says that it should be
unique but it does not describe the
mechanism for doing so
it also doesn't mention whether
uniqueness means uniqueness worldwide
uniqueness in the context of an
organization so that is another thing
that could be solved here you can look
up whether the ID already exists and
whether its associated with this binary
data
so assuming that we have done so the ID
get registered then Bob wants to sign
the document so Bob's public key and ID
and the hash value of both get added to
a record on a blockchain at some point
later in time Alice wants to know
whether bob has signed it now Alice can
do that easily she can either have the
physical document or just the ID of the
document by having one of both she can
simply check out all the records on the
blockchain that contain that ID and then
she will automatically get Bob signature
ID and she will know whether he has
signed or not now on a detail level that
means that we want to store certain meta
information of the document on a
blockchain so as I said before every
document has an ID we definitely want to
store that and similar to the standard
that is described for storing signatures
in a document we want to store the hash
value of the document and the algorithm
that was used to create it the signature
and the cryptography algorithm and a
certain amount of fields that can be
chosen by the end user
by allowing the end user this freedom to
define fields you can enable complicated
workflows you can imagine for instance a
workflow where an invoice is created and
it automatically gets the status created
and if a bank notices that the
transaction happens on that invoice it
can update the status put the record on
a blockchain and all the participants or
everyone who has access to that document
can immediately see okay this invoice
was paid or this invoice was at least
seen by Bob who needs to pay it I
haven't really addressed the issue of
certificate authority yet because at
this point we are still working with
public keys on a blockchain so this
concept whether Trust is certainly
applicable to the current situation
short definition a web of trust is a way
of establishing the authenticity of a
binding between a public key and its
owner or in human terms it's a way of
saying this person has
public-key how do we do that
Bob can look up the public key of Alice
assuming that public keys are available
to Bob on an organizational level or
international level or Alice can simply
give Bob her public key she can give him
an email and say look I'm Alice this is
what I claim my public key to be Bob can
then sign that key using the same
cryptography algorithms that we saw
before and sign Alice's public key with
his private key and put the record on a
blockchain now as mentioned before
everyone can see those records so
everyone can see that Bob used his
private key to sign Alice's public key
and we can interpret that as Bob trusts
Alice now on a more global scale or on a
company-wide scale that means that you
can build a graph and say for instance
the CEO trusts all of these managers all
of these managers trust their teams and
so on it means that you can build a
network where certain people are trusted
by certain other people and you can
automatically exclude certain people
from doing certain things what does the
current implementation look like for
digital signatures this is just a
screenshot of what adobe shows you if
you have a signature in your document it
says this document is signed and
signatures are valid and you can open a
window on that signature and it will
give you the information belonging to
that public key if there is a
certificate authority now that's a very
narrow view in my opinion we can do
better we can have extensions for
instance we can have an acknowledgment
or not acknowledgment field in
signatures we can say this interim
worker is currently trusted and
afterwards we can revoke those
permissions which is not something that
we can do at the moment we can give
degrees of trust to people so instead of
saying this person is really Alice we
can say 90 percent of your network
agrees that this person is Alice and 10
percent doesn't it allows a much more
fine grained control
of identity and authenticity which is
something that we can all benefit from a
concrete use case that we've already
worked on with the Port of Antwerp so
for those who don't know how harbors
work don't worry neither did I so
essentially you have a large ship with
containers and this is actually a fully
loaded ship this is frightening the
large amount of containers and they are
secured at least that was what we were
told and then we had a look on the
actual containers it turns out that
there is just a giant padlock that
accepts a numeric code but that is
considered to be secure now a problem
with that is that if you transport a
single container roughly 30 people are
involved it goes all the way from the
people who have to load all of the goods
into the container who obviously need to
know the code the harbour master who may
choose to do an inspection if he or she
wants to the captain of the ship
actually transporting the container and
so on and so on and so on so when we did
this case study we found that all of
these people in the entire chain were
exchanging the four-digit code of that
container in all kinds of ways going
from simply passing post-its to each
other to faxing emailing and telephoning
each other so there is no way that this
process is in any way secure or that
nobody actually has access to the
container if they shouldn't now the
problem of this code being publicly
available would not be such an issue if
it weren't for theft it turns out that
containers go missing or rather the
container doesn't go missing its content
goes missing the lock is still in place
sealed secured and this is where block
chains provide a perfect fit we can have
a single document of the Bill of Lading
of the container which already
exists and is already created and we can
pass this as a token between all parties
that way if anybody receives the
container if anybody needs to sign off
on something they are digitally signing
the document and stating that they are
from that time on until the next person
signs responsible for the container and
this does not physically stop anyone
from stealing it but it certainly makes
sure that people know who is responsible
and that turns out to be a very good
deterrent for crime in conclusion we
know a lot about PDF we are experts we
are part of the ISO committee we are
developers of PDF for more than 50 years
in total and we have a lot of material
on it if we look at the blockchain part
we are still novices we work with a lot
of startups we have patterns we have
useful contacts but what we typically do
is set up a mutually beneficial
cooperation if you teach us something
about your business and how you want to
work with documents and security maybe
we can work together and do something
with blockchain and we can both learn
something lastly and I think this is
important to emphasize we are still very
much at the apex of the hype curve I've
seen a lot of companies on all kinds of
conferences that do something with
blockchain simply because it's the new
sexy term to do something at some point
a lot of these companies will go under
or change their focus I think the key
idea here is that you need to have
technology backing up your claims and
you need to actually do something useful
with it it needs to be more than a
gimmick conversely though Davos also
concluded that watching can no longer be
ignored and that we should make it part
of our technology stack
are there any questions feel free to go
ahead
sure
because our witness
what
sorry the length of the PDF in the
current setup does not influence the
time it takes for the transaction to
pass or at least it does not influence
the time in a way that digital
signatures as they are implemented
classically are influenced by the time
the only thing that depends on how big
the PDF is is creating this hash value
and whether you're doing that with
digital signatures as they are today or
whether you're doing that with
blockchain that time will not change so
you are not incurring any performance
lag because of using blockchain however
if you are generally or genuinely
concerned by the amount of time it takes
then there are several things that you
could do you can choose for a
high-performance blockchain client we
have tested scenarios and we have
noticed differences going from cheap
implementations that are open-source to
more costly it implementations and you
can definitely get up to a few thousand
transactions per minute which for most
companies is enough of course if your
use case requires more we will need to
work on a solution together like I said
this is a learning curve for both of us
we are still very much in the process of
talking to people who want to implement
this and who want to go on this road
with us together so if you have
something to teach us that would be
valuable input yes
at the moment the only requirement that
we put on any blockchain vendor is that
they allow us to store any blob of
binary data and map it to a certain key
that is a conscious decision because we
know that there are various open-source
implementations of the blockchain
protocol that do not have smart
contracts so we prefer to go for an
approach that supports as many platforms
as possible rather than lock ourselves
in by demanding that they supported this
particular language or this particular
feature for instance smart contracts in
a certain blockchain language the
current implementation
like I said requires you to implement an
interface that Maps a binary key to a
binary data and we have example
implementations for etherium and multi
chain yes but like I said you are only
required to implement one or two API
methods so it should be trivial to
implement this for any vendor of your
choice excuse me
any other questions
okay that's it then thank you for your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
