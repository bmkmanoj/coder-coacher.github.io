for coming to our session and we're here
today to talk to you about scaling your
API development what give you some
practical tips about what you can do to
actually scale your process so my name
is in manual Paris khakis it's my
twitter handle there we also have my
colleague Adam Clements hello and I want
to kick it off by asking who here is
actually developing api's probably
arrests api's okay Wow a lot of people
who here is developing more than one
REST API at the same time okay a lot of
people this is gonna be probably useful
for you guys so you have an API and
probably if you've been following along
the last few years you kind of did this
design first process where you start out
and you speck out your API before
implementing it and you also might be
reading about best practices and
incorporating them in your API designs
and you are probably using something
like API blueprint or swagger an API
description language and you probably
also have some API management in place
like gateways and monitoring and so on
and you're finding success api's are
really really useful people want to
integrate with them they want to create
mobile apps they want to create
integrations so life is good right
and as you find success you're being
asked to create more api's so you know
maybe 10 API is in the beginning maybe a
hundred api's maybe then it's different
versions of the same API
maybe it's slightly different for that
special partnership that's going on and
maybe you're doing micro services and
all of a sudden you have many api's on
your hands so you have more people in
your team and you create more of those
API designs and more consumers come in
and integrate with your apps you finding
more success and you create more
versions of those api's and then you
have to deploy all these versions to
different
environments around the world what's
going to happen it doesn't scale right
you start to lose control a friend of
mine yesterday were saying api's
multiplied like like rabbits you're
gonna have a lot of those they're gonna
start to get inconsistent
you're probably gonna deploy the wrong
thing to the wrong environment break
some plants out there so what can you do
about this
well we're proposing that you use tools
and processes to help you along the way
and we think and we've observed that
you're probably going to have a workflow
that looks something like this you're
doing API design you're prototyping
you're talking to your API consumers
then you develop a pair you deliver it
people consume it you look at the
consumption patterns or get feedback and
then you kind of feed that back into
your design process and you go over and
over again in this cycle so here's the
five things that we're going to talk
about today and we're gonna talk a
little bit about each and then show you
a demo of how you can use tools to do
that and for the demo we're gonna use
Oracle's API platform local API platform
is probably the most complete solution
out there for the API lifecycle it came
together from first of all Oracle's API
management platform that they've been
developing the last couple of years and
the acquisition of apiary apiary is a
design and collaboration around design
platform we'll show you that today and I
just want to stress out that Oracle is
these days really serious about
developer tools and open source we
recently joined the cloud native
computing foundation were full members
of the open API initiative specification
the formerly known was known as swagger
and we've also have our API blueprint
formats in in open source and today
Oracle API platform has about 300,000
developers so we have a free tier that
you can go and register today on a
peridot diode and this we have the
thousand API developers have created
four hundred thousand API projects is
actually about a thousand more today
because new ones are being created and
the those one hundred thousand API
project have been viewed by more than
three million
API consumers so that's up it's probably
the biggest API platform out there by a
factor of ten so you're in good company
if you are if you're using this okay so
let's kick it off and talk about the
five things first thing is we think it's
a good idea to keep your API consistent
we think it makes for a good developer
experience it makes for an API that's
easy to use that's easy to learn so
you'll get in situations where you have
a couple of api's in your naming the
same thing differently in each API maybe
it's a typo and you know if it's if it's
a typo in a in a key name for example
you can put it in there and somebody
will integrate it now you can't take it
out because somebody's integrated you're
gonna break them so prevent that type of
ahead of time or you might even get into
a situation like I did where you had
three different date formats in one
singular spot so that's crazy how do you
get there there were reasons how we got
there
but the problem was how do you prevent
that from happening in the first place
how do you get to a point where you're
not able to design or deploy such a
thing that would have such big
inconsistencies so we're proposing that
you use our tools to encode your style
guide usually people have a long
document that's a style guide or rest
conventions document that they use and I
had one of those you write that you say
hey you know follow this and nobody can
read that thing because it's like 30
pages long and even if they read it it's
very difficult to implement and check
manual you can eyeball these things I've
tried it it's just impossible
so we're saying you should be able to
encode your style guide into runes
that you can apply a design time and
these rules will help you have a good
consistent design so we're going to demo
that momentarily okay so this is a
period on the left-hand side you can see
the API description document and it's
swagger slash open API open open
specification open API specification and
it has the following anatomy you can see
URLs HTTP methods and responses and
requests and parameters this is about
API governance and how to keep the
consistency so you may notice here that
you are discussing in this document URLs
and maybe you have one design rule
across the entire team organization or
the group of people you're collaborating
with or multiple api's or you're
adopting some other existing style guide
that every API should have plural
resources plural or so snail resource
names in the URLs so if you do a mistake
apiary can show you
I think our internet connection is a
little bit slow I'm gonna reload this
like the Moose that was exactly all the
things I think well you guys are on the
Wi-Fi checking out there there and
that's what's happening oh it looks like
the internet doesn't work at all so give
me a second right you know Ben and Emma
without the internet so maybe we should
use them are you gonna use your hotspot
so give me a second please okay give a
second so what I'm trying to demo here
is the fact that when you create a
resource that's in singular you're gonna
get a warning right there in your editor
it's gonna say hey your resource is not
improvable and to recognize this across
many very different almost any any word
out there and it will give you that
warning and it will tell you so now
what's happening is that you can go
ahead and save your design you're not
prevented from saving your design so
this is not top time we're gonna top
down we're gonna prevent you from doing
anything but you can save the design and
continue using it because there may be a
good reason for example you may have a
camel casing vs. snake casing rule and
then you're implementing off and off
needs snake case name so there may be a
very good reason why you're doing this
so you should be able to say you are
back online already so then you when you
remove the plural form the interface
it's very similar similar to an IDE and
linting and the interface tells you that
you are not following that particular
style guide on line 42 where do these
rules come from here in the
yours are the damn open there here is
the dashboard for style guide validation
and every single API has to conform that
particular style guide it's like
plugging in a linfer into your IDE so
the API every API within your team
organization is gonna have the same
expectable design and that's very
important for developer experience and
for is the adoption of your API s so we
can either from the API architect or a
person who can oversee all the api's you
can see the status of all API seven in
your organization this is interesting
when you already have some API and you
can you want to iteratively make them
better and better made them more and
more consistent you can even create some
expectations here so if your case before
right where you had to somehow have an
exception to that rule that you used all
the time and there you can have an
exception absolutely
also they're more the generals who can
set so it's not just plural for most of
resources but it's a snake case came up
case keys it can be conventions for for
the status code combination of status
code body content etc etc so everything
which can appear in an API can be
controlled and you can you can make sure
that it's consistent across all the API
and all the people involved in the
process are actually following those
suggestions which show up as warnings
okay so turning over pick the manual all
right so basically you can achieve
consistency at design time and then
we'll see what you do with that with
that design so the next thing we think
you should be doing is to treat your API
like a
we believe an API is a product like any
product out there you would not dream of
launching it unless you have user
feedback unless you show it to people
and say yes they say yes this meets our
needs or you know it doesn't meet that
needs it needs some some modification so
we believe that you should be doing the
same thing with your API and and we
think the best way to do that is to
create a prototype and we have found a
way to create a prototype out of that
API description that Adam was showing so
while you're describing how an API
should behave
and you're saying this resource and that
method and here's an example of the
response we think that is able to render
a mock service on every save on every
change that you do to the API design
that mock service follows and that mock
service should emit payloads accept
requests and so on just like a regular
implementation so we're going to show
you that moment Ali I'm also gonna show
you how you can invite other people to
come in and collaborate and even edit
the API description with you so that it
gets the result they need all right so
back to our API I'm gonna hide this so
the entire a period product is a valid
documentation oriented so you're
basically creating an abstract
documentation of your future API and
people very often use EPA and this live
preview of the documentation as a
thinking tool in the first place so
people can create an abstract API in a
PRA and the API it's actually the
documentation itself there's no API
without documentation because it's not
going to be ever used and every single
action in the documentation actually
comes with a mock which is a URL which
returns the data you described and
discussed and thought through in the API
description so let's pick let's try this
one so you can either try it right away
in the you can try it right in the
documentation so this is the API console
this is the mock address address
generated for this particular the API in
a PRA when you call the resource it
returns the data from the API
description so every you can give an
example of requests and response to
every for every resource you have in the
the documentation so just to show you
I'm not making this up when I copy this
to my command line it's gonna return
this body which is compiled from the
JSON schema from the swagger document
okay
and now whenever you would make a change
so this the change would be reflected in
the name service right away make a
change so for example
I'm gonna be wrong and I'm not gonna
follow the API style guide for this
document I can use this unpolarized
there's not not pluralized resource name
so it gave me yeah so you can hit that
same URL and Caroline exists also where
more people are involved in the API
design you can invite them and then they
can collaborate with you so they even
the future consumers of this abstract
API can provide you with field icon on
the API design so you know I think a
manual to view thank you okay so turn it
over back to you sure so I had a great
example of this where we were when the
apiary got acquired by Oracle recently
about six months ago and when we came in
we needed to very quickly create a demo
and one of the Oracle front-end
developers was working with us and then
said hey I need to consume some objects
or I mocked up an API we quickly and
then said well okay I'll invite you to
the API design and then maybe you can
tailor it to what you need maybe you can
give me something but take a look and
let me know what you think so I invite
him and what happens is that he was able
to go in before I even I thought I
thought he would just take a look around
but he was able to go in modify the the
payloads to exactly what he needed and
they go back to his app consume those
payloads when I get back to him he said
well I I'm already done I have what I
need so he was able to go in and
self-help and create the payloads that
Hamidah so that was pretty powerful to
me all right so at this stage I want to
pause for any questions here
sir so please take the mixer microphone
what do you mean yes
so you know what I'm gonna repeat the
question question is how versioning
would work so there's there's a couple
of aspects to versioning your api's and
you know the the thing we usually mean
by versioning is where we say I'm gonna
create a whole new API that's gonna
break clients out there and I'm probably
gonna give you a way to indicate that
you're wanting a new version of the API
so other people put something in the URL
other people put something in the header
and it's a completely new version of the
API I think in this case we're talking
about a completely new API the other
thing we can imply when we were talking
about versioning is basically change
management how do you keep saying during
changes and make sure that changed the
changes that you want are the ones that
are being deployed and it just so
happens to incident at Adam and I are
going to talk about this so I believe
versioning is change management whether
it's a breaking change or a non-breaking
change it is about changing any even the
smallest change you should be able to
have control over it so I like to say
don't let change manage you but manage
change yourself what we've done with
success is we've employed the github
flow so most developers are familiar
with github most developers use git and
most developers are familiar with the
github flow of you know creating a
branch creating a pull request merging
it and so on so we've built full
integration for a github both cloud and
on-premise a platform and we're saying
that we showed you that you can invite
people to participate in your API
prototyping they can make changes there
in that editor they shouldn't be able to
override everybody else's changes right
I mean this is insane this doesn't scale
if you have a hundred people that you
invite how you're gonna track all those
changes so of course the way to do this
is with the same mechanism that we use
to version our code so we're gonna show
you how this works
in every the integration how you can
create a branch and kind of complete new
version of that API design together with
a mock URL together with a documentation
URL look at those changes individually
and then when it's time you can merge
them back into you master branch or
whichever other branch so let's go see
that okay question so
so how does deployment work the question
is how does deployment work in all of
this that's a it's a great question so
first of all we believe you should
synchronize your API description into a
into a github repo you should use the
github flow like we talked about here
but you should also have the code that
implements that particular API design in
the same repo in the same branch so you
are having the codes and the design for
that codes in lockstep they should match
now we're going to show you how you
actually make them match how you
actually ensure that what he deploying
matches you're gonna use your normal
deployment process you're not going to
change
tooling here you're gonna deploy the way
you do today but after we show you the
change management will also show you
testing how you can ensure that whatever
is in the API design actually gets
implemented or when you refactor that
you don't break that implementation so
it's a way to bring in API design and
testing into your deployment workflow
the question is how long does the mock
stay like the mock is always there so
400,000 API projects 400,000 mocks run
actually running but they are there in
available to you there is absolutely ok
and it's not even per API but per every
branch you create and I'd like to talk
about and show you how to manage the
change so sir over mentioned gentleman
over there I mentioned how do you
version so let's try to create a change
and proposed new version of this API so
as you may notice this little branch
icon
every API in apa you can connect to a
github repository so the code in this
on the left is synchronized to a github
repository and vice-versa so every
change you make here it's committed to
to a github repository and every change
you make your regular development
workflow and gate and push into github
is is you can you can see here like it
applies here so it's basically like
continuous deployment of your API
documentation so everything with every
specular document like swagger document
in the a pure yet up repository is
rendered here so I'm going to create a
branch here reload this so there are no
changes it's the master branch
dismissing the change I'm dismissing the
changes because we are very working in
master on the master branch so nobody
does that right so here you can view the
github repository which I have already
linked to the to the API project and you
can add a branch so a new branch is
gonna be future version create a new
branch so you creating the branch
meanwhile I can show you the repository
I have linked with the with the API
project Napier and this is the swagger
document I'm editing in the a paper
editor and the branch has been created
so I can switch to the branch here in
APA so it means that I'm having a barrel
version a parallel universe an API in
Perl universe and I can make a change so
for example how many of you guys are
familiar with swagger or open API
perfect so I have this base path here
and I'm basically going to create it -
yeah so this is where you're changing
version set so and you can continue with
this like early feedback on this new
version the same way like on the
previous on the master and every single
mock has this version included so now
it's a different mock URL
different documentation URL entirely
different places because on the master
branch maybe somebody's already
integrated into it maybe testing it out
or maybe even in production you don't
want to go make those changes so I'm
gonna go and push push the version to
get up so you can this is super helpful
because you can actually move in
parallel no you don't need to coordinate
people working on one thing and you can
like basically move in parallel in
parallel universes and this thing can
scale even like hundreds of people
involved in the API design there's the
regular tourist proper request flow so
every change you make you can review in
github and see better you want to
involve this change in your API you can
review those changes before even
considering merging them and maybe some
of the changes you don't okay to turn it
over back to manual
all right great give me the slides thank
you
alright so fourth point is that do you
have a question do we the I think the
question is do we generate code for you
we don't we generate code examples that
you may include in your clients
libraries we don't currently have
tooling ourselves to generate code but
the swagger ecosystem is very very rich
in this code generation for servers and
clients pretty much for any language
that you would want so that's there we
believe that this should be agnostic to
the implementation language and actually
what we're going to talk about here
which is testing we're going to be
testing about the behavior of the API
regardless of the language so you notice
that the description that we have there
the swagger decision that we have there
he's talking about the HTTP protocol the
resources the methods the status codes
it's not talking about how this is
implemented so we need that totally open
and in reality you might change the
implementation you might have you know
something in I don't know Java and go
replace it with nodejs
and the behavior should stay the same
right that consumers of this API don't
care the clients of the capn don't care
and this shouldn't be broken so what
we're going to talk about here is
exactly this how do you make sure that
that design that you have there is
implemented correctly and as you
refactor you're called how that remains
implemented correctly and that's very
difficult to do because you might make a
tiny little change that's going to break
some client code but you probably won't
be able to fly ball that change and
remember because you're building in
consistency and style guides in the
design you also get consistent api's out
of this so we're going to go right ahead
and show you the testing tools in the
command line
so if only there was a tool which can
test and verify the API design against
the implementation what you're saying so
we have that too so the tool is called
dread like I had questions and I'm
hearings I'm going to give out some
cookies and red is an open-source tool
which consumes API description documents
regular and API blueprint compiles HTTP
transaction and neurons them again
against your API either in production
and it's up to you better use you use
this piece of open-source software on
production locally for developing the
API or in continuous integration and I'm
going to show you how it works so here I
have already cloned the repository and I
have my swagger document locally I also
have Brett here Brett is the
command-line tool it's an NPM package so
you just do
install bread and you're ready to go and
here I want to test the swagger document
against the production production API in
this case for the sake of simplicity
we're thus where do I find the you are
all the production API and the API
documentation so I search the production
and copy the base path of the is
actually coming from the host the host
key there so and I run thread and it's
gonna send for every single action in
the in that API description document
it's gonna send requests and set
essential assertions on response yeah I
think it's I'm doing it on my phone here
so make some time so the thing is this
should pass and it's going to pass if
when the when the internet connection
kicks in yeah it's it's timing up but
you can retrieve the exit status in this
case it's one but it timed out and so
it's it's failing
exit code of one so something it's not
passing so okay you have a question
we don't have Jenkins plug in or
actually there is one around
it's a an open source thing somewhere on
github but we don't like it's not our
product so
this passing test for the master against
the production I have created this
change in a branch right so I can get
cool
I pulled the future version of my API I
can get it check out and run it again
against the same endpoint and I didn't
commit to change oh I did so I have five
failing five failing API API calls here
so again I'm in the future version
branch and when I run and read against
the production API its failing because
we don't we didn't implement anything so
this to make sure that the API
specification never gets out of sync
with the API implementation and what you
have deployed now this is really simple
in the small API that we are showing you
but we have instances of people using
thousands of lines or very very
descriptions huge API and it's very very
easy for things to get Alison especially
when you have many people making changes
maybe it's different teams different
locations and maybe it's a slightly new
version of the API and it really really
makes a difference and there's also a
way how to make this tool part of your
continuous integration and continuous
and pipeline so if you have your
continuous deployment set up you are
100% sure you're not that deploying the
wrong thing to the wrong place so
turning over back to our annual almost
there so the last thing we want to talk
about is use your api descriptions as
the source of truth for everything we
showed you a little bit of how you use
it as a source of truth for your tests
automatically generated interface test
we showed you how to use it for
automatically keeping documentation in
saying we
be extended to the right time so if you
are using API management you should be
able to configure your API management
through the API design if you're
generating SDKs you should be able to do
that and in fact we have a partner API
Matic that does just that integrating
with with a peers API design and
generating SDKs or API fortress for
monitoring their integrated taking the
API understanding how the API is formed
and then generating what they need so
use the API design always as your source
of truth and that keeps everybody insane
so we're going to show you one last
thing which is the API developer portal
in the Oracle a platform and how it's
driven by the swagger file that I showed
you here so so the most beneficial thing
in this approach is that you have only
one source of truth you're not
generating something from something and
then clicking point-and-click in some
interface and you're creating the
developer portal you need a bi platform
I'll fire you so I'm gonna use this one
single API description document which I
have created in the design process we
have implemented deployed etc etc and
I'm gonna publish it to my AP consumers
because they platform is the runtime
part of this entire Oracle ecosystem and
I can go to the IPE platform so we're
loading into the management portal of
Oracle API platform this is the runtime
environment where you would expect to
configure gateway policies monitoring
analytics and so on and there's sessions
I'll talk about which session you can go
to to learn about this in hands-on labs
on this isn't one of them or
okay I have created this API here and
here you can set up runtime policies
like authentication reduction at the
trial set fra it's very sophisticated
but we have an earlier session this
hands-on lab session today in the
afternoon I think and I would like to
invite you to these sessions if you want
to know more about the runtime part of
the API platform and what I'm going to
do here now and show you how to publish
the API documentation so we are using
this one single document and the
documentation and mock and etc etc I
generate out of that particular document
and we are going to reuse it here in the
documentation so also remember to enter
a URL for your portals this is what
you're going to expose to the world and
I'm going to this Oracle API platform is
integrated with API and it's becoming
integrated closer in closer so I can
just point and clink and reuse the API
which is actually later the API project
from apiary and the documentation for
this API is now continuously deployed
from from github and every change which
gets merged into master is automatically
included in this developer portal so I'm
going to save the change
publish to portal and now I'm gonna so
this is the yura that will give out to
the world to come to our developer
portal and register look at
documentation and so on and again it's
behind credentials so this could be like
your internal developer portal or you
can make it public it's a question over
there
so the question is how can I control
access to these api's and the short
answer is that Oracle API platform
allows you to control access
first of all enforce security
credentials who can access the API so
you can't access API also has rate
limiting throttling policies and so on
it's a little bit out of scope for this
session so I don't want to go there but
please come find me afterwards and
appoint you to the right place it's very
very capable of doing that and this is
it so you can you're a the consumer of
the API you can give the your partner
for example access to the developer
portal they can see documentation of the
API they can try it out even without
sending live data against the mock and
then K they can subscribe to this
particular API and retrieve the
application key for that particular live
API and you can with API platform as the
API owner you can manage it all in one
place so control access like to the
developer portal and even even across
enforce for example some security policy
across Europe it was because all your
API and that's it question is
absolutely if you have already if you
have already have an existing API
existing design and you placed in API if
you copy paste that API design in apa it
you can get this feedback in this API
architect dashboard in the team
dashboard the good practices would have
to be encoded in some rules as we saw
there and out-of-the-box a theory comes
with about 15 of these rules things that
say hey use communication use plural
resource use this combination of status
code with this particular method so we
have some of those best practices we
think every organization is different
and can custom customize these these
assertions annuals and in fact in Oracle
itself we also have a style guides
document and we are also encoding these
rules for using around it guys another
question
maybe we haven't done it so far and to
tell you the truth out of the 300,000
people that are there on that on the
apiary platform it's it's not the number
one thing that we're hearing out there
and and we see that a lot out there in
in tooling that's available we think
it's great for demos tickets definitely
it's a it's a good way to get started
but once you start doing this day in day
out as as your job the UI configuration
gets a little bit in the way so it's
great to start with and we probably need
to do something like this but most
people want to edit that document don't
forget also that the the document serves
in place of the actual API documentation
so you want it to be a document not just
a configuration for what method and what
resource should should be there but yeah
thank you that's that's good feedback
that's an excellent observation this so
do you wanna I don't think there's out
there there's no tool to figure this out
like you can if you can use some already
existing dependency management system
like NPM or herbal gems and you can use
that dependency management for
versioning api designs and then
basically assemble the deployment to
some environment but there's no tool for
this yet I think in the microservice
world this becomes extremely important
as we move forward so I would totally
agree with you I don't have a efficient
to give you a toasty shirt so sorry
about that but I'm being told that
there's free t-shirts out there at the
end of the corridor so go grab that
whenever we're done so to summarize what
we saw here I'll start from the ends use
your API design a single source of truth
automate testing so you make sure that
what you deploy complies with your API
design manage the change treat it like a
product prototype bring in the user
feedback and find a way to keep your HP
ice consistent we think the best way to
do that is with tooling on a period so a
few resources here and I'll make the
slides available I have a link to a peer
and into dreads I have a link to a great
article that tells you about what can
happen if you don't do testing basically
it's about a company that went bankrupt
in 45 minutes because they deployed the
wrong thing you oh you're so the ethical
this is this is an awesome article about
basically DevOps and and in testing if
you can go back to the slide for a
moment I just want to talk about the
next sessions that we have is a
developer keynotes
today I think at 4 o'clock tomorrow
morning at 11 we have maybe in the same
room we have a panel of apiary customers
that have used all of this stuff that we
talked about and I think it's going to
be very view
for you for a hands-on lab tomorrow
afternoon well you can come and try out
all of this including the API management
that you asked about and we also have
three sessions by our partners Capgemini
the consulting firm who have used Oracle
API platform and they're talking about
the lessons learned and the best
practices during their implementation of
their clients so that's all we have any
any questions
so when you say validation so so the API
validation that you see there on the
screen is validating the syntax of the
API description language so if you make
a mistake and you know well this should
have a response and you forget the
response it's gonna warn you it's going
to say that you're missing something
here much like a code editor
okay so I think I know where where
you're going so first of all yes you can
test for the presence of a response you
can test for does the response conform
to this shape or when you have a
collection you can create a rule that
says hey it must be an array of
something so you can test for those
things I think also what you're going is
which is very interesting about testing
schemas of data structures so you could
do this to a lower degree with with
dread we also have I mentioned API
blueprint which is a markdown based
language kind of the opposite of the
gamble that swagger is and there we have
built in a language called Amazon to
create and manage data structures that
you can use and reuse and there you can
go validate those data structures so
something and I just want to mention
that the style guide engine is
JavaScript so if we don't support
something I can write custom assertions
on the structure of the API this
document so if you're looking for some
particular field in the body or a better
body actually s jason parsable against
or parsable against the given media type
it's possible so so we're passing the
API description and we almost it's
almost like a dome that we expose
specific to the API and you can
manipulate and examine those objects in
the your the question
so the question is what kind of security
protocols can I use for this so we think
that on the API design level you
probably shouldn't be even though you
can with booth swagger you probably
shouldn't be hard coding what security
you're going to use because remember
this is something that can be deployed
in many environments and again we're
going into micro services where you can
say well I'm going to deploy this
and and maybe it's going to be used with
one authentication protocol maybe in
another instance it's going to be a
different we think this is a random
thing and we think that you can enforce
this in API management and Oracle API
platform does have those policies to
deal with oath to basic laws I think
both one is not there but nobody's
hardly using that so so you can apply
those policies at the random
configuration and then get them forth on
the gateway again in the money in the
API platform management portal you're
correct
okay so thank you very much thank you
