here at developer Week 2018 a couple of
questions that were asked to me on what
was the best decision that I have ever
made as far as technology it was going
back to school for programming and
coming here to developer week I learned
so much it's such a small amount of time
there's so many different connections
learn about the new programming the wave
of the future the way things are being
connected learned about virtual reality
augmented reality it's an amazing place
an amazing event um if you're thinking
about getting into the computer industry
I highly recommend it
there are jobs all over the globe there
are people from all types of different
backgrounds will then help you and this
is a challenging industry too so if you
like to think and learn to be a creator
developer week is one of the places you
want to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
