project leader for Eclipse motto project
and working in the connected home
department of Deutsche Telekom my name
is Yan I'm also working for the telecom
as part of the key be called approach
and responsible as product owner
responsible product owner for the SDK
and one time team so it's the team which
is cast about the main development of
the holes of the stack we see in parts
of here later okay and what we want to
talk about is smart home today of course
and just as smart homes are not really
that much in mainstream so far I'd like
to start more or less with a problem
description for you so so how would you
start or if you want to get into smart
home usage usually you might buy some
nice gadget like a smart block here that
is Wi-Fi enabled you just took it up
your network current or you get a nice
smartphone app with that where it can
remotely switch it and you say oh well
nice good start so you go ahead and buy
some more of such toys and you have some
more smartness in your home or have some
more apps and you say pretty cool I
continue and I buy more and more and you
end up with really many smart devices
smart gadgets with many different apps
on your smartphone and I guess there you
already start seeing the problem you
really have many things that are smart
for themselves but really isolated in
the silo so although they have network
network access they can communicate they
more or less just do what they are best
in and you can't really achieve
overarching use cases so having the
different things talking to each other
and sharing the data and making really
intelligence or use of that in the end
not a problem of that is the
every single device more or less or has
its own cloud service for it connects to
so that the smartphone app can remotely
access the things it pushes all the data
are on to its cloud service and so on
and to me that looks somehow like a
rainy day or it makes me really sad I
see multiple problems there usually you
might have to use different credentials
for all your services here on one hand
every single service may come with its
own winner abilities and our security
risks that it addresses and you are also
completely dependent on all these
services being available so you might
have their situation that your internet
connection is down then none of that is
available you might just have for a
company nice cool startup from today not
existing next year or any more and sure
your device that you bought is just
useless from one day to the next so
wouldn't it be much nicer to have all
your things
communicating locally you have them at
home and would be much better if they
could directly talk at home as well I
actually like to use the term Internet
of Things here so all your things are in
the local internet internet so why not
use them there and as long as there is
no standard way for communicating
peer-to-peer and I think we are many
many years if not decades away from a
common accepted standard on that you
need some central or instance here that
will it does the translation between the
devices and other things and this
usually are called a home gateway so
your ever a central system which allows
are accessing the devices and this
system then this home gateway can be
used as well for remote access so one
single access
motely to all your things it can host
your automation logic and other things
now eclipse mat home the project is a
framework to to build exactly such home
gateways and yeah it's a part of a
software stack that you can deploy on
that talking about software stack on a
home gateway of course we have some kind
of operating system in most cases that's
just some Linux version Eclipse smart
home as we're here to Java conference is
based completely on Java so we need a
JVM or SE version so it's not ME but se
minimum Java 7 the framework itself is
very modular and to this modularity that
you can pick different things or it's
done through OSGi so on top of the JVM
you need some OSGi container um it
should be release photo 2 compatible so
there are open source implementations
there are also commercial
implementations available on that and
Eclipse matte home itself is then really
just a set of different bundles or SPI
wonders that you can assemble yourself
of what you think might be useful for
your solution to build on top now what
kind of services does the framework
offer world defines a small as rather
basic domain model for your things in
the house defines events for these
different things that you want to
operate on and based on these events you
have been four main categories one is
connectivity which is really the
translation more or less to specific
protocols to API store access devices
and so on another important aspect is
everything around the automation aspect
because
so it's not just promote controlling
devices but it's really to have things
working automatically and really having
the smart part in that very central part
as well on the user interfaces so as
we've seen before it many many different
applications all over their own or way
off for user interaction and so on but
you would actually want to have that
more or less consolidated in a in one
way of using your system and your
devices and last but not least it's
providing all kinds of free persistence
mechanisms for these events which are
volatile and first place so to say you
can store them locally you can sent them
to some cloud service for further data
processing and other things ok as I said
the events play a very central part so
the events are really an asynchronous
mechanism here which are then captured
by in in so called
registries which are then used by user
interfaces all engines and so on to do
all of these services on abstract level
the physical access to your device
assistant who so called bindings and
these bindings are more less really in a
translation layer than to the specific
devices protocols or other services now
we brought some some nice gadgets here
to show you some things in practice and
actually we never try to select devices
here which are not chests you can see in
many other sessions some other we know
ports and Raspberry Pi so stuck together
but it's really things that you as a
normal end user would buy in the shop
and which should illustrate you here how
easily you get a very
ye-yeah diverse setup of different
technologies and so on and that you
really need some solution that doesn't
focus on a single protocol or a system
but really something that allows you to
connect the things together so as a
central piece here is in that case just
a picture of the Raspberry Pi but it
just is a symbol for the home gateway
which one's equipped smart home as part
of its stack then this home gateway is
connected to your router at home and to
your router you have your smart phone
then of course in the network we then
brought here Wi-Fi enabled speaker it's
a solo speaker so it's really just
hooked up to your Wi-Fi and you can play
your music there and it's it's working
on its own first of all but it also
makes a lot of sense to have that
integrated and home automation scenarios
then we have this nice bulb here it's a
live X or bulb or also Wi-Fi enabled so
you can just replace your existing
pallet with that it's led in all kinds
of colors and yeah this thing is Wi-Fi
what is interesting about this pallet is
that it actually has a dual radio stick
built in so if you have more than one of
these bulbs then they communicate
through a 6lowpan which is a low power
protocol more or less and so these pipes
make sure that only one needs more or
less the power for Wi-Fi to communicate
while the rest is really
energy-efficient and can be at rest for
the one routing part that's pretty cool
technology and you don't need anything
else but or having them on your Wi-Fi
then a bit more widespread is the
Philips you system here
brought the philips iris which is more
or less a device to do some ambient
light so you can do some nice color
shading of your of your movements on
these things are communicated school
safety protocols or something yet again
different and it comes with an IP
gateway so although we have that that
thing here it's a small gateway with an
rest api built on top communicates to
the bible ZigBee and on the other end
HTTP on your network and yeah also
something quite quite nice to use then
having all these polyps and replacing or
your existing ones at home you usually
still want to be able to control the
things with the wall switch because you
don't always want to use your smartphone
just to switch the lights and your
existing wall switches now have a
problem because if you use them you
completely power off the the bulb so you
don't have a chance to automatically
turn them on again because they simply
don't have any power so what you want to
do is to replace your your wall switches
and there's another cool technology and
that's called an ocean radio protocol
and that's that's one of these here
an ocean is a very low power or ultra
cause so that this thing doesn't really
need any power supplies or no cable
they're not even batteries but just
pressing the button you can hear
clicking this energy is simply enough to
send out the telegrams okay so pretty
cool for for replacing and with
fulfilling your existing things but
again it's a different frequency
different protocols or again another
youniverse more or less for home
automation devices and yeah
can be nicely combined last but not
least what we have here is stuck on the
speaker here a small NFC tag that may be
a bit more
advanced use case but once you get used
to that or it's something very
convenient that you can just stick NFC
number put your smartphone next to it
and trigger some kind of actions or
procedures okay so that's the setup that
we brought and I now want to make that
all running here and I'm using the open
source project open half version two
which is actually one open source free
solution based on Eclipse smart home and
I have that that thing running here and
I hope that's that's okay from the font
size i need to ernow define my devices
that i have here so so i've showed you
the life expo and justifying now okay i
have one which I call l1 with this
device ID which I have to read there
next what else do we have we have the
sono speaker which has earned a specific
number as well which I can define here
that I want to use that okay I have the
Philips you pritch plus device so I can
say well I have to bridge with this IP
address please access that and I have
the iris lamp here with the ID number
one internally they are numbered okay
and to show you that it's not
necessarily all our physical devices I
can also hear for example define another
thing which is more or less or better
station but not using a physical bond
but using yahoo weather service as a web
service to retrieve the weather so here
we just defined that for San Francisco
which has a specific number on the
whether service and defined that we want
to have us units okay that small s are
setting up and making the system of air
of the devices that we have here now
next thing to do is to connect Li when
you will do that here we define now
so-called items and the items are more
less than the functions in the end on
abstract level that you want to to use
and to operate on your rules that you
want to display in the user interfaces
and so on so I'm just saying well I have
a color light the lifx here I have
another color light the iris and I can
define me
or a group lights where I'm putting the
other two into so the small s what I
have there and now to to trick a bit sir
this one I don't want to type I know can
say that the weight this one was the
iris this one I now find to a certain
thing that I defined so the physical
thing that we had here we defined as
this ID and we say the color channel
should be linked to that same for the
life expel
okay and here just put a default icon
okay so that's for defining that next
thing to actually see something is to
define a user interface which is also
quite straightforward it's called a
sitemap here my home comes with a frame
and in here we cannot just say well we
want to display a group of sorry for the
item lights that we have here let's try
that out directly in a browser okay it
didn't reload yet as it seems okay there
we go so that's not just one browser or
UI there can be different your eyes that
simply make use of this decorative user
interface and in here we see our devices
and now let's try we can switch the
light the lifx
controls the color here with the color
picker let's try the iris yeah
that's on as well there's a chap green
okay you can do the same stuff here
actually what is now nice to show you
that things can be easily combined we
can also put here instead of a group we
define color picker widgets directly on
this group now once this is reloaded
give it a second okay now we have a
color picker right here and so we can
actually use both at the same time and
choose the color and the two very
different technologies interact right
right next to each other and even the
colors are fairly similar not too bad
okay let's put something more in our UI
I showed you that I defined the vetters
or let me just copy this over here so
that's no two number items for
temperature and humidity of our defined
location and let's put that up in the UI
as well we add another frame in here and
so you can really use now Apep so it's
just the same way as a local device and
if you refresh here okay there we go and
now it's it's polling the weather once a
minute and after a while it should come
up with all right yeah there we go
66 degrees Fahrenheit 70% humidity so
that can be now easily integrated here
and use then an automation codes and so
on just like any other piece of
information okay for yeah let us try to
add this device now here which has again
a very specific IDE which we just have
to add here as an ocean information it
has channel a and B let me just save
that here okay so it has two switches I
know it should be hopefully able yep
with the one switch
I switched the one light with the other
the other
yeah so again with one piece of specific
hardware with a completely different
protocol than the others I can nicely
combine the things here now if you want
to see it's something really cool how to
how to access these I just add this
device here small gesture sensor leap
motion and now I should also be able to
switch the life export like that ah
and not only switch it I can also choose
the color just wrote I can I can I can
dim it down
let's Telekom magenta you've seen that
okay so but that's not really something
that you would buy and use at home not
yet but I could imagine that in a few
years from now it might be actually
quite convenient to have some gesture
controls in your wall because there are
not really good controls nowadays for
colors and so on so doing something like
that or right next to your wall and
might be pretty cool pretty cool feature
it needs to jump the cat to to get on
that level
you you possibly could
there is no implementation as far as I
know for kynect so far but yeah more or
less
you can combine any kind of input device
and yeah make that work there okay but
so far I've only showed you how to
control things we didn't see any any
automatic stuff and for this the
speakers actually pretty nice or
actually as a kind of notification
facility then as well so let me quickly
are some new item here which we don't
connect to any physical thing switch
presents come on I add that to my side
map as a switch for item presence so
this thing should just show whether we
are at home or not so we have a nice
switch here we can switch it okay so
nothing nothing attached to that what we
can start with there is to use now the
NFC tag which is up here and I've
actually programmed this tag to
correspond to exactly this item so if I
hold the phone here next to it a second
I'm on the right network should be yeah
duck okay you see it switching so I can
now then whenever I leave my home I can
just go with my phone next to the door
and say well I'm now away because so
many people think it there are some
clever algorithms to actually
automatically determine whether you're
at home or not but that won't work
because of your cat okay so now we can
switch the presence here and now let's
start defining some rules and as I'm
lazy and typing let me copy that in here
as well so it's a bit smaller I'll read
that to you it's as a check if
everything is fine when you're leaving
the house or says when presence has
changed to off then it checks whether
any of these bulbs is on and if then it
tells me through the speaker otherwise
it just wishes me a nice day let's see
if that works so we're at home and you
have left the light on I am turning it
off for you okay now this was really
quick because what happened in the
background was that the text was
actually sent to Google Translate server
converted into an mp3 mp3 hosted locally
served full servlet to the solo speaker
who picked it up and played it okay so
pretty pretty complex set up in the
background but yeah it's really very
nice really for having notifications and
not just playing music with that for the
choose cases especially when leaving the
house you left some window open or
whatever and you can be borned and be
informed so I didn't activate the rule
for coming back of course so coming back
so that I come back and that's let's try
coming back home the phone needs to be
on of course welcome back
ok and now this time all lights should
be off if we leave again you have left
the light on I am turning it off for you
that was the demo effect especially for
you now the lights should be off have a
nice day
ok hmm wonderful
ok as a last feature that's really
something cool I love to play with it's
using voice commands here so I'm just
putting in a very very simple rule that
really shows how how easy it is to do
some automatic control then using voice
commands and there is a in the
atmosphere that uses just the voice
recognition of the smartphone sense the
recognized text to the server and this
now can react to you in the rule and do
something so for example as the lights
off I say please turn the lights on ah
at least one turned on the other one I
think it's yeah ok
I'd like them blue mm-hmm ok so I'm
really just recognizing than single
keywords here like blue and say well ok
let's send a command to these things
known what's the current time it is few
minutes too thick ah ok also very not
are very easy than just time recognition
and having some rule to assemble the
right text for that and
if I say something that doesn't
understand okay I say just something
sorry
I understood okay I say something but
this is probably not what you meant so
that was just my else case here in the
if statement if there was no other hit
it just repeats what it understood okay
that much about this part of the demo
that you've seen that it's it's quite
quite troublesome to set up and define
your devices or manually and that's
definitely nothing that is suitable for
the for the mass market for the standard
consumer he doesn't want to deal with
all textural configuration files and so
on
so what we're actually currently working
on for eclipse matome is to more or less
shift the focus from textural
configurations and yeah manual setup to
using our user interfaces having our
api's for that using auto discovery of
devices and are having reusable rules
then our that can be easily just
configured and used by by people for
that we introduce new API s for these
bindings as a first step that Mallis
define a formal description of devices
so that if you discover them or you know
how you can display them and use
interface to have for other you know
discovery services then and or mods or
flows for setting up devices if that is
necessary because sometimes you have to
have a parent process where you have to
press something as on in order to
authenticate each other it's just a very
small example how on such a formal
description of a device looks like as an
example for the Philips you birth
and for discovery services well there
are many things in place like European
Pierre many devices like the sono
speaker like the Philips approach they
can be discovered for you PMP
automatically the life expert has its
own udp-based specific mechanism for
discovery and so we defined api's here
where you can simply or easily implement
such specific discovery mechanisms and I
just want to show you that I can now
actually delete everything that I
defined in here so all our manual thing
definitions are gone now they don't
exist anymore and in the side map are
not just defining one coupe for the item
things as it's called and all this now
shows that from you know what it tries
to find here on the network it will
directly now display with all its
functionality ok and there we see
exactly the Philips ukridge with one
bulb that was right automatically from
there and we can directly take control
yeah okay so this is now without any
kind of setup without any configuration
file automatically discover setup form
put on the user interface same the
unknown device here that thing doesn't
have name of the life ex has also one
color channel we can switch it here so
also automatically retrieved although
it's a very specific protocol and stuff
but just appearing like the rest and the
Sonos speaker was also discovered so it
can really have for the things without
any textual configuration now available
in here and
that I would love to hand over to my
dear colleague yes thanks what you saw
now is that we did some preparation
steps that all these kind of
configuration which can be some techie
user can be now simplified but we also
want to include now the the end customer
so I would like to give a short overview
about what we're doing at our telecom is
a commercial product offering which is
called a Kiwi con just some words about
the whole idea and how this fit together
with eclipse mat home and why we doing
supporting the Eclipse mat home project
here so if I come back to the to the
picture of Kai about this picture of
Internet of Things so we just said that
one essential part is to have a common
gate we're here a home gateway so named
that's one essential part of that for
running this kind of locally intelligent
intelligence and that's exactly what we
did at Keeley Khan so we developed one
specific home gateway which you see here
on the left side which is called the key
week on home base as a marketing name
it's essentially it's a home gateway
like I described we have some hyper
functionality included in there so we
use an arm CPU six hundred megahertz who
has about some other characteristics we
have 512 megabyte ram at least two
gigabyte flash we included some security
modules we have even for the German
market that's one specific here a radio
module pre-integrated on the hardware
layer because we're supporting one let's
say where we common standard in Germany
and we have as one additional idea
supporting this kind of extensibility
like these kind of radio protocols like
the in ocean like sea wave and and seek
beyond our stuff around the way that we
can extend this by external USB slots
it's also something where we have some
kind of hardware extensibility also to
the software stack in addition to that
we are running on a software side Linux
operating system we using Java is
embedded seven we running goes to our
release for the two in this case one
your commercial product so from from
process the embedded server process the
NBS and the basic idea behind the the
key beacon system is that we allow
partners to write applications logic
running on this home gateway we call
them local applications or can be
extension service extensions so this
will run on top of the Java was GI
virtual machine and we will care about
the whole ecosystem behind so even about
security sandboxing these kind of
applications
let's see basically we have the give
econ router here just to give a short
overview about what we have in place
it's based on our market offering we
started last year so maybe one year ago
on a German market so we have devices
here from eight six eight megahertz
range which is called home attic I think
it's only an excerpt we have about 15 or
20 different devices we're supporting
sig be stack it's just see here we have
a CB USB stick included we have some CP
devices here we just started with camera
support have white goods appliances
supported familiar or was a German big
supplier here so let's just what we have
in place here to given the imagination
what we're working on and how all these
cool stuff we see in here could be a
good extension to that what we already
have here if you look about the the
backend sides okay just that this kind
of home gateway should be integrated
with some cloud technology so that's
actually what we're doing here so we
have one key beacon cloud which is where
all these home gateways will connect to
this cloud the cloud will handle all
these let's say ugly stuff which has to
be done about remote management so we
can completely remote control this home
gateway we
and do the whole provisioning process
installing uninstalling and you logic on
this home back to home gateway we
provide api's to get access from the
cloud to the home gateway again done by
secured by security mechanism so we
start with following the true security
approach here we have additional shops
and app store for maintaining the
software component these local
applications we provide back an API so
our stuff around that for the own user
interfaces we provide so we have
applications for controlling devices for
doing the how we'll set up all these
kind of pairing of any new devices you
also provide some local logic running on
this home gateway so these are
applications provided by us for
ourselves but the whole idea of Kiba
Kahn is based that we allow our partners
to be able to deploy their own solutions
so we allow partners to provide their
own infrastructure which can link to our
own cloud they can write their own
applications for example web
applications running somewhere in their
infrastructure and use all these
mechanisms we provide to them and they
can and have to do have to implement or
some local logic it depends on how much
logic they want to have running locally
so it depends on the application on the
use cases it can be from a very
minimalistic application just having
some configurations up to let's say a
complete full-blown application where
they do some home automation stuff rules
and so on we also provide for these
partners the way to integrate smart
smartphone devices like we just saw here
from from from Kai and these can also be
connected to the cloud infrastructure
but that's something which is important
for us can also connect locally to the
home gateway so it's especially for the
case you just be at home want to control
some devices it doesn't matter if your
internet connection is way you can even
control it completely home about the
local connections and we make sure that
the EP is we provide in the cloud
also be provided locally so that's from
the software architecture writing such a
smartphone application or difference in
addition to that we enable the partners
to what these kind of applications by
providing an SDK with additional tooling
api's for these kind of smartphone
applications and we provide until now we
call it the closed partner developer
community so we allow these partners
since two years now to develop such kind
of partner applications locally and they
done that
and it's really available now on the
market for one year just a short
overview about the partners we have been
in Germany and Europe from device
manufacturers to utility providers from
distributors to complete the solution
provider sort whole bunch of interested
companies here in addition to that we
also have smaller community of
development partners though these are
companies who are partly involved in
developing the the whole platform or are
doing some development for other
solution providers which has to bring
ready products to the market ok so
that's just a short overview of what
we're doing here on the commercial side
now how does it relate to the Eclipse
mat home again if I take the picture
from Kai we have more or less of
surprise a same basic idea of the whole
software stack here so just talked about
these concrete technologies so be using
more or less the same like Eclipse mat
home it's requiring to run and we have
actually on top of the hgi container
let's say our so named key liquidity is
to provide access to the existing
devices to more additional services we
provide and so on and what we're going
to do is that we want to open these
commercial product to be able to include
this kind of chip smart home
functionality we just saw here in in
some details so that's the basic idea
and in the ideal case
it's possible to include these open
source based bindings for devices like
we saw here or in our commercial product
I want to give you a short overview how
this can fit with a live demo as you can
just see here it's now I'm connecting to
this GB con home gateway here we provide
here for development purposes a special
kind of frame we have additional tooling
on top of that so you're able to debug
you're able to have some tooling where
you can retrieve your devices controller
devices manually and so on what you see
now is the custom of wand ends so that's
something where we control the devices
we have a possibility to add new devices
here and that's what I want to show here
so actually on the current situation
installation here you see that we have
four types of devices or four vendors
with supporting here these are sick P
devices we have dealing cameras we have
this kind of German components here and
a lot of devices will be supported here
but we're not so actually Philips you
and what I want to do now is to install
the open-source Philips you binding you
just saw here from from customer
directly into the cubicle home base
normally an end customer would do that
by using some kind of portal where say I
want to buy I want to install these kind
of binding I will do it here manually
yep
we have some tutoring about that so I
just use here on the only adult folder
the open source binding as it is so no
modifications of that and we'd installed
that onto these home gateway here as you
see takes a little bit of a time and
then if I go back here to my user
interface do a refresh takes a little
bit now here it is what you see is based
on the dynamic nature of which GI which
has two thought now additional bundles
the bundles provide a new binding the
binding provides additional metadata as
part of these kind of s as you said
think type descriptions of new think
types so we see are there's a new way
how to add devices you to the TV current
system so I can just here select which
kind of device I want to add now and now
if I go to the bridge we have some
process that we can now all this kind of
stuff which guys did in the first step
manually on the second step will be done
automatically by the open-source
implementation can now be done in our
commercial product by and custom
interfaces so we have now using a versus
implement on base of this kind of
metadata so we can use this kind of
binding directly one by one in in a
commercial product then so I can do here
the the bridge it's exactly this one we
see here and now he's doing some
additional discovery from the bridge
then to the pubs takes a little bit and
then we see the harvest pipe here and I
can use the vibe here so that's the idea
we we did in the last months to be able
to use these open source stuff also in
our commercial product offering
so as part of this this approach
actually come and the key we convey we
joined the Eclipse Foundation because I
think it's really one very important
stuff in our work map for our commercial
product therefore we provide additional
support foley for the open source
project so kai is a project leader of
these eclipse project we have two
committees working on that not handle %
full-time but I would say at least 30 50
percent of the time just doing open
source development and most guys of my
development team are also doing our sub
contributions on the Eclipse pod home
staff so it's something we just
enforcing and it really makes fun for
all of us and what what is the result
the last six months we were working on
that just as you said these kind of
things which can be configured or can be
already discovered has been designed by
us we made the initial contributions
about that with the whole discovery upp
support in the last two or three months
we developed as a as a template for
other developers joining this approach
the Philips you buy me which is more
complex binding so which shows some
aspects about discovery and you pimpy
and all this stuff around all also with
the bridging though some protocols have
a bridge concept others do not have that
we develop the whomever binding and we
provide additional documentation for
that then something within the last
month so I think it was a good starting
point but we've also would be happy if
others would join this this effort and
we'll also provide additional
contributions on that the the benefits
we see not for us is that there's a
really huge list of available bindings
for all of stuff which is can only be
thought of which is available the
internet so this is some samples from
the current bindings available new per
source so most of them are part of the
open up project this is the predecessor
of the clip smart home
some of them will be migrated over to
eclipse Matt home some will not you
choose licensing stuff but we hope that
at least and a relevant portion of these
bindings can also be adapted to eclipse
Matt home and then it would be very easy
to use them also for other commercial
products but no leave ours was of the
other companies if they interested in
that that's something we think it makes
sense to share this kind of code and
implementations to support these where
we had to genus landscape of smart home
devices so this means for trips Matt
home and I was a econ that we
think in future in the next yes that we
will influence each other so we will do
some contributions on eclipse matt home
because we have commercial requirements
we think this is a good starting point
always to extend the existing open
source on the same hand we also can
benefit from these open source
development stuff and feedback and and
additional ideas coming in to that so I
think we think at the end d our product
will also be extended but this kind of
functionality we also plan which is more
or less naturally that this kind of EP
is will be opened by a cubic on itself
so our curly closed developer community
will be at some point or an open
developer community so we're trying to
address more and more developers also
doing not only stuff for Eclipse Matt
home but maybe also having some fun
doing that for kvitko and maybe finding
in future some commercial aspects where
they can provide applications also with
some benefits regarding selling maybe
these kind of applications bindings
extends to whatever then also maybe to
commercial environment that's it from
our side thanks from all time not time
for questions
I keep smart home as a project as well
you just solution on top so as an end
customer you are not looking for some
kind of software stack you were looking
for something that you can take in your
hands so you need some physical device
summer to buy off the shelf and so it
Clips not home as a such a software
stack can be used by commercial
offerings like he becomes kind of
solution and as I said what I showcased
here for the live demo was the open app
open source project which you can also
download and which makes use of for
eclipse mat home framework just like
Kiva Khan used it for commercial
solution you as our here takes every
person you can download or open up
yourself install it on Raspberry Pi on
some other device and run that for
yourself at home
yes exactly
yeah well actually I ran the stake here
here or right from the computer but you
could run it on a raspberry yes so if
you're doing in this way that's actually
defined but then you have to care for
yourself about something like access
from remote to your Gateway so you've
declared in DNS and firewall stuff and
so on there's something which can be
offered here on a commercial base
because it's everything predefined a
pre-configured which is working out of
the box but for for your purposes
absolutely fine to use the open source
stack and run it at your own home a lot
of people are doing their own westbury I
think it's most popular platform using
open hop and and eclipse maram stack
the device will be in Germany be served
between let's say a hundred fifty euro
up to 200 euros normally there will be
some bundles with devices and software
packages but our street price it's about
150 euro you pay per app yes
normally the the packages will include
the license for the app for at least
three years for free and then after two
you have to pay a money like let's say
20 30 euro per year something else so
normally the our solution providers like
you to do parties in Germany or even
touch telecom is selling a solution in
for little children and customers in
Germany making bundles which includes
some cover devices like Thomas thought
control and plug plugs and other stuff
around so it depends on the solutions
they will be bringing to the market
um yes I know
so um there are actually two ways you
could integrate and use Bluetooth le the
one is here you carry around your
smartphone and you have beacon Center so
your smartphone application actually has
to has to use that information and make
something out of it the other way around
us you could actually distribute many
gateways around your house which are the
receivers and you just carry a Bluetooth
tech with you and then you might do kind
of triangulation to do our indoor
location and so on so that is also plan
to support actually both ways in Eclipse
smart home to have really concepts there
which don't exist yet for persons or air
pets possibly as well and locations and
to make use of that or inside automation
rules and other things
I think the open source part is a very
big aspect about it because usually the
solutions that you see on the market if
they're closed they are often from
vendors that want to directly sell you
their own heart rare their own specific
protocol and more or less door-lock
enough for their customers so that they
sell most of their own devices and I
think the approach here with the clip
smart home and that what we are trying
to do with Kiva : is just really to
establish a platform itself where it's
really open for everybody to connect to
whatever they want and without saying
that well us one company more or less
decide what's in there and what is
available to the customers or not and I
think although these kind of costs costs
scenarios like destroyed here
integrating such an audio device with
all the stuff around you will not get
from one single provider because he
would have to do with such kind of
integration this may be five or ten of
them or maybe my five or ten of these
kind of LED pipes so if one provider
would do that for the whole market in
one specific solution it's a lot of
effort and we know it from our
commercial stuff it's really a lot of
effort to include all these kind of
devices so at the end there has been
some common solution where we have tried
to minimize the effort for this kind of
device in the equation and we think
open-source is a good way to do that
it's reliable it's it's open you can
motivate people to do that maybe some
commercial benefit too
these devices are available for purchase
in Germany Germany only not in u.s. we
just prepare in preparation for
international rollouts but actually not
for us to be honest but you can also put
the open source stuff which is also
quite good ok so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
