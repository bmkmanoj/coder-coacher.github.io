session here at Oracle code Beijing I'm
your host Javed muhammad real excited to
have as my guest today Lewis we're who
is the chief architect at Cap Gemini so
Louis welcome and also has always good
to see such a smiling face okay so Louis
you have a title of API and
micro-services a match made in heaven
that's right what's the what's that
about sounds like a marriage it is a
marriage idea okay well everyone talks
about micro-services because it's
obviously it's a hot topic but
microservices exposes an API uh-huh
so what does that mean right how do you
manage this API
imagine you're in an enterprise and you
have you know you can have many
micro-services how do you how do you
manage all those API so people can
discover developers can discover those
API and eventually start using them
right so it's kind of showing how the
two relate to each other looking at
design time and runtime aspects of
governance in the context of API so
microservices all right so why do you
think that and I'm thinking of marriage
and microservice an API I'm thinking
about Chris Richardson's keynote today
and he said I mean one of the things he
covered a lot but one of the things that
there are no such thing as micro
services and I do believe in marriage
and microservices but what did you make
of that well I agree I think we use
micro services to refer to a specific
type of service that's in nature fully
decoupled right and it has certain
character characteristics like a tree
set for example each service owns its
own storage for example that's one of
the patterns well then you want services
to be independent right in terms of
scaling in the fault tolerance tolerance
as well so I agree I think it's just a
shortcut to refer to a specific way of
designing and implementing services what
we call in a project that we have a
we're creating called Omega dot IO we
call it fully decomposed services so I
think it's a a within micro services is
just a shortcut for micro services
architectures
and and so what is the relationship
between API micro-services can use to
expound on that a little bit more so
it's like you know so as you work on a
particular architecture that that
exposes one API is I mean I mean not
elaborate on that absolutely
so microservice it's an inside out view
of how you implement a business
capability in code right so you have
concepts like the abounded context
within Eric Evans domain driven design
it allows you to choose you know divide
your your business logic into components
right and each component being a micro
service right or a service implemented
with a micro service style delivering
that capability however how do you
access that capability hmm typically you
do that via an API so so but then if you
have many micro services or services I
exposing api's right there must be a way
to to to kind of manage it at you to
manage them and then connect them more
easily accessible is that where API
first comes in API purchase an
outside-in view on how to implement a
micro service ok the API first starts
five for example focusing on what your
consumer needs right for example someone
building a mobile app that developer
might need a specific API to create an
order or fetch from information from a
customer or actually aggregate
information from different micro
services and that's the focus you take
for sometimes the micro service don't
exist if the micro service is not
created yet meaning that that business
capability doesn't exist what do you do
so taking an outside-in following an API
first approach can also help you derived
micro services right and then implement
them properly as well ok so I think
we're talking a little bit off camera it
seems like you're for you based in the
UK that's right okay
and it's you've written a few books and
use your writing a few more books and so
what is it you're kind go-ahead to have
the JK darling not so nothing like that
okay do you want to tell us a little see
the theme of what are the books that you
have and what's coming down the pipe
yeah I come from the SOA
acronym so my first book was on SOA
governance that was about four years ago
then I wrote a book on API management
using Oracle technologies that was about
a two years and a half I think three
years maybe ago
you can lose you just want to talk about
your book that's coming out yeah so
there - one is a title implementing
Oracle API platform cloud service it's a
long term colleagues feel Xander and
Andy it's about how to implement the
latest Oracle product the other one is
the enterprise API is some non
technology specific book it's more about
an approach from an architectural and
also slightly business angle on the
business value of api's and how to do it
properly in a large organization so uh
hopefully both will be out late this
year or early next year okay so great
you're going to give Jake it sounds like
you will give JK Rowling's it would read
video on it but I'm just curious like
you work you have a family yes when do
you find time to write books ask my wife
it's a few loose wheels right please
contact me well on trains planes early
in the morning I hear that a lot I wake
up early so I'll try to write up before
the kids wake up right because at that
point that's it okay so any any time you
can find hotels I do do a fair bit of
traveling for you know customers so I do
I do write at night in the hotels so
anytime you can find release okay that's
all the way all right it looks like you
run 7 by 24 Louis I really appreciate
you coming down I guess we'll be meeting
in Sydney yeah and so yeah keep keep
writing keep flying and stay tuned to
dev life some more great sessions here
Oracle code Beijing
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and thanks
for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
