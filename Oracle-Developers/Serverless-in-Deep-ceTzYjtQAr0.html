coming I will talk to you about
serverless today I don't know if someone
of you have some knowledge about
serverless
or are exploding serverless Oh anyone
okay
don't worry so my name is Mercedes I am
coming from Guatemala well I am
community leader of a Jay Duchess
chapter and a Google community there and
was member of a Java users group -
actually I am CTO in a startup called
productivity and next to that I am an
abyssal ambassador technology and Oracle
developer champion - and I have a Duke
Choice Award educational average and
this is the schedule that we will take
today we will talk about serverless then
we will talk about pollution as a
service services surveillance
architecture the benefits and drawbacks
little bit of design patterns our use
cases and we will make a little bit demo
and finally I will talk to you a little
bit about the AFM project that is the
server solution of Oracle so we will
start about where is cerberus and
surveillance has two definitions
throughout time so in the beginning they
started like you know the these
applications rich client applications
that consume cloud phone as a services
as buckets but in that quality we didn't
know serverless like that if not is when
we implement a function as a services so
what is this of back-end services in the
past so server glass is not the backend
as a services was these applications
that start to use in order a platform as
a bucket so one example of that is the
DEP database that is called pores and in
the 20s order a similar that is the
firebase database there are databases
that work in real time so when we use
them I avoid the part to have a back-end
for synchronize my information I just
send the information to the database and
that magically appear in my application
and other thing is when I use platform
as a service and one of the
most common right we have now is make
authentication services for my manage
Identity Management so we have Oracle
Identity we have out 0 we have Amazon
kognito that was the first definition of
serverless
but now we are knowing serverless like
functional services and this is when I
am ruining my applications for being a
being triggered and ephemeral
ephemerally some a way to natural
elasticity and basically our back-end in
this case our service are managed for a
third party person I am NOT managing
that and that examples of that is Amazon
lambda Google cloud function for base
function a search function and the f-m
project so what are the key
characteristics that have a server less
applications one of the first thing is
that we will not make the management of
our servers so I don't need to configure
dedicated instance or install all and
environment in then you know a third
party person we will make that flows
that in this case is a cloud the next
thing are flexible Scala will have
flexible scalability and high
availability what means that so now that
we have the cloud we can have services
that work with elasticity that means
that I we can manage a lot of
concurrency you are familiar with the
term of concurrency someone said yes
others say no what I will explain that
our service have the capacity to manage
a lot of concurrency that means that I
can process 10 requests or 1 million
requests one example of that is Twitter
for example do you see The Hunger Games
yes everybody do you know this Ln the
generate yeah it's a lady that have good
hair what she take a picture with the
guys of the Hunger Games a few years ago
and she tweeted on Twitter and you know
this tweet have ten millions of retweets
just in ten seconds
just stacked with ten millions of
retweets imagine how how much is that so
how many retweets make tweet Twitter for
second this is a high level of
concurrency in Twitter and they need to
have the capacity of that so what do you
do create a monster server will a lot of
a ram you know capacity of processing
but this is a high cost so cravaack high
coast other thing is that for example
you know which is the time when the
people must most watch twitter know the
marketing guys say that is in the launch
you know have sense if you work and
don't I cannot watch it your cell phone
when you will watch in your cell phone
when you go to lunch so this is the
moment but everybody watches the cell
phone so if you want sometimes launch
marketing campaign is in the launch okay
okay whoa so that means that Twitter
need to have a lot of capacity in the
launch but maybe know in other hours
this is a lie because you know every
hour is a launching other part of the
world but I'd imagine that only work in
the United States that means that you
only need to have capacity to process
that by lunch so this is when we put
this of elasticity and put a balancer
inside of our service and we configured
is collapsing we create a second image
for don't paid for have a high server
all the time so this is the focus of
Cerberus that I can is scaling that only
when I need it and have high
availability but that means that I
always we have my servers available for
the people can consume it so that means
it in one moment I have 1000 of requests
my server will create 1000 functions for
attendees requests and then we have this
part of whenever we paid for the
integrated development environment so
that means that I always will pay when
my function is turning on imagine that I
only need to run one a phone
once a day I only will pay for this 15
minutes a day that my function will be
run this is our other characteristics
absorber less and he says this is a
resume of that so we will have a full
abstracted of everything we can have a
scaling and it's urban driving and we
will only will pay for the things that
we are using so where is not service
well platform as a services so when I am
talking that I will consume something
that I didn't made this is not service
container this is other thing that
people confuse a lot now the containers
is like a built relations with extra
plus and what is not Cerberus the other
thing is that that doesn't mean that we
don't have ops DevOps so the fact that I
am not managing my servers don't means
that I don't need to may deploy or
manage a version in may testing or all
those things so don't means that and
that things that is most confused is a
storage procedures as a services and
this is because the most case use for
Cerberus is for processing information
especially when I detect a changes in a
database so existing sometimes that when
I detect that I have certain changes in
my database I need to run a process so I
can configure server less for me that
this is the most typical use case of
Cerberus so the people confuse that this
case is Cerberus but it's not so here is
an example of the complexity that we
will change for example in the first
image we have an infrastructure as a
services that is our typical
implementation if I use a monolith or
micro services so I have my servers I
need to config my servers and then I
have my app inside my app I functions I
have tasks and I don't know if you are
taking pictures for a post or something
but I will share the presentation so you
don't need to make that just for
Evernote that ok then we have the plan
from as a service this is when I am
using a platform as a service inside my
application but finally we have the
server list that is only functions so I
don't know what happened with the rest
things with my servers anything I just
grab that and here is other a diagram so
this is like a a manolito micro-services
that I will have my host inside my host
I will have my application and my
application have a lot of operations but
in serverless I only will have the
operations and I will take care only of
development seeing a single operation by
time so now we will explore a little
more at the function as a service so we
as developer we will focus to make the
functions note the rest of the pearl
the rest is that the business of the
DevOps guys so we will only develop that
so basically it's a small unit of code I
will have just one single task and I
will development this one and other
interesting thing is I only with
deployed this one why we tell you a
story for example in Guatemala when
company start to wasn't a start-up and a
program in programming programming a lot
that they the team grow up a lot and
they end with a project that has 5
gigabytes of size and they need to
deploy that imagine that create the
world to those 5 gigabytes only for send
that to the QA team once we make a
meet-up in the Java and all the guys
games because was two blocks of his
scope by the office and like I said you
know we came because we are deploying
you know I have three times waiting and
didn't in that so they need to I don't
know how to say that in English but
create micro services for don't need to
make the a deploy to 5 gigabytes wait
you know 5 hours and this is one of the
things that have the functions I only
need to deploy one function and
everything is ok then is the even
driving processing part of serverless
architecture this is
something that is important to
understand the function is not the
serverless the function is part of the
server list that is server list is an
architecture then the principle of pass
is that we will reduce all the
complexity and abstraction that have a
developer when we are developing and we
will only pay for the consumption we
will have we will not take care about
the server's the server part and even
driving and instantaneously scalable
this is only the same thing that if I
need 1,000 functions they will create
1000 functions
so how sail the cloud that through that
developers and ideas will run the code
if don't take care of any server and
that works like a button as a services
we will not administrate anything is
scalable
we will have high availability and is
automatically trigger and we can direct
this one from the web or from a mobile
app something important about the
functional services is that is States
that means that we not save any state so
if you need to make a server that save
an estate you need to look for any
strategy usually the one strategy is
that I am saving the state in a database
or in a file on in a storage but in the
the function cannot save any state so I
create a function the function process
the information there and say or return
to me the information that I want and
then is destroy it and never exists then
other aspect information to to take in
mind when we develop at server server
less is that the function as usually
have a expiration time so for example in
a though AWS lambdas I cannot run a
function for more than 50 minutes so if
I see that my process we will have a
duration of two more fifteen minutes I
need to see
what I will do with that so I can you
know create just as more pieces of this
same function or don't implement
serverless
so we will talk about the Cerberus
architecture and this is a diagram so
you should we have our user that will
have a the browser or our client that
can be a mobile application and we use
an app gateway for can manage all the
endpoints and then this applet way will
be connect to all the functions that I
have and I can't have to a different
database or connect to the same one is
not like in micro-services to the best
practices that every maker services have
their own database here is just a
suggestion and this part is the function
as a services when I have all my code
and this is a little bit more complex a
architecture so one a things that is
stay come on right now with micro
services and Cerberus is that I delegate
my authentication process to a third
party so a platform as a service like
like I mentioned before that or I call
identity out zero Amazon commit so octa
is other one is many ones so I have my
client and my client will be made the
authentication and authorization process
with the authentication server I can
have functions or for example is this a
server functions and I can have
databases that don't require that I'd
make a authentication process so I will
expose that a databases directly to my
client I will show you other an example
of that then I have my Apple gateway and
my appeared will connect to all these
functions one interesting part in the
authorization process is that now that
or ization process we will made by the
IP gateway so when I connect my client
will connect to the authorization server
when made the login and will obtain a
talking typically a JSON web token then
I will send in annual request this token
the a PDA will be connect again to the
authentication server and we will ask
if this user have permission to consume
one of these functions if the
authentication servers say no is the a
bigot with that one that will be
answered to the client that he has no
access to consume this function so we
never came to the function part and
don't execute that process if not I
enter to my function so I can just
process something or in my function can
go to a storage or a database multiple
ones this is a typically architecture in
serverless the next day a picture that I
have is highway we will be grading we
have a monolith and as usually the
monolith have less complex in terms of
DevOps but Ken came in something that we
call that espagueti code right and we
have all my functions here in
micro-services are separate that for a
tasks for example an impasse I only will
have a lot of functions but sometimes
the complexity to implement that can be
a little bit but so about the benefits
and drawbacks in terms of benefits we
have here the list we reduce the time
for development sometimes in that we
need to make a mock-up or just a demo of
something is faster that I develop here
some services so I don't need to create
any development environment create a
server config the server and deploy my
code I just make some lines of code and
I have something working
reduce the operational cost and in that
the infrastructure cost because I only
will pay for the things that I use
instead to stay paying to help turn on a
server then the backing as a service a
is reduce it and have a more easy
operational management but they
drawbacks for some guys is the problem
to a third party will be administrate
our servers this is something that
everybody have a scary about it you know
I will lost that control I don't know if
someone remember maybe not I see me
young faces but when Java was launched
it and in what he knows what the
was a garbage collector yes you know now
he's like what is a garbage collector
what is that of manage my memory it's
like yeah so why laughing yeah they came
to that or were loved saying when I need
to create my objects and they stir in my
objects when we well I didn't leave that
but some guy maybe killed his computer
because and with his memory fool Annie
when the people say we don't want this
garbage collection collector because
that developers need to have the power
to manage the memory and now anyone
remember that but they had a scary to
loss this power and now is the same some
guys don't want to lose the power over
the server in that when that represent a
cost in terms not only of money if not
in terms of time unit that sees that
mean they're managing the server knowing
making configurations not everybody
likes to do that then we have lack
operational tools the problem with that
that enter in with the other ones
monitoring challenges architectural
complexity is that how I will collect
all the locks to my function as a
services right now we we not in one
single place so exists tools for I can't
collect all the locks to all myself the
functions and see in one place so how
are we manage the versioning of my
project so right now I am NOT versioning
in Tyrell project I will need to version
in every single function or yeah this is
strategies but we can scrap these
architectural complexity now we need to
add a NAPA gateway for manage everything
separate the information in different
databases that is one of the most hard
part so this is all the drug box of
serverless so is something to take in
consideration and now i will show you
some examples to how we can use a server
less and the first one is a simple
application that is a how can pass a pet
store server into a server less sort
so we will have our client that we will
connect to that but the story and the
pedestal will connect to that database
so this is one the client we have here
our client our browser he can me now the
log in with an authentication server but
what happened in a pet store is like in
Amazon that I can show the products
instead when I am not make logging right
so they divided the database in the
products database and they'd create a
purchase database so I have a database
that can be accessed to everyone in that
when they didn't make the authentication
server just for watch the products so
the client can connect direct to this
kind of database but if he wanna
purchase something or make a search they
connect to the Abigail gateway and a pig
that way go to the purchase function or
the CH function something that is not
here for example for the seer function I
don't need to may the authentication
process but for the Apple chase I need
to make that so here we need to connect
before with the authentication for made
a purchase and we will connect
approaches with the database and here is
another example in this example is
dousset for hand process a lot of
requests and this is a click message
channel this is an example when we
manage adwords in our for example
websites you see this website of news
that sometimes you don't know which is
the new one which is the new
announcement i don't know what happened
here so every time that someone make a
click in this announcement you will
reduce the count of money for example
facebook have dust i put a announcement
and I will put $5 for that and they say
okay you have $5 for three days so maybe
we will have one and 45 for the first
day and every time that someone may
click we reduce 5 cents for this
announcement so they need
to take all these clicks for reduce that
money and win okay do you not have more
money we will don't show more your
announcement so when they have a lot of
clicks they create a function as a
service for a manage that clicked
processor and every time that someone
make a click they will create a function
for manage that and in the database we
will reduce in all the money that we
have for manage de the announcement the
next a really typical use case that
exists for server lazy 4 is for data
processing the first one is for managing
or manipulate images so I don't know if
someone of you manage or world with
mobile applications know just web even
one guy okay so in mobile what happened
is that our cell phones don't have the
same capacity that have a high computer
or you know our server so sometimes in
might in this picture so how heavy can
be this picture you know five megabytes
1421 depends of the camera that take the
picture and it's really Vegas can be you
know 1090 pixels for 1200 pixels so if I
send that image through my cell phone
when I render the picture I can have a
out of memory error in my application or
the picture can not so good so one thing
that is like I put the picture in a
store and then I have a server list that
we detect to I add a picture and the
surveillance we take the picture and we
process that one for adapt to any advice
so I will create a picture adaptive to
iPhone a picture created put Android and
in Android we have different resolutions
so I will reduce the size and the heavy
of my picture other thing that entered
in data processing is for the tag that
changes in a database and eject a
process and I have more an example here
of an implementation that we was making
in Guatemala
and we have a guy that don't want make
when don't want pay for me since the
beginning of his project you know a
connections with SAP or manhatta for
management he been Terios I don't know
how to say that but with SAP and he said
we will use excels so we will take that
can excel for the SAP and we will
process an excel but Excel can have
thousands of records so that means that
I need to have a server that can have
that capacity to process these heavy
files but we don't make that all the
time you know it's like we made that
what very files per day one Monday to
Friday so while I we pay a server to
around 100 dollars in in month so we
will implement a server less function so
and we only will pay for the time to the
server the function is running for
process this and the function will
provide to us the wrestle for can
process these heavy files instead to
have a bigger server because then is
like oh yes we will have like 100 people
will consume in our information so we
don't need a server of $500 for a same
people so the next example is the
Internet of Things and what happened I
don't know be someone of you make
something of Internet of Things or have
some knowledge about Internet of Things
no yes so so ok internet thing is
nothing more than I will have a hardware
project connected to the Internet
caching information varies ok don't
worry I will put an example do you have
pets
yes fishes No
ok but you know the fishes ok you know
what in the Fisher's you need to put
this day game Google's yuasa yes you
know why for the air right in the water
is oxygen - and what happened is the
world is calm and never is move it
oxygen is and right because the fishes
need oxygen to so you need to put the
bubbles for put oxygen inside that so
that happened to when we produce fishes
to this aqua culture that produced
fishes you know the Salman that you can
eat yeah so they usually don't have this
biggest bubble always all the time
turning on imagine have that for a
big-ass pool of fishes so one thing that
they do is go every hour to take many
metrics about how is the oxygen in the
water or what is the temperature of
everything of that so we can create a
IOT project for them and have this well
these things that take matrix I really
don't know the name in English but that
will collect the oxygen that temperature
every hour or every half hour and I will
collect that and I will send that
through the cloud for saving a database
and I will can say okay you know you
need to turn your bubbles every day at
12:00 because we detect that this is the
hour when we don't have much oxygen
there or in that we can put make that
out to make right create that we create
the poles this is a a small project or
IOT but if you know is that the only
thing that I need to make in my project
is send the information and this is
everything so I only need one server for
the IOT project so what I need to create
a manolito configure server for have an
IOT project I can have our server list
one single function that will receive
the information and say that one in the
database so this is other of that
typical use cases of server list and the
next thing is about the chat bots so
Chad what is the same right I am talking
with a about and what will answer to me
so I can use server less for implement
chat BOTS and this is one of the
companies that are using server less
right now in that Expedia to Expedia is
for buy flight tickets and those things
and now I will show you a demo in that
that we have so first I create
previously a database in the Oracle
cloud so I will connect my function to
our Oracle cloud if you didn't see the
Oracle cloud yet so I enter to the
dashboard I may create create an
instance and I will go to all services
for look for MySQL there is and then I
will put create an instance will ask me
in three steps the first thing that I
need to do is put the instance name the
description and in which email I will
receive notifications for my instance so
for example when is created that I saw
that other clubs don't have that we need
to stay refreshing for see when my
instant finally is ready but they will
send to you an email then when I have
the region when I will put that one if I
want to have tax then the full
configuration is with kind of instance I
want if I will use a ssh public key the
mysql configuration if i want to have
backups and recovery configuration and
then here is that the confirmation for
verifying the information is okay so we
will go we will use a server list just
let me check
I will show you this that is a function
as a service list that is not related
with any cloud that is called web tasks
so here I only make the function and I
am can be happy I can choose this is
something that have right now serverless
many clouds
restrict to you that if you will
implement server list you need to use
everything in their cloud so the
database need to be in their cloud you
need to use the epic gateway you need to
use everything of them so in this case
they know you only we will only run here
the the functions so okay well I will
show you one for a connect to us with
the database I really don't know how
many time extra I have for show you that
so we will don't write that from zero
this is a platform that works with
nodejs so in this case I am only
creating a bar for manage my SQL
connection the next thing that out first
to that I need to create some secrets
here I will show you here are the
secrets I create a secret for the host
name of the database for example here is
the IP to my database the database and
the username and the password
okay I create here my MySQL then this is
notation just for can't create my
function Here I am receiving the context
and a callback I verify if I don't have
previously my my connection created if I
don't have that I will create that one
first I will call the secrets I put the
secrets in that way and Here I am
putting the secrets inside if don't
exist some secret I will say you know
what you don't have the secrets for
connect to you to the database right
then I will create my global connection
so I am sending the horse that user the
password and the database and finally I
will connect myself to the database and
I am putting here a callback for civics
it's some issue and now I will make that
connection so I am making a query I just
create a table that have an ID and a
recipe name it supposedly recipes
because I put other that are there and I
have here well I am my connection and I
made a connection now I will show you I
will consume that I have here insomnia
yes
so we consume again we'll return here
here back I have a URL for contest my
server dysfunction so here is the URL I
only send that and we'll return to meet
adjacent so if you see here I am
connecting to a database but I don't
need to config any libraries for made
the connection
I don't need config anyway to mapping
the database of the table that I will
consume I only said you know what I only
want select all the files from this
recipes I want to order died by recipes
and I put a limit of 100 so it's really
easy right so how many times take that
to make that in Medora framework or
platform it's a little bit more complex
right more when we are mapping to a
database so now I will show you other
one that will be add things to that
database and we have run out 7 recipes
here so we will add other one we return
to here so I have here again my SQL SQL
bar I obtained my jason i will obtain a
JSON for my contacts body then I made
the same process to create my database
and we will came to the final of that so
I am just running a query when I say
insert into my recipes database put the
set and I am sending the JSON I will
show you the JSON rich on to insomnia
there is so in my JSON I just post the
recipe name that is the name of the file
in the table and the value and I will
put other thing here I don't know we put
pasta and I will send that here
this returned me the pasta and now I
will go to the database test and past I
need to appear here so we have the pasta
here so you see it's really simple
development the function and this is the
the key secret of this so it's more easy
for us as developers develop something
faster and I don't need to make any
configuration and I am paying well in
this case this is a demo I am not paying
for me this only if I will web task
permit to me play with that and don't
pay when I am playing with that so only
five will put that in production I will
pay for do that but yes if I was paying
I only pay for them seconds that this
was running not for have a server so now
we will return to the presentation and
we will talk a little bit about that FM
project for finish days so FM project is
the new way to Oracle join the Cerberus
architecture and this is really simple
here they are installing the FN project
in that computer
they are starting one of the keys of the
FM project is that is a you can use in
any cloud but the secret here is that
they are running the server list inside
a container a docker and they use
kubernetes that is the only one that
right now have lights to be outer
scalable in terms of when I need them
the other thing that they have is that
we can programming in several
programming languages that is order of
that negative aspects too many clouds so
for example in web tasks I only can
programming in node.js for example I
hate JavaScript and anything that have
related with JavaScript and I consider
JavaScript necessary evil for me to our
fronton works so if I need to use
something that forced me to use no - yes
I wish I don't wanna do that right all
right that happened
for example a LW is lambda started
restricted only to pi/2 for example the
cloud functions are in the same way bit
nodejs so those guys permit to you if
you watch at the beginning of the demo
they was programming in Golan so here we
can choose our programming language we
can have more complex function because
some things happen that whoa I create a
demo right just for write something and
for read everything but what happened
when I receive a really complex JSON
with a lot of a tax say that I need to
parse and create many many files in my
table so we will more complex my
function that will be really biggest and
I cannot have a like a file like I will
make here the parse and I will write
here so those guys create a well we'll
talk about that but we can make more
complex functions that are not only one
file we can have many ones and well they
are next to run that for finish this
demo so they are creating a function
that Willie hey hello hello from FN
no this end yeah it's returning okay
the FM project is divided in four key
parts the first one is the FN server
this is the insight server of the FM
project when I will run my functions so
is I don't know if you know some
framework that is called play framework
yes some guys yeah one is that really
good thing so place that I don't need to
configure server up they have met your
akka and I just made a plain room so
this is the same with the FN server then
we have the effing low load balancer
this is a balancer that is wound inside
the server and words for mate elasticity
of our functions and finally we have
that F function functions development
kit this is a kid when I can use for
development functions in any programming
language and create more complex
functions and finally they have the F
inflow here in server less and
micro-services sex is something okay
this function we make something but
sometimes I need to dysfunction connect
to other function and this is called
orchestration so sometimes I make to
this function called this other one but
that means that these functions need to
get out to the cloud game to the same
epic gateway and Aiyappa gateway we
redirect him to the other function so do
I do that so they create the FM flow for
manage this orchestration in a best way
and one of the key aspects of the FM
project is that is multi cloud so I only
need docker and I put my nathan project
and they will run the developer
experience could be better than in other
ones is container nap in the native Ani
this say created for me more complex
things in the server side so thanks to
coming this is my github when I will
publish this presentation if not equals
I will submit that to the Oracle code
program so you this in the website can
download the presentations this is my
Facebook and my
Twitter account and thanks to coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
