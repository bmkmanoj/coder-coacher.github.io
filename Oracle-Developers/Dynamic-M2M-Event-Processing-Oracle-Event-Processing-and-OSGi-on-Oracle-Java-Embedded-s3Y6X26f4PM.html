to my colleague here but we're sort of
going to have a huge in a geek show for
you today it's not that he's not
handsome but a span first I'm guessing
15-20 minutes on a slide we're talking
about how we see complex event
processing taking increasing a role in
the event processing in m2m space about
some of the components that we see fit
into that space and I will pass it on to
Walt and he will have hands-on demo for
you to show how we actually see it
working in the real world and I think
you we also have a few slides that you
will talk to Ray and we'll open the
questions if you want to stop us at any
point feel free if you chewing it's
filled it's good to know no problem so
with that so that's basically roughly
four things that we want to cover today
I'm not going to give you big lecture
and a big data I not consider myself
expert either but you know just a few
slides to set some basic groundwork for
what we're going to be talking about
down the line we'll spend some time
talking about CP complex event
processing in general Abbott ulcer code
applies to m2m m2m space and how we see
it are taking more important part in
them in a event processing and then our
wall will talk about ogi and how we can
leverage oh ji capability to actually
dynamically update our rule engines only
embedded oep devices and in finally
dimensions there's going to be demos at
woeful run
so big these of big data so if you
google for big data or big Lizzie
probably going to come across notion of
these of big data rated something that
was was first showed up or was
introverted to just buy one of the
analysts from gardner one of the big
analyst outfits out there and it was in
1992 and you know it was curious to me
when I was preparing for this session
was it if you think about 1992 to
remember that far back because I do the
notion of what big data is those days is
is not what we think about big data
today everything you remember we had a
56 kilobits modems that were piping data
from from computers to to internet right
so but interestingly enough the basic
concept of what Gartner so is a big V of
data a success still holds true so well
while you variety velocity very straight
forward obviously volume refers to the
amount of data we have to store and
process lee variety refers to all the
various sources of data that we have to
deal with both structured and
unstructured and obviously velocity is
something that refer to how fast this
data is coming so great and i am not
gonna I'm not gonna overwhelm you with
statistics I think that if you went to
any of the keynotes out there everybody
is talking about XO billion devices and
exif you know it is Etta bytes of data
sensor internet in 2012 and we all know
that different people have different
estimates suffice to say that it's it's
big but there's interesting transit not
everybody might be aware of is it
increasingly larger and larger
percentage of overall
data is actually not coming from humans
in a typically when you when you ask
somebody in the field what they think of
as a big data and what invert interview
generates big data he probably first
thing you would think about this I don't
know Twitter and Facebook and emails and
and in your structured data that
Enterprise generate all the databases
the documents in arm but also things
like every mouse click a very loud
message is yours your server generates
it's all being saved and lives forever
somewhere in some archive in some backup
of your environment but what what struck
me is that it is estimated that today
even well in point it file for roughly
twenty percent of all this big data is
generated by machines and I i'll give
you a couple of examples 1 is smart
meters here in california some of you if
you're anyone here are local you know
that in California we have roughly I
think it's a little like upward of
seventy percent penetration of smart
meters we have more than 10 million
smart meters installed just in
California and each of those meters
generate data if different intervals of
time it meant to be you know I'm not
going to go deep into it but it meant to
generate really often in a less than
minutes apart but in reality it happens
depending on the utilities but i have
seen numbers today there's a 1 billion
data points generated by smart meters
every day and it's going to grow right
says there's a because there is expected
to quadruple in next five to six years
another example that I found very
interesting is at old couple of a couple
of months ago with a researcher for
from BMW research lab here in bay area
in Mountain View and he he was as he was
sharing some information that every BMW
car produced this here generates around
100 data points every second and and
most of the data is being transmitted
and saved in the databases and this
concludes information not just that a
telemetry about car performance engine
performance but it also includes data
like environmental information
temperature humidity precipitation or
old condition because they connect start
data out of out of these AZ sensors it's
monitors suspension on how the
suspension reacts to the road condition
so they can extract all of this data
obviously GPS data says there's a
there's a wealth of data that they have
and they really don't know what to do is
that they do they do use it for rmd
purposes to run and of the drum data
models and analyzes to improve
performance of a car's performance of
the Ancients but there is a lot more
they can do with that if you can figure
out how to leverage it in the real time
because it right now they kept this is
sexual was one of the topic of our
conversation how they can take this data
is they have and create some kind of
math shop solutions with other data
providers data sources to offer a or
each environments or customers okay so
this brings me to what again it's not my
invention I'm not taking any credit
unfortunately I don't know who did come
up with that but you will see another
two V's or what what people refer to is
missing these coming showing up on
Google searches and those are referred
to value and viability so viability
first is that you really have to test
your data and make sure that what you're
getting
is in fact reflects the Z real life
scenario if you have to validate your
data and second one is you have to find
a way to extract maximum value of your
data out of your data it is not enough
to store it in a very house somewhere in
a data warehouse and do post processing
and you know put it in a Hadoop
somewhere in and around it analytics you
have to really create a end-to-end the
data analytics solution that would
enable you to respond in a real-time to
two events on a network so this and
again stop me anytime if you disagree
with me or or you know want to comment
you're welcome so on one hand a
evolution of what we see is a big data
analytics and as a is a constant
increase in the computing capacity of
the small embedded environment is
actually merging in creating this
environment where it can actually create
a distributed dynamic data analytic
solutions so we pull the slide between
Walton myself of a bunch of different
devices from your customers every we
actually have experience working with
and and and putting a reach application
environment I'm that Java based
application environments that would
allow them to do own a network event
processing on a network decision making
and the network close to the age close
to applications real-time or near
real-time response to the d2 z to the
ongoing events so this is the slide is
basically key three key elements of
cognitive intelligence so I mentioned
devices devices that they are cheap
enough price goes down capable enough
come pick out as a CPU
capacity memory are all climbing up at
the parts of prices go down so that
creates environment working we can do a
lot on devices nowadays a real-time
analytics real-time what sometimes in
Oracle we refer to as a fast data
ability to process data own devices
close to the action and the responding
real time and in a big data where you
have ability to connect push data to the
backhand and and leverage is a big ire
and your traditional Big Data
environments to refine your model refine
your data model and be able to push it
down back on the network and and you
know keep processing it's like what what
what I call a a continuous feed lab
feedback loop holes a of Z real-time
analytics so basically that's what it's
going to look like an hour video and we
see a lot of customers already doing
this the local analytics na na na na
rooms of our based oh and controlled by
global analytics so in other words you
have a big data center you have your ex
oolitic exalogic or whatever environment
you're using 'too to process your
zettabyte so 4 terabytes of data in and
you create based on that data models you
create hypothesis you decide you know
what if spectacle events might have or
my effect outcome of / / particular
action and and you make hypothesis based
on those hypotheses you build data model
and you put the data model on to network
devices thousands hundreds devices that
able to process data real-time apply a
data model make a decision on a network
while providing feedback back to the
data center on on the results of your
analytics
so you're looking for the big patterns
in the back end you taking results of
that on the network and you presario
time events and you create a UW create
dynamic feedback loop you constantly
refine your model you constantly push it
to the device to get a better results
it's not because it's not only because
there is no perfect model you know it's
you you do your best you calculate you
define your model the best you can and
try to get a more more most optimal
results out of that but it's also
because the the way your data is
generated network and conditions under
which it generated are not static either
so it's constantly changing behavior
changing patterns are changing so to
stay on the top of that it has to be
continuous feedback loop and that's what
I said right now it's a steps and you
counselor repeat it okay and well as i'm
sure you guessed by looking those
loggers on the bottom of the screen is
is you know we're here to tell you that
we have a solution for you oh okay so
between a oracle and and hitachi we
believe that we have a solution that
would solve a lot of the problems of
processing data and creating real-time
data analytics so on our side oracle
have a very mature stable product that
both works on the backhand in the data
center and on devices so we have oracle
event processing software talked about
it a little bit in a few slides I'm I
okie on time yeah okay and if we have
embedded version of the Oracle event
processing that is small enough and
optimizing after on on on on a very
small embedded devices the OTP is built
on all share framework if you're not
familiar brazoria framework I'm sure
Walt is going to give bring you up to
date but essentially it is a platform
that allows for dynamic application
management remotely so in other words
you can deploy application from the
central service on to the local devices
updated maintain life cycle of the
application of the device including oep
as application and provides you this
ability to constantly connect and update
rules on the device and taking it all
together and in by the way easy he
thought you have an infrastructure
behind the typical osgi client that
allows to manage hundreds and thousands
and millions of devices and we believe
that taking out together I provides your
framework for developing the type of
applications that I've been talking
about yes exactly yes so superjet
framework is or is a he touches
implementation of the osgi standards it
includes both client and server
components it is commercially
so again the 101 or a little for the
lesson 101 but oap there's a couple of
sessions on going here both at the
yellow one and there's more in oracle
openworld will give you a lot more
in-depth soar over your event processor
so you're welcome to join it here is
fairly high level it was that sad oeps
provides you a event-driven architecture
for processing in-flight events it has
ability to consume events provides you
provides you an environment where you
create filters triggers or various kind
to extract intelligence or data out of
those events and then decide how you
want to handle the events post after
post processing you can you can send it
to different streams you can you can
save it a database you can send it to
the consuming clients of any kind the
oap embedded is based on exactly the
same product except that it's optimized
for embedded space some of the
components that they're not applicable
to embedded space were removed it's
going down tested and it also adds on
arm it's part of the so called Oracle
Java embedded suite in and around some
Java embedded vm so it's a java SE
application in essence so it's a
requirement to run on your mission you
have to have Java SC on embedded devices
Java same ballot and Java Sea embedded
on its own is optimized for embedded
space it it has a musician for smaller
memory footprint static footprint for a
you know there is a some optimization
for the low-power devices so there's a
number of things that makes it work
better resource constraint devices and
as I mention is based on Java an osgi
no no it is going to be it's going to be
we're going to continue to support on a
job I see the osgi as a standard to its
standard environment series current
version of Weegee I is not supported in
July me when we talking about Java a new
Adobe cldc right there is some talks
rate that about changing that but I not
aware of any plans to support this on
jelly me one of the key features of
Oracle event processing is the
availability of so-called cql I don't
know if anybody familiar continues a
query language in in its nature it is
very similar to SQL I actually have
example of secure else statement but it
introduces additional features like like
processing on events on am sorry on
streams definition of windows slices
where you can look at the events in a
specific event of afraid of windows
lives or the frame window frame
integration with Eclipse tools I
personally think that it has a great
tool set to develop application tested
monitors there is a component allows you
to log in a minute oriole type oil or AP
engine and you can really break it down
you know it's it's high level but into
three components they are adapters that
we are there to consume events to take
data into there is a processing engine
and there is a circle sinks where you
know there is a where events are being
sent after the process and I'm going to
brief services because there's you know
fairly similar next few slides it is all
really based on java the java
application you can you can create an
adapter write a Java codes it would
consume event from a ver
to any source including no java
application native code the same thing
for the data things you can connect and
send data to any even a client that you
can access you from Java code even
processing already briefly talked about
it you can either use cql to define your
queries if you have any experience with
SQL it takes you know a couple of hours
to get you up to speed on how it works
is fairly straightforward you can also
write your own Java code if you want to
do that way so it's also available most
of the cord is auto-generated for you
there is very good documentation it
creates all the stuff tells you where to
put your your quads it analyzes events
and decides where to send it and you can
also plug in you can plug in database
directly as a source of your data it's
often needed to enrich your data if you
have unique events coming you want to
link it to your location events names
something is static singing a little
absent lives in your database so you can
easily do that just in a graphical
development environment and I already
talked about basically the same is true
for destination of the data so this is
example of how a event processing
Network might look like it's actually
not just a random example this is an
example of what we currently running is
a live demo here at the joe on oracle
openworld we with our partners we
develop a solution to monitor people a
real real time so we have devices
install it holguin Moscone Center we
roll the keynote taking place at Java
exhibit hall in hilton and few other
locations and we're monitoring people a
real time and this is in the EPM that
we're using on the backhand in the cloud
and accelerated clouds to process data
so we have now I'll get to use laser on
okay so we have a source of the data
that they actually coming from the MTT
server I don't know if you're familiar
mkg tmq gt's is a pop sub product call
optimized for embedded space there's a
lot more to say about it if you want we
can talk a little later on but for now
it's all it is so so there is a channel
that takes this database if you like
starts payload from JM q GD messages and
creates a tree eventful so each of those
who can flow responsible separate logic
so we're extracting different type of
intelligence out of zero data you know
for instance we're monitoring in an odd
count of people in the registration area
in hilton and there's a two doors exit
and entrance and the expected flow of
people is that people going to be coming
into entrance and living out of exit so
what we do is we created one of the rule
here actually this one this one right
here on the bottom create a sliding
period of winter sliding window of time
three minutes and maintains over sliding
three minutes time frame direction of
flow for each of those entrances and and
and and pendant makes it available for
the visualization parted I'll show you
in a second to indicate whether expected
people fully actually taking place it
reserved people in fact i Bangz a signs
and the rules and entering in one door
and exits or another and there's some
other analytics that happens at the same
time so we actually using you if you go
back to exhibit hall there's a three
places where you can check it out and
raise your hand you will see silver bars
as the door so the whole exhibit hall
and Giovanni you will see each door has
a bar with the people counter on it this
is example of cql I am probably will
take you a couple of minutes to
understand what it does but it's not a
rocket science is it okay nevermind and
so it's just a I guess he plugs I have
here is this is say people come
device people people counter device this
is gateway where the old intelligence
leaves us they're connected feeding data
up to the cloud and this is one of the
dashboards that we have shows occupancy
level in different locations counter
this guy here is a stereoscopic cameras
so there is a two lenses it monitors
people based on blobs so your shapes it
does not matter facial features or
gender race or anything that my violate
your privacy it does however able to
detect a a direction where you going
because it's three-dimensional it takes
three dimensional picture so it can it
can detect the vector of your movement
yeah yeah the manufacturer is company
call your attack they actually also on
the floor of jello on so it can come by
they're great guys talk to them yeah
there you should make it up yesterday
and I can't remember the money as they
can tell you to have some slides on how
that little twice work yeah come by talk
to them they're great guys there is
there from Italy have a very cool
accents to not like mine okay and I volt
you on that oh yeah absolutely
if I have a crash so interesting you
mention where the garage is money so
there's a couple of different things
that happens right there is some cash in
education could be configured so the
device is actual people counters and
gateways they are they can be configured
to hold up to 60 hours of data but then
in application in your application you
have to decide if you you know you have
to implement the logic what would happen
if i lose the upstream connection and
runs in connection very established do
it just dump this old data back and let
them figure out like each data point
each time person goes in and out it is
obvious timestamp right I know where
that was generated what sometime it will
generate so there's ability to recover
to some extent but it's really up to you
know this this guy here is where you
deploy in applications it pull the data
from the they provide the API here at
that guy's provides you an API to get
the data so you don't have to write the
low-level code but but it is a really
your decision is developer how to handle
outages and in how to how to decide what
you do with handles a bulk of data that
comes up was that sad then other things
that to consider is gateways connected
to the cloud using MQTT so MQTT one of
the features of MQTT answer is a you
know there's different opinion on you
know on I'm not for against against
against the supporters of heaters of
MQTT but one of the features that it
does have is a configurable quality of
service where you can define how message
is coming to get you messages should be
handled you know all the way to send and
forget meanings it you know if my
message did not reach end I don't care
there is the way to configure centenary
thrive X number
x or sent and retry until until it is
acknowledged deliver acknowledged 3 so
it's really again depending on the use
case you decide what you want to do with
messages but again so it's not in you
know it's not infinite right if you
start queuing up messages on a gateway
side some point you will run out of
space so you have to decide how you
handle it yes absolutely the oap on the
server side is actually part of our
fusion middleware framework and it's
supported all the underlying high
availability features are supported so
you can cluster it it's a tricky
business but it's probably not something
we're going to discuss here because
because how events are triggered and if
you distribute across multiple clusters
you'll have to think about it but I'm
not you know people who know a lot more
than I do about it but a short answer is
yes and in a few hours and pushing data
to databases we have obviously have all
the underlying high-availability
features for database as well and
actually if you talk to the tachi
consulting guys down at oracle world
than in the moscone center they're the
guys that built the back end piece of
the arm of the current iot emotion demo
so they're the guys that understand like
I'm on the embedded sign they're the
guys that understand how you build out
all that infrastructure back in okay I
want to make sure we'll get his share of
time but we'll be happy to answer any
other questions after Walt is done every
day can y'all hear me I said I'm on the
that in the embedded side working with
embedded Java and also with osgi so
that's kind of what our space is we
mainly our particular group works a lot
telecom industry a lot of the devices
you saw back there are home gateways
home routers as people are trying to get
more more intelligence out closer to
those gateway devices your tech has
these guys right here
which pretty cool devices you can see
those if you go out on the demo grounds
there next to all the little mounts so
their gateways collecting the data
because you can have multiple of those
sensors on these gateways you can also
hook other things to enlight digital
signage you can be collecting all kinds
of other information and aggregating it
up and we'll show you why that may be
important here in a minute whoo so for
osgi is how many people are familiar
with it not familiar with it ok I'll do
kind of a quick a quick kind of overview
it one things that we're as we're
talking about this right is that we need
a dynamic environment and one of the
things that you need is a dynamic way is
all it was talking about earlier to
handle data down on those gateways that
it turns out that your initial rules one
of the issues you see now with embedded
devices you put the embedded device out
there you program it you find out that
the environments that event isn't
exactly the same and it becomes
non-trivial then to change those devices
out of the network all kinds of things
may play into that in particular your
global analytics may tell you that you
wanted to have changed your your range
on your devices because you find out
like global Northern Pacific measures
the temperature of train wheels to
determine if they get above a certain
temperature they know what the
percentage rate of failure is so they
can pull a train over or slow him down
before he derails right you may find out
from a global analytics standpoint that
that the data that your engineering
specs aren't quite meeting what you're
seeing reality is so you want to
exchange you and expand that range
dynamically right would be an example
you also find that you end up with more
data more inputs that you wanted so you
want to be able to do this kind of
dynamic on the fly on the devices closer
to real time so you can leverage the
changing in these processing rules and
also take advantage of the processing
that are on these gateways these
gateways are getting more and more
powerful
and they can do a lot of processing see
freescale guys are back here and they
build these guys to they've got devices
that I put a lot of um horsepower on
those so what osgi is is osgi is a
dynamic modular system for Java it rides
on top of it it's mature it's been
around for a long time it's lightweight
the two key things that we leverage in
this is it supports a modular life cycle
so as well as being modular so you can
kind of really cleanly separate all your
functionality is it supports an install
start/stop upgrade and you can do that
remotely you can also do versioning so
you can have different versions of a
particular module out there it turns out
you can even run multiple versions at
the same time if you need to there's all
kinds of things you can do with the
versioning for that the other thing is
it has a services model built in some of
the guys call it microservices so you
can advertise the service that you
provide other modules can dynamically
discover that so that the implementation
of that particular service can come and
go without the actual other module
having to change so for example if
you're needing to change the way you're
doing input or the type of device that
you're gathering the input from that can
change without the guy above you who's
consuming that service knowing how
you're getting the data and we're going
to kind of run through some of that now
in OE p what you're saying up here oleg
showed you this this kind of top part
here there's an osgi framework that all
that runs in and that runs on the top of
java on the device yeah so the we can
run this on on different ones itachi
does us the Super j framework on it is
on
no it's actually the hitachi super j is
developed from scratch internal that it
saw up and particularly optimized for
the embedded space one of the areas that
we were looking at was to optimize an
osgi for embedded products so it's a
hour for dot 30 ish I compliant
framework you just comment to make it
clear the the embedded client or
declines at ODP embedded chips which is
Felix based yeah open source right but
it is fully swappable the oil embedded
oeg i embedded oep is a part of what we
call jelly embedded sweet and and the
under language a client at Ronzoni and
just new release that is coming up or
lady it's it's almost there yeah is he's
going to have a full swappable oej
client so if you you know if for those
who will need to or want to leverage
features that super Jay can offer they
can swap it s then you can swap it with
or you're not or you can mail X right
you can manage other clients from your
infrastructure as well right that's
right yeah yeah what we're agnostic as
far as managing the different clients so
how does this look basically you've you
have an implementation out in the field
you've deployed it up in the back end
you have a repository of different types
of functionality that you need for these
different modules so there's a
management system that management
systems work remotely it can scale up to
thousands tens of thousands millions of
devices so you can upgrade your entire
infrastructure so this is kind of the
picture that Oleg showed you earlier and
your setup you've deployed
inevitably you get out to the field and
what happens the data feeds that you
have coming in there's variation in it
there's either additional ones there's
other ones so what do you do what you
can do with osgi because these different
pieces are modular and pluggable is I
can go through and decide to download a
different data adapter on that guy and
handle the new data that's coming in to
me either from you sensors you formats
over the same sensors just variations in
it I can change that then I can decide
right if I wanted to process the events
differently because now I'm getting
different data in a now Diana CLE want
to change the behavior I want to do some
different event processing on those
events now that they're on the device
and remember this is all happening
before you send it up to the cloud this
is kind of managing it locally yes yet
jazz comes with a database and you can
aam store all the stuff locally and then
process them locally so you have
variations of choices on that i'm going
to show you all this running on a
Raspberry Pi with an SD card stuck in it
I'm sorry Java embedded sweet yes sorry
we're all guilty for slipping into it
yeah yeah yeahs always crate and then
kind of the final thing that you may
want to end up doing right is you now
want to send that to different locations
or where you send it might want to be
different right I may want to send the
different inputs to different locations
I may want to send them all to the same
place I may change the way i want to
send it hola gusto might MQTT I may
publish it on different in qtt prime
topics as it goes out you can send it to
different rest services it doesn't
really matter you may want to change the
way you handle that behavior so the
underlying osgi technology is what's
allowing this dynamic behavior and for
you to do what I showed here these
pieces to kind of change independently
of each other on the device you could
have done it kind of the other way the
other direction as well
for that and then it's kind of the it's
the rinse and repeat that I Oleg was
talking about right you're now
processing happily again everything is
going good and eventually something's
going to change in the system that you
want to change it to some dynamic stuff
again yes device with IP devices for
example there is a type of devices let's
say air conditioned they're sending the
old a path through the weighty devices
to the back end but if the week device
there's no voy voy advices the itchy air
conditioning send the data directly to
back-end system but one of the air
conditioning as a malfunction though it
doesn't if any effect two other
condition but IP devices cause
malfunction or air conditioning
mercenary data to the backend system I
mean the earth the essential to take is
centralized that devices
because my function all air conditioning
stop
yeah so well these gateway devices are
highly reliable gateway devices that
you're putting out there and almost as
reliable as the air conditioning but
well so I'll give you an example and
this is a this is also big debate still
in the MDM space whether you're going to
use cellular and have the air
conditioning talk directly back upstream
and then there's weather or whether
you're going to have gateways that
aggregate and process data before you go
back upstream there's a lot of
advantages to putting gateways out there
to do the data one is is that the viable
data that Oleg was talking about when
you embed that air conditioning unit to
send everything a lot of times you're
sending junk and you've got no way to
filter it the other thing is and this is
a real world example with the people
counters when they're put on buses you
can now use that gateway to click the
people data information it's also
collecting the bus Tellem at you know
telematics it's also collecting other
information from the bus diagnostic
systems it's also doing digital signage
so that it's collecting all that data
together and real time updating ads
based on the stops that are coming even
the number of people on the bus you're
doing that because you've got a gateway
out there that's helping your aggregate
all that data on the bus before you send
it upstream and then you can change that
the behavior amongst all of that live on
the on the bus so actually have a good
example with me very much yes actually a
couple of months ago I went to the
conference in one of the presence is
smart intelligent devices related
conference in one of the key presenters
keynote presenter swoozie the CTO from a
large company air conditioning company I
never heard of them before mcqueen i can
find the name but they claim to be one
of the largest industrial manufacturer
of air conditioning equipment rack
equipment
what he said is that they implemented a
similar type of solution that is not
only integrated not only pulling data
from individual air-conditioning units
but also integrated was overall building
management system that for instance it's
aware a what's going on in different
locations and a building where what's a
count of people so they can adjust its
workload or chested cycle the only cool
enough air to our to meet the
requirements of occupants of the room
right so it is integrated with a other
devices on the network integrated in in
a fashion that it can make intelligent
decisions based on temperature locations
it can be preheat or pretty cool with
the room if it knows that there is going
to be largely event happening so people
won't come in and it's going to be too
cold or too hot until they will adjust
height so the dupree active a management
that was both result in a better quality
of service environment but also save
energy they said they have significant
cost savings on on an energy side by a
regulating how air conditioning sports
not just heavy on and off switch yeah
cool I'm going to a quick demo to show
you how it works like I said it's
running on a Raspberry Pi there's a
couple of slides if you download them
when they publish it just kind of gives
quick overview of this but it's easier
just to go ahead and show it so that the
first thing I'm going to do is show you
the right here so we have a doctor
running on the device now and what I'm
going to do is change that back end
processing pieces to different modules
that are running when I'm going to show
you how you change those this initial
one right here this oep temp is kind of
basic simple we're going to lob let me
find the one that I'm gonna download
we're going to push it down to the to
the Raspberry Pi so what we have here is
a raspberry pi with a couple of fidgets
connected to it one's an LCD display one
of them is a temperature probe you can
google fidgets and there's all kinds of
little things if you wanted to build
your own so we're going to send it down
it's going to prank up and initialize
the LCD display and and the thermostat
the temperature probe so it's connected
found the temperature probe we're doing
something very simple first of all I
show you kind of the rules right here is
all I'm saying is the this probe has an
ambient temperature that it measures
that one end of it where the USB port is
and then it has a probe end right and
all we're saying is is that if oops back
over to the right screen this guy is
displaying what the probes actually
measuring this Elsa LED and if the
temperature gets I can make it and get
it form enough now above the ambient
temperature
okay okay
then I'll display that the morning that
you saw come out here that the
temperature is changing right my hands
have gotten too cold and I'm getting to
room temperature that's a scary right so
exactly so you can see that the
temperature is changing and that's all
because it's it went above if it's above
the ambient temperature if I put it in
this glass of water you can see that the
temperature is changing but I'm not
displaying any warning for that know
what it is is it's on that is just right
now all that processing is happening
locally yeah I'm not actually sending it
up screen right now i'll show you the up
yes yeah exactly that's exactly right so
in the adapter so what i'm doing now and
i shade the code here in second all it's
doing is displaying it but it could say
yes send it to different MQTT streams do
different things with it back that's
exactly right so and like so for now
here's the actual guy that's displaying
it it's just displaying code it's just
displaying the message right now like
this but you can do this some sort of
thing and send it to different locations
do different things you can send this
data to multiple multiple processing
streams on the device so in the in the
applications of the running here is a
demo in the same events the same block
of code initializing em QT client we
import mmk client library initializes a
client connection mq connection defines
a connection point for the server and
topic name and send messages well the
mosquito I know the mesquita is a open
source version of women kiss the client
the eurotech I actually a one of the
founding members of that standard so
they have their own implementation there
is one who open source I'm ki GTG in
must get as creator of that so what they
have is a superset what is available in
mosquito what I'm going to do here is
use that cql that Oliver saw Matt
earlier i'm just going to change it so
that instead of doing it when the probe
temps above the ambient temperature it's
going to do it when it's going to do
just the opposite so now we should see
when I stick it in the ice that it will
work so I'm going to build this guy what
we're going to do is we're going to
rename it to the one dot one version
made that change go to the screen smugly
now we'll build that new version save my
changes
alright so now I have this new OE p21
dido jar so what we're going to do is
we're going to uninstall the old one
then I'm going to find my install line
again Oh ep10 yep now what I'll do is
install the new one onto the device yep
closed
so that it so now we've we've built it
we and we installed it down it's now
reinitialized back so now we should see
just the opposite so if I stick it in my
cold water it's now given us warnings I
breathe on that damn it temperature goes
up I give no warning so you can you can
see how you can do the same sort of
thing I could now set the temperature
range right and I can vary the range
like I so about that Northern Pacific on
their wheels if they decide they need a
wider or ideally their idea is to keep
trains running if they find out through
the global analytics across all the
trains that they can narrow the number
or lower the number before they need to
tell the engineer to slow down right
that keeps our trains running they make
more money right they need cargo on the
Lions it's kind of interesting so that
is you can do this dynamically with an
infrastructure this can I was just using
command lines here there's a back-end
infrastructure you can push this across
an entire network so you could update
all your sensors are your gateways in
the network with these new rules based
on your global data for that yes
yes so there is no reason why you
couldn't do especially using this
technology is to federate some of that
intelligence across different gateways
right so that's exactly right different
gateways yeah so this kind of decision
making and how to do this dynamic thing
you could actually with this technology
kind of think of tearing out how you're
making the decision so you've got the
your back-end hey do know SQL massive
analytics is trying to figure out all
this data plus is there some correlation
between this and Twitter comments on
Madonna right i mean you know because
that stuff find some weird correlations
right but you could then tear it down to
where okay i also just want these i want
all the devices in hotel nikko to
coordinate to find out is there a
pattern right and then or their higher
pattern so yes you could do this across
devices and you could tear it then I
think about LEP is you could have that
that one adapter on the outside feeding
another adapter on a different system in
putting it one step up and doing that
same sort of thing and they dynamically
change it as you need to another another
example might be interesting there's
there is a people who are using using
people counters to understand a buying
patterns of people in the air tail
stores where they are monitoring the
amount of people going in and out of
this stores and comparing it with a
comparing with a number of paying
customers logical conversion rates and
they trying to exist data from multiple
different stores are you talking about
you know
pizza chain it was thousand stores I can
single fanny at this moment anyway any
closing store you analyze data across
multiple different stores in the back am
trying to create hypothesis right our my
youth my salespeople are not trained
well enough that's why that's a reason
they are not converting customers so let
me give them more training in the
monitor again right is that improving or
not or maybe my locations they are not
generating enough incoming traffic for
salespeople to convert into say paying
customers so let me compare so what I'm
saying here is it is example of how you
need all this data cancelled data from
hundreds or thousands of stores to come
up with a model why is it but is it my
conversion rates not where I want it to
be or why specific areas or stores don't
have it then implement solution deploy
it continue monitoring expecting areas
is this here is after you see it if you
do good if you know you try to refine it
again deploy it and test it so that's a
kind of feed bags loops it will be
talking about yeah it took stall time
with you good I I didn't time myself as
the first time any other questions I'm
happy I've got time we can I don't know
about all the guy I can stay for a few
minutes to so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
