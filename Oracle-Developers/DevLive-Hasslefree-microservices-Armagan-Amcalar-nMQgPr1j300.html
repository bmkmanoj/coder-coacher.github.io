Oracle called fog after noon here had
some great interviews I'm your host
Javed Mohammed and I'm we have another
wonderful speaker with us today at the
moment I'm trying to get a name right
arm again I'm color
yeah I'm July yes I say one more time
Armand I'm jealous well okay everything
I'm going to quite get that but anyway
so you had a presentation zero
configuration micro services with no js'
and darker yeah so what was all the way
round so it seems like you got a whole
lot of stuff that go going under yes
exactly
um so of course it's apparent that
micro-services is a rage at the moment
it's a new way of doing your application
at the darker um and of course we had
this service-oriented architecture like
10 years ago 20 years ago and we've been
doing stuff that way
so when micro services emerged people
basically took practices from the past
and kind of rebranded it as micro
services but actually it's a little bit
different this time and so it kind of
sorry because it might be a that
expression of what's old is new again
yes um but yeah it now brings in a lot
of new ideas and this talk basically
points out the the underlying the
fundamental principles for making micro
services a modern micro services
architecture basically it has to be
hassle-free that's the more self come it
has to be void of a lot of technological
dependencies burden for your operations
teams burden for your developers so
there are a lot of best practices around
to make it all happen kind of magically
and basically the Stoke points out those
so what else can you share a few a few
of those
this is yeah exactly for example one of
the biggest pain points about
service-oriented architecture was
configuration you had a bunch of
machines lying around in your data
center or several data centers around
the world and you had to know the IP
address of each and every one of them
and which services are in which machine
which server which is kind of a hassle
than you want to push a new server any
service into the ecosystem because then
you have to update the configuration
sometimes people did it manually which
led to a lot of problems so there are
modern solutions that do this
automatically for you so that you don't
even know a single IP address but you
have maybe thousands of machines so
where is all the central repository of
IP addresses and which where is all of
that care um so we are using tools
called orchestration management systems
are like kubernetes yell exactly
communities and docker swarm or Dhokla
cloud or enterprise uh-huh
and the best thing is they give you an
environment and they get out of your way
and then you're left with your source
code which is agnostic of where it's
running it doesn't know if it's running
in communities or or docker cloud for
that matter and basically there are no
configuration ever in your source code
to make your application run okay
so where is all this kind of as a trend
so you know you we talked a little bit
about what old is do you have so where
things kind of going with darker the
biggest thing darker gives you is
confidence that your source code will
run wherever you deploy it and because
it's it's an immutable file system in
it's an immutable service which
basically lets you develop applications
regardless of the database lying
underneath it and basically it's going
to
I swear you don't have applications and
services anymore but functions running
in the cloud which is called server
looks basically you don't care which
server is running your code anymore you
just before function and call it
multiple times of different parameters
and you get different output is that
where all this zero configuration and
yet your presentation kind of yeah
exactly
so basically you have no configuration
again whatsoever not IP addresses not
service names also you just say I want
this to be executed and there is no
central manager but somehow the
ecosystem knows that okay well I can
answer to that so that requests so why
don't I take it and basically this
happens in an autonomous way services
know which requests they can respond to
and then there are some other services
that require work to be done and they
meet and they make friends and then they
work together okay you also talked about
the failsafe and self-healing we will
talk a little bit about from a
reliability some will work how that ties
in um one of the biggest problems with
micro services right now is they fail a
lot and you have hundreds of them it
leads to lost requests and somehow
sometimes it's critical you know you can
lose your payment request it correctly
yeah that's terrible
so the first thing you have to make sure
is your services can function even if
some other service is failing for
example if the payment service is down
your category list your product list or
user profiles should be up and running
because they don't depend on payments
actually and if you want to make a
payment you should have a circuit
breaker somewhere that says the payment
is down for the time that would work
through like monitoring service yeah
exactly
um and of course the services who wants
to who want to talk to that payment
service
should monitor it it's health and you
know take action autonomously hey okay
I'm not sending you any more requests
because you're dead basically I can't
talk to you
that is fault-tolerance then and then
there's self-healing which is basically
the system and orchestration management
does this for you like cognitive or
Tucker Swan those for you when they are
dead they should be respawn base achill
e because i want it that way i want
exactly ten instances of that service if
it's eight my service may falter it may
lead to latencies so you have to sound
feel somehow to bring up those services
back online
okay well it's a lot of interesting
things going on are you going to be
going to any more other Concord events
or is this is for you for now I guess
it's this formula here and there where's
home home for you a Berlin Berlin yeah
spread to you how did you get how did he
get from Berlin to product well I'm
night took a bus you took a bus very
comfortable yeah okay okay so yeah and
this is the first time I'm in Prague so
I'm actually excited about the city as
well yeah you probably took just as long
as I had it had to go through airport
and security and all of that so I
thought oh it didn't come out ahead
yeah thank you so much for coming out
and for sharing with that with a
pleasure thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
