looking at some practical examples of
using the new features of the servlet
3.1 API mainly how I use those within
apache tomcat to implement WebSocket one
point oh so this is a rough agenda we'll
start off with some introductions I'll
give a very brief overview of the
WebSocket protocol I'm not going to go
into any great depth but just cover the
key points of it that then impacts on
the design and then the selection of
features we use from server at 3.12
implement that design once we understand
those requirements will their map that
to the server core servlet 3.1 features
probably the most useful part is going
to be the complicating factors it's all
the places where it didn't quite work as
expected where it is a little bit more
difficult and hopefully that will give
you some lessons that you can take away
when you're doing implementations with
server 3.1 using those api's you'll be
able to get around those obstacles a
little bit quicker than it took me to
figure out how to do it I'll wrap up at
the end of the quick summary I will take
questions at the end but if there's
anything that that's not clear as we're
going on please you know jump up and
down wave your hands in the air get my
attention and we'll deal with it there
and then so who am i I'm Mark Thomas if
you follow the apache tomcat project
then my apache ID is mark to you
probably seen that on the users and Dev
lists I'm obviously a committer on the
Tomcat project and I've done the
majority of the development work both
Tomcat 7 and 4 Tomcat 8 elsewhere the SF
I'm a member of the Apache security team
I helped out on a couple of other
projects and I also helped out managing
Apaches infrastructure my day job is as
a consulting engineer at pivotal where
they pretty much leave me to get on with
working on tomcat which suits me just
fine as a technically under the pivotal
umbrella I was a member of the expert
groups for servlet WebSocket and
expression language for Jerry 7 whilst
it it has to be done under the pivotal
umbrella Releford rather annoying legal
reasons it was as I was essentially
there as the Tomcat representative
elsewhere at pivotal when I'm not
working on tomcat I do have a few other
bits and pieces to do and one of the
things I do is I lead the security team
so it's a bit of a security theme to
some of the other things I do as well so
let's start by looking at the WebSocket
protocol it's defined in RFC 64-55 it's
a fairly readable specification if
you're interested in WebSocket then it's
definitely worth reading it will help
you understand what's going on
essentially it's an asynchronous
messaging protocol there are three types
of messages text messages binary
messages and control messages and
between the client and the server is
essentially the client is whichever end
initiates the connection the server with
whichever end receives that connection
there's one persistent connection
there's no management of state within
the protocol itself if the connections
up it's connected if it's down it's not
and there are messages to close the
connection at the end but essentially
that's it in order to initiate the
connection it uses HTTP upgrade so the
URLs you'll see in the browser all start
WS colon slash slash whatever but if you
actually look at what happens on the
wire what actually happens it's an HTTP
request you can see HTTP upgrade
requests assuming that the upgrade
request is accepted you get an HTTP
response back and at that point it just
switches over to the WebSocket protocol
you never actually see a WS or a WS s
for secure protocol on you never
actually see that URL on the wire it's
only HTTP you actually see on the wire
so I mentioned the three types of
messages text and binary a sort of group
together and control or a little bit
difference we have we discuss those
separately all of the text messages are
always encoded using utf-8 no exceptions
it's always utf-8 encoded there's a
limit of two to the sixty three bites on
a single frame however messages can be
split across multiple frames and there's
no limit to the number of frames you can
have in a message therefore there is
absolutely no limit on message size none
whatsoever which creates a few problems
on the implementation side because
infinite buffers denial-of-service tends
to cause a few problems and so obviously
we do have to put some limits on there
but there's nothing there's no limits at
all
all in the protocol itself control
messages are only 125 bytes in in terms
of payload length and they're meant to
be short and you can insert them in
between frames that are parts of other
messages for text and binary messages
once you start sending a message you've
got to complete that message before you
can send the next one so if it's just a
single frame you send the frame then you
can go on to the next message if the
message is split across three or four
frames you have to send each of those
frames in order before you can then move
on to the next message you can't
interleave different frames from
different messages I'm not in the not in
the base protocol anyway so that there
is no multiplexing there's an extension
for that the last time I looked it was
still in draft I think jetties got an
implementation for it tom cat hasn't yet
it's one of the things on the to-do list
but the reason I mention again those
those frames is that you can you are
allowed to insert control messages
between the frames of a text or binary
message but you're not allowed to into
leave multiple text messages or multiple
binary messages looking then at the
WebSocket jsr there's absolutely no
requirement whatsoever to build on top
of that serve the 3.1 there's no
requirement to build on any other bit of
j2ee if you don't want to it's perfectly
acceptable to build a stand-alone
application that implements these api's
however there is a recognition that
chances are you're probably going to be
doing this in a j2ee environment and you
probably won't be using it in a j2ee
environment so there is the ability to
pass in the HTTP session when you start
a web socket connections so you you know
what HTTP session this particular
connection was part of always started
from and but it's passed in it as an
object explicitly to avoid a dependency
between the two specifications it has to
configuration Styles programmatic which
is as you'd expect you do everything
just with Java and also an annotation
style you can do almost everything in
annotations that you can do
programmatically it does provide client
and server api's and the client API is a
subset of the set
our API so if you're on the server side
then you've always got the client API
available as well so you can always if
you want to initiate your own
connections off to other servers then
you're able to do that with Tomcats
implementation I was aiming to do a
number of things first of all in
compliance with the specifications
that's a good place to start I wanted it
to be contained a neutral a number of
Tomcat components get reused in other
application servers I wanted there to be
the possibility for you to be able to
take Tomcats WebSocket implementation
and use it in another application server
if you wanted to or for those
application servers to take Tomcats
implementation and use it themselves as
their implementation I'm not aware of
anybody doing that yet but the option is
there obviously if you're going for a
container neutral approach then you have
to go through through the server 31 API
and there's potentially a cost in doing
that as opposed to going directly to the
containers internal ap is bypassing the
sort of additional layer of indirection
that you get from using the server api's
from what I've seen so far in the
testing there's very very little impact
if any that you can actually measure
from doing that and whenever I've done a
performance test I always end up hitting
IO bottlenecks not sort of layer
bottlenecks in terms of going through
the server API that doesn't actually
seem to have caused any performance
implications at all not to say that
somebody won't at some point produce a
test case that highlights a problem and
as always an open source when they do if
they're kind enough to provide us with a
bug report will take a look and see what
we can do to fix it so let's look now at
the features of website and then how
they map to serve at 3.1 so we've seen
it it's a single persistent connection
and it uses asynchronous messages so the
client can send messages whenever it
likes the server can send messages
whenever it likes if you want that sort
of solution to be scalable you really
need to be using non-blocking i/o
otherwise you have one thread that's
allocated to connection and it's just
SAT there spinning waiting for some data
to turn up and whilst that that's okay
for a few hundred connections it's
manageable for a few thousand
connections when you get into tens of
thousands can
connections you have an awful lot of
threads using up an awful lot of
resources not doing very much so you
really want to use non-blocking i/o
where you can only need to use a thread
when there's actually some data to
process so there's a nice mapping here
servlet 3.1 has introduced the concept
of non-blocking i/o WebSocket needs
non-blocking i/o there's an obvious
match up there so one of the first
feature that we selected was the server
3.1 non-blocking I also mentioned that
WebSocket starts with an HTTP upgrade
connection it won't be a surprise that
servlet 3.1 added HTTP upgrade support
that was primarily in order to support
the WebSocket spec that was the main
driver for although it's obviously there
if you want to implement any other
protocol via HTTP upgrade it that all
the hooks you need to do that are there
with some complications that you'll see
in a little bit later but the hooks are
there we also need to scan for
annotations because the WebSocket
annotation configurate configuration
essentially means there could be a
WebSocket annotation on any class in any
jar anywhere in your web application so
that means you have to scan all of them
looking for those annotations
fortunately servlet 3.1 so I 3.0 in fact
provides annotation scanning via the
servlet container initializers so that's
what we're able to do to the for the
annotation scanning so that's a a large
chunk of sort of plumbing that we don't
need to provide that the container will
just provide for us so we'll start with
looking at that annotation scanning
feature as I said it was added in
servlet 3.0 and it's done via the server
container initializer essentially what
you do is you implement that interface
and you annotate it with the handles
type annotation and in that annotation
you list all of the classes and all of
the annotations and all the interfaces
that you're interested in and then web
application scans for matches for all of
those and it will also scan up
hierarchies as well so if you have if
you say I'm looking for anything that
implements HTTP servlet if you've got a
class implements HTTP server that but it
sort of four levels down the inheritance
hierarchy the annotation scaling will
still find it so it's smart enough to
look up and down the inheritance
hierarchies for things like oh it needs
to implement that interface and so when
the container starts up it starts up
each web application it scans for the
annotations and for all of the servlet
container initializes it looks see what
they're interested in finds the matches
and then it calls that initializes on
startup methods passes in a set of
classes these are all of the things that
I found that were either annotated with
those annotations or implemented those
interfaces that you said you're
interested in or were the classes that
you said you wanted to know about so
this is what it looks like in WebSocket
apologies if it's a little bit small I
was hoping it would be a bit bigger but
as a small issue with the display
doesn't really like my Mac unfortunately
but what we've got there is we're
looking for a server that server
endpoint classes that's the annotation
so that's saying this class implements a
server web socket endpoint so that's
something that would receive web socket
connections we're looking for the
application configuration that's a
filtering mechanism that I'll come on to
in a minute and we're looking for
anything that extends endpoint class and
that's the programmatic implementation
of a WebSocket endpoint so we're
essentially looking for endpoints and
things that filter them right go back to
this filtering one the reason that's
there if you've got a framework jar that
provides say 20 or 30 different
WebSocket endpoints and you only want to
use two of them if you add that jar to
your web application by default all 30
of those will get enabled and that's 29
places where you've got server doing
something that you don't want it to do
that could be potentially exposed some
sort of security issue so you need a way
of saying I really only want those two
and the servlet server application
config is how you do that it basically
gets passed a list of all of the
endpoints that have been discovered it
can then fill something yet just deploy
these to these three this one whatever
it is that you want so that's why we
need to find those as well and you have
as many of those as you like in your
application and it's the combined set of
all of us all of one's that it says okay
deploy this so if you've got to server
application configs one says deploy
these two endpoints the other one says
deploy these three you'll get all five
deployed um because we need to scan
every single class for things that match
handle types that's a relatively
expensive operation in the early days of
the Tomcat seven implementation it was a
horrific ly expensive operation we've
optimized it as much as we can but it's
still a relatively expensive thing to do
and if you're in an environment where
applications start time is important
then you want to be able to do all that
you can to minimize that and servlet 3
does provide some options for minimizing
the scanning however the specification
language wasn't quite as clear as it
could have been and then to further
complicate matters I then didn't read
the specification language that there
was quite as carefully as I should and
that meant that Tomcat wasn't quite
doing the right thing since I've written
these slides we've actually thought of a
few more edge cases that aren't covered
at all and there's there's currently an
exercise going on on the Tomcat devilÃ­s
to work out all of the things where we
think clarification is required and then
we need to go to the expert group and
say right this lot needs clarifying and
so there's a well-defined process for
exactly what's going to happen with all
of these server container initializers
but the bits that are clear if the a
servlet container initializer is
provided by the container it always runs
it always if it has a handles type
matches for the handles type are always
scanned for if nsci um needs to when you
configure an SC I it's basically done
via the service loading mechanism so
that tells you which class you need to
load it's possible that you have an
implementation of that class both in the
container and in the web application
unusual but not impossible and one of
the things that the spectres clarify in
that case the standard class loading
delegation model applies so by default
it'll load by the web it will go and
load the one from the web application
but you most containers have an option
so you can flip that in which case it
would go and load the one from the
content
instead there are no specification
requirements whatsoever that control the
order in which scis are initiated and
that's one of the problems that needs
fixing particularly if you have
something like so it's implementing some
form of security feature you normally
want that set up and configured first
unit or if it's doing logging you need
to make sure your logging is in place
before you do anything else but there's
no way of controlling ordering at the
minute so that's something that needs
looking at and need some clarification
what you can do in terms of limiting the
time spent during startup with in
web.xml from servlet 3 onwards you can
explicitly define the order that you
want the jars processed for fragments
with an absolute ordering if you do that
only the jars in that list will be
scanned for SC is and only those jars
will be scanned for matches to SC is so
if you know you've got a couple of jars
that don't have an SC is don't have any
any annotations in them that you're
interested in you can exclude them from
the ordering and then hopefully improve
your startup time a little bit but one
of the things that caught caught me out
in the servlet through implementation
that since been fixed metadata complete
has absolutely no impact whatsoever on
sei scanning even if you mark your web
application is metadata complete all of
the SDI scanning all of the handles type
matching still processes still gets
applied so that's the annotation scaling
let's go and look at HTTP upgrade yes
question that
um yeah to be perfectly honest I'm not
exactly sure it was as I can I can sort
of skip around that was saying well that
was a servlet three expert group
decision and I wasn't part of the expert
group in the mailing list on public so I
don't know but I think that really the
the intention was the metadata complete
applied to web fragments and that that's
what it was for the SC I scanning
because it provides things like web
socket or potentially the GSP engine can
be provided via sei scanning you really
don't want a web application to be able
to disable that via metadata complete
that the two were intend always intended
to be separate that's a that does create
a few complications so if you want to
use HTTP upgrade then you have an
interface you need to implement that's
the HTTP upgrade handler and then the
application calls the upgrade method on
the httpservletrequest and then what
happens is essentially nothing at that
point you're nothing will happen until
the response has been generated written
out the committed and everything's been
written out to the client only when that
HTTP request response cycle is completed
does the HTTP upgrade mechanism kick in
and the reason for that is that the HTTP
upgrade mechanism is essentially talking
raw data so you need to ensure that the
request and response are complete
there's no more HTTP bites left on the
wire then you switch to your upgrade
mechanism and it can do whatever writing
it requires and read what it needs to
read the way that what then happens once
the response is finished is the init
method on your upgrade handler gets
cooled and you get passed in something
called a web connection that web
connection is essentially just a wrapper
for the servlet input stream and the
servlet output stream and this is
something I will bang on about several
times in this presentation you only have
access to the input stream in the output
stream you do not have access to the
underlying socket and that place is
quite a few constraints on what you can
and can't do with
so as well as that init method there's
also a destroy method the container will
automatically call the destroy method
when the connection closes so if you've
created any resources as part of this
connection then you can do the necessary
cleanup now the upgrade method on the
httpservletrequest is slightly odd
because you don't pass in an instance of
the HT to get red handler you pass in
the class that implements it and the
reason for that is to allow CDI to get
its grubby little mitts on the class and
inject things into the object that's
created so the continued pass in the
class the container will then create an
object for you and obviously the side
that the implications that is you've got
to have a zero argument constructor
otherwise the container can't create the
object I've mentioned the web connection
you've only got the input the output
stream it also implements or it rather
extends also closable so you can use the
resource semantics with try catch and
automatically close it if you wish one
of the issues with because you've got
that zero argument constructor you can
pretty much guarantee that there's going
to be some extra information that you
need to pass in to that upgrade handler
it might be the identity of any
authenticated user it might be some
information from the associate HTTP
session it could have been some query
parameters that were associated with the
connection that requested the upgrade
whatever it is there's going to be
something that your application is going
to need or probably going to be
something and there's no api defined for
passing that so you've essentially got
to provide your own and it's kind of
obvious you've got two ways to do it you
either have a whole bunch of setters
will you do it in one big method and
tomcat does it in one big method and
passes in all of the things that it
needs to do the web socket upgrade the
reason I've done it that way is that it
lets me call the method pre in it
which then makes it obvious to somebody
that's coming along later that okay this
needs to happen before the init method
because all of those need to be in place
before the init method happens and the
WebSocket connection actually starts
being used because that this tells the
WebSocket connection which end point to
use how its configured which its
container is information from the
request and other bits and pieces as
well moving on then to non-blocking i/o
again it's a deep in servlet 3.1 and it
was added by putting additional methods
on the server input stream and the
servlet outputstream but there are some
constraints as to when you can use
non-blocking i/o you can only use it
with asynchronous processing or with
upgraded connections and once you've
switched a non-blocking i/o you can't
switch back to blocking well there's one
small exception to that if you're using
a sink and first we have to start a sink
then you're on an async request then you
can switch to non-blocking i/o when that
request is either just all that async
context is either dispatched or
completed at that point it automatically
switches back to blocking io because the
async phase is over and at that point
you could potentially if you're doing a
dispatch start a sink again and go onto
non-blocking i/o again if you wanted but
essentially within one once you started
non-blocking i/o within that async
context you can't then just switch back
and forth between blocking i oh and
non-blocking i/o and that causes us a
complication as well with web socket
which will come on to in shortly the
methods that have been added will look
at the input stream first then the
output stream the ankle stream is very
very similar to the input stream there
are three additional methods is finished
basically says has all of the data been
read from this connection so have I read
all of the request body if we're talking
HTTP it is ready is am I able to write
data so I am able to read data from this
input stream and read listener is the
object that actually handles the events
that when when data becomes available to
read and read data you've got on data
available so that's des data there to
read
all data read is again you've reached
the end of the stream there's no more
data here and error obviously
something's gone wrong and hopefully the
exceptional but the thread will rather
will tell you what now there's a
slightly unusual shall we call it way of
doing non-blocking i/o there's a number
of different non-blocking styles in java
already and this is a little bit
different so you start the non-blocking
read by setting the read listener so you
get your input stream and you set the
read listener on on it that's that
that's what puts it into non blocking
mode at that point potentially again
nothing happens until there's data
available to read and that might be
immediately that might be in 30 seconds
time it might be in four hours time once
there's data to read then they can take
container will call on data available
when that happens you can read once and
once only from the input stream doesn't
matter whether you read one bite or a
thousand bytes you can only read once
after that you have to call is ready
again before you do another read and is
ready has to return true otherwise
you're not allowed to read anymore if is
ready turns false then the container
will look after things and it will call
on data available again when there's
more data to read if you don't do that
you will get an illegal state exception
so as I said if it's ready returns to
you can read again and you basically go
through a loop essentially well is ready
at Wally's ready read some data and you
keep going around that loop until is
ready is false and that's essentially
what all of the on data available
methods end up looking like
yet the once you've had that initial on
data available the only time it's going
to get cold again is if you've called is
ready if is ready is returned false and
there's no more data to read so if the
container calls on data available you
read the data and you don't call is
ready nothing's going to happen doesn't
matter if the tcp / buffers are full to
bursting nothing will happen until you
call is ready there you don't get
repeated on data available methods that
subsequent on data available methods
only happen if is ready returns false
and then later once the data they're
available to read so you must follow the
expected cool pan otherwise it all just
falls apart very quickly and finally
once you've reached the end of the
stream then you get the all data read so
for writing it's very very similar so we
can spin through this quite quickly
we've only got two methods here we've
got on right possible and on error there
isn't a all data written method because
you as the application developer
expected to know when you've written all
of the data that you're expecting to
write the container certainly doesn't
know so that's where you don't get that
method there but otherwise the model is
exactly the same you start the
non-blocking right by setting the right
listener they contain all then call on
right possible when it's possible to
write data without blocking and that
would normally happen pretty much
immediately assuming that you haven't
actually written anything previously so
there should be plenty of space in the
buffers but again that's not guaranteed
so the container calls on right possible
you can write once and again once only
you've then got a white call is ready if
Israeli returns true you can write again
if ready returns false you can't and
you've gotta wait for the on right
possible so it's again it's a vet it's
pretty much exactly the same pattern as
reading again you don't follow the rules
you get an illegal state exception so
what does this look like in Tom caps
implementation I've cut out a fair
amount of the boilerplate in some of the
detail what I'm trying to do is just
sort of give you a sense here of what's
happening so the WebSocket read listener
it's on data available method
essentially just calls
data available on tomcat internal
representation of a WebSocket frame and
basically what that will do is it will
read all of the data it can turn it into
a frame and then process that frame
within that there we have got some locks
we ended up needing to be quite careful
about having multiple threads here the
server input streams narrow stream don't
expect multiple threads to be writing to
them at the same time you have to be
normally the sunny day scenario it all
just works it's the edge cases that
catch you out you get an exceptions some
other event fires something ends up
trying to write a closed event to thee
to the output stream while something
else is trying to write to it as well
you need do need to be very careful to
make sure that there is only ever one
thread working with your input stream in
your output stream at any one time so
just to be absolutely sure here we've
got a connection read lock that that
ensures that and then it's just that
well loop I was talking about well is
ready we've also got a check of is open
so if the connection is closed we just
closed the connection we stopped reading
we read the data into the input buffer
if we don't read any data we just give
up if you get end of stream then throw
an exception otherwise we record how
much we've written and then we process
that input butter and that's when we
turn it into WebSocket messages that we
then pass on to the application right
listener is a little bit more
complicated the reason for that is
there's no limit to how much data you
can throw at this in a single right so
if you want to throw five hundred mega
data in a single right at this stream
then that's what it's got to deal with
and obviously that's not all going to go
in the wire in one go so the container
has to buffer it so we've what we can
end up with is a whole series of buffers
and things are a little bit more
complicated if you go through when you
doing this via a sink rather than
upgrade use with with a sink servlets
you've also got all of the standard
servlet buffering that's still in place
and flushing so whilst at the at the
niÃ±o level you're only allowed a single
right that might actually end up looking
like multiple rights further down
stacks you do need to be very careful
with this so we've got multiple buffers
and again it's the world is ready we go
through those buffers we check to see
whether there's any data in them if
there is we try writing it and then
that's our one right so we then skip out
and call is ready if the buffers empty
and we'll check to see whether we've put
all of the buffers if we do you'll
notice this right time out unregister
one of the complications of only having
access to the input stream in the output
stream you have no way whatsoever to set
a time eight so you had there has to be
some that you have to basically build
your own timeout mechanism if you want
to be able to time these things out
through the API there's nothing there at
all to set timeouts and that to me is a
gaping hole that we need to fix instead
of a 3.2 you can't you can't just say oh
oh we'll just set a default time out of
20 seconds three seconds it that doesn't
different applications will need
different sets of timer there isn't one
there isn't a one-size-fits-all so that
needs fixing so there's some additional
work at the bottom there just to either
if we have completed the right we don't
need to worry about timeouts anymore if
we haven't completed it then we need to
make sure that this particular
connection is registered for a timeout
and what that background mechanism does
is basically right you've got whatever
the configured timeout is to finish this
right if you don't finish it we throw an
exception and close the connection yeah
I mentioned thread safety more places
and you can imagine possible to trip up
with this it definitely helps if you
start off writing it with thread safety
in mind but even doing that there are
still a few places I forgot and test
test and test again you just can't test
it enough so we've seen this servlet 3.1
style of non blocking and because we're
implementing web socket and WebSocket
also has non blocking rights the ability
to send messages via non-blocking api's
we actually end up with three different
non-blocking styles there's a servlet
3.11 web sockets has two you can either
do things with futures or with send
handlers
if you look at the client that actually
adds a fourth because the client I opted
to implement that via an asynchronous
socket channel so it was a really really
good match for what we needed to do on
the client side apart from ssl which
i'll come on to in a minute and apart
from yet another form of non locking
style so essentially what we ended up
doing was writing little converter
classes to convert between all of these
so futures are always converted to send
handlers so that was basically half the
non-blocking api done just wrap any
method that you needed a future just
wrap ascend handle with the converter
and you use the send handle one instead
server-side the send handles nmap to
serve that 3.1 we looked at doing that
both ways we could have wrapped a future
with a send handler and then map the
future to the server at 3.1 style but it
was a much cleaner mapping doing it the
other way around so that's why we did it
this way and on the client side send
handlers just match to completion
handler so that's again relatively
simple and now we get to the point where
it got really really complicated really
really quickly but not immediately
obviously which was it added to the fun
should we say the web socket API lets
you send a message via blocking or non
blocking there on there are methods on
the remote end point that let you use
blocking and unblocking depending on
which one you choose you are message I
they get sent locking or it gets sent
non-blocking but the server 3.1 api
doesn't allow you to switch between the
two so there's a little bit of a
disconnect there to start with a bit of
a square peg round hole and as i dug
into this it was definitely square peg
round hole time the only option you've
got is you have to simulate blocking so
that's not too bad this is an extract
from that the tomcat code with a few
bits taken out so when we want to write
a blocking message so our message is an
opcode that tells us what type it is the
message has a payload we can we create a
future to send handler we then call our
non blocking start message code which
that will just go off and start sending
the message we figure out what the time
eight is
and if we've got a timeout we just call
get on our future with the appropriate
time out or if we've got an infinite
time out we just call get and sit back
and wait so look at that that works
problem solved if only first of all
there's no AP again there's no api for
defining the timeout so that was a small
complication and again its container
specific and all of the WebSocket
containers are going to have their own
specific solutions for this again that's
something for WebSocket one point one or
two point oh whatever the next version
gets cooled so when we're doing this
what happens under the hood is that data
whatever data needs to be written is
written to the socket as much as can be
let's assume that there's some data left
over that's buffered the socket is then
registered with the polar for rights
will get a call back from the container
when we're able to write more data to
the socket so when that callback happens
the container automatically just get
says I've still got data in the buffer
so I'll write that data out and you
basically repeat that until the buffers
empty all well and good the block that
in our future to send handler is
implemented with a simple latch so when
you cool get on the future to send
handler it just calls latch or wait and
then that waits for the container to
call the countdown method once it's
written all of the data which wing that
releases the latch and the thread can
carry on doing whatever it is going to
do if you're on an application thread so
somewhere in your application you've
started off a thread you kickoff a
non-blocking you so a kickoff a blocking
right all of this just works and
everything's fine but lots of
applications tend to work on the basis
I've received a message from the client
I process something and then I send
something back to the client in response
to that message not always because
WebSocket is asynchronous and you don't
have to work like that but you often get
a chat application yeah you get a
message in from a client you write the
message back out to all of the other
clients it's very often that gets
something in and I need to do something
in response to it and serve at 3.1 and
all of the early
versions have an unwritten assumption
and that unwritten assumption is that
there is only ever one container thread
working with a socket at any one time no
tom cat has always enforced this with a
lock it solved a whole pile of problems
when we're trying to implement served at
three a sink there are all sorts of
issues with state transitions when you
had dispatch is happening on separate
threads and when you then getting the
complete it was very close to the time
out which one actually happened first
there was there were lots of threading
and concurrency issues as soon as we put
the lock around the socket they all went
away and the implementation got a lot
easier and it passed the tck which was
good um but because we've got this lock
that causes us quite a few problems with
web socket and let me explain why so
let's start with my right hand I've got
an established but idle WebSocket
connection the polar detects that
there's now some data on this connection
and this connection gets passed to a
container thread to process it ok so the
container thread processes it it obtains
the lock for this socket so it can work
with it it reads the data and that data
eventually gets through to the
application code the application then
processes the message they're all well
and good so far and at this point the
application says write what I want to do
is I want to write another message out
to the client and it decides they want
to do it in with a blocking message so
it writes a blocking message all well
and good so far the message is too big
for a single right so it gets partially
written and the remaining data is
buffered again absolutely fine all
working beautifully so far the socket is
then registered with the polar saying
yet I need you to tell me when you can
write so when i can write some more data
to this socket polar says yep fine no
problem so the soft the socket is sat in
the polar and then the polar says yep
the space on the socket for more data
now you can write some data so the polar
then passes that socket off to a second
container thread to handle the you can
they write data event so I've now got
two container threads working with the
socket there's this is where it starts
to go wrong this container thread is now
blocked waiting for the law
Rock to allow it to work with the socket
the problem is the thread that's holding
the lock isn't going anywhere until the
container says I've written all of the
data the thread that says you can write
some more data isn't going anywhere
until the other thread releases the lock
and effectively what you've got there is
a deadlock and the whole thing just
seizes up and the tricky part here is
you only see this if you do the right on
a container thread and if the right is
big enough that you can't write it in a
single right and you have you end up
having to buffer some data so because
how much data there is in the TCP
buffers obviously isn't going to be the
exactly the same on every test run we
had what looked like a hard to reproduce
problem it's you certainly couldn't
guarantee to reproduce it every time um
that made life really difficult
eventually with some help some test
Suites and the autobarn test suite for
web socket is brilliant if you're doing
anything with WebSocket use the autobahn
test suite really really good using that
were able to trace what the problem was
and then ok how are we going to fix this
and we discussed a couple of options
within the expert group and we never
really came to a conclusion one was the
idea of automatic blocking and the idea
there was if you forgot or didn't call
is ready before you did another right
the next right would automatically block
that doesn't actually solve the problem
you end up in the same deadlock
situation and it creates a whole bunch
of other problems and it makes the
non-blocking semantics of the servlet
non-blocking i/o even more difficult to
get your head around so decided no don't
want to go there something else we
discussed as well as long as you're not
doing the right on a container thread
the problem doesn't happen so the trick
is obviously get the right onto a
different thread so you can add say a
start method to web connection it could
take a runnable and that will then do
the right a couple of issues of that it
should work but we didn't test it it's a
little bit clunky and it's not
immediately obvious to application
developers what this start method for
why they need to do it what this how
this deadlock can occur
and trying to get all of that
explanation into a coherent set of texts
in a in either the spec or the Javadoc
and then for people to actually read it
understand it and follow what they
needed to do is pretty unlikely so you'd
end up with all sorts of problems so
really at this point there as well we
could just give up if I could go
directly to the Container API I could
solve this in a jiffy dead easy I think
I've got all sorts of knobs like and
twiddle in the container API to say
whether something's blocking or non
blocking I don't have to worry with any
of this life will becomes a lot easier
but I really wanted this to be um
implementation dependent if I could so
the option I took was given that the
servlet spec doesn't actually say you're
only allowed one thread per socket or
one thread per connection let's bend it
a little bit let's ignore what we really
know they were intending and what we'll
do is we'll let you have two threats /
socket one thread for writing one thread
for reading you can't have two threads
writing into or two threads reading we
can have one doing each now that does
break that implied rule but it is only
implied it happened to be the solution I
tried first it pretty much worked it did
highlight a few currency issues in the
tomcat code it was never written to
behave this way but they weren't that
big and they were fairly easy to fix so
that's the option that we've gone for I
suspect if we get to the point where we
have a a spec defined solution it will
look more like the start runnable on the
on the web connection or we'll do
something like basically if you want all
rights have to be done on a non
container thread all that there'll be
some kind of um fix in the API for it
that I don't think this will be what's
adopted by the service back I could be
wrong but I don't think it will so that
was probably the biggest complicating
factor and took the most amount of time
the next one was generic types I've
heard lots of people say very nasty
things about generics at this conference
how they're the worst possible thing
that's ever been added to Java um I
actually quite like them and they
generally cleaned up the Tomcat code and
generally made it easier to figure out
what was going on and it was we in
converting things to generics we did
find a couple of problems both in tomcat
and in some other Apache stuff so there
are some advantages in terms of type
safety but yeah I do get where people
are coming from and after this well I'm
sort of leaning more towards not liking
them the issue is that the WebSocket
spec lets you define these things called
message message handlers and a message
handler is unsurprisingly something that
handles a message and they've got
generics so when I when I when I tell
the WebSocket container here's my
message handler it then has to look at
the dirt and work out what type it is
because you're only allowed one message
handler for text messages one message
handler for binary messages and one
message handler for control messages so
I have you have to be able to get at the
t work out what it is and then work out
which one of those three messages it
maps to to work out whether you're
actually eight so you can route the
right type of message right handler and
B make sure that the application hasn't
just tried to configure to text handlers
on a single session so now it's not that
difficult to figure out what T is at
runtime and you also you also have to do
the same thing for the encoders and the
decoders because one of the things you
can do is as well as text messages
always strings binary messages of byte
buffers and control messages of byte
buffers as well all these strings can't
remember either one of the two anyway
you can also define these things called
encoders which will map arbitrary
application objects into either a string
or a byte buffer and they use generics
as well so you have to be you have to
work your way through those to figure
out ok I've got an encoder Thor map you
know Apple to text messages and orange
to binary messages so going back to our
message handlers if we've got a class
foo implements message handler whole
string that's not too bad that's fine I
can I can figure out that that's a
string message handler fairly easily if
I then have a class bar that extends foo
I can still work my way up the hierarchy
and
yep that's okay it can get more
complicated so if you've got a extends
be booty and string and bx y xn c so byx
extend c x y and c exit yang at this
point what type of message handlers that
I think it's string isn't it no hold on
message handler whole ex ex ex what yet
string now this is doable providing the
generic information is set at compile
time as long as you explicitly say
eventually somewhere up the inheritance
hierarchy this is a message handle of a
concrete type whatever that type is
there's enough information in the class
files to work your way up the tree map
all of these from one to the other and
figure out what's going on if you create
one of these at runtime and specify the
type no chance at all no got no idea
what method type of message hendra is at
that point the container just gives up
throws an exception and your endpoint
one start if you're interested in the
following games of how to do that it was
a combination of a few hints on the
mailing list a couple of good logs that
then identified and I think a couple of
things from stack over and you pull all
the various bits together and you get
all the bits you need to work your way
up the hierarchy and figure out what
everything is those are the methods you
need and if you rather look at how it's
done look at the get generic type method
in the Tomcats util package don't expect
to get your head around it in 30 seconds
like it's one of those things that
whenever I think I need to bug fix it is
right set set aside a good chunk of
times the first thing I need to do is
figure out how it works again next one
was utf-8 as I said right at the
beginning WebSocket messages are always
utf-8 encoded and I mentioned the
autobahn test suite again big plus one
to the autobahn test suite really really
helpful and a lot of what it tests is
our utf-8 messages decoded correctly and
the short answer is well as
getting a whole bunch of test failures
nothing that I don't think I'm doing
anything wrong and I wasn't the utf-8
decoder in the GRE is broken so having
found a couple of problems I wrote some
test cases that found a few more okay
this is going to be tricky what we're
going to do here well let's get the
right way around right the issues that
you've got at first of all there are
certain biopsy quiz that type bite
sequences that aren't valid they don't
map to real characters they should be
rejected and the GRE doesn't the second
one is the spec says if you get an
invalid sequence and the way utf-8 works
is the first bite I'm amongst the other
things it tells you it tells you how
many bytes there are that make up that
character and say if you've got a 3-bike
character so the first byte tells you a
little bit of the information about the
character and that there are two more
bites there are then rules about what
the allowed values are for the second
bite and there are certain ranges that
aren't acceptable and if you get an
invalid second bite what the spec says
is at that point you throw you the first
two bytes away and you start again
completely fresh with the third bite
what the GRE does is take all three
bites and throw them away and that can
cause issues where the wrong number of
bytes are thrown away if you've
configured your decoder to replace
invalid bikes with a replacement
character you get the wrong number of
replacement characters so multiple
problems now writing your own utf-8
decoder it's not the sort of thing you
can knock out in five minutes it's not
that hard writing your own efficient
utf-8 decoder is a slightly different
exercise and fortunately Apache harmony
might be dead but the code is still in
the repository and it has a perfectly
good so I thought utf-8 decoder
unfortunately it also had some failures
different ones the advantage however
it's apache2 licensed and I can change
it so that's what we've done we've taken
the Harmony Dakota we fix the bugs went
past the autobahn test suite and we've
actually switched that decoder
throughout for all utf-8 decoding in
tomcat
and what that got us was it fixed a
whole bunch of educate educators passing
URLs are also utf-8 encoded so all of
that now works the way that it's meant
to write I did mention was talking about
asynchronous socket channel that ssl was
another complicating factor there it was
a good match in most respects in that it
was non blocking you could pass it an
array of byte buffers in a single right
which was exactly what I needed and that
took away a whole pile of complication
downside there was no ssl support so you
know what you normally do in this
situation will you start guling to see
if somebody's already written it
unfortunately all I could find was a
couple of posts saying so that the
software coder equipment that's going to
be a bit tricky you don't want to do
that do it a different way which really
wasn't what I was hoping to find what I
had to do this n she was right one from
scratch but I was able to take a few
shortcuts first of all we only use a
small number of the methods on the
asynchronous socket channel so we only
need to wrap those in SSL we actually
put a wrap around it that no ops all of
the other methods you just use the ones
that you need and if you've got one
non-blocking i/o ssl implementation it's
not that difficult to port it to another
one and tom cat has a non-blocking i/o
implementation for its HTTP non-blocking
i/o connector so I was able to take a
lot of that code and at least map the
concepts across to make sure I didn't
miss anything really important to get
the ssl implementation so we've now got
a simple ssl refer a synchronous socket
channels so in summary um tomcat has
implemented WebSocket one point Oh folks
that have access to the tck tell me it
passes I haven't got access to it so I
don't know it's implement on top of
server 3.1 it's available Tomcat 8 along
with JSP 2.3 anyell 3.0 there were as
you've seen a number of complications
with using these new server at 3.1
features hopefully you know a little bit
more aware of what they are and when you
use if you need to use them in your
applications then you'll have an idea of
what the vet
appropriate workarounds might be and to
get tomcatting WebSocket implementation
to work directly on top of service I
said we did have to bend the
specification in terms of threads and
sockets hopefully that's something that
we can clarify in the next iteration
generally the way the way that we sort
of handle that sort of clarification in
the past is if the expert group has come
to a decision and put somewhere on the
mailing list yet what we really meant
was dot dot dot there's certainly in
tomcat we tend to just get we take
that's okay yeah that that's effectively
part of the spec and will then go and
follow that and implement it and that's
what the expert group intended that's
what that's what we'll inputs we do
retrospectively make those changes we
don't take the view that well that's
what the expert group rip wrote so
that's what we implement if they say no
we really meant something else then we
take that on board and adjust what we
implemented if you want to look at the
source code it's all in Apaches public
repository svn dashte org repos asf
tomcat shrunk the WebSocket package is
all the patchy tomcat web socket right
that's pretty good for time actually any
any questions at this point death or one
there
the the buffers when we when we do those
non blocking rights essentially what
we've got is each time you do a right if
it doesn't fit we see how much space is
left or how much data is left to right
we just use byte buffers but what we do
is we have a maximum size of that buffer
and then we try and reuse them so if
you've if current mo I think it's 64 K
so if you're trying to write say 300 k
then you'll get one two three four five
of them and you know the first four
before the next one will be about third
full and then when there's another right
because of the way that the server
through server buffering can work you
can end up getting flushes generating
additional rights whilst you're still
doing the previous one and then the
application hasn't done anything it's
just what happens internally and then we
look at how much data trying to write
and then depending on what's most
efficient will either tag another buffer
onto the end of that or put that data
onto the end of an existing not quite
full buffer but yet all of the buffers
are just bind buffers and one of the
performance things that I was worried
about was there's a fair amount of
copying between byte buffers but that
doesn't seem to be where the bottleneck
is the bottleneck save mostly on network
I oh and then after that it's actually
doing the utf-8 encoding and decoding
that's where it's not quite as quick as
I'd like it to be but looking at the
encoders I can't see any obvious places
to make them quite get to be honest
they're pretty efficient already I think
it's just a price you have to pay any
other questions
but what I will say well I'll give you a
chance to think about them if you do oh
so they think of any other questions
then I'm going to be on the pivotal
stand in the exhibition hall all for
most of the rest of today I'm also back
in here at half-past four talking about
web container security there's a panel
discussion on that so obviously you are
all more more than welcome for that if
there aren't any other questions going
once going twice gone then thank you
