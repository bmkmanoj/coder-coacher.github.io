session of dev live I'm your host Javed
Mohammed and I have as my guest today
buddy
I just like this car that's great
reasonably okay who is the CTO of talk
talk box and the senior VP of
engineering and you've got a great
presentation line up implementing the
future correct whatever what a great
title what's it about yeah one of the
big sort of revolutions we're super
interested in and I think it's gonna
have a fundamental impact across the
whole slew of industries is what I call
this confluence of live video with
augmented reality and most people think
of augmented reality is sort of fanciful
and mostly occurring in gaming but
fundamentally I have we believe that
it's one of those sort of market
movements which is going to shape a
whole host of verticals from healthcare
to field services to education mmm-hmm
so we're very excited to talk about some
of our perspectives as a platform
provider in terms of how augmented
reality is going to impact and sort of
fundamentally change a lot of these
digital workflows okay so when I think
of augmented reality it sounds like
something that's way out there right
correct how far how far into the future
are we talking about that's a great
question so this is actually not that
far fetched along and in fact augmented
reality is massively unfolding right now
as we speak and just to give you some
context in terms of numbers the number
of AR enabled mobile endpoints is
estimated to be about 1 billion right
now already already but in 2017 2018
that number is expected to grow to 3.5
billion mobile a are connected endpoints
by 2022 so this is sort of massively
already in flight and underway and so
the revolution is upon us so to speak so
as I mean I don't we've got a lot of
developers here but just as a regular
end-user as a consumer correct how's
this gonna impact our lives I think
that's a really good question right I
think augmented reality is fundamentally
going to change the way in terms of how
we interact with the physical reality
around us
a simple example is going to be in in in
for instance IKEA recently the letter
introduced a product a consumer product
but essentially if you were at home and
you were trying to interior design your
house you could flip open your
smartphone and essentially overlay IKEA
furniture and sort of see how that fits
in your own living room or your own
house and so fundamentally I think as a
consumer this is gonna sort of make
certain experience much more and
interact a much more immersive and much
more seamless purely from a day-to-day
perspect that sounds fascinating because
when you're saying about that it almost
kind of reminds me of the earlier thing
of people wanting to try out clothes and
seeing how that's gonna look on them
because to me it's always a case like
when you go and look at a lot of you
know the the the models are out there
I'm a you know middle-aged guy or even
beyond that you know dark skin whatever
it is so it's like I don't reflect it
but what people you know what how a
clothes may look or so so to me it's a
fascinating thing of how you can
customize whether it be clothing whether
it be kitchen cabinets brings about a
certain degree of hyper personalization
and hyper contextualization previously
not possible great is that the skeptic
within me says this sounds too good to
be true yeah is it no I absolutely not
and I think one of the things which is
sort of driving this revolution so if
you think about it it's what I call a
confluence of very happy factors all
right smartphone and camera technology
is sort of improving by leaps and bounds
which enables a whole bunch of use cases
user not previously possible bandwidth
and connectivity has massively improved
and it continues to improve augmented
reality is being pushed as a first class
citizen across a whole bunch of light
platform providers Apple is doing this
in iOS with a Ark it Google is doing
this in Android with a our core there's
a whole bunch of web frameworks which
are pushing for augmented reality and I
think fundamentally as we see here in
developer week there's a whole bunch of
developer and coding talent and
frameworks
you're also driving this so this this is
this is this is sort of upon us it's
it's not a pipe dream at all okay
well buddy your presentation sounds
really exciting I hope the folks out
there will check it out what time is it
uh it's at 10:00
it's at 10:00 yeah okay all right so
really already finished correct okay so
this is a thing of this is a post review
but the future looks great and I hope I
wish you all the best and you know
please help bring more peace thank you
for having me on thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
