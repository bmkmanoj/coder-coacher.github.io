my first daylight session here
I'm your host Javed Mohammad but I have
as my guest today sebastian national do
i get that kind of right with a java
champion rock star and many other things
ago my so sebastian welcome i am thanks
thanks for coming yeah thanks for having
me here so I know I kind of have an idea
how Java champions await our rock stars
made well I don't know either like its
brother it's kind of like a an idea from
the JavaOne rock star I guess that's
that's why that was called that way but
yeah I'm really happy to be here in
Seoul it's actually my first time in
Korea okay ever and yeah I was very
happy to do this you provide a chance to
look around yet no not really I was just
walking around this kind of business
district of of this venue but it's yeah
I like it it's really interesting to be
you absolutely so you gave the the
keynote this morning
yeah the Oracle code Seoul and he kind
of takeaways from that I know it's a lot
to cover and obviously we can cover your
whole keynote but uh you talked about
CQRS you know just tell us yes just kind
of for those of the folks without a
little bit about it yeah sure so am
secure RS it stands for a command query
responsibility segregation so forget
about that buzzword it's a it's a bad
way of explaining it basically may M
means separating on the right side from
the read side and when you build up your
enterprise application and it's one way
how to build enterprise systems as
opposed to the more well-known way the
corrupt faced approach when you have
some kind of relay relational database
storing your current system of your
application and so on and so forth and
yeah it's a quite of I would I wouldn't
say new approach but it's a fairly
unknown approach for most of the
enterprise developers this is why I am
usually like to start this talk with
explaining the concepts and why
developers should care about that and so
on and so forth and before you get too
much into again just kind of kind of
laying that the the stage so the thing
that we're trying to do here is to build
enterprise application right in
distributed systems right and that's
precisely the point it has to be a
distributed system because one like kind
of takeaway from from that is and there
was also a question from the audience is
like when it makes sense and does it
make more sense as the legacy crud
approach and this is where I wouldn't
exactly say there is nothing legacy in
building em enterprise systems in a
crowd based model so it's just a
different approach and it's one approach
how to tackle and distributed systems
and visually consistent that this solves
is the coherency problem of of databases
or like what's basically yes so the idea
is that um well the old cap theorem
consistency availability and publishing
torian's the problem that you basically
can't scale and be fully consistent at a
time for enterprise systems and that is
exactly what we want to tackle here when
we have distributed systems it's totally
fine with the way we build we typically
build enterprise applications as long as
you don't need to scale but if you need
to scale then you have a problem because
if you have like one single database
instance that is of course consistent
but that doesn't scale right and that's
where we have to think of other
approaches where we introduce eventual
consistency and secure s is one approach
how to build that and then of course is
the question well when it makes sense
right so it of course doesn't always
make sense you have to have this
situation where you are in a distributed
environment and where you need to scale
which does not work with a one single
relational database approach and that is
basically what one tier take away got it
and I know you said one of the questions
came that they were kind of referring to
the
the other system is legacy and user is
not my entry which I so you so so if you
were kind of to do a compare and
contrast what changes oh yeah so
definitely what changes some one key
difference is that you have to have this
distributed world that you are in a
distributed system and you want to build
eventually consistent use cases for that
and then while you're introducing
eventual consistency and you have to
somehow implement this and CQRS is one
model how to build these systems and
it's well totally different to a crud
based model that you're not having one
single database where the current state
is stored rather than a CQRS combines so
called event sourcing approach and
event-driven architectures to combine
well a current state that is calculated
out of atomic events and not one current
state being stored in a database so
you're distributing everything and
you're only communicating by these
events is basically and the idea they
are behind this event driven approach
and yeah that is also the biggest
difference so you are basically having a
lot of individual systems loosely
coupled together and then you can scale
as opposed to the crowd based where it
all boils down to a single database
which is your well bottleneck and if
somebody wants to try out CQRS further
how would they go about doing that um
first of all I would say the most
important thing is that you understand
what's behind it understand the concepts
and how to how to implement that and if
you if you google for seeker s you find
a lot of interesting articles and also
to look into that if you're you more
like like to watch videos I recorded a
video course which is available for free
if you if you go to my blog Sebastian -
Norcom see this one more time see the
link again are the link M Sebastian - -
not calm so bye Sebastian - - murong
right or just
the best in Tennessee yeah thanks a lot
and if you like to watch videos then you
see this this not only shows how to
implement this in Java but also AM the
concepts and ideas behind that which is
I would say one of the most important
things for developers to to get first
rather than just give me the framework
and I'll start that you kind of
understand the ideas and motivations
behind us ok
so it was a great presentation actually
i sat in most of it and one questions
that I had which was I thought very
interesting is most presenters use
PowerPoint and have you chose not to do
use yeah yeah well basically I'm a
programmer and I'm bad of setting up
PowerPoint slides and I'm too lazy and
everything so what I'm doing so normally
I would like to do just live coding and
everything when I do presentations but
this kind of doesn't work with that
approach because I really want to give
the motivations and ideas first to
developers otherwise it's really hard
too hard to get if it's a totally new
concept I would say if you're just doing
live coding this probably wouldn't work
and so I have this approach of using an
editor like them as kind of slides with
just a couple of words on it and yeah
that is my way of using a Hecht whim
which is much more productive for me to
set up slides rather than well thank you
for saving the world from death by
PowerPoint off so Sebastian thank you so
much for dropping by so yeah it's a lot
and check out so I think I hopefully
will get a chance to today art whatever
probably I hope maybe tomorrow to check
it out yeah and thanks for a lot for the
interview thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
