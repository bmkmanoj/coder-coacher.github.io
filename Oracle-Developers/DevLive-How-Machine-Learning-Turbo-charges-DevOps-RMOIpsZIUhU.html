technology Network and I'm here with dr.
Jay Fleischmann how are you I'm fine
thanks Laura good good
it's great to see you so you've been
with in the DevOps
world for quite a while we were just
talking about how it all kind of started
for you at Sun right yeah right so if
this is true then we need to I need to
double check and make sure that he knows
how to count so ready Solaris 2.0
correct 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.5 . 1 for the
ultra extra extra for enterprise
platform ah 2.6 and then we jump to 7
and I know we have 11
that's flowers 11 11 . 1.3 doctoral so
there will be no 12 looks like so it's
11 to 3 maybe the 4.5 there for sure for
sure
well congratulations you really know how
to count so let's talk a minute because
you your job your day-to-day job back in
those that era of laura's you were
writing scripts for you know for you
system administration work and a lot of
the different management with the
platform maybe I wouldn't say what's my
job I've done it as part of my job so my
job wants to take care of large customer
banking customer so banking customers
I'm located in Germany so banking
customers telecom customers insurances
which for example have board at that
time our a 10k sir about the new servers
so which were pretty expensive at that
time and so but so we were everyone took
care of a couple of customers and all
our goal was really to help them to be
successful
to solaris decoys lares the the
application successful and as part of
this job i I like to figure out okay
there are things which you can improve
which you can automate which did make
customers happy my colleagues episode
share the tool with a kind of community
now to nowadays we always say here we
have a community so at that time even at
that time we did shares of stuff and so
it helped to yeah help colleagues all
runs world and customers to make the
deployment of servers much more
efficient we fast forward here and now
this whole new world of DevOps is merged
and you've got a very interesting
perspective on this because you've kind
of been in the center of how this has
evolved it because you've been doing it
yeah myself freshener and
and fingers that I'm really I'm taking
care again of those guys on the ops part
of DevOps so we have to develop us and
like here we are talking here today
about how to even release further
continuous integration so it's
everything here it's about how to code
faster how to code make things much more
easier connect all kind of things but
what we are missing is the second part
of their box
it's ops IT ops it's those are the guys
which other since I started more than
five years ago it's and Microsystems so
those guys it's again like maybe 20
years ago those guys need to be able to
keep up with the pace of depth so it's
now depth is releasing every hour I've
been in a coordinate org in the morning
and I'll talk a they want to release
every hour they want to be able to
listen you build a new version so we
have to think so listen for sure it is
it will not be possible for for IT ops
to keep up with this piece if they
continue with a traditional way like
again like we have done it so you have
all the silo PF here collecting the log
zero
troubleshooting finding issues while
working so this will no longer work so
with with a new depth of content for the
app so and this is a part of the talk
about its that what we need is to to
enable I to ops to to keep up with with
the pace of depth right they need
machine learning um they need machine
learning because machine learning will
enable the up enable them to take human
efforts out of the equation what I mean
with this is that today is really
everything it's if you have issues
troubleshooting there must be one who
knows where the lock pods are knows the
applications he has to fit all the
things together has look into draw a
conclusion to the analytic part and then
it figures out ok that's the error there
also but this is this will no longer
work in in the future world and this
will no longer work in the depth of
concept or the IT ops part will fail a
lot of this methodology is now in the
cloud it's in the Oracle cloud with the
Oracle managed services right yeah
exactly exactly and that's what we can
offer our customers today that is they
don't have to hire data scientists to
use machine learning they can use Oracle
management cloud it's already built in
there so it is capable it's able to
analyze their data and machine learning
it's able to draw the right conclusion
and alert them whenever we figured out
something is not as expected so we are
we are and that's about this that's
that's a heart of machine learning they
are all the data which we are collecting
it gets fully automatically analyzed we
are creating baselines we we understand
the workload that we call it the
seasonality so you have a daily daily
workload and during the night it's less
the weekends you have less so so the
algorithm will learn itself how a system
behaves if all is good
oh man and applying it to DevOps it's
just a perfect pitch isn't it exact
exactly again there is without and this
is for sure without this kind of
algorithm the the idea of spot cannot
merely successful because the EMP they
caviar they can and they cannot be able
they are not able to keep up with they
have to go faster and aesthetical they
have to go faster because they want to
keep up with the speed of death but
that's only possible with automation
that's what it is yeah so all right well
thank you so much for joining us here
today it was a really great fun I'm
Laura Ramsey and this is Oracle code
