of the specification leads for the Java
EE 8 platform my fellow specification
lead bill Shannon is here in the first
row say hello bill so um the purpose of
this talk is to give you an update on
Java EE 8 where we are today and then an
adjustment in focus that we're proposing
to make to address current trends in
cloud and micro services usual
disclaimer what I'm going to be talking
about is either work in progress or work
that we're proposing to do so don't base
financial decisions on what I have to
say I'm gonna start with a brief recap
some background material and then we'll
review our original proposal for Java EE
8 and what we've accomplished so far
I'll turn then to the ways in which
we're proposing to modify these plans to
address recent and emerging trends in
the industry towards cloud and micro
services and finally since this is very
much a big-picture talk I'll conclude
with some pointers as you how you can
learn more about the details of some of
these proposals at other talks here at
JavaOne how you can contribute and then
how you can influence what we're
proposing to do so the road to Java EE 8
of course started with Java EE 7 our
initial goals for Java EE 8 were built
on the success of Java EE 7 focusing on
and building out work we had done in the
areas of HTML 5 and web tier
enhancements ease of development which
has been an ongoing theme with us and
improvements to the Java EE
infrastructure we generated a lot of
excitement with the EE 7 release and
that's seen in the adoption that we've
had there are a host of compatible
application servers they
you can use for the platform you can
develop and deploy to any one of about
20 compatible Java EE 6 + or Java EE 7
compatible application servers there are
hosts of user groups I've listed a small
subset here many have adopted jsr
projects which we really welcome for
their feedback there are hundreds of
publications job opportunities and so on
so let's turn now to where we are with
Java EE 8 today when we started to
formulate our plans for Java EE 8 we had
at this agenda of items we wanted to
build on from EE 7 at the time meant
many many of them along the same lines
and themes but before we launched the ee
8 proposal and before we define any
specific jsr ease
we started with an extensive Community
Survey and we got thousands of
participants in the survey somewhere
over 4,000 participants to the three
parts of the survey and we fed the
results of this into our planning
efforts and the results of the survey
had major influence on the shape of the
jsr proposals for EE 8 when we launched
te 8 about two years ago so I'll be
talking about some of these so these are
the major jsr s that we identified as
part of the plan for EE 8 CDI which
since its inception has played a central
role in providing ease-of-use for the
developer JSONP the JSON processing API
building on the work that we had done in
EE 7 and Jason binding which is a new
jsr which complements JSON processing
with a JSON to object mapping facility
servlet with an ambitious agenda for
HTTP to support jax-rs
for reactive clients server-side events
integration with Jason be a new action
based MVC
a jsr to complement JSF the
component-based MVC framework that we've
had for many years
updates to JMS to continue the trend
towards modernization and simplification
that we began in 87 and updated
management jsr and a new security jsr to
simplify and modernize security in the
platform and then finally being
validation which was just launched in
the last couple of months which we had
anticipated for some time which is again
a new to do GSR so in addition there are
a number of planned smaller updates
maintenance releases to existing j SRS
that are part of the platform and these
maintenance releases we've already done
one of them with common annotations will
be driven by the needs of the major J
SRS at the platform we're not otherwise
planning any other maintenance releases
so I want to look at all these J SRS
what their goals are and where we are
with them as of today so the goals for
CDI were focused around making CDI more
modular and for supporting use of CDI
outside of Java EE containers and this
was in response to strong feedback both
from within the Java EE community and
from the job broader Java community as a
whole this work has entailed the split
of the CDI spec to make clear which
aspects of the CDI spec or core CDI that
is common to both Java SC and Java EE
environments and then those parts that
are specific to use and se for example
the bootstrapping API for bootstrapping
a CDI container in an SC environment and
which parts are specific to Java EE so
in addition to that the CDI expert group
has been addressing a number of requests
for enhancements from the community such
as asynchronous events and observer
ordering and these are both in the
recent
early draft to which the CDI expert
group has just published so Jason
processing was added to the platform in
EE 7 it's obviously a key technology and
is becoming increasingly important for
modern applications not just at the
browser or the data export level for for
these applications that is through rest
or through WebSocket but also at the
data to your level with the emergence of
many no sequel databases that that use
JSON as part of their underlying data
model so the goals for Jason one JSONP
one one were to keep it up to date with
emerging standards
Jason pointer Jason patch and Jason
merge patch to add editing operations
for JSON object and JSON array and
helper classes and methods to utilize
the java SE 8 lambdas and stream
operations and there's a very nice you
can think of it as a query capability
over over JSON documents that was
introduced as part of this what happened
okay back to our regularly scheduled
program okay so Jason P has published an
early draft too
last year but it's essentially completed
all of the agenda items in its jsr
proposal when we did our Community
Survey Jason binding API was one of the
most requested features from that survey
it was the number one requested feature
in that survey so what this does is it
provides a mapping between JSON data and
Java objects so it complements the JSON
processing API and thus closes the gap
in the platform support for Jason
technology to facilitate ease of use
that provides default mappings between
classes and and JSON text and then
customization API so you can customize
this mapping and it gives us a standard
support to handle application JSON media
types for jax-rs so Jason B has been
making great progress it's completed its
public review and it's a very active
expert group so jax-rs rest has become
central not just for the html5 support
but it's becoming increasingly important
for service to service communication for
communication among micro services some
of the areas on the jax-rs agenda
include server-sent events support for a
reactive client api hypermedia
improvements and integration with other
j srs and frameworks in particular CDI
JAXA wrist has not yet released a draft
although the expert group has been very
active but the ri4 jax-rs namely Jersey
is is has been making good progress and
in some ways it's ahead of the spec
because of exploratory work that was
done within Jersey so that our eye
already has implementations for some of
these features including server-sent
events and reactive api's now for those
areas where we haven't yet brought them
into the standard of course what's been
done in Jersey could be considered
preliminary work it doesn't entail that
the end result will be what's in Jersey
today but rather that's of course up to
the expert group the big-ticket item for
servlet for row is support for HTTP 2
which is now a proposed standard from I
ATF and the stated goals of HTTP 2 are
to address the limitations of HTTP 1 1
in particular for performance that is
reducing latency supporting parallelism
without requiring you to have multiple
connections to achieve the parallelism
addressing the head-of-line blocking
issue giving you some facility for
server
push at the same time retaining the
user-visible semantics of the existing
HTTP one-one protocol so in addition to
providing server-side support for HTTP
to the servlet expert group has a task
of figuring out how to best expose
relevant features of this protocol so
that they can be leveraged in the
programming model for example server
push which was which allows the
application to determine the order in
which data is exported to the client and
in fact in the early draft that was
released by the servlet expert group
there is in fact a push builder API that
was done was added in that draft ok JSF
is certainly mature technology it's this
jsr is intended to address smaller scale
features rather than big-ticket items
and it's driven mainly by requests from
the community some of these enhancements
have had been made are better
integration with CDI WebSocket
integrations support for Ajax method
invocation class level beam validation
and support for java SE date/time
support so JSF has completed an early
draft 2 but actually it's addressed much
of its agenda nearly all of its stated
agenda we filed a new jsr for an
action-based model-view-controller
framework so the idea here was to
provide a complement to the JSF
component-based MVC framework so in this
case it's the task of the application to
turn-to-turn the HTTP 2 requests into
actions this isn't intended to be a jsr
out of whole cloth but rather to
leverage existing technologies so for
the model leveraging CDI
being validation and then at the
templating level facelets and jsps so
this jsr has published already a public
review draft GMS - oh did some great
work in terms of simplifying the core
JMS api's and leveraging CDI in its
programming model one of the things that
it didn't address was what we have today
with message driven means and ironically
message driven bean z' were once the
simplicity jb type but by far no longer
so one of the major agenda items for
this expert group was to continue this
work with a simplification and
generalization of message driven beings
in addition there were some smaller
items that the spec lead wanted to
address increased portability between
application servers and better support
for JMS and XA and bad messages so JMS
unfortunately hasn't made much much
progress although it's completed its
early draft and that early draft has the
additional flexible MDBs
the java ee management API this is a 2.0
but it's a rename of the existing old
j2ee management API which is you can
imagine is quite antique at this point
so the idea here was to provide rest
based management api's as a replacement
or rather to supersede the old-style EJB
based api's of the j2ee management jsr
it was intended to be a superset of that
functionality to basically capture all
of the functionality in that earlier jsr
but simplify it and make it rest based
and in addition this jsr had hoped to
include a simple deployment api
unfortunately this jsr really hasn't
gotten off the ground
okay security the security jsr has a
really ambitious agenda the goals were
to simplify and modernize Java EE
security in particular by leveraging CDI
some of the CDI features such as
interceptors some of the proposed
simplifications included api's for
managing users and groups password
aliasing which was an agenda item that
we had tried to introduce in Java e7 and
never really were able to complete API
is for role mapping metadata for
authentication security interceptors
much along the lines of the
transactional interceptors that we had
added in Java EE 7 but a really flexible
way to handle authorization with support
from CDI and then finally the last of
these jsr is being validation which is
the expert group is now up and running
this was filed just a couple of months
ago and its main goals are to leverage
updates to Java SE 8 and address
requests from the community for
additional features and these are some
of the features that the jsr lists as
being relevant to the ee SE 8 agenda
mainly constraints that can be applied
to collection items support for the
date/time api use of optional Java SE
optional repeatable annotations and
other features okay that was a quick
tour of what was originally proposed for
Java EE 8 so where are we today
this orange dot is kind of pie chart is
intended to represent a loose capture of
the status there don't take a picture of
this this is kind of I don't want it
this is a little loosey-goosey because
I'm not too good at these PI figures so
some of them should probably be 5/8
instead of 3/4 them should be 1/4 but
some of our jsr is
have essentially completed the agenda
items that were proposed in their jsr
submissions even though there they may
be at one of the early draft stages or
the public reviews state whereas others
have made considerably less progress so
for example JSONP and and JSF have
essentially completed the goals and
they're in their proposals
Jason B's been making excellent progress
its completed its public review CDI this
probably more accurate is a 5/8 but I
can't do that so whereas some of them
have not yet gotten off the ground such
as management I'm not gonna fault bean
validation because that's a new jsr and
that act that expert group is actually
quite active okay so in the meantime
where are we now well the world is
changing or the world has changed
current trends are a lot different from
when we launched Java EE eight two and a
half years ago so the industry is moving
on there's much more focus on the
ability to deploy applications into the
cloud and when we launched Java EE eight
docker didn't didn't even really exist
so the landscape has changed
considerably and there is also a
definite trend towards microcircuits
architectures where instead of
monolithic apps apps are architected as
highly distributed smaller scale and
reusable services and there's more
emphasis on DevOps so while it's
possible today to run your Java EE
applications and cloud environments Java
EE isn't really focused on supporting
water currently cloud native
microservices style applications so we
think the bottom line is that we really
need to adjust because we want the
future of Java EE to be viable for these
next-generation applications they're
composed and deployed differently in
cloud environments they are more loosely
coupled there
modular they require have somewhat
different needs in terms of scalability
and flexibility composability update
ability and reliability so we need to be
able to evolve smaller scale and
dependent services quickly and consume
cloud services from other applications
ok so how do we address these challenges
ok so I want to talk now about our
proposals and keep in mind that these
are proposals okay this isn't nailed
down at the end of the day the expert
groups are going to have a fair amount
of say here you can have a fair amount
of stay here and I'll give you pointers
at the end of this talk as to how you
can channel your input ok so what we're
proposing is to retarget the java ee
platform to address these shifts and
cloud and microservices architecture and
we think that this can best be done with
a two-fold approach first of all a
relatively constrained adjustment and
focus to Java EE 8 and then for Java EE
9 longer-term more in-depth work
targeted at what you could consider
enhanced support for cloud and micro
services that leverages work that we're
going to be doing in Java EE 8
our intention is to run these two
efforts in parallel so that we can get
started with the longer-term issues and
an areas before we finish Java EE 8 so
tracking what we're doing in Java EE 8
and building upon it in parallel I'm
going to cover the first of these areas
that is the Java EE 8 changes in this
talk and then in the follow-on talk in
this room at 4 o'clock our colleagues
receive more Donnie and Josh door are
going to be talking about proposals for
Java EE 9
okay so our goals are also to provide a
migration path so this isn't a radical
departure it's to provide a migration
path to cloud development and deployment
for our existing Java EE customers and
to provide a migration path to micro
services based architectures for our
applications thus retaining backward
compatibility with Java EE so here's
what we're proposing in terms of
revisions to Java EE 8 there are some
additions and some subtractions to
achieve a focus that we think is more
appropriate to address these emerging
trends our plan is to basically more or
less
tie off jsr s that are almost complete
and in that category I would put JSONP
and JSF Jason B as I said earlier is a
new jsr it's been making great progress
we believe it's essential in this new
environment for servlet it's critical
that we complete the work for HTTP 2
support so that'll continue is the
number one focus of the servlet expert
group rest is obviously a key technology
in cloud and microcell will be
reinvigorating the jax-rs work with a
focus on reactive programming model and
for greater resiliency the addition of a
circuit breaker api within within jax-rs
you can so for security we need to
reorient a bit we believe it's essential
to address requirements for OAuth and
open ID and secret management the agenda
for the security jsr is already
extremely ambitious I think so we may
need to adjust that agenda plus or minus
or to accommodate these new features
within ee8 and areas that perhaps don't
make the security jsr and ee8 will
obviously become candidates for EE 9 we
also need to prioritize in terms of
those areas where we think we need to
cut back or not pursue further so GMS is
a mature technology and while it would
have been really nice to have flexible
GMS MDBs as part of the platform our
current thinking is that our efforts
would be better spent if we looked at
some of the newer forms of eventing and
messaging that are emerging today and
receive and Josh will be talking about
some of that so we're proposing instead
of JMS to one as the inclusion in Java
EE 8 to rollback and include JMS to o
the existing management chase JP eyes
aren't really extensively used and the
management jsr hasn't made any progress
so we're proposing to stop work on
management 204 MVC this is I realize
this may be a little bit controversial
but we think that the new MVC jsr will
be less relevant in this cloud
environment so we're proposing even
though it's made good progress we're
proposing to stop work on the MVC jsr on
the other hand we think that we need to
file some new jsr s in particular for
configuration and this has been an item
that we want it to address for quite
some time and that's now becoming more
urgent and new configuration jsr as part
of Java EE 8 and also a jsr for
healthcheck api's again thinking forward
to service based applications that are
highly decomposed where you need to
worry about the health of the
applications that you're talking to and
the services that you're talking to and
in addition some basic support for
multi-tenancy which we're thinking does
not need to be a separate jsr so this
slide summarizes our rationale for these
proposed changes that cloud apps really
need to rely on remote rest calls so we
need some circuit breaker API to add to
the resiliency in this area and this
will be introduced our proposal is to
introduce this as part of jax-rs perhaps
it can be extended to apply to other
api's as well and then focus on security
with OAuth and open ID which have
emerged as the norm in cloud computing
and secret management which has been on
our agenda for a while
we need to externalize configuration we
need a basic config API some more
sophisticated apps will require support
for multi-tenancy so we'd like to
provide some base level services here
that can be relied on and again for
resiliency health checking in terms of
dropped functionality as I said we're
proposing to stay at JMS - o rather than
advancing to JMS - wine and we think
that cloud MVC will be less relevant for
cloud apps so we think that MVC will not
be so important here and as I said
earlier our current management GSR is
not widely used this is the slide that
Anil showed in his keynote yesterday for
the proposed focus areas for Java EE 8
and Java EE 9 I've highlighted here in
the darker blue those aspects that we're
proposing to address in the context of
Java EE 8 so this will be like the first
phase and
the more advanced aspects are targeted
for Java EE 9 so if we look at some of
these in programming model not
full-blown reactive programming in Java
EE 8 but rather reactive client API in
jax-rs support for HTTP 2 Jason B
lambdas were appropriate and new jsr for
externalized configuration and an api
for addressing for accessing
configuration from potentially multiple
sources basic support for multi-tenancy
circuit breakers and healthcheck api for
resiliency and then a number of
enhancements to security so I want to
look at these briefly in in a little bit
more detail
so for reactive reactive style
programming is more common in
cloud-based environments where the apps
are more distributed and there's
increased latency so you don't want a
synchronous API you want some kind of
callback mechanism where threads are not
going to be blocked we're gonna our
proposal is a migration path to a fuller
reactive programming model in Java EE 9
in Java EE 8 were going to take a few
steps in that direction with reactive
clients in in jax-rs
so the idea with circuit breakers is
they're important to improve resiliency
and fault tolerance in distributed
systems by isolating failures and
preventing those failures from cascading
so they give you a generic way of
dealing with failures in remote
invocations so we want to avoid the
situation where you know developers have
to write extensive boilerplate code to
hinder handle failures and standardize
on a basic circuit breaker API we're
envisioning this as again as a first
step by introducing this in the jax-rs
client API the approaches that I've
listed here are strawman approaches that
our team has has been thinking about
whether programmatic or whether
declarative with some annotation based
approach and then we want of course this
to be configurable and again these are
strawman things that you might want to
configure like the sampling frequency or
the time period or you know what's your
threshold for triggering a circuit
breaker I should mention that jax-rs the
the jersey api the RI for jax-rs has
been experimenting with circuit breakers
it's it's you can use hystrix circuit
breakers with jersey right now
so again like circuit breakers health
checking is needed for resiliency and
there's no standard here you want to be
able to check the health of other
applications of resources servers Micra
services today since there's no standard
you would expect them all to report
health differently and you like more
than just a you know yes there's no
response I mean ideally you'd like some
semantics health status codes for
example or the reason for failures or
you know what about the dependencies of
the service who's healthier checking so
our idea is is to file the jsr with the
rest with a rest-based API and then
relying on JSON for the actual data that
gets passed back we'd want to have some
kind of configurable context path and
notice that circuit breakers for example
could leverage potentially leverage such
a health check API
I talked about this a little bit already
you know our jsr for security is really
ambitious but we think we need to add
support for OAuth and open ID connect to
the agenda
oh office is complex it's hard to use
and it'll be the task of the security
expert group to evaluate how to improve
that how to perhaps introduce simpler
api's that will capture the semantics
dito open ID connect so this may or may
not entail a reorganization of the
already ambitious agenda of the security
expert group so configuration
configuration of an app needs to be
externalized we want to separate the app
from the configuration of the app and we
need an API to deal with multiple
configuration sources to perhaps support
layering and override of these sources
so that you can not only configure an
app but potentially reconfigure an app
as it moves to a different environment
you might have multiple instances of an
app that need to be configured
differently and you may have different
stages of your app where each stage of
the app for example a development stage
of the app versus the production stage
of the app would need to be configured
differently so we want to standardize a
mechanism for configuration define how
you can inject configuration information
into the app itself how you can layer
configuration and how how you can work
with issues immutability so there's been
a fair amount of community effort in
this area you know Apache tamiya Delta
spikes spring config so we need to
leverage what's already been done and
learned in this area and I expect that
our spec lead for the configuration work
will try to bring together
our experts from these various
communities to to help with this effort
and finally multi-tenancy we'd like to
do something simple here I realized that
this might be less obvious than some of
the other areas we've gotten some
feedback already that well this should
probably be optional for those servers
that really want to support
multi-tenancy but the basic idea is to
provide some kind of structure or some
kind of information for those
applications that are more sophisticated
that need Ted and specific routing or
need to be identity to identify who the
incoming tenant is we tried to do some
of this in Java EE 7 we didn't get very
far with it but I think it's time to
revisit those proposals and to see if we
can converge again on something fairly
straightforward that can be leveraged by
these more sophisticated applications
and you'll show this slide in his
keynote these are the Jay SRS that are
part of the Java EE 7 platform if you
look in the platform spec you can find
the long laundry list of api's that are
required pieces of the full Java EE 7
platform in Java EE 7 we enhance some of
these as full J SRS and other cases some
of them were just maintenance releases
and a couple of these technologies were
defined as optional so it's optional for
a platform an application server vendor
to implement some of these API some of
the older ones like Jax RPC Jax are are
optional for the Ender to implement but
they're still part of the platform and
they're still part of the reference
implementation this slide summarizes
what we're planning to do or what we're
proposing to do I should say in Java EE
8 this is our revised proposal so and
apologies to anyone who is colorblind
here the ones in dark blue are existing
jsr s that are being updated in Java EE
eight they're part of the list of main
jsr that I went through in the beginning
so these jsr s are like dot one or two
dot o releases or in the case of sir
little four dot o release down at the
bottom Jason B and security were newly
introduced in the Java EE 8 platform our
intent is to enhance and continue that
work and complete those J SRS security
will also be part of a big part of Java
EE 9 and then configuration and health
check our new jsr s that we are planning
proposing to file as part of the
reinvigorated ee 8 work so this is the
roadmap again if you went to the keynote
you saw the slide before so where we are
today we're gathering feedback and I
will in a minute give you pointers as to
how you can give your feedback
and we want to get those new jsr s off
the ground and then as we go forward
we'd like to complete Java EE 8 by Java
1 next year you know that specs RIT ck
the whole thing complete in parallel we
want to advance work on Java EE 9 have
that work well up and running and have
some kind of EA for Java EE 9 and then I
realized this is quite ambitious but
we'd like to complete a Java EE 9
release within 2 years that's the goal
okay so how can you contribute first of
all take the survey you know we really
want developer input the survey is now
live it asks you basically how you would
view as important or not important some
of the features that we have some of the
api's that we're proposing existing ones
in Java EE 8 and some of the new ones
some of the areas we could address and
longer term items for Java EE 9 so
please go take the survey we'd love to
get as many responses as we did to our
ee 8 survey if you have technical
comments or even political based
constructive comments about some of the
proposals that we're making you know
what should be in what should not be in
in addition to blank fields in the
survey where you can fill in and the
survey you know you can also send
technical comments to the users list for
the platform jsr you can join the JCP
it's free there's a JCP membership drive
that's going on right now in the hacker
garden area in java hub you can join the
JCP JCP now has different contributor
levels so if you don't want to be a full
fledged expert you may not have the time
to be an expert you can register as a
contributor to various expert groups and
be acknowledged that way so go find out
about joining the JCP
the URL here lists the jsr s that are
part of the platform where they live how
you can track their progress so it gives
you access to to the jsr project pages
and adopt the jsr we think adopt the jsr
is another really great program for
channeling feedback you can get together
with other like-minded people or not
like-minded people and disagree and as a
group channel feedback for an expert
group our spec leads really like this
this adopted jsr mechanism because it
gives very constructive feedback ok so
what I'm gonna leave you with here is a
long list of talks where you can learn
some of the details I realized what I've
said has been extremely high-level the
next talk here in this room will do a
deep dive into some of the longer-term
proposals for more advanced platform
work the speakers for this had so much
to say that they've actually split their
talk into two pieces now the second part
of that talk is again I believe it's
here in this room and it's the one
called portable cloud applications with
a Java EE so part one right now and then
part two tomorrow afternoon at this time
and we have a buff tonight I forget
exactly where the buff is whether it's
here in the Hilton but the Java EE for
the cloud buff where you can meet with a
number of the spec leads and again give
feedback on these proposals if you like
them if you don't like them if you have
questions and want understand more
that's a good really low-key way to to
get your questions and answers and so
far as we can give you answers and
that's basically it I'll take any Q&amp;amp;A
and yeah
well we're trying to advertise it as
much as we can here at JavaOne oh sorry
okay the question was what are we doing
to advertise the survey you all can help
advertise the survey where every one of
our speakers on this list should be
advertising the survey because we really
want to get a lot of feedback so you
should see a slide that is the next step
slide and most of the the talks that
you're going to be going to from our
team with the the new proposals how long
is a survey going to be open I would
anticipate several weeks but I don't
have that information that's a great
question yeah okay the short form of
this question is what's happening with
Java and what are we doing about it we
have a team that's currently looking at
how do we deal with this and where are
we moving stuff to and I think it's a
little early for me to say exactly what
those guys are thinking but yes we're
working on this to be quite honest I
wasn't aware of the Jason B move so I
can't really comment on that yeah
Reza's just raised the issue of the
Guardian survey and the micro profile do
survey and yes we've been looking at
both of those so thanks for posting that
the if you go to the let me go back here
if you go to the Java EE spec dot
java.net project and you look at the
mail archives there's an email there
that Reza just posted on the users list
that has the URL for the survey results
so that's the way I go to look at the
survey results you can look at the
survey results to the Guardian survey
they're micro profile do has their
survey results and I forget whether you
need to go to Google Groups or or where
to access those but John who is back
there can tell me how you access the
micro profile that is a survey but you
have them up today where can you see
that on your website
oh I thought you had preliminary results
up at least I had seen something
anyway good a micro profile dot IO and
if he sniff around there you can find
some information is that the feedback
they've gotten let me see if anybody
else has a question before I take you
again is this the only guy asking
questions well okay so I think our ee8
plan is a fairly modest plan which you
know given the goal seems pretty
straightforward and the new jsr is
configure than trying to draw in for
some time the healthcheck jsr is a pre
constrain jsr and then some of the
emphasis has shifted like for what we
want to do with security and a little
bit of what we want to do for jax-rs i
realized that a few of the things that
i've said or that we're proposing might
be a little controversial for example I
heard that there was some controversy
around our proposal not to continue MVC
so we're we want to hear from the
community we want to hear about what
we've proposed which will influence the
outcome but I think for Java e8 you know
this is pretty much the direction we
want to take for Java EE 9 that's
longer-term and there's still you know
there's still a lot of investigation
that needs to be done before we file the
Jay SRS we need to actually address
what's going to be covered in what jsr
with those jsr czar so there's a window
where that still needs to be nailed down
come to the talk that's being given in
the next hour so that you get a feel for
what's being proposed and you can
channel your feed
I think that question is better better
asked to that speck lead yeah it is very
ambitious well I can't really comment on
the resourcing at this point we're still
kind of working out who would be spec
lead for what jsr and how the emphasis
is going to go so it's it's a little
early to do that
I think the ee8 is much more predictable
we have a fairly high degree of
confidence that we can do Java EE 8 in
in a year yeah well okay so over no
raises the issue of profiles over what
we're proposing basically for a e8 and
e9 so of course we already have the web
profile so could we so how are we going
to address the potential issue of
subsetting I assume it could be
subsetting plus super setting for EE 8
and e e9 this is something we've been
discussing internally I think it's
fairly safe to say as to whether whether
or not we should think in terms of a
profile but I think it's really
premature to to get into that at this
point until we get further along and
then
obviously these decisions get influenced
by our expert group so for e9 we have
the whole issue of you know e8 is
building upon SE 8 e e9 builds upon SE 9
there should be no surprise at this
point
se9 is adding modularity how do we
leverage that these are still
longer-term open issues back bro in the
blue I'm sorry but you're so far back I
really couldn't understand your Oh Jake
hash um yeah so we would love to see
Jake ash make progress we had hoped to
bring in Jay cash in EE 7 there's some
integration pieces that needed to be
addressed for it to be part of the
platform if that expert group can get
reinvigorated and do that then I think
that would be a good addition and I
think our expert group our platform
expert group would certainly welcome
that yeah we back sorry the guy way back
to less row
sorry well depends on when they actually
get the work done yeah
insofar as we were thinking you know
jax-rs that's near-term but we'd really
like to have some kind of more
generalized circuit breaker that could
be leveraged elsewhere as well so your
answer short term versus longer term I
think it's kind of both it could I think
once we get into the work within jax-rs
then we'll know better I think that's a
question good question for him actually
there are two of them
Oh recently recently I would try next
week I think you should talk to anneal
yeah
oh sorry I should have left those logos
on when I when I took those slides I
know I Neal had the logos yes we expect
GlassFish to be the reference
implementation yeah those are goals
those are targets yeah well you have to
you have to put stakes in the ground
because otherwise people don't don't see
the urgency but we think there is some
urgency here certainly for ee8 we want
to be aggressive with ee8 Wow okay I
think that's where the java.net
questions some of our some of our expert
groups are already using github for
mirrors of their projects so I think you
know that that can be on the table I
think it's too early to predict that we
would do that but I think that's
certainly a viable option to consider
yeah yeah
well some of these at least for ee8
these are already existing J SRS with
existing jsr agendas in terms of the
ones that we and in fact except for some
additions like to security where we do
expect the expert group to have
considerable input there that's quite an
active expert group even though they
haven't released a draft yet but there's
a lot going on in that expert group so
the expert groups definitely address the
jsr agendas now for the ones that we're
proposing to stop work on I think under
the jcpoa could just simply do that and
i'm looking here at patrick we could
just simply do that but before going
there we want feedback from the
community do you do you folks agree is
you know give us your feedback yeah
I think your questions will be answered
in about an hour if you stay in this
room okay I got two more minutes yeah
until we have another solution I would
expect them to get started on java.net
but that's just me I don't make that
decision yeah
well there are a lot of contributors to
micro profile yo who are historically
also contributors to our expert groups
some of them are former colleagues who
are here in the audience and yeah you
know we certainly expect that
collaboration to continue that they will
continue to provide input to our expert
groups you know some of the the member
companies are leading Jay SRS that are
important Jay SRS for the platform and
those Jay SRS are continuing and we're
folding them into the platform so I
think you know obviously there's a
little bit of disagreement between the
the some of the approaches here but I
think the end goals of you know having a
platform that's viable for micro
services and well targeted for micro
services is the same okay well thanks
everybody
yeah a good discussion and channel your
discussion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
