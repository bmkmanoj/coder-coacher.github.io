for coming it's about layout like a boss
and if you read the the description is
mainly about mid layout or big pane as
it's called here in Java effects I will
also talk general general about layout
in Java effects but not going to any
specific you know really core details
because it's kind of complicated when
you go to the details but this is mostly
how to use it and what's good with
layouts
my name is Mika Greer as it's called in
Sweden Michael is perfectly fine and
also written down tom and he actually
specifically gave me so that I could
butcher his name but I have no idea
there how to say but it's you'd link or
something like that
and he yeah you probably can say it
better than I can and I must warn you
there will be code in this session so
yeah you don't like code you should
probably you know yes take a microchip
or something quickly about the agenda no
that's bright yeah
the whole first section will be about me
then there will be some about the
general layout and make pain philosophy
some simple layouts and then we come to
the interesting part some features
features features that make layout has
and it has a lot of features and I will
not go into every single detail about
those features because then you will say
to me that it's too complicated so I
will just pretend like they don't exist
that's okay with you and there will be
one more thing moment hope that works
yeah so me then it's not that much to
say actually I have opinions about API
sand code in general if you follow me on
Twitter you probably can see that I code
and Twitter a lot and I do it at the
same time and usually when I find
something wrong this is also me I've
done this transition now I have been up
pilot for 17 years in the Swedish Air
Force I've always had a IT consulting
firm on the side but now I have
converted to the fully nerd guy or two
right it's not me at an earlier stage
actually it's it's a mock-up but anyway
so I'm now I'm 150% into the nerd stuff
so general effects things and layout the
layout cycle and I will just do this
briefly and not particularly exactly
about the effects but how it works
because sometimes I'm I know that people
don't know this and it's kind of if I
explain how it is then it's some have
more understanding why things are quite
difficult at times and it's asked them
do and that's what a layout manager does
it's the system ask me or ask the layout
manager what would be your preferred
size or your minimum size or whatever
and and then you ask all your children
that and then the answer comes back up
and then the layout actually does the
layouts in in the second wave of that
sort of thing and that that has a little
problem and especially with when it's a
little more complex layouts that for
instance if you have components that are
have let's say our bias they want to
have an aspect ratio of one to one and
then you have two of these components
that they want this and you have also
the layout that wants this then there's
an unsolvable equation if you understand
and that is something you always fight
with when you do layouts just have that
in mind and then in Java effects we have
a couple of new things and I'm gonna
compare it most it's a swing is it
mostly sway who had done have done swing
before I guess almost everyone so
comparing it to swing a little bit swing
was a little bit short on the features
when it comes to layout so to say FX is
a lot better so it's really nice to have
converted me layout to maintain and for
instance it hasn't we
have bias and bias means that you you
the component or the node can say well I
want to prefer I prefer to you know if
you ask me what my width are first and
then we decide the height or it can say
the other way around that well I give me
a height and I'll say how how wide I
want to be or you can say I don't care
and which most do but for instance text
components they are typically you say
how wide I am and then I'll tell you how
high I want to be or tall or whatever
and then now we also have context and
that means in in the swing days we
didn't have a way actually I think
almost all other toolkits had this that
you can ask a component what would it be
what would be your preferred height if
you were given this width for instance
and this is very important because since
swing didn't have that it was faked so
the components of often used their
current way to know kind of okay I'm
this tall this high if I'm this wide and
that created redundancies and loops in
in in the layout if you weren't careful
and there's also separate width and
height so in swing you couldn't actually
set in a good way the preferred width
and then and still pick up the preferred
height of over button for instance you
you you wanted to say well this button
should be this wide but the height of it
should still be dependent on the font
that was impossible to do in swing if
you set the the preferred size you set
both the we don't the height and that's
a lot better now we also have pains and
not layout managers and this was to
start with I was a little bit know well
that's not as flexible as in swing but
it's actually pretty good and it's not a
limitation at all I think it basically
means that the panel itself is the
layout you cannot set the layout on the
panel as you did in swing now we have
pains and the pain is so big pain is the
MiG layout plus a panel and that can't
it makes sense I think it's not as
flexible but it's easier instead
it also lays out the reference bounced
out is to call them the reference bounce
called lay out bounce I think in JavaFX
terms but it basically in swing you you
had just one bounce and the the
components couldn't even paint outside
that and if you were to to to twist it
in some way the bounce would actually
change here the layout manager we always
lay out the the reference bounce that
the note should not stick within but use
as the reference bounce and so if you
add you know rotation or scaling or so
it doesn't actually change the layout
because the reference bounds are still
there there's also a little
philosophical thing here that that's
maybe it's how I like it
but there is also always the control
versus to layout sizes I think it's
really important to keep that separate
so I never usually set the preferred
width of a note or over control since I
think controls should be in charge of
their own it's its own preferred size it
has a reason for its preferred size
usually it's it's to cover the text
exact way or something and if you start
messing with that you cannot get it back
on unless you reset it so I like it when
when the controls have their own size
that you can ask the preferred size but
you use the layout managers say well
sure you can you might have that
preferred size but in this way out you
should have this preferred size for
instance so we can kind of keep keep it
separate the component or source a
component that's the swing leads to the
node in our control the control has
still got these original values but you
use it in a layout then you can just
take that control to another layout and
you don't have to change it it also has
another advantage and that is you if you
use the layout pane to set the width and
the height or whatever then you have all
the code
that does the layout in the same place
otherwise you usually you create the the
controls in one place and you set the
the preferred size or whatever and then
you have the layout code where you're
added to a pane down here now you have
two different places in the code which
actually produces the layout and that's
not in my opinion a very good thing I
try to keep all my layout things in the
same place in the code we also in in
Java effects have a couple of things
that it's not as I would do them by but
it's it's not a problem but it's just
different ways but you have to stay
clear them a little bit one is the the
max size and that is for instance
buttons have a maximum size set to the
same width as the preferred size do you
recognize this and that that is kind of
can be a problem issue for instance if
you have a row of buttons you all want
them to be the same width so you kind of
you just set them well grow into this
column or whatever and they won't grow
because they have this inherent maximum
size set to to the preferred size so
then you have to change the preferred
sorry the maximum size to you know
integer dot max value or something and
well that's a line of code that goes
somewhere else and you got to separate
the things as I was talking to and we
saw this in MIG pane by disregarding
basically for the normal controls
disregarding the maximum size so we
don't have this problem but it's kind of
a small rape on on Joe effects I guess
Joey X also have this get children dot
add for everything and it doesn't have
constraints so you cannot when you add a
component you cannot say be this with
layout wise like like we did in in in
swing but we add that to the API of MIG
pane so you can do it the old way it
just like in swing you just say add the
button and the constraints we'll look at
that later I also want to float in jf
extra
which is an open-source library which
has a couple of other layout managers
and did they do the same assessment as
we do in MIG layout they they disregard
the maximum size and they add API for
adding as well and they for instance
they have a D box and an H box that
disregards the maximum size and have the
add meta meta methods if you want it a
little bit about the philosophy when we
did make pane and that is if you look at
a GUI and you see and you try to as a
human being say well how do how do we
lay out this GUI then you probably would
would do it like text you say well we
start with this component and then we
have that component and then we'd go to
next row and then we do it and do that
and the next row and so on or if you
have a totally different layout you
might go with this row and then that row
and so on and that's how you think it
and that's how we code it so you
basically just add components say go to
the neck like a typewriter go to the
next row it is in the in the core it is
kind of grid based so it's a grid that
you're building but you can also say to
make layout disregard the grid if you
want and it all adds white whitespace
automatically so if you just add
components we will add the normal white
space in between them and that white
space is actually different on different
platforms so if you run the app on OS 10
it will have a slightly bigger larger
white space than on Windows and it also
adds around the gooood ads the
appropriate amount of pixels it is made
for coding so it does not complete
compete with scene builder
I mean similar is really good at what it
does but sometimes you want to put it in
code I like that because I've kind of it
feels simpler for me to change it all
the time which I do but it's it's made
for coding and if you like scene builder
or you're just creating a fast GUI or
doing some prototyping or or like F
like XML for instance then by all means
you should use scene builder or but
they're not competing it is fast and it
is small it is fairly complex as you
might see later but that's in the course
but I made it quite fast anyway
it is about 80 82 K or something in it
everything if you I think that's for the
FX version the swing version is about
the same and the SWT I think all worst
versions is about the same maybe I
didn't mention this is exists for a lot
of different frameworks QT phantom
Android I use it myself and when I do
when I code Android apps I use MIG
layout them and Griffin has it it is GUI
toolkit independent I read the code is
written in such a way that 90% of it is
about is just math basically has nothing
to do with the GUI toolkit and then I
have a one two interfaces that you
should extend to support it to a new
platform so it's really really easy to
port to a new platform it is resolution
independence independent in in a way you
can specify all sizes in centimeters or
millimeters or inches or dots or will I
have feet or something so um it also
picks up if you have different scaling
on the monitor so you and you can do
that in two different ways so there's a
lot of features around that but if you
do nothing it just write numbers then it
will use logical pixels but I will get
back to that it is platform independent
as well and that with that I mean here
that it picks up what is appropriate for
the platform we will see that with the
button ordering and stuff it is in the
as you patrol at keynote before shutdown
we it is simple to read and that is
important
and it is condemned I mean we have we
are using if you want at least you can
be using the string constraints and they
are very condensed it it's very easy and
fast to do layouts and the close
constraint proximity is is what I was
told
telling you about that I want all the
layout in one chunk of code so to say
not spread it out all the whole
application and it's free bsd so and
this is also in the philosophy and that
is very bright I don't know why looks
very good in my screen can you see the
outlines at all yeah they should be very
gray but they're not so this is at least
when I was coding before I made me glad
this was kind of my normal journey I I
will have requirement X and requirement
Y and I start to make the the GUI and
then I go maybe I use a grid pane and
then although I need to add that but
that doesn't work with the grid pane so
then I go to well I need to anchor pane
and then how are chasing the GUI again
and every time you change the layout
manager it's kind of I have to rewrite
the whole layout code I'm not sure
everyone does this but at least I've
done a couple of times
and and it quite often it ended up in my
pain up over there where I kind of coded
it anyway so this is what I was going
for
with the with MIG pain instead to add
that's just one big chunk of features in
one layout manager so you can move
around inside layout manager which has
basically all these different panes it
has absolutely layout in it it has the
grid of course it has anchors it has a
lot of different features but you never
have to switch you can just you know
rearrange everything within layout all
right some basic usage how do we get it
going this is how we get it going
we create a big pain and then we have
three arguments in the construction
constructor you seldom use this maybe
the first one sometimes but I normally
never use the column and row constraints
anymore because you can just put it on
the components and it will kind of
inherit up we've showed you later but
the layout constraints we should keep
track of because that kind of can be
interesting but normally I would say at
least like 70% of all my layouts I have
a totally empty
constructive there so when we create
after we created the pain you just do
add the button for instance and then we
have a couple of constraints and this is
the API that is new on the MiG pane and
this is not how you added in Java
effects then you would do get children
dot add instead and you would also you
use static methods on MIG pane to add
that constraint which kind of also
separates the logic for Mature and made
it makes the code like this big so when
I first did this I've posted about it on
I think it was Java lob at the time and
everybody was saying well no this does
not compute because you are using
strings and we don't like strings in
Java we want everything to compile so I
I bent bent over and I made an API
version instead so you can also use this
it's a totally different constructor but
if you really like to have everything
compiled time check you can use the
layout LC there is the layout constraint
and you just don't wrap or dot whatever
and you got it it's a good way to learn
the API actually because you can just do
dot and in control space or whatever you
do in your IDE and you can see what you
can do so it's a good way to learn it
it's a little more verbose I try to make
it as little verbose as possible it's
semi builder stuff it actually modifies
the LC all the time so it's not
returning on you which I would do
probably today and then we have the same
thing for the compelling
constraints you can just new CC and not
grow away then and whatever and it
should be so that all features that are
in the in the string version should also
be in the API version if it's not it's a
it's a bug you can file it so let's dig
into the code let's create a simple
layout
I hope my layouts show yeah this looks
ok it's a very simple layout it's the
first name last name and an address
right so first we create the MiG pane no
problem there put an empty constructor
then we add the label and then we add
the text field then we add the label and
now it gets complicated here then we say
gap aren't related didn't have it's
quicker so you can see here that the the
space is a little larger here than here
right and that's because of this when we
add this label here which a gap should
be unrelated
there is related unrelated and paragraph
that those are the main key words you
use for gaps you can also write 10
centimeters or whatever that that works
perfectly or 10 pixels but unrelated is
kind of platform-specific
so that platform if 2 components are not
related it is that size so we're add the
label and then we add that tech text
field and then there's wrap and wrap
means well we wrap to the next line we
add that one and then we add the big
text field here the address text field
now here is a little more complex spam
tree grow X spam free means that well
this is a grid I told you about that
from the beginning so this is a
basically a grid and we have three
components here
this one should spam three components
right so it goes all the way out to the
edge if I were to take away this then it
would just be that big because it would
share the column with that component I'm
sorry with that control so it spans
three components but just because it has
the space to actually span those three
columns doesn't mean that it actually
will do that
it might just that depends on the size
the inherent size of the text field but
if we add grow X then it will actually
grow into the available space this is
not a complete right and then we have
another simple layout again a new pane
we add the UP button we tell it to grow
X I'm going to explain that a little
later we add the item list so first we
have that one and then now we are adding
this one and we got the span Y this time
three components si I will probably
never learn how to say control so we
I'll just say components and you have to
translate it it goes three down right
and then we wrap to the next line which
is here and we add the down button grow
X and we wrap to the next line del the
delete button ever grow X and now about
the grow X because otherwise the buttons
here they would all be different widths
right but we want them to line up nicely
and here we would have the problem if if
they would have their maximum size set
to their preferred size we could have
written ro X as much as you want but
wouldn't work anyway so that now it's
good that we're disregarding the maximum
size there we can also write this exact
GUI in in two different ways or probably
a hundred but I'm gonna show you just
briefly two different ways to write it
the version two of this one is big pain
and then we have the layer
constrained flow why and that means that
instead of the normal go colon by column
and then changed line we go that way so
we go and then we wrap up here get it
easy right so then it would be we will
actually be sure that shorter after that
we would still have the grow X but we
will just had to add this this this and
then this one and span three would work
or we have another version which is just
we use cell reference absolute cell
references so that the up button would
be in cell x y 0 which will be the top
left and it would be one wide and one
high if it's one you can disregard you
could just type 0 0 of course and then
we can just add the other controls the
same way okay now we're into the
features section we have the size this
is the size that is used for components
and it's also used for the if you want
to specify the MiG paint size itself
normally the MiG paint size is kind of
it calculates all its children and then
it sets itself to that size but you can
specify it oops that was not intentional
so but you can specify it like this as
well so for instance we if you would
just write with 100 then it will be 100
pixels wide of course we can write
height 10 centimeters works perfectly
fine should also say that the default
unit you can change the fault unit for
big pain if you want but the default
unit is logical pixels and instead of
using dialogue units or you know what
whatnot we are used the definition of
logical pixels is a normal pixel on a
normal sized or a normal DPI screen but
as soon as you change the DPI of the
screen it kind of
you have that if you have the double
amount of dpi which means that the
pixels are half the size them a hundred
logical pixel would be two hundred real
pixels but you should just use no no
unit and that will work nicely this is a
more complex way to say it or to write
it and that you have a colon in between
and then it's minimum preferred and
maximum size if you just have to like 10
: 20 that's the minimum and preferred
size because it's you usually have
minimum and preferred it's quite seldom
that he use a maximum size at least I'm
not using it that much you can also use
math expressions if you want and you can
do this can be quite elaborate math
expressions if you want you can also use
if you if you have no spaces in the
expression you can just type it like it
is if you want to use spaces then you
have to use parentheses around it then
you can use spaces as well otherwise if
you have a space it will kind of
interpret it as a separate value and you
should not hold down that button and you
can also use Max and mean and a couple
of other arithmetic math things I don't
remember offhand every one of them you
can add an exclamation mark after 100
for instance but here is 100 pixels that
means pixels and then it we're forced
into these will be pixels and not
logical pixels of course if you use an
exclamation mark that means do this for
minimum preferred and maximum so it will
get this component or this layout will
be exactly 100 pixels forced that's a
very short way of saying that you can
also reference there are some reference
values that you can use you can say for
instance height pref exclamation mark
that means it will definitely get it
preferred it's preferred size so big
pain will ask what's your preferred
and it will report that as the minimum
preferred and maximum size so it's a
good way to just force it into the to
that size we also had the constructor
you can you could specify the row and
columns right so it's normal not needed
but sometimes it can be helpful to first
set up the grid in a way and then you
just add the components then it's a lot
easier to add the components the syntax
is it's quite simple it's just it's the
same four rows and columns and it's just
the column constraints you have that in
brackets and then if you want you can
specify a gap between them and then you
have the next column and gap and so on
and it will use the last column and gap
if it's more components than we have
specified columns or rows for this is an
example it's easy 100 logical pixels we
have an unrelated gap 200 a gap of 10
pixels 300 and so on and these are the
same four rows and you can just have
them empty if you want if you just want
to specify the gaps between the rows and
gaps and inserts the they are quite
important to make a good layout or
rather if you the easiest way to see to
recognize a bad layout or someone that
it's not that accustomed to making
layouts is that they always make the
layouts way too cramped that is one
thing that they don't add enough white
space I don't know if that's expensive
or something but but one should always
try to you know make it a little more
Spacey
that that looks better and another thing
is that it's quite common to use
separators and and and borders around
the components and that's because how we
programmers think we kind of well those
are a logical unit so let's put a border
around these and inside that one
there's another logical unit or
components let's do that but instead of
using that just use white space just
increase the white space until crazy but
it looks a lot better so it's important
to be able to control the gaps on the
insects if you add a component and we
saw this in the first slide I think and
on in the first code slide list gap
you just write gap and then the before
gap which means the gap before that
component and then you can also specify
the after the top and the bottom it's
like the padding basically you can just
an example gap 1 centimeters and for
instance centimeters what you're gonna
use that for you say but on if you run
it on a phone for instance it can be
good because you might have the you are
guy that comes in and say well that's
this component should be this size and
then it's he's talking centimeters and
then you don't have to do the math you
just say it well good it should be 1 by
1 centimeters and you're done you can
also say gap unrelated for instance and
then Coulomb push and push Coulomb
pushed us a little special add-on that
you can use and that gap then gets
greedy so it kind of pushes the
components aside you can all there's
also the keywords gap after gap before
gap top gap and gap left and gap right
also also which you can use if you don't
want to kind of write that and just
write nulls instead of writing writing
gap null null null and bottom you can
just write gap bottom and then that one
and before and after is different from
left and right we have to think about
this might be run on you know an
international computer so then it knows
what's right and left and so on
sometimes you may want something on the
Left otherwise you usually just put it
put it the way it should be and then you
change the layout and picks up that
picks that up automatically
we have wrapped gaps as well so when you
wrap to the next line if you you should
have just use the the related size but
quite often you want to use two
unrelated or the paragraph paragraph is
a little bigger
sized white space which is appropriate
for the platform wrap on the related
wrap 20 the push worked there as well
then we have in sets which is basically
it is the white space around your whole
GUI
and that is usually by default it the in
sets are set to panel and panel means
the white space that is appropriate for
a normal pattern panel on the platform
we also have you can specify incest 20
sorry 2 centimeters means that there
will be a space of 2 centimeters all
around and well yeah I think you
understand that and we also have the
dialogue in sets dialog that means it's
a normal is a little bigger space that
you have around your outermost panel in
in a in a window and especially on the
Mac is quite quite big on the windows I
think it's not that big of a difference
but there is a difference and on the Mac
it's also a little smaller space at the
top than around the sides and at the
bottom we have the docking layout or the
docking keywords in mingle layout is
very easy to understand it's dependent
that the what is it called in FX is
called border pane right but border pane
and those same the same inswing it is
always the topmost and the bottom most
and then you have the left and there the
west and east and they go in between the
top and bottom just like this one and
these all always overlap inside but in
MIG layout instead we use so that
depends in in what order we add the
component the controls so here and that
it cuts off that part of the panel so to
say
so if we say doc South that p1 will cut
off the the the south part of it
dah quest for the two and then we cut
that one off doc North it will talk cut
but remaining part off and it continues
like that it will just slice it off so
that way we can exactly say how we want
the docking layout to work it is a
little bit more flexible but in the
other on the other hand it depends in
what order you add your controls and the
docking layout is really good when
you're doing the outmost layout in your
app it's usually you have a panel on
left or or on the right and then you
have a some kind of status field on on
the south edge or something I also have
the the field keyword here which means
that the layout should feel the whole
parent otherwise it might be a little
might not feel feel it depending on this
one we also have absolute layout
sometimes you want to control exactly
where a component should be it might
relate to the edges which anchor layout
in effects does or it might you might
want to place it in an ABS like 100
times 1 100 by 100 pixels down or you
might want to place this component just
next to the white space around the panel
and it's really easy you just write
pause X&amp;amp;Y and then you might also want
to specify it specify the X 2 which
means the the right side of the
component and you can specify both X and
X Y and then the control will be exactly
that that size but you can also just
specify for instance X 2 to the right
size of the control then the left size
will be just you know the preferred size
so if you want to place it to the right
and then it just grow out to the patrol
size the same way with this one we just
added at zero bones error so it's top
left
see - here we add it there's another
unit it's called al it means a line and
point five a line is center line
it's that easy and and as you can see al
is aligned to the right space as well
not to the actual edge of the panel
because the Y here is zero al which
means as high up as possible I'm
actually not going to go into that you
can we can take this one instead we
create a new me lay out with position
that you use percentage that's another
unit we position it at 30 times 30 by 30
percent it's the big one
so it's this and then we give it an ID
big like that that means that we can
position the other components around it
relative to its lair to its bounds so if
we position it we do not specify this is
the c1 so it's that control so we
position it we don't specify X we say
that Y should be the same as Big Y and
paid out why it should be that right so
it has the same Y and then we go down
and the x2 should be the same as x2 so
they are lying there and we don't
specify the left side so it's preferred
size and it's the same thing here I
think you can understand quite easily
how its absolute that the other ones the
other components are positioned relative
to the big one here so that just jump
over that one another feature we have is
the button ordering and at least I can I
can never remember what what order I run
both OS 10 and I run Windows sometimes
when I have to so and you probably know
this but okay and council for instance
they are on different places on on OS 10
and on
windows so would me glad we do this we
have this automatic way we try no grid
haired doesn't have anything actually to
do with with the button order but it's
just a new keyword and no grid means
that we don't want a grid in the layout
at all is it it's in the layout
constraints up up here and that means
that you can see the components aren't
aligned by by the columns anymore they
are still aligned in in rows though
and why I have this here is that in
order for me glad to be able to
reposition or or reorder the buttons
they need to be in the same cell that's
why so then we just add label and the
text field and we wrap a wrap paragraph
here which means there's it's a little
bigger white space we add the Help
button and we tag it that's how you tell
make layout that you want reordering we
tag it with help to there's help and
help too I didn't know what to call it
but didn't some platforms have help on
either the right side or the left side
and and if it's helped it's on the right
side if it has a right side otherwise it
the left are you you understand probably
what I mean and then we had the okay
button and we tag it with okay and we
have the tag it would cancel we also
have I think it's previous/next finish
some custom one two and three and and
whatnot which usually ends up somewhere
here in the middle you have to look it
up and what what happens if when you run
this on on Windows it have it looks like
this and on if you run it on OS 10 that
ok and cancel with switch places so you
don't have to bother you don't have to
care about it then we have some growing
in shrinking shrinking and now we're
gonna go to get into the demo or one of
them it is a little bit complex it's not
complex maybe to understand but it's you
can do a lot with it
it applies the components in the same
cell and it applies to rows and columns
it posts both how we shrink and grow
components when space are scarce or too
much and also the rows and columns the
syntax is really easy there is two
things things bow and and I've seen
sometimes if you try to bake this into
one key word and that's quite hard but
there's a grow priority and there's a
grow weight and the priority is so that
everyone with higher priority they grow
or shrink first without touching any
other other lower priorities but within
the same priority it is the weight that
kind of you can say this has more weight
than it shrinks faster this will get
apparent when they do the demo it's the
same thing with shrink it works exactly
the same way grow prior this is for
adding a component grow priority X 200
100 is the default that you get if you
don't put any priority on it and then
grow X and you can also do the same for
rows or for columns so it's some action
let me see
can you see this alright so here we have
a normal just four components or four
controls based drink the same way here
we have different priority 1 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp;
when we try to to shrink this one we see
that you saw that the first the higher
priority shrink first before the other
ones even start to Frank here we have
175 15 25 this is not the priority this
is the weight so then we see that see
what I'm doing there right and then we
can of course do a combination here we
have shrink priority 2 &amp;amp; 1 and then
different shrink weights
it'll be like that kerosene
miscellaneous features I will just go
through this all a little quick way we
have the hide mode what happens to
invisible components this is also a
benefit of having one layout manager
because there's a lot of features that
goes for all layout managers and you
have to re-implement and in every layout
manager if not so how for instance do we
have for hide modes where hard mode 0 is
the normal maybe if you hide a control
it still takes up the exact same place
just gets hidden and on the other hand
we have hide mode 3 means that if you
hide that one it will completely
disappear from from the layout and then
we have intermediate modes where it just
shrink to 0 but it still has the the
gaps around it the pane sizes as I told
before you can override the paints
calculated size just know that you can
do that that's good for instance when
you want to open a dialog you can say
that it should be at least 300 pixels
but at most 20% of the screen and you
can do that in an expression that just
looks like that SP means screen
percentage by the way we can giving
nodes the same size so you just add them
to the same size group so now you have
if you add two nodes then it will will
make pane will just use the bigger of
the sizes of the two so they will always
be the same size and you can do the same
for 4 columns here so the first two
column is grid columns will be the same
size as 2 column 2 and 3 they're zero
based the bugging layouts non-intrusive
after a while you see the well what is
this grid doing actually and then we
just add a keyword debug and it goes in
on the discourage of JavaFX and that it
paints the layout and the blue part here
is the actual bounds that the control
will get and the red is the grid size
so it's really easy to understand why
did that component end up there how many
for instance if you are spanning here
then this red would be one big red
square we also have split of course you
can split cells you can skip over cells
when you do the layout we can out the
size the window I'll if there's time at
them about it then we if you change the
size of the layout then the window will
automatically resize we have visual anti
padding not gonna go into that but it's
cool
we have right-to-left on bottom to top
layout so you can just change it will
pick it pick it up from where it's run
actually but you can force it as well
for trial for testing and we have last
minute resize called padding that you
can if you cannot get that last pixel
right you cannot just say well the right
edge should be one pixel to the right
and that's always the last resort
fix if you want it we have callbacks I
will show you a quick demo that later so
does it hurt your head okay we've got a
new feature I'm not done with it because
I hit a little snag and it's very sexy
its animation yeah why should we use
animation it's just a cool gimmick right
I will show you why
it's more fun back in you know the
earlier days of Java 1 then you always
had always had to say switch to the demo
machine please and it took a while and
they didn't hear it and you have to say
it again stand waiting let's run this
the animation demo it is really simple
this demo this is all the code there is
we run it and it's a really cool
application right so what's it doing
yeah yeah it is
yeah right it is actually doing three
different things either it's adding a
rectangle or it's removing a rectangle
or it's adding one at the top or
removing one at the top but let's change
this it was kind of hard to follow right
what it was doing
you can if you really concentrate you
can kind of oh it added one there I
would remove that one so let me let me
change this and I will do some live
coding here I will make this better you
X Y u XY z-- so I will mate like that
and we run it
so now it's quite easy to see what it's
doing right it's doing exactly the same
thing as as it would do them before it's
not doing anything meaningful so don't
try to you know pick it apart but this
is what you're gonna use animation for
and that is to keep the user in the loop
that is all is done for animation is not
at all for doing you know fancy smashes
stuff it's do its to keep the user what
I press that one and it went over there
okay I understand good keep it keep the
user in the loop and big layout you just
add animate and it animates all the
transitions and you can see it's fading
away and there's a lot to it more more
than you actually think I think I will
so first the UX bits I am very much I
work with UX a lot and what about
animation because it's quite easy to get
it wrong
first thing animate to keep the user in
the loop that's the whole reason
specially when you have this new flat
design is very important it was a little
bit easier when you had this cue more
physically what is it called something
like that design but it was easy to see
where everything went now we have on
Android the the material design and
everything is flat then you have to
animate stuff and that's harder than you
think
do it quickly
do it fast usually if you're not used to
animation or us or are a designer then
do it check how long this looks good
this looks good and then you cut that
duration in half that is probably better
2 to 400 milliseconds your eye blinks at
100 to 400 milliseconds you shall have
between 100 and 150 unless you are a
little bit tired after dinner so 2 to
400 millisecond and it depends a little
bit on what you're doing
I had 400 milliseconds in that graphics
I had just Emir ago avoid linear
movement linear movement serves no real
purpose you usually accelerate and then
you decelerate that is the fastest way
to do something and and the user can
still follow it if you show them
seldom-used you seldom move like like
this you accelerate and then you
decelerate unless you're gonna move on a
really big different distance crazy
quick that's a valid test always try
your animation by crazy clicking on off
on off and you see it's quite often that
then the the animation doesn't work
because you store an animation going to
the left and then when you click it
again you start another animation going
to the right but but now these are
competing and it doesn't look very well
what me mink pain helps you with but you
just add the animate is that it it's
more it has a more natural accelerate
and decelerate JavaFX has the ease in
and ease out but it's just 20% is in and
20% is out and so it kind of moves like
this it's the fast acceleration then
it's linear and then it's a fast
deceleration and if you have like 200
milliseconds you will never see the ease
in and ease out it copies it to a
temporary image because if you remove a
component or a control then you can
actually you cannot you cannot fade that
away because it's removed right so what
Meghalaya does is when you want it when
you say that you want to remove a
control it copies that very quickly to
an image it takes a couple of
milliseconds at most and then it phase
that one away and it does that we dad
and it can do it with pain movement as
well if you want to depends on what's
faster it is different in interpolators
for add and remove if you have for
instance something you have two
components and you remove this one and
the other one should you know swallow
that space then you you you want it this
one that's gonna be removed you want it
to start away really quickly and you
want this one to to to not be so quick
because you don't want them to overlap
you want this one to be kind of gone
before this one grows into that space
and and if when you're adding instead
this one should go back it should start
really quickly and this one should not
be so quick to start and I don't like it
to actually wait to do one or the other
so I use in ease in Sinise out the
accelerate and decelerate instead it
looks better and it's it's survives the
crazy clicking a lot better you know
also change the Z order for added
removes no added and remove nodes again
with the example here if you're gonna
remove this one you fade it away but and
you the other one components grows in
over its place but you faded away but
this one is still showing on
for that one that doesn't look good at
all so when when what we do is that the
copy that I put in place I add that at
the high at the lowest index in the
children's observable list so it will
get painted behind everything else I
hope
JavaFX someday will get so that we can
specify the see order but now it's just
depending on where in the collection it
is and its handles the crazy clicking
automatically which means that it kind
of removes and stops the timer's you
know in a good way so that's it I think
we're on time just a little slight pour
it's actually me sitting in there sorry
now that's not a big way we are a
sweetie square are the good guys the mix
are the ones we're trying to shoot down
now that's a it's a Swedish aircraft
called a Griffin Griffin is it means
great Griffin actually yeah so it's
obvious so MIG layout is short for my
name me category ever that's it any
questions still got two minutes
go ahead
now so the question is is there any
pitfall gone pitfalls going from using
swing me cry out to MIG pain and I hope
it's not Tom did the initial conversion
to Java effects and then there was a
couple of teachers missing so III wanted
to use it myself I do use it myself my
new application so that's why I went in
there and added those as well it it
isn't as mature of course and it is now
also the latest versions are Java FX 8
only so that might be a gotcha but I
think everybody's jumping on the Java FX
8 bandwagon anyway so we kind of did it
anyway now when I do a lambda so that's
a good reason as well so it shouldn't be
and if it is I have a zero bad policy so
I just yeah I know it's theoretical but
if there's a bug fallout I will fix it
I'm yeah that's the way it is I read all
my Twitter things as well that I have in
my feed probably some letter combination
I have yeah yes I think we can I don't
use FX ml myself
I don't like XML in general I heard
people do though but nobody says it but
Tom actually has made it work that way I
think and it should work with CSS as
well but I'm not I haven't done anything
on that myself but it check out with the
table bare not and he can tell you all
about it
anything else
so the question is how good is it to
actually make one centimeter one
centimeter right well it cannot do
anything more than actually trying to
interpret the values it gets from from
JavaFX there's a bug I know now that
kind of it's a problem and on Mac it has
been a problem because they have been
using the wrong DPI for a long time and
there is they suddenly in I think it was
Java 6 or something I'm not sure if or
Java 6 so if it was ten point something
but they went from 72 to 96 as the
default but nothing else changed so I
haven't and if it's that this then that
so I try to compensate for that but then
again I use always use the latest
version of and I usually use Mac so
unless you tell me about it I can't fix
it but but we can't do more basically
than than the platform that's us but but
usually I have tried you know I've
measured it a couple of times and it's
usually a couple of percent wrong at
maximum and you can also set it yourself
so you can't set a factor on it I
believe so if it's really important to
you you can kind of have your own
database or your own factor that fixes
it yeah anything else
you know what this time
so the question is what was the most
challenging to do the swing version or
the JavaFX version I think it is the
JavaFX version was more challenging to
do but only because I was just new at
JavaFX as well when I did the swing
version I'd been programmed in swing for
five years so I kinda was into that
ecosystem already I knew a lot of swings
so and but I mean Joe FX is 10 times
better at least in many different ways
sure if you have followed me on Twitter
you can find out that is that it's not
always perfect but it's a lot better
than swing yep so the question is any
ideas by adding support for singular I'm
not sure I can do that but someone
probably can I haven't looked into it
I hope they actually will will add real
solid support for custom components
first and then maybe for custom layout
managers or layout paints if I can do
some something to help maybe I don't
know there are a couple of IDs I'm not
sure I don't remember but that use that
is a drag and drop that works with MIG
layout it's it exactly window biller
they they have that and they have it for
a couple of other layout managers as
well it's kind of hard to make a GUI
thing for me layout since it has such a
vast amount of features of course but
you could just base it around I have
been thinking about a lot of times just
basing it around the absolute layout
part and can we use a constraint just
those constraints but that's just in
here right now would be fun
anything else
yeah the sounds like a good time to quit
