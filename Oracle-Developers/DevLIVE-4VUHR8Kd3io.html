do you write anything for Brusco Oh on
your phone okay okay cool thank you
Thanks so welcome to Oracle deadlines we
are at JavaOne this year so my name is
Shalon Fayed and I work for Oracle
technology Network and my guest today is
karima rafes key from write burned on
the ARCA team thank you thank you for
having me yeah I correct soccer team
three years or so at light bent now and
ever invited on the day job I also
participated in very active streams
initiative so that's what we're gonna
talk about today mostly and also wrote a
book recently for Riley called why
reactive okay that's kind of a book four
tries to explain and disambiguate the
term reactive because people are kind of
new to it a bit confused by it and being
alka having years of experience with it
we kind of disambiguated some of the
terms for so it's a free book from a
writer you can just download it it's
like a 15 pages or so so pretty small
condensed info kind of guide so the book
itself the way reactive book is
specifically about reactive so it's not
about akka we didn't want to kind of be
it the technology pitch and it's also
not just about streams but what comes
after because now so reactive streams
that ended up be
in JDK now and JDK 9 a few weeks ago
like when when it got public and now the
thing is what people will be new to it
and kind of confused and maybe only
seeing the first word reactive and
assuming ok that's the end of a story
whereas reactive and streams that's kind
of one part of it but there's much more
to reactive to us elasticity and
building elastic scalable systems and
streaming is one part of it but not the
entire story so that's what the book is
about you telling me that akka is
actually what is right so Sokka we call
it a toolkit to try to we try not to be
a framework we are very you can pick and
choose specific parts of akka and let's
say you want to do clustering so we only
pick for clustering stuff you don't need
to have the screaming or if you want for
streaming things when you only pick the
screaming things you don't need for
clustering things so we were more of a
pick and choose toolkit for building
distributed and concurrent applications
on the JVM so it was a scholar API and
the Java API both of them are equal and
basically feature parity is always
complete etcetera exactly so because
directive streams vision is this
initiative and this API that we've been
working on for the last three years or
so and without being included in JDK 9
obviously we wanted to support and be
compatible with JDK now and as soon as
it came out so we managed to have a
stable release last Friday just to do
final checks on the actual stable
release of JDK 9 and yeah now we're
fully compatible with JDK 9 including
the new Java util concurrent
api's which are exactly reactive streams
so it was basically pulled in
under a different name so the module
system I mean I yeah so we're currently
not module arised excellent we're just
running on the ADK nine without four
modules but that's definitely what we
will have to look into and it kind of
fits as well because we have naturally
kind of structured the project into
these modules like I said this big this
big that we just have to do that for
work actually so that's not done
currently it's compatible on API so I
mentioned and yeah that it doesn't blow
up because as a concurrency toolkit we
were using a lot of kind of unsafe and
kind of now blocked api's so we had to
rewrite some of also interested in
feedback from people if it's very
interesting or kind of where to put it
in the roadmap if we should jump on it
right away or if people are slower to
adopt it anyway
so we'll see that's that's definitely in
the roadmap not quite sure where exactly
now right yes because it's really a it
works across so can you elaborate a
little bit like what kind of tools can
we use with account oh yeah so basically
we do a number of things we have our own
kind of binary high-performance
messaging protocol we can easily do
around a million messages per second
between two nodes using actual network
that's like 100 bite-sized messages and
easily a million offers so that's one
part that needs I got to be kind of on
both sides of the communication because
it's our custom preparatory or
really prepared or it's just costing
protocol and based on UDP and when we
also have an HTTP server that implements
HTTP 2 already so even if you are still
on JDK 8 but you already want HTTP two
things we can give you that and of
course with JDK 9 verse over HTTP queue
client so it's also something we were
very excited about so there's these two
things and also in process messaging
where we easily do like tens of millions
of messages between two components so
it's also very popular that people don't
really need to go distributed because in
a single node it's it's already fast
enough today if it was a talk by
DreamWorks
were they were initially a bit worried
that very infrastructure they couldn't
quite go clustered with akka yet some
limitations in very infrastructure so we
were worried yeah will it be enough and
vanveen benchmarked and it was like
hundreds of times fast and fast enough
so even just the local abstractions so
we call them actors very very powerful
the streaming as well actually so it's
also a streaming local abstraction and
maybe let's let's talk about yeah so
with with reactive streams we kind of
was kind of kick-started by yeah so
that's a very good question especially
because the word reactive is now just
slapped onto everything is like a
reactive database reactive chair
everything is reactive so reactive
streams is specifically kind of a
versatile specification and versity ck
so I wrote 40 sec ever and if you want
to clang but you're a reactive streams
implementation well then you have to
pass with ezk so it's very black and
white if are you are an implementation
of it or you're not
so people can't just go around and claim
they are reactive streams without having
passed for thing and what it
specifically aims to address is
something we've seen in the past with
our Co like I said okay super fast in
process forty million per second but by
the end of the day you need to interact
with some other system be its legacy
system are just some someone else's
system or some some database is
something and what our customers would
then get into it's okay if they rewrote
their system using our reactive
technology and that's fast it's just
killing all of the other systems in the
company because overloading firm and
basically not the other systems not
being able to cope with the rate of
producing data this new system so this
is where we kind of started reactive
streams were it's aiming to solve a
synchronous because obviously we need to
be a synchronous and back pressure to
streaming so when we say back pressure
we mean that not faster than the other
side can actually consume the data so
like I said when we had these people
built a POS using akka and then
overloading our systems well that's bad
for akka right I mean okay great but
it's fast but it's killing our systems
so it's not good so this is why reactive
streams is both kind of vendor agnostic
when we did that it's creative commons
zero we invited a spring peeper we
invited Red Hat people we invited Oracle
people to work on it all together so
it's vendor agnostic everybody
implements the same thing which is which
was and still it's the only way this
could actually achieve the goal of
integrating multiple systems in a way
that none of them overload each other
and now in JDK 9 it's in Java servers
even less reason to be kind of afraid of
it but it's a thing on the side will it
be there in five years or not if it's in
Java you know it's going to be there you
know you're not kind of locked in by by
some I don't know akka people's
technology it's you can migrate away if
you want
so anything else so where can people
find more information oh yeah that's a
good question so directive streams for
the website service reactive streams not
org it kind of explains for what and why
and it also contains ver specification
and Vitesse ek however that's more of a
if you want to be adventurous and kind
of try it out to implement such a thing
but it's not really intended for people
to be randomly implementing the
specification it's more like if you're a
framework if you're Eric's Java for
example or agava implements it reacts or
implements it vertex implements it ARCA
implements it so if the big guys
implemented when you're kind of you just
want to know what they implemented and
when things would work so it's more
about getting the idea what it is so the
website is good and obviously since it's
now in Java you can just check Javadoc
of java concurrent flow
it also contains most of the routes and
what things are allowed and obviously
when implementations so ours would be
our streams just Google for our customs
and other implementations where they
mentioned they all function exactly the
same way slight differences in API sand
and style depending what what what
library made what trade-offs thank you
so much thank you so much for the
presentation
kind of about that topic to explain it
in depth so it's on first day I believe
around one is Kony West
I forgot which room but you can find it
online if you just Google for reactive
streams first thing okay cool well thank
you so much thank you very much taking
the time and explaining the echo thank
you
Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
