it's red means my trouble
Laura
do I need to do on periscope and YouTube
recommend just do it
yeah
I'm Melissa thorn with the Oracle
developer community here at open world
2017 and I'm sitting with Jeff Smith
dibbley did we talk about your sessions
or your hands-on labs we're both so play
I'm Jeff Smith I'm a product manager
here on the database team and we
specialize in developer tools Oracle
sequel developer which has about 5
million users worldwide data modeling
technology and Oracle West data services
which is what we're going to talk about
I'm calm I'm a consulting member of
technical stuff with a in the database
tools group and I lead the development
of Oracle res data services hands-on
labs about this week do you have
multiple right and they're all sold out
we have the same lab that we're running
at three days this week and it's about
integrating Oracle rest data services
with Oracle jet so it's how you can
create a REST API using Oracle rest data
services and then layer a web-based UI
on top of it using Oracle jet yeah lots
of acronyms yeah so what that really
means is all of this awesome data that
your company has compiled is being kept
in our awesome database and you want to
make that available to customers
partners
anyone who has interest in that data and
we have this other awesome technology
Oracle jet which gives a really rich
framework for building a JavaScript
webpages or applications and the way
that data gets out of the database to
this jet tech stack is a REST API and
column will tell you why REST API is are
taking over the world they have taken
over the world and so you know in the
early two-thousands it would have all
been soap and XML and people found that
quite difficult to work with and around
2006 people started experimenting with
REST API Yahoo and people like that
Flickr and they kind of popularized the
idea of REST API is where you're just
using the native abilities that are in
the hyper HTTP protocol to more easily
interact with web services and people
found a lot more intuitive a lot easier
to understand
and it kind of took off from there and
it you know started in the consumer
space but has moved into the enterprise
now so you know if you're a business and
you're trying to share data with other
vendors or whatever they're gonna expect
you to have a REST API they're not going
to want a soap API and so Oracle res
data services lets you create REST API
is over your database data very easily
if your experience database developer
you'll have no trouble at all creating
REST API it's really quickly and we've
done a lot of work in Oracle to make
sure we have standards for all of our
REST API is across all of our different
text stacks and that they should all be
fairly similar because of that oracle
jet is able to work with our product
with almost no effort at all and so are
all of your lab slow that or is there
still room if someone wants to register
there may still be room for our last lab
tomorrow morning at 11:30 but it was
sold out today and we have to turn
people away so if you want to go you got
a you gotta both man see ya the happy
news is in for those folks that for some
reason could not make it to Oracle
OpenWorld I feel bad sorry
so the labs are available for download
on the oracle develop which used to be
known as the Oracle technology Network
which is now known as the Oracle
developer community
it's a VirtualBox appliance it has the
entire tech stack there it has the
database
it has oracle rest data services and it
has the developer tools that we provide
to allow you to write and publish these
restful services which were which is
sequel developer basically so you
download this file installed on your
laptop press the start button
you've got the database you can have
application Express there so you can
build a web application as well as you
like but the lab that we're running here
in the room where you can do with all
your friends and get some help from us
you can just as easily do it from the
comfort

popular yeah
easiest way to get there is go to
