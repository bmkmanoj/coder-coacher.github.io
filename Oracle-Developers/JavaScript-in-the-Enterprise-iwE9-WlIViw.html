love standing in front of crowds at
javaone whose surf here for the first
time I mean a Java one this year okay
that's cool second time more than four
what was still who's been here for every
java one before I know at least one or
two persons that actually made that
happen yeah I hope you like it as much
as I do I'm here to talk about an
interesting topic you've seen that using
that my my name next to my company
outside on the slides and then the
content schedule is still my former
company the msg systems which east which
still is a big eyes V in Germany with
around 5k employees I guess we used to
do all kinds of individual integrations
and projects in large corporates so I've
been a principal working my way through
big accounts and helping them designing
software and making the right decisions
for ya 33 letter cooperates in Germany
let's say automotive OEMs for example
there's probably only one left so I
thought I come up with everything I need
it for talking to other architects about
what to do with that fancy javascript
thing this is probably the last talked
for a while that I'm going to to talk
about JavaScript because I now work for
red hat as a developer advocate should
focus on integration technologies we're
not talking about integration
technologies today so don't be worried
and scared let's see what do we have
whenever I I'm a Java boy right so I
hate JavaScript for a living don't get
me wrong and I'm not going to pitch it
to you very hard today but you know that
all the script kiddies out there are
actually using it and that even some
very serious people think about building
applications on it and they did that so
it can't be that wrong but looking at it
from a very corporate perspective you
always end up with that isn't that a toy
isn't that the stuff that runs in the
browser let's be serious let's do java
ee kind of things the right application
server clusters we have a business to
run we can play around the JavaScript so
and that's probably why that picture
appeared out there in the internet make
me laugh a lot because it's seriously
it's what the is JavaScript right
yeah what and why I mean there's a bunch
of scripting languages out there
javascript happens to be one of the very
popular ones lately and review is
working for large corporates who has to
deal with blueprint kind of things and
platform decisions and that okay and the
rest of you were you doing smaller
companies fancy stuff who's working with
no Jas JavaScript experience in general
oh whoa and we hate it do we seriously
okay so um when I hit lot large
corporates with the java ee background
um made platform decisions for oracle
IBM or whomever even rad hat so and they
approached me and asked me what do we do
with that what's javascript and where do
we put it into it so and I typically
start by trying to explain why
javascript is cool ish which is hard for
me right okay if you look at that
language field in general like scripting
languages you can see that you can come
up with some cat
relations and talk about the different
approaches to scripting languages I mean
that starts with bash scripts right so
it's all that kind of things that mix up
in a big ball nobody knows a lot about
the biggest things that really make a
difference in a very short walk through
so we have Java which is pretty static
and we have JavaScript which is kind of
dynamic so we have no real tool support
this is the the biggest thing I hit back
in the days the landscape changes a bit
javascript is the pre new some ideas are
upcoming who's using web storms from
JetBrains which is pretty pretty much
the only solid solution as of today to
use if you really want to handle
javascript without all that fanciness
that it that it gives and besides static
and dynamic typing as as a
differentiator between Java and
JavaScript you also have that week
versus strong typing approach so it
doesn't that look wrong it does to me
but yeah I'll leave you alone with that
so there's a bunch of the pointers in
there and I guess if you really what
really want to learn about javascript
which most of you definitely don't have
to then you can catch up on that part
that was the beginner intro part what
cooperates care about they care about
stable technologies they want to have
support for stuff that they're using and
they're looking at nasty stuff like
quality and performance so the next
thing after the differences in the
programming languages I always had to
talk about quality and performance
drawbacks of JavaScript what do we have
the pro side is it's a scripting
language I've started out with a lamp
stack with PHP and even further back in
my days I program pearl and that kind of
things it is just fancy you can use it
you can get done without taking
care for it and that's probably the
biggest drawback if you're not using the
right tools to handle JavaScript then
you end up with nothing real high
quality and good working with I bet that
at least 10 of you have seen xjs project
the early ones where we all started to
learn our first steps into that new
approach and I've seen a project in my
former company that was just
unmaintained anymore fancy stuff runtime
performance for scripting languages
where does the jvm do they gathered
forty percent more speed coming all the
way down from jdk five to jdk 7 or 8 I
guess so they've been constantly
improving what the JVM as a runtime does
with the compiled stuff in inside the
running inside it so it gets optimized
and gets more performance though more
often methods are called so runtime
optimizations scripting stuff like Ruby
do you know the startup times of JRuby
or Ruby in general it's just there it's
an interpreter but if you call that
often and frequently and start it up
often frequently then you see definitely
a difference in performance and some
people came up with some benchmarks
about the individual computing times and
cycle times for different scripting
languages and compiled languages or just
in time interpreted languages and if you
look at the results then you pretty much
see that
the more aesthetically compile the
languages the faster it can execute and
that's there's definitely a difference
in here that you need to keep in mind
things tend to get better over time but
still what I've seen so far I mean we've
been computing stuff for insurances like
in not really big data but having many
cycles and having to execute stuff on on
top of Records quite a lot and you can
you can measure that difference between
a compiled language and a scripted
language which sums up two hours and if
you have to run batch kind of things
good luck but what the hell is this guy
doing I mean seriously I've never wanted
to look at javascript but I get asked a
lot about it and so I thought I'll look
out for the good features let's say why
the is fancy you might have seen
the rat monk analysis they did on the
github repositories out there and the
programming languages that are popular
its top right it's top notch somebody
has to really love that and okay let's
assume I think it's cool if you want to
play around with it try to approach it
open mind Lee you get a chance to try
something differently here and that is
good and it's definitely fun to do so
okay we agreed we're going to try it
jumping over over our comfort zones and
dropping out there how do we combine
Java and JavaScript I mean just
generally speaking I want my java still
there I just want parts in JavaScript
let's start easy you have that three
different approaches as of today you
could actually cross compile things like
in what GWT does the other way around
you program in Java and the output is a
UI with HTML and JavaScript and stuff
like that that works pretty good there
are some different approaches for other
other scripting languages but yeah that
works then you can go the bean scripting
framework way of things we'll look into
that a little bit more detailed and then
we have thankfully another JS r who took
care for integrating scripting languages
in the JVM itself so these are basically
three ways you could go
just a short example for compiled stuff
yeah I mean going from a pretty simple
script d like one liner to a compile
java class that definitely needs some
dependencies in the runtime environment
is hard and we can all imagine that
debugging that isn't really fun so if
you could on that path be pretty short
to pick it for a reason I mean you might
have some very very rare features that
you want to reuse like in those little
one-liners what could be one of those
things let's think about validation
logic if you have client side validation
logic that you might want to reuse on
the server side that might be an
approach to do it just cross compile it
and see how to integrate it most easily
I've not seen that in the wild a lot so
at least not in the enterprise's I've
been working for but at least I think
it's a good way of great way to try it
you find some special script engines
that use the same JS r that JavaScript
integrations use this is groovy groovy
example just to give you a little bit of
a feel what it looks like it's basically
the same instantiating an engine passing
all the script into it binding variables
and executing what's in there and then
you get a result
the bean scripting framework is a little
bit more than just cross compiling it's
actually a complete environment where it
could execute your scripts very very
equally to what the script engine
interface allows you the code still is
kind kind of unreadable I mean I always
have that issues with bindings and it
just doesn't look good for me but you
pass in some JavaScript bind some
variables and then you invoke something
and get an answer the way today might be
the j's are two to three we had Rhino
for a while as the only scripting engine
up to Java one not six or 6 or whatever
and it has a separate package you can
actually see what's going on here okay I
messed up the slides I make sure to
correct them the other we look into in
Toronto and NASA aren't in a bit so I
don't want to Nico do you have a session
later on about that when's your avatar
session okay so make sure to check by of
the Avatar session off of Nico 1130
where Hilton golden gate for another
thing we're looking into later just to
be complete the service load of approach
is something that you could also try to
that it's not well documented and not
really broadly used um I just try to be
complete here for whatever reason if you
look at the the compliance scripting
engines but you could just use from a
JVM perspective we we are the Jays are
two to three then it's quite a bunch of
stuff so it's not only JavaScript Python
groovy whatever so it might be the best
way to handle it to use that approach
and I did that effectively since Java 17
java SE 7 a new animal came up which was
called Nass horn have you ever played
with Nassau before who's running java 7
already java 8 it's yeah it's pretty
cooperate right so we tend to just use
the latest version that's stable and
upgrade people go ahead upgrade we can't
just keep all the shops on java 6 that's
not working anymore NASA is the new
JavaScript implementation on the JVM so
the changes introduced with a z7 like
invoke dynamic the new byte code
instruction actually made that happen
and Nassau an evolved us kind of a
proof-of-concept project internally to
see if the new byte code instructions
really work and they are constantly
improving it and making it better in
terms of performance runtime performance
obviously is the key and I guess its
first bundled version was with with java
SE eight so it not completely replaces
the former engine rhino and you can use
it with every sdk download that you can
have it is definitely faster than right
now let's talk about more secure that's
more kind of a marketing thing i guess
if you know the guy who's implementing
it it was really really sharp Marcus
lagergren if you see a talk from him
make sure that you'll drop by there and
say hello the number one thing that you
really get from NASA horn actually is
you have a very smooth integration with
Java so
from the javascript classes that you run
on rhino you can directly access java
objects so you don't have to bridge you
don't have to pass parameters from left
to right you can just use what's there
and that's pretty unique compared to
other engine javascript engine
implementations there's a link down
there to the documentation how does that
look like it's pre straightforward so
you can just use it and use Java
functions the most interesting part here
is definitely that nurse or niz is here
to stay so Oracle itself uses it for new
products that are going to launch you
might have heard about avatar I am I
told you about the session from eco so
um this is definitely one thing that
takes advantage of rhino and whenever
Oracle tries to build a product on some
kind of platform thing and we are pretty
sure it's going to stay and that's good
like it is give give it a try there's
plenty of documentation out there and
it's constantly growing there's some
other unique advantages like a command
line version of it so you could just
pass on your javascript in the command
line and get the answer compare ibly
easy to debug so far so good not much
much magic but as i said i've been i've
been in the ee world before and java and
javascript integration is one thing can
we just put that into the EE world and
be happy or what do we do here this is a
random drawing on random wall
trying to explain somebody where
javascript fits in the game mostly in
the cooperates it just burns down to
that so and what you see here is exactly
that web architectures change over time
a lot and we do java ee stuff mostly
with a web-based front end who's doing
mobile programming a lot okay what
front-end technologies do you guys use
generally JS off raise your hands okay
two to three plain HTML and JSP pages
still okay GSP jquery ok so this single
page up approach restful services okay
fair enough and the rest what did I miss
GWT nobody seriously whew okay
interesting I mean that that's what
looked like right so you have all the
presentation somewhere you have a bunch
of JavaScript on the client is it is a
good story we have bigger teams in my
former company and we're running kind of
a 40-person project and we built a bunch
of teams and one of them was the graphic
and front-end team it's a story from a
few years back but they've been the
magic guards with all the great
creativity and feel and an idea about
what makes things look good and they
been in charge of implementing
JavaScript and we've been starting to
experiment with Ajax and all the first
as increments communication stuff I can
tell you it was a complete mess those
guys on the front end definitely didn't
know what the guys on the back end were
doing and vice versa and they definitely
had some complete different kind of
language so they weren't
able to talk and I can't count the hours
back in the days that we spend trying to
bring that to complete different
professions together to make a great and
good looking thing things became easier
especially with the restful services
today but still if you have a team that
completely focuses on you I then you
probably have some communication issues
true for bigger companies but what what
did we do I mean nothing right we put
everything in a Java EE server and we've
been happy what was next single notes
multi-page application kind of things so
a bunch of everything you just start to
split your logic I mean you have that
growing JavaScript capabilities and
frameworks like jQuery like xjs you name
them and you think hey I want to give
some real early feedback to the user if
he enters a number and a character only
filled then he should get immediate
response right so and that's where the
web team started to implement logic on
the client the worst thing that ever
happened and that was exactly when we
started to try to reuse those validation
bits and clients on the server side for
the first time that was all around two
thousand six already I guess so quite a
while since then it didn't work out
pretty well honestly that yeah we
learned our lessons what do we do today
we have single page applications right
so that's what we all have we stopped
shifting logic to the server we just
took the Opera opposite direction we put
all the logic that we have into the
client and we just have a dump
integration server like restful services
nobody really needs any UI technologies
anymore what's jay's off before if i
have javascript and a fancy client
framework right so
you don't need a java ee server for that
kind of settings right you would be
happy with a tomcat running some restful
services you don't need all that fancy
transaction management anymore so
customers really ran a bunch of restful
services on the biggest java ee clusters
that they had to offer to just serve
some really nice single page two escaped
applications and that didn't work pretty
well for various reasons that's what we
found out doing that kind of things I
mean at the end of the day if you're
using complete different technologies
like validation JavaScript and
server-side jpa bean validation
approaches then you definitely have no
reuse there are some fancy individual
projects which try to resolve that kind
of problems so look at arai for example
if you ever want to have a good approach
there look at them but still you end up
with a mess if you don't take care of
every single thing that pops up here
makes kill we talked about that
dublicate implementations and the
general communication overhead it was
just yeah it wasn't fun for quite a
while any gas what big corporations
decided on doing about integrating
JavaScript into their java ee based
platforms any idea single words it's
actually the note Jas bridge so having
most of the applications in the client
already and having all the validations
there the next natural step is to just
extend that to the server side to really
have the single stack developer again so
you don't want to have people who
implement Java and JavaScript and no
both
you want to have specialists in their
field on JavaScript so and using note
jazz on the server side is is a decent
solution here and that's the wrote many
bigger corporations actually are going
which kind of denotes Java EE it's just
an random ERP system and honestly there
isn't much java ee needed when we talk
about some really basic cooperate things
like HR systems SI p based or stuff like
that so all you need for your
applications is a restful front end and
a bunch of a bunch of erp systems that
you want to integrate so no jazz is the
obvious solution oh okay yeah that's why
I basically explained so it's denoted to
to a random thing and that's probably
the first step into the direction of
microservices like everybody is talking
about that today all right so you don't
need that real big service anymore you
just fire up a bunch of Nettie instances
or whatever you have at hand and provide
some standardized front ends to your
complete javascript-based clients and
server applications okay I scared you
enough I guess let's see how things are
going to evolve this is my personal
pitch by the way so no red had no other
company in here what's definitely going
going to happen is that we need that
full stack approach I definitely want to
want to make sure that I've not that
much dublicate code in my applications
if I already have stuff implemented in
JavaScript I would just want to reuse it
on the server side however it looks like
so if you're bound to Java EE and the
JVM then that's my personal idea of
using rhino and pushing JavaScript
features that you are using down to the
server side Oracle tried that and then
my they made real huge thing out of
effort all last year then we've not
heard a bit about it anymore unto
recently 30 days ago they started
committing again on it it's kind of a
node.js port to the server this is a
brief outdated overview oracle announced
some really new directions for our tour
what were they doing they I mean this
thing like it was presented last year
ran on glassfish server it was basically
an extension framework on the server
side for Java EE and that doesn't really
fit well for various reasons not only
the different programming models but
also the different runtime environments
no Jay as compared to java ee so they
are basically going to rip out the Java
EE parts out of avatar and base it on on
the single JVM version so go to nico's
talk if you want to learn more I'm I'm
very very reserved when it comes to that
approach avatar is open source I guess
it's Apache licensed no it's in this CD
dl and GPL to write so you can look at
it you can try to use it I've not seen a
single company using it that's pretty
new and I guess the glass officially has
been a blocker for many people what is
red hat doing when it comes to this kind
of things we recently announced a new
acquisition which will be feed Henry
which is offering for mobile
applications and those guys run their
services on node J us so and this is a
this is a random architecture picture to
just give you a brief idea
the future might look like so all you're
left with is a complete decent
integration layer you have mobile
enablement of your back-end systems like
exposing all kinds of interfaces that
modern clients can consume and you have
some push notification elements like web
sockets XXL aero gear different projects
that really add to the mix here and I
personally think that even if I love
jelly II will see a lot less of it and
bottom line is definitely that Java and
JavaScript go together even if they
don't have anything in common there are
bunch of solutions my personal
recommendation here is to just whatever
you do keep the solution clean like in
don't spread JavaScript all over your
projects make sure to find the decent
use cases where you really want to use
it if you'd like to i'd hear you page on
end or if you have questions just fire
it will because that basically was my
presentation today for you yeah go ahead
speak up
okay which cases I would recommend
JavaScript rather than groovy right so
basically I've no recommendation as i
said i'm not really the script guy i was
more looking at it from the integration
perspective into java and java ee so i
have no recommendation seriously non
yeah
the question was if x JS got better over
time okay oh yes definitely um I still
personally don't like their programming
model but um that's another thing I
guess we did insane applications with
xjs and its scales massively you've done
right so yeah there's nothing wrong with
that guys it could be hell yeah like
many things you don't know about so but
yes yeah interested in your thoughts my
own personal feeling is that the
javascript is like a runtime engine note
if they're the rows up the more plugins
exception what I want to do is stop him
from writing JavaScript and Michael so
we're going to even earlier in the slide
you go back to job as being that night
like we said there's a JavaScript sorry
when you're developing JavaScript that
any little change to said you call how
to play Sora
and the drilling in jobs but it's so
weak yeah I want my team to stop using
javascript but I can't deny the Java
scripts in the ecosystem i'm looking at
gwc i'm looking at times see this
anywhere it's not job so the question is
if I have any idea how to stop people
from implementing JavaScript right I got
that fair enough I completely agree with
you I mean I know that good programmers
can handle it and I know how many people
that really are into JavaScript that
care for what they doing and as far as I
know they judge about web storms IDE and
the solutions in the ecosystem that are
there when it comes to testing and
integration testing they judge
differently so they can handle it and I
wouldn't generally stop anybody from
doing it it's I couldn't judge if it's
just a trend but I definitely agree that
single stack development is an advantage
in larger teams so I probably not play
around a lot with 40 people and trying
to spread in some JavaScript there so
just make a definition set the
circumstances and everything will be ok
now I'm not not really recommending go
back to java and stop everything else
what i really recommend is look at what
are you doing with it and find the find
the rolling updated way right so pick a
few things that might work and extend
that if you're not massively betting on
JavaScript like using node.js on the
server side so there's no question at
all anymore but integrating it with
large corporations and let's say
conservative enterprises you might be
safe for another five to ten years
anyway so just might my two thoughts
here
thanks a lot guys I'll be around Taylor
Street and over 21 enjoy your time here
was a pleasure to talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
