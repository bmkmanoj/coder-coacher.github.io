well welcome to dev live at Oracle
OpenWorld 2017 we're on what is this day
3 something rather it's Tuesday
there's Sunday and then there's Monday
yeah so this makes today day 3 what
about Saturday when we had all the
students in that's right Sunday okay
that was Saturday that was Saturday
that's what I said Saturday so anyway
it's Tuesday Wow great start I'd like to
thank you for joining me today
Thank You Laura baby this later the
afternoon next time tell me tell me what
is new with Apex so this year at open
world this year we're talking about apex
5.2 which is the release we're working
on and we've got some exciting new
features coming up we make what well
I'll tell you you know obviously we
utilize odds or Oracle risk data
services to talk between the browser and
the database and they've been putting in
some really cool features that we're now
starting to utilize to be able to use
remote databases so rather than having
to use a database link you can actually
just use odds and their ad hoc query
capabilities to run queries directly
across another database which is really
cool and then we're also being able to
utilize Oracle rest data services as a
source for our reports and charts and
and calendars etc which is really
opening up applications Express to
really work well with other data sources
which is very important so you can use
Oracle recitative services as your
integration layer or both oh yeah I
connected yeah the best way to phrase it
is you've got a remote data source you
want to build some reports on it and you
want to build them in Apex now you can
very quickly and easily and you know
we're making it so that we can work
before we used to be very database
centric you know basically everything
you did was on the local database and
now we're saying well we don't care if
it's this database another Oracle
database or another data source
altogether you can just as easily build
those same reports and and charts and
what-have-you using our new capabilities
cool very cool all right so say we have
we're bringing on a whole new population
of developers we've got a developer
community as building very quickly
around microservices chatbots JavaScript
of course so a lot of them are thinking
you know they they don't think about
building their application in the
database they're thinking about building
it on the database jewel so what do you
say to these folks when you say wouldn't
you rather build that once in the
database so I mean one of the key things
is that you know the we're considered
database centric so we live inside the
database and the primary skill set you
need is sequel MPL sequel for building
complex applications for building your
first applications it's all
drag-and-drop so it's very low code and
it makes it very low barrier for entry
and that's what I think it's very
important for small and medium
businesses that have got antiquated
business processes using spreadsheets
that sort of thing that you know it's
not just the realm of the professional
developer people that are used to doing
Excel macros or been playing with access
and building out little systems can get
into your application express very
quickly and easily and start building
out solutions that works for them today
but also can expand out because of the
fact we're inside the database you know
you might have 100 users now it might
expand out to 100,000 users it's still
the same application in it will just
scale as you require we've got all our
cloud services which make it very cheap
to get into it so you can sign up for X
data Express cloud service it's about
170 a month spend more on coffee
yes I know I think we should have had an
extra coffee this morning before we
started baby we're not going to go back
to that but don't you start with the
next day to Express and in fact with
Larry's new little announcement of the
universal credit then they can also be
applied to X data Express cloud service
which means that customers aren't just
saying oh we want this it's we want to
use this much computing power and they
can use it on any of our cloud services
and certainly being able to use a tool
like application Express on that cloud
service makes it very quick and easy for
these customers to take something and
make a really good business process and
be able to get ahead of their
competition I mean these days it's all
about being able to move very quickly
because that's how markets change right
and you've got to be able to respond and
that's what we're all about is being
able to build very quickly very easily
and with cloud services very cheaply
right you know what what comes to mind
for me is that when you've got somebody
in your line of business and then trêpa
Delana jur yep you know project manager
and they're thinking boy I would really
like to be able to run this report and
just do this automatically and I you
know and you know the bottom line is
guess what you probably already have an
Oracle database running in your
organization oh yeah yeah there's a lot
of that that goes on there you know it's
interesting when we go and talk to big
organizations and over here you know
this business units using a lot of Apex
this business unit has no idea of what
apex even is and you know we've been
around since 2004 so it's not as I worry
you know a young spring chicken in the
industry exactly but you know not that
we're all old you know insofar as we're
dated and everything else because we
continually refresh our platform
underneath because it's metadata based
we can do things like take out our
charting engine and we put in the jet
charting engine which is you know part
of Oracle jet the javascript extension
toolkit and that is just sort of the
sort of things that we do with as new
features
available then we can just undo what was
there and put in the new one and the
applications just keep working and now
you can make changes to the UI above or
to the infrastructure below and the
application keeps running because it
keeps running and running isn't that
just like the Energizer Bunny but it's
not one of the biggest pet peeves for
application developers is oh great I get
to rewrite my application right we can
take an application that was built in
2004 with version 1.5 and we can install
that into 5.1 which is our latest
production release and it will run how
many platforms can say that story true
story that is really cool and you know
that makes sense for it a lot of these
use cases where you have a data set that
is I don't want to call it lethargic but
let's just say stable oh you mean they
haven't had enough coffee or that you
know like a long term like the list of
nails that you have you know in your
machining factory that's that's not
something that's going to change no I
know it's pretty stable yeah I'll get
that that's right that's probably just
David Pete calling me hold on let's take
that call hello I'm doing an interview
right now yeah she's busy okay I'll call
you back bye for now okay so I bet this
is slightly bad TV so no the subject
being that you know your your catalogue
hasn't changed in many years but your
units or interface let's hope that it
has changed over the years
well the other thing is that business is
changing now you go back ten years and
primarily you're building purely
internal systems these days you need to
build systems for your partners via
customers you need to build applications
that work well on mobile devices
desktops any sort of device and with
being a web-based product then you can
take the same application you're running
on your
stop and run it on any device including
your smartphone so I think that's you
know a big advantage of writing with
application Express one of the other key
things is it's you know saying a low
barrier to entry really if you've got a
bit of sequel knowledge then you can
take this tool a long way you know you
if you want to take it to the next level
then you could start learning things
like HTML and CSS and JavaScript but
there's no requirement that you have to
learn that to be able to build a very
nice-looking application that's
responsive that's easy to use and that's
really one of the key things I think is
these days it's all about building very
intuitive applications you don't spend a
week learning how to use the application
you spend an hour just getting familiar
with what what's in the application and
there's no training manuals on that
because it should be as simple as going
to Amazon and you know people today know
how to use Amazon they should know how
to use your applications without being
trained up and that sort of thing yeah
you know another thing I like about apex
is the community around it oh you gonna
love that there are so many there
there's so many people meetups worldwide
your Oracle world is huge yep I mean
apex world is their main community site
built by the community for the community
there's a slick interface there people
are always helping each other out and I
think that's one of the key things is if
you've got a problem then it doesn't
matter with you it's a competitor of
yours or anything else people are very
happy and and willing to give up their
own time to help you to resolve your
problem because of the fact they believe
in the tool so much and how it's helped
them and they want to give back to
others that are starting out and that's
it's really cool it's really cool to be
part of that sort of close-knit
community but it's a very welcoming
community to new members as well I love
it so we're gonna be having Michael
hitch wa on the show later and I'm gonna
ask him to walk us through you know all
the new apps that he is built sure which
I'm sure he's probably up to 30 um you'd
better have a bit of mixed
really how many how many is he up to now
Oh I mean he's prolific in the number of
internal apps that he builds but library
is just huge yeah we've got all our
packaged applications and you know he
spends a lot of effort improving those
we actually work with a lot of internal
groups that are using those you know I
can't mention the business unit like
mergers and acquisitions that utilize
one of our tools to to track all the
different acquisitions we're doing and
things like that you know a lot of the
sales teams that are staying to pick up
and utilize things like our customer
tracker and and so we get feedback from
them which helps us to improve the
product and make it more real real real
world usable and I think that that helps
them it helps us so it's win-win oh
that's great that's great and it went
for the customers because I get the
benefit of their development positively
so what was the last application that
you built hmm so I built a little sample
projects application and that was mainly
to show off the master detail detail
capabilities which is something that
I've been after for a long time with
application Express and we released it
back in 5.1 with interactive grids and
especially for those coming from Oracle
forms where they used to building a lot
of master detail detail type of pages
then I thought it's very important to
show different ways that we could
represent that data and it's all very
easy very quick declarative ways to
build these pages out so eight years
from now that application will still run
no matter what version of Apex you're
running that's our intention I'm so glad
you dropped by today thank you for
having me well it was great fun and I'm
gonna come over to the demo area and
take a look and maybe we can build an
app together oh well I've got the skills
I do I look I definitely low
[Laughter]
