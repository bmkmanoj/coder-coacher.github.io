reactive programming patterns with Java
8 so if you're looking for a different
talk you know sorry you're gonna have to
listen to me
I am I'm Josh surrett I'm an author I've
written I wrote a book and I'm in the
process of writing another book
with the co-author on Scala and SBT I'm
also just a giant nerd I love any kind
of technology I read lots of tech blogs
and things just in general so yeah and I
have a Twitter I try not to be annoying
with my Twitter so if you follow me I
will either say something that I find
amusing or you can unfollow me one of
the two and then I'm also a senior
software engineer at typesafe so the
goal of this talk today the reason why
we're here is which we have a use case
that we see a lot which is I have two
different systems or more that I want to
pull data from and render them into a
website okay that's that's our use case
today and to do that we're going to look
at doing it reactively and we're going
look at the motivations why we care
about reactive and what has changed in
the tech space that makes us care about
reactive so the agenda first we talk
about asynchronous slash reactive
programming there's there's a slight
difference between the two which I'm
going to try to cover but you should be
familiar a little bit with asynchronous
programming that's what it's generally
called now and we'll cover what the
difference between that reactive
programming is okay we're going to talk
about some new Java 8 features though
you might have already been you know
inundated with them at this this session
but we're going to cover them again just
to make sure that we solidify what these
new features are and how to use them and
then we going to talk about a few just
real simple basic patterns with
asynchronous programming mostly we're
going to talk about the mindset that you
have when you program reactively
asynchronously and why it matters ok and
finally we're going to do a little demo
of the play web framework which right
now I would say has the most
bust asynchronous reactive programming
platform available for running web
servers okay
first I want to make you aware of the
reactive manifesto normally I'm not the
kind of person that would promote
manifestos but this is pretty much just
a diagram for how to write reactive
applications I think it's quite valuable
it has four tenets the tenets are we
want a responsive experience on our
software in general to do that we need
to be scalable so if we have a lot of
users to be responsive we have to be
able to scale for that load we need to
be resilient to failure it's okay to
respond with a failure message but you
need to actually respond with a useful
message and the event-driven component
is what we're going to focus on today
the event-driven piece is what allows us
to gain the other two but if we don't
actually push for those other two
components we don't end up with a
responsive system so if you go
event-driven but you don't plan to
handle failure and you're not resilient
people who will still hate your system
right we don't we don't want to do that
okay so yeah
asynchronous what does it mean what does
it mean you've probably been programming
asynchronous code a lot in general if
you use any je e webserver you are
programming asynchronously if you talk
to a database the definition of
asynchronous is if we look at the red
part which is the important part a
specific operation begins upon receipt
of an indication or signal so all this
says is when I get a signal that says
something's done I do something else if
you look at the way you write code you
say do this thing and when that's done
go do this other thing and when that's
done go do this other thing right so we
tend to program asynchronously but when
we talk about sorry when we talk about
reactive programming we mean a little
bit more than that
so here's an example of a common web
server that hits a database to get some
information brings the information back
and returns the big data to the client
that they care about right
the red diagram for those of you who
aren't familiar with this style of
diagram the red implies how long a
thread is hot like taken hold of and
captured for a particular you know
request event cycle so right now the the
servlet thread is in use the entire time
we're querying the database even though
the query is happening on a different
thread and the response is coming back
on a different thread we are blocking
two threads for this one thing and we'd
like to kind of maybe use threads a
little bit better now that we have so
many cores on machines the ability for
us to paralyze here is a little limited
whereas if we don't hold on to the
thread while we're waiting for these
events if we have a way to non-blocking
asynchronous wait right if we have a way
to say when this is done go tell
somebody who will wake up and do things
we use a little bit less of the thread
and so maybe a scheduler can make more
optimal use of our CPUs and we'll get
better throughput and better utility on
a single machine okay so that's kind of
the tenants well if we want to do this
what does that mean what do we need to
actually make this also be efficient
because there is an overhead for passing
things across threads so the tenants of
a good reactive design are you want to
avoid blocking threads that's what we
just talked about we don't want to block
threads because we want to use all the
CPUs we can but the second thing is we
don't want to change threads because if
I pass computation to another thread
that that CPU that's right if it's a
different CPU needs to pull the data
into its cache and that's a hit a
performance hit that we don't want to
have to take if we can avoid it so
there's these two competing performance
characteristics we want to use all of
our CPUs and we don't want to corrupt
our cache and finally the failures part
is the most important we don't want to
cripple failure if a thread dies it
needs to notify another thread or
another system or something else that
hey there's a failure you have to tell
your user and you have to
try to recover the system tying failure
to a particular thread is dangerous
because it isolates it in one spot of
the system your system is a big
component you know it's a topology so
we'd like to be able to handle failures
somewhere else not right on that
particular thread since we can be
passing okay what came to the rescue for
us that made all of this relevant is in
JDK 7 for the fork/join pool was added
and just the design of the fork/join
pool is ideal for this kind of
programming the the fork/join pool can
help us prevent cache corruption it
understands different tasks in writing
and stuff let's look at what that
actually means ok what does it mean that
it helps us avoid you know sending
things to another CPU until it's
relevant
so the key assumption behind the
fork/join pool is that if I create a new
task to execute it's a that is most
likely to have its data in that current
CPUs cache so maybe we should run that
one immediately and older tasks that
I've cued up you know probably aren't as
local in cash so I can safely send those
to other CPUs and get a performance gain
okay so essentially the way this works
if I have a task and I throw it onto the
queue alright it goes onto the queue of
a particular thread every thread has its
own queue of tasks that it needs to do
when the task gets run or when the
thread is ready to do something it says
hey does my queue have a task to run I'm
going to pull it up and execute it and
then if the task needs to do more work
the task will add to the local threads
queue what's nice about this now is what
does the thread queue do next it pulls
the top task off of the queue and runs
it okay so ideally if I'm adding it to
my local thread queue and I'm pull it
off of the queue for tasks I have not
corrupted my cache well how do I get
scaling how do I get this to go across
differ
threads if that thread number two there
is not doesn't have enough work because
you know all of his tasks completed
there's no one making requests there and
I have a huge buildup of tasks over here
on thread one there's what's called work
stealing where we grab from the bottom
of the queue we assume the bottom of the
queue means that it's far enough away
from cash that moving it to a different
CPU will have the least amount of
performance impact okay so using
fork/join for asynchronous programming
is just ideal right we can we can make
an asynchronous program where we add
these tasks into these queues and we get
really good single threaded performance
and as we scale out the number of cores
we get really good sharing across the
CPUs that you know again we try to avoid
cache corruption so this gives us a
really really good performance basis to
implement this style of programming Java
eight now adds a completable future to
take advantage of this completable
future is like a Java future except I
can add tasks to occur when the future
is done and I get back another future so
I can start chaining these things if and
those tasks basically are added to the
fork-join queue so they most likely
hopefully you know stay on the same
thread when it makes sense and they'll
move to other threads as makes sense
so now we can asynchronously do things
and get some performance benefit back
okay so here is an example web server
it's kind of an arbitrary one that uses
completable future okay so right now if
you use the play web framework we have
our own version of future the code will
look very similar to this but I'm
showing you Java 8's completable future
which will be you know what gets used
once Java eight is out so we have a
method called index that takes a request
in response and returns a result okay
and the idea is we want to go do our
tasks that are asynchronous join them
together and return a result this method
actually doesn't do any work all it does
is scheduled tasks that need to occur
and then the fork/join library will
actually do the execution of these tasks
okay so the latest blogs method returns
a completable future of the list of
blogs that the user wants the current
user data goes and hits our user cache
of what users are active what kind of
things have they done recently all right
are people having trouble seeing this in
the back if so raise your hand oh it is
it is it too small can't see the bottom
okay
well this will be interesting can we
drag this up hmm okay we'll all right so
can you see this
okay alright so basically what we have
there in the bottom half we had blogs
okay blogs was a completable future that
is a list of blog okay
we had user which is a completable
future of user can you guys read is that
how long is that better said is it too
too big too small no okay
all right so we have that which was a
completable user and then we want to
join these things together so blogs that
combine a sync with user and then here
we have a render method so it was like a
home page render home page all right
some of this will look a little
confusing
but if I have a completable future of a
list of blogs and completable future
from user I have this mechanism now of
joining the two things together and
creating a new future okay so render
home page is going to actually take the
data render the HTML okay it's it's a
method on home page it's a static method
so I have a static method that I can
actually send testing data to I can get
back the rendered home page and test
directly and then I can lift it
essentially into a future syntax so what
this is doing here is I am taking my
methods that return data and I'm putting
them into an asynchronous context and
I'm fragmenting what I do normally I
would write code that just does this
does this does this does this using
completable future it looks like do this
do this do this with a little bit of you
know gymnastics but what I'm actually
doing is I'm taking all of the things
that I have to do in my workflow and I'm
allowing them to be paralyzed because I
say do this when this is done I don't
care what thread it happens on and I'm
allowing the fork/join library to make
the decision for me to try to optimize
across CPUs okay so
the first thing we do is we grab the
latest blogs is this better with it
smaller like with it higher up can you
guys read that in the back now okay all
right the next thing is great the
current user data and then we're going
to combine the blogs and user data into
the same future this is a join we have
to actually explicitly say these two
things have to be used together and then
we call that render home page method
alright and then finally we return in
play we call it async
it's it says that the result of this web
request is going to be asynchronously
completed and the method returns
immediately and then this all happens on
some other thread okay so there were a
few new Java eight things that may be
passed you by there that we're going to
Co and uncover because these make this
style of programming more practical and
easier to do so first off you know
completable future
second of all method handles that this
render home page here log home page view
render home page is what's known as a
method handle okay
a method handle is a reference to a
method either static or on an instance
of a class you can use it in place of a
functional interface now we have to go
further and say what are these things
okay there's there's a question so the
question is how does that method access
the response which was passed as a
parameter that particular method is
rendering HTML directly without looking
at the response object then the async
thing is what Pat actually flows it down
out so yeah okay all right so that's the
method reference blog homepage view
before we can really look at the method
reference let's actually look at the
signature of then combine async so we
know what that method is doing and and
what this actual argument is okay so
we're winding down the stack first then
combined async this is the signature you
see when you open up the Javadoc yeah
it's some
it's pretty good right this is this is
by necessity Java has what's known as
you site variance so these funny
question marks get added well
we let's ignore those for now because
that's that's part of the type
gymnastics you do in functional
programming and it's not actually
informational for us it's gonna allow
you to do the right thing in your code
so we're going to ignore it it deals
with superclass subclass that kind of
thing let's just get rid of them and now
we have UT and V as these names of types
which I mean they're so descriptive that
I hope you see what's going on right now
right you know just that just made it
clear all right no we're gonna let's
take these type parameters and give them
human readable names that will kind of
help us I'm also really bad though at
making examples so if this were my API
it would be foo and bar just saying okay
so first a completable future returns if
there's a result type of a future right
a future is going to perform some action
and store it and that's the result type
so we're going to label the type
parameter result so that we understand
what's going on and here's how it shows
up now that by function thing still
looks kind of weird but it's a function
that is returning the result okay it's
some sort of interface that can take a
Tau and give us a result well let's call
the current thing in the completable
future we're talking about data so then
this then combining sync is defined on a
completable future his type parameter
we're going to call it data because I
have a complete above future that has
data in it and I want to get a result
that's different than the data I already
have and I'm combining with another
complete completion stage or completable
future so we'll call that one other data
okay so I take a completable future of
data and some other data and I have this
by function that takes data other data
and returns a result okay is that a
little bit more clear I mean I I like to
think data another data is a little bit
better than T in you but to be fair like
most FP where it's really abstract like
this they use tu V R and just down the
alphabet for variables it's just a thing
and we don't necessarily like it but
that's what it is it's it's a little
easier to write okay so yeah then
combine async essentially we take
another completable future and a
function that's going to join them let's
look at actually what by function looks
like this is it's an interface again we
see tu and r yay but it takes something
and something else and returns a third
thing to you and R if we look back it
takes the data on the left-hand side of
the future takes the data on the
right-hand side of the future and
returns the result all right in our
instance if we go way back this render
homepage takes a list of blogs user data
and returns HTML where HTML is a
first-class object in this framework
okay all right go through that all right
now in java 8 if i have an interface
with a single abstract method like by
functor just had one abstract method i
can use a lambda to implement this
interface or I can use a method
reference so that's this is the
functional interface this is where the
functional programming side of things
comes in if I have a method called test
can you guys read the bottom in the back
now okay great great man just making it
not the full size is awesome ok if I
have a something called test that takes
a bi function of string string and
string so it's going to take two strings
and return another string and that's the
combiner and I pass it hello and world
ok then I can call this test method with
this little red line here on the bottom
ok that is the lambda it is the
left-hand side here are the arguments to
that method and the right-hand side is
the body ok it takes a string a string
and it returns a new string and in this
case I'm just plussing them and I get
back hello
all right what I can do instead is if I
have a string utils combined method that
takes a string in a string and returns a
string you notice that the lambda and
this method kind of have the same inputs
and outputs it has a different name than
the by function except but it has the
same types in the same positions all
right so what I can do instead now is I
can reference the combined method from
string utils and say give me the by
function interface and to implement it
call this method ok that's what's going
on there so this lets us inside of java
8 now all of this code where we'd have
to create all these anonymous inner
classes to run methods is a lot simpler
and we can put methods where they make
sense and when we debug we debug a
method we don't debug this anonymous
inner class with a handler ok so it gets
a lot nicer the way a method reference
works is you write the object or class
or variable that you want to reference a
method from then you put colon colon and
then you put the method that you want to
reference ok pretty simple so if we go
back to our asynchronous flow that's
what's going on here I have a blog home
page view class with a static render
home page method that I am referencing
ok so let's go back to patterns for
asynchronous programming
the key mindset that you have is I'm
working in a workflow ok we went through
all the gymnastics that make this
possible but now we have a workflow if I
want to request a user profile page I
need to pull the user profile from the
datastore
I have to get my recent you know
tracking information from some live
cache index of what the users done just
recently I want to get some
advertisements for this user and then I
want to update my click log those are
the first four things I do after I get
back the data that I need to render the
user accounts page I'm going to render
it after I get the advertisements I'm
going to render those and order them
appropriately then I'm going to push
those into something that can
pleats these two right and then I'm
going to stream HTML to the user in an 8
in a reactive programming model what you
do is you make each of these things a
method and then you make the workflow
method which is your controller request
where you lift these into a future and
then chain them together appropriately
using the methods on completable future
or for existing play using our future ok
so that's how we do reactive programming
we think in terms of workflows and
there's just a few simple things you can
do one is I want to run something after
something else ok cool if I want to do
that with completable future there are
two methods to do so there is then
accept which says after this is done run
some function I don't care about the
result just run it so in that case when
we wanted to update the click log we can
attach after we go get the user
information we can update the click log
with the user ok if then apply says I
want to take a completable future and I
want to take the data you have in it and
run a function using it to create new
data that will be used further
downstream so this is where at the end
of a workflow item I have more
information that has to flow I use then
apply now the stars mean that there are
actual four methods in the API there is
then except then apply then except async
and then apply async the async is a
misnomer as we learn from the definite
definition of what asynchronous means in
this case async means it can run on a
different thread then except actually
blocks the current thread until the
future is done and then execute the
behavior but if we want to actually take
ma you know as best advantage of our CPU
as possible
most likely we'll be using then accept
async so that it can happen on a
separate thread ok so prefer using async
and sometimes you might need to block
usually when you think you need a block
you don't have to but you know it's
still there in case you need it
alright and my my little circle does not
line up correctly that's supposed to be
erase I
I can maximize it if you want to see it
on the right thing but or you can take
my word for it okay all right so next up
asynchronous join this is just where I
have two things that I ran and I need to
join them together so the API calls that
I can use to do this are then combined
and then accept both if you remember
before where we had then apply and then
accept accept was I wanted to do
something and I don't care about the
value it's not going to go further down
the chain and apply was after this is
done create a new value so here's the
same thing combined is I want to take
these two futures and return a new thing
using some function and accept both is
when these two things are done run this
function and do some work but I don't
really care about the result it's a
terminal value in your workflow okay and
again there are the blocking version and
the asynchronous version okay and again
it doesn't line up rock on all right so
pattern number three and this is the
most important pattern is in this
workflow you will have failures every
stage of completable future could end up
with a failure every function you run
can throw an exception and at any point
in time we can say was there a failure
and let's do something okay
in completable future if you have a
failure and you chained these methods
together that failure actually blocks
the rest of the operations from
happening and you get the failure at the
end okay it actually chains all the way
through so we can set up a stage of
computation to run asynchronously and
the failure happens on any thread and we
can handle it over here at the end on
the thread we care about okay so the way
this works in completable future there's
actually a few ways to handle exceptions
this is the one I totally recommend so
I'm not even showing the other ones you
can take a completable future and call
exceptionally on it so here you say if
this future failed
I want a function that takes the
exception that was thrown and returns a
valid result okay it returns a T so
completable future
if I'm trying to return HTML at the end
of my pipeline I can write the pipeline
and then I write exceptionally return
this valid HTML if there was a failure
I can even inspect the exception and
return different types of failure
messages and HTML based on that ok so
you always want to throw these at the
end of the chain to make sure you are
resilient to failure and if you fail in
the middle the pipeline you don't have
all these threads blocking waiting for
this right it just goes through
immediately okay so a quick recap we
want to use completable future we want
to use then and combine without
supplying and executor okay
I didn't mention this but on most of
those methods you can actually pass in
and the executor service of what thread
to run in if you do so most likely it
will force it to go on to a different
thread you want to recover from failure
by providing goods states and you should
actually learn play if you want to try
out reactive programming today so we're
going to do a little demo time this is
the reactive stocks application from
play we're going to delete food Java
here is the application hmm we can make
you a little smaller okay so what what
we have right now is we have a web
application that has connected via
WebSocket to a dummy stock ticker I'm
not actually connected to the New York
Times or New York Stock Exchange or
anything because I'd be ridiculous this
is just a dummy ticker that's just
putting in dumb values but it's actually
serializing them over the WebSocket and
we are changing on the fly okay so our
javascript actually has a handler to
react and that's a different talk what's
kind of neat here is if you click on the
stock it goes out it makes a web request
to a service which I don't think my
phone Wi-Fi is actually going to be able
to handle right now but it makes a set
of requests to Twitter and then to
sentiment detection
separately so we're hitting more than
one service to figure out what do the
tweets say you know are the tweet saying
that you should invest in goog are they
saying that you should invest in Apple I
don't know
so yeah looks looks like the service is
not going to return all right but we can
take a look at this this is a this is a
application that I work on called
typesafe activator if you're interested
in getting started with play this is a
great way to start it's a tutorial
driving framework so inside of here I
have an application and I have a
tutorial that describes the application
and it's a little bit of an IDE so we
can click in here and see application
Java inside of application Java you can
see right here we have a index that
returns the index this all happens
asynchronously but in this case we're
just rendering HTML so it's kind of
hidden we open up a web socket and
that's where all that communication
happens what to small oh right okay here
we open up a web socket to communicate
with this application okay but the
interesting part is I'm going to show
you what reactive programming looks like
in Scala this is the sentiment detection
so in the sentiment detection we make a
method to do each of our pieces of
workflow the first method is get text
sentiment this happens to be written in
Scala because it's a demo app and I
didn't want to rewrite it but in Java
this actually looks very similar
we take our web service API we give it a
URL and we say go get this with this
post and it gives us a future response
where response is the response of the
web service okay so that's our
asynchronous method call that's one of
the items in our workflow after we get
that we want to actually get the average
sentiment for a sequence of responses so
if we go out and get the text sentiment
for one tweet we want to a great these
sequences together okay all the tweets
all the sentiments
we want to get the average sentiment so
this is another method another instance
in our workflow of getting tweet
sentiment okay and that's using the JSON
API which isn't that important
okay the most important thing as you see
we're chunking out by methods load
sentiments from tweets this is where we
take the JSON value from the tweet query
that we made and then we go execute this
get text sentiment
method to go get the text sentiment for
an individual tree tweet what's
interesting here you see we're returning
a sequence of futures okay
in the Java 8 API this is something that
you're currently able to do but with a
lot of gymnastics and in in the play API
it's actually a single method you can
take a sequence of futures and create a
future of sequences okay so if I have a
bunch of features that I go out and
issue a whole bunch of queries I can
join them together and it's the future
dot sequence command which I'll show you
in a bit okay so finally I think I went
through those upside-down and backwards
because that makes sense here's the
workflow right here a for-expression I
say give me all the tweets
asynchronously okay
Scala has this sugar and with fours to
make it be a little less verbose so I
say get all my tweets load the sentiment
from each of the tweets that I got in
that response right here then I say this
future sequence where I take the
sequence of all of the web requests I
made for sentiment and join them back
into a single you know workflow item a
single future and then I yield the
result so return the sentiment JSON here
this for expression returns a future
simple result okay and then at the very
end I have recover with so that's our
version of the exceptionally where you
can say on an exception here's what you
do so if there was an exception recover
with this error message alright and
that's the same kind of model that
you'll see in a Java 8 version of play
with completable future that doesn't
exist today because Java 8 isn't out but
that's
where we're going okay all right and
yeah if you're interested in learning
play you should check out activator it's
a project that I work on
it's I love it it's fun but yeah give us
feedback we just released one Oh on
Monday there's a principals of reactive
programming course that will go in far
more depth than this talk did in terms
of you know all the tenants of reactive
it will cover different models of doing
reactive including you know the actor
model more event based models observable
models that kind of thing and yeah it
looks to be for me five to seven hours a
week is like death workload but I hope
it's not for everyone so yeah it should
only be five to seven hours a week oh
and it's free oh this is on Coursera
sorry principles of reactive programming
on Coursera starts the fourth of
November so it'll be good times
sign up now there's the URL and a
picture of Uncle Sam cuz you know you
got you got it I don't know
all right and with that I can I can
start taking some questions
yes in the back I sorry you're gonna
have to speak up a little more do use
the use of what you could you walk
transactions is the use of transaction
supported in the model ah yes so the
thing the thing about a lot of
transaction systems currently is they
either use a thread local to like denote
the transaction amount of web frameworks
attach all of your session to a thread
local and stick it on a thread in this
system what you have to do with
transactions is attach them to a class
that represents the data being flown
reactively and then at the end you need
to clean it up with one of those accept
blocks okay so on error or on success
you would have something that closes the
transaction but you actually have to
lift that currently yourself onto the
futures yeah so question back here
say
so the question is how do I compare the
performance of this completable future
with apache camel where you can create
the same kind of performance but less
low-level completable future is is a a
way of getting the performance for a
particular machine up to a higher level
there's there's a little less overhead
so I'm not actually fully aware of where
a Patrick Campbell is today because I
haven't followed it for like the past
two years in depth so I don't I don't
actually know the full results if they
are making use of the fork Jordan pool
under the scenes I'd say that the
performance would be equivalent because
you're using the same you know if you're
using the same magic sauce underneath
you can't beat it but yeah I I don't
know directly so yes
okay so the question is if you have a
workflow that involves a bunch of
parallel tasks and if any one of them
fails you were to cancel the whole
workflow right now the solution is if
you farm out a bunch of parallel tasks
and you have one fail and you have a
joint operation between them the first
failure will get propagated and end the
remainder of the workflow but anything
you start will still try to finish so if
you want to task it canceled a task in
flight your actually need some special
support for that so yeah yes so the
question is is this independent of the
servlet specification for async
dependencies or are they tied I believe
they're gonna they're going to work
together once servlets allow
asynchronous you know completions you
should be able to use completable
futures to do your servlet workflow so
it's going to tie hand and foot you know
this is um like I said if you if you
want to try it out and play now to see
what it feels like it's coming to Java
so it's only a matter of time before
it's everywhere as a viable option so
yeah any other questions cool well
thanks guys so it was a little short</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
