working at a software engineer for over
four years and hereby I just want to
share some story about you know how I
started programming and how I saw the my
first problem in the application I
created so I remember that back in the
days when I just started learning
programming I was a learning Python and
it was a very simple tic-tac-toe game
they recruited but uh I have a problem
our problem we were I cannot make the
game finish and I always try to race
between the two players so I remember
how he back from very long time it was
frustrating but uh so I I went to I went
down line for solution but then I figure
out by break it down into small steps
and that's what that's how I saw the
problem and from that I learned that you
know it's valuable we always we always
learn from the mistake we don't learn
from success</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
