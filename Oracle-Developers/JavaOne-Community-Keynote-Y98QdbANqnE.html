to save Duke does anyone in the audience
have something we can use to stop Duke
from ruining San Francisco did you are
here in Paris oh oh hey are you guys
doing we are we're really sad stiff so
we just I don't know if you know but
Oracle just acquired Sun and you know
the platform that you know today as j2ee
is going to evolve into also another
very powerful option called Java EE it's
going to take a few ideas from the past
you know what ideas that you already
have around you things like hibernate
and X doclet and some things from the
future like annotations and convention
over configuration and really become
something that a lot of people like
myself really believe in one of the
things we've learned in 2015 is that
things were deprecated for a whole bunch
of different reasons and so in fact
there's a gem that has just been
announced JEP 277 on deprecation and
what we're doing is we're defining a
number of different concepts for the
reasons that the things were deprecated
so things might be superseded things
might be dangerous and then only certain
things a small subset might actually
eventually be removed the parts that we
had were not nearly as good because we
had to use what we generally refer to as
hammer technology namely we buy
something else like a Nintendo Game Boy
and hammered apart nice I mean there are
a lot of see enough Sony Walkman we had
we would buy boxes of consumer
electronics gear hit them with hammers
pull out like like the connectors from
from Sony Walkman because they had
really great connectors the screen we
got out of sharp TV sets that the little
radio thing was from some strange
military outfit that I forget so it's
like a Frankenstein tablet it was
totally it was totally Frankenstein
