George Saab
hi good morning welcome to Java 1 I'm
very pleased to be here to introduce our
next speaker and and I wanted to say you
know one of the things that I think a
lot of us have in common is we're
completely sure that what we're doing is
you know very you know it's very complex
it's very advanced right is there anyone
who doesn't do advanced stuff in the
audience I know my team that makes the
JDK and the JVM we know that what we do
is rocket science
well the next guest is actually somebody
who really does rocket science our our
guest has a masters and PhD from USC and
she was the lead systems engineer for
the revolutionary it's called the
revolutionary parachute which was used
in the landing of the Mars Curiosity
rover she also is the project manager
now for the cold atom laboratory at JPL
she's come to visit us from Southern
California we're not going to hold that
against her please give a warm welcome
to dr. Anita Sengupta
thank you for the intro George well
thank you for having me everyone I'm
gonna go get my clicker as I'm the
presentation I'm gonna go through some
interesting slides for you so my
background is aerospace engineering
which is also known as rocket science so
everything that I've done for several
years has been related to either
speeding things up with propulsion
systems or slowing things down with
retro rockets and with parachutes and so
the topic of my talk today is probably a
bit of a departure from some of the
other topics of this conference but it
is how do we explore Mars and
specifically how do we use engineering
to get us to the red planet and so
several years ago I had the opportunity
to work on the Mars Science Laboratory
mission which landed the Curiosity rover
which you see here in this picture so
curiosity is essentially a robotic
geologist and it's the largest robotic
geologist but NASA has ever created and
sent to the surface of Mars one of the
largest engineering challenges of being
able to send something the size of a
small car do Planet which is 400 million
kilometres away is to land it safely on
the surface and so I was part of the
engineering team which developed that
system and it was a very much a
highlight of my career and so for
reference what you see here in the
background is the planet Mars and so our
job was to land the Curiosity rover
which departed earth on a launch vehicle
into a crater called Gale Crater about
nine months after we initially launched
it so I'll talk a little bit about the
engineering challenges associated with
how you design that type of entry
descent landing system and then talk
about exactly what the rover has been
doing on the surface and why it's so
fascinating for us so first of all how
do we land on Mars we created a
wonderful video called seven minutes of
Terror which was intended to sort of
engage the planet Earth and children and
adults alike as to the challenges of
landing something on a planet so many
millions of miles away and it takes you
seven minutes to get from the top of the
atmosphere down to the surface of the
planet
so please enjoy
when people look at it it looks crazy
that's a very natural thing sometimes
when we look at it it looks crazy it is
the result of reasoned engineering
thought but it still looks crazy the top
of the atmosphere down to the surface
it takes a seven minutes it takes 14
minutes or so for the signal from the
spacecraft to make it to earth that's
how far Mars is away from us so when we
first get word that we touch at the top
of the atmosphere
the vehicle has been alive or dead on
the surface
for at least seven minutes
entry descent landing also known as EDL
is referred to as a seven minutes of
Terror because we've got literally seven
minutes to get from the top the
atmosphere to the surface of Mars going
from 13,000 miles an hour to zero in
perfect sequence perfect choreography
perfect timing and the computer has to
do it all by itself with no help from
the ground if any one thing doesn't work
just right it's game over you slam into
the atmosphere and develop so much
aerodynamic drag our heat shield heats
up and it blows like the surface of the
Sun 1,600 degrees during entry the
vehicles not only slowing down
violently
through the atmosphere but also we are
guiding like an airplane to be able to
land in a very narrow constrained space
this is one of the biggest challenges
that we are facing and one that we have
never attempted on Mars Mars is actually
really hard to slow down because it has
just enough atmosphere that you have to
deal with it otherwise it will destroy
your spacecraft on the other hand it
doesn't have enough atmosphere to finish
the job we're still going about thousand
miles an hour so at that point we use a
parachute a parachute is the largest and
strongest supersonic parachute that
we've ever built to date it has to be
able to withstand 65,000 pounds of force
even though the parachute itself only
weighs about a hundred pounds when opens
up that fast it's a neck snapping 9 G's
at that point we have to get that heat
shield off it's like a big lens cap
blocking our view of the ground to the
radar the radar has to take just the
right altitude and velocity measurements
at just the right time or the rest of
the landing sequence won't work
this big huge parachute that we've got
illness slows down to about 200 miles an
hour
that's not slow enough to land so we
have no choice but we got cut it off and
come down in rockets
once you turn those rocket motors on we
don't do something weird you're gonna
snap right back into the parachute so
the first thing we do is make this
really radical diver community fly off
to the side diverting away from the
parachute killing our horizontal
velocity and our vertical velocity
getting you over moving straight up and
down so looking at the surface with its
radar let's see where we're going to
land and straight down to the bottom of
the paper
right beside six corner high night
we can't get those rocket into the
toothless agreement because if you were
to descend compulsively with our engines
all the way to the ground we've
essentially create this massive dust
cloud that dust cloud could then go and
land on the rover it could damage
mechanisms attica damage instruments so
the way we solve that problem is by
using the sky cream 20 meters above the
surface we have to lower the rover below
us Baris heaven it's 21 feet and then
gently deposit on its knees
Paul mr.
as the rover touches down and is now on
the ground the descent state it's in a
collision course with a robot we must
cut the bridle immediately and fight in
the same stage away to a safe distance
from the road so what's so exciting of
course is that that appears to be
science fiction but in fact it's science
fact so we were able to engineer that
very complex system and safely landed
curiosity rover on the surface of the
planet just over four years ago today so
first of all though people like to ask
me why is it that we're so interested in
Mars and this drawing that you see here
shows you a photograph of the Earth
taken from space and a photograph of
Mars taken from space and you can see
that the planets are quite different
from each other but at the beginning of
time when the solar system first formed
we actually believe that Mars did have
an atmosphere a thick atmosphere and it
had appreciable water flowing on the
surface so something happened over the
course of the past several billion years
which made Mars evolved into a dry dusty
cold rock compared to Earth which
obviously has very large oceans and a
thick atmosphere with oxygen so that
we're able to survive on the surface but
what that means though is that if we
were to one day go and colonize another
planet in our solar system would we want
to go to Mars and the answer is actually
yes because even though Mars doesn't
have appreciable water on the surface it
probably still has it in the subsurface
which could be used by future human
colonies and the other benefit of Mars
is it's not that far from Earth it's a
smaller planet but it does have about
one-third the gravity so it's not as
difficult to be able to survive in a 1/3
G environment as opposed to a GRE
environment um there is an atmosphere we
actually use that atmosphere to slow
ourselves down during the entrance and
entry descent and landing sequence that
you just saw and so you could
conceivably use that atmosphere which
primarily contains carbon dioxide to
make fuels such as methane if you
brought enough supplies with you now it
is a much colder planet than Earth
because the atmosphere is very thin and
it's further away from the Sun but if
you can imagine during the Martian
summer day in the equatorial regions it
actually can get to a temperature on the
order of California temperature although
of course during the wintertime it can
get much coal
- 120 degrees Fahrenheit the big
challenge of course though is that the
atmospheric pressure is quite low it's
only about 1% at the surface as what it
is on earth which means that if you were
to live on the surface of Mars you would
have to bring your own air supplies with
you as well as live in a pressurized
environment but compared to the moon and
compared to the vacuum environment of
space Mars is actually a far more
habitable compared to what it would be
if we were to go to a more distant
planet for example the one challenge
which isn't too much of one however is
that the Martian day is only slightly
longer than the Earth Day so even our
bodies wouldn't have that difficult of a
challenge to be able to be accustomed to
twenty four point six hours versus 24
hours but what is so fascinating about
Mars though is it has had an active
geological history so one of the reasons
why we do space exploration is to
understand how did our solar system
evolve how did our planets of all and
what we do know is that in the past Mars
was actually very volcanic ly active and
what you see up here is Olympus Mons
Olympus Mons is the largest mountain in
our solar system and it's an extinct
volcano it's three times as high as
Mount Everest that can give you the
scale of how large this volcano was and
the amount of material that it probably
did spew across the surface millions or
billions of years ago but now the
volcano appears to be inactive and we
don't understand why why did we have all
this volcanism in the past but don't
appear to have it now we actually are
setting a mission very soon which is
going to look for evidence of Mars
quakes if they are still present another
really interesting feature is Valles
Marineris which is sort of the scar that
goes across the center of the planet and
it's kind of a kid into Mars as Grand
Canyon so at some point in Martha's past
there was a lot of water flowing on the
surface but where did the water go is it
frozen the subsurface did it all
evaporate off of the atmosphere and the
way we answer some of those questions
about why the volcanism changed how did
that change the environment of Mars
where is the water today is by sending
spacecraft to orbit Mars as well as
Rovers and Landers to explore the
surface to take scientific measurements
for us so Mars actually has moons not
everyone is aware of this it's that are
called Phobos and Deimos they're
relatively small which is the reason
when they kind of still look like potato
type structures they haven't you know
crushed under their own gravitational
for
and one potential architecture is to
actually for us to go and visit those
moons Sela set up a telecommunications
relay and potentially mine valuable
minerals or even water that might be on
the surface of these moons as a future
sort of human mission architecture so by
a show of hands who thinks we found
water on Mars well we actually have and
so we have found water frozen in the
subsurface region what you see in this
picture is a Phoenix lander which was in
the mid 2000s came down was landing on
its retrorockets kicking up all the dust
and soil and the little patch that you
see beneath it
it's actually frozen water ice so it's
like a salty water ice brine so we know
there is water it's in the subsurface
and we would have to tap into it if we
were in future to be able to send people
there to utilize it from a colonization
perspective now a really new finding I
would say which is in roughly the
September of 2015 time period is that we
actually confirm that we found flowing
water on the surface of Mars and the
picture you see on the upper right and
all of these images are taken by a
spacecraft called MRO the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter and it takes
beautiful high-resolution images across
the entire planet and those black
streaks that you see going across this
image and coming down on this image are
actually seeps of water from the
subsurface material which comes down the
sides of cliff faces it's not that much
it's seasonal but we do still see it
which means that we can potentially tap
into these subsurface aquifers and what
might reside in that water we don't know
until we actually go and visit it and so
we have a lot of data as to what the
surface of Mars looks like the most an
engineering perspective and then we're
collecting more data understand what it
means from a scientific perspective so
we have landed on Mars a total of seven
times now with the u.s. space program
we're the only space program to date
which has been successful other ones
have tried but haven't been successful
it's a very difficult thing to do so we
build off of our prior experiences we
had the Viking landers which land in the
1970s you can imagine the computer
technology that was available at that
time not so much as probably far less so
than what you have even in your own
individual smartphone we also landed the
Pathfinder Rover which was about the
size of a Tonka truck we landed that in
the 1990s in the early 2000s we landed
the Mars exploration Rovers which is
roughly the size of a lawn mower
there was two of them Maury and Murphy
and then we had the Phoenix lander which
was in the mid-2000s and then August of
2012 was the Curiosity rover so each
time we have these missions we build
upon our expertise from an engineering
perspective from the fire missions and
we increase our scientific knowledge
base as we go again and again to the
surface to collect more information and
we have two missions which are coming up
now which is the insight mission
launching in 2018 which is gonna look
for evidence of Mars quakes and we also
have the Mars 2020 mission which is
going to send another Rover to the
surface and cache a sample to hopefully
bring back to earth one day for further
analysis and these are all images that
were taken of the rover's over time in
these individual missions so what I'd
like to show you here is the evolution
of Technology so ironically in the
evolution of computer technology you
start big and you go small in the
evolution of Rover technology we start
small and go big and the reason for that
is that you can carry more scientific
equipment if you have a larger platform
so if you were going to move your house
you wouldn't move it on the back of your
bicycle or right or on the back of
motorcycle you would move it on the back
of a large moving truck and so as we
increase the wheelbase and increase the
mass that we can send to the surface of
Mars we can make more interesting
scientific measurements as you can see
the evolution from the small Tonka truck
sized Rover going all the way up to the
Curiosity rover which has an also a new
power system which enables it to go to
more interesting terrain over larger
rocks and operate for a larger portion
of the day and I'll talk to you a little
bit about what some of that scientific
equipment is that it's carrying on its
back so the Mars Science Laboratory
mission specifically was there to assess
whether or not Mars could have once been
habitable and could still be habitable
today and the way we do that is by
making a series of scientific
measurements one of them is to look to
see whether or not there could be any
biological potential and we do that by
taking a look at our organics present
are the building blocks of organic
molecules presents we want to also
understand how the rocks and the
minerals formed that they formed due to
water-based geological processes or
something else we also want to
understand what the radiation
environment is so if any of you have
seen the Martian I assume most of you
would probably see the Martian one of
the biggest challenges for sending
people to live on
surface of any other planet in our solar
system or mood in our solar system is
what is the radiation environment going
to be like and so this is the very first
mission where we actually make
measurements of what the surface
radiation is which will allow us to
understand do we need to develop new
shielding technologies and what kind of
environment are we going to see if we
live on the surface for extended periods
of time so that actually is a really a
big challenge that we have ahead of us
and so we do that by carrying a suite of
scientific instruments on the back of
the rover so then of course the obvious
question becomes where are we going to
land the rover right Mars is a large
planet just like Earth is a large planet
so they have to pick a location which is
going to be scientifically interesting
so if you are an alien race coming down
to earth and you were looking for life
would you go to the middle of the Sahara
Desert or would you go to the middle of
the Amazon rainforest you go to the
rainforest right so on Mars we don't
have that exact same sort of
geographical selection because the
planet has lost most of its water but
there are regions on the planet which
did have large water bodies and so we
selected a location called Gale Crater
which you can see on the lower image
here where we believe there was an
ancient riverbed or lake bed presence
and we're better to look for evidence of
past sedimentary rock formation or even
pass organic molecule deposits than the
base of an ancient water body so they
selected Gale Crater and then just for
reference for those of you who are fans
of the Mars program MSL curiosity rover
was landed in Gale Crater the prior
Rovers the Mars exploration Rovers were
landed in Meridiani so there are very
large distance between them so
unfortunately you know you can't drive
from one to the next because we're not
able to drive out of the crater and if
you remember from the Martian movie he
was actually able to go over and pick up
the RTG from another Rover and use it
for his power system so we don't have
the capacity to do that is we actually
don't have the driving distance capacity
which is actually largely driven by
computational constraints for our flight
computers that we use which is an
interesting aside so in terms of Gale
Crater this is what it looks like in a
three-dimensional sense and so for scale
this is a picture of Los Angeles and so
our challenge was to be able to land
something the size and the mass of a
small car into a region you know 400
million kilometers away into region
roughly the salaries of downtown Los
Angeles probably roughly the size of
downtown San Francisco and so the
a very difficult sort of bullseye sort
of challenge to be able to do that for
such a large distance because at the
time because of the complexity and
because of the mass and the other
challenge associated with this is that
Gale Crater has in the center of it a
mountain called Mount sharp which is
roughly six kilometers high and on the
edge of it it has a crater wall so if
you don't have the correct precision to
your landing accuracy
you could either smack into the mountain
or smack into the crater wall which
obviously would be game over so this
actually drives the needed accuracy from
a flight software perspective as well as
from a guidance navigation and control
in the loop perspective to make sure
that you can get the rover to land in
that particular area
and so this shows you the bullseye on
Mars and what are the engineering
challenges that we had was to be able to
get us down from these larger ellipses
that you see here from the 1976 Viking
mission which was roughly 200 miles wide
down to a region which was only 12 miles
why it's row that's or over an order of
magnitude improvement in terms of landed
accuracy and we did that through the
development of very specific technology
advances one of them was to actually
sort of fly the rover because it had an
angle of attack which means it was sort
of like a small airplane but the other
one was to have the precision necessary
to understand where we were going and so
when you couple that into flight
software in the loop
you have closed guidance navigation
control and you're able to land your
rover of a large mass and a much smaller
area than if you just had a traditional
ballistic entry type of trajectory and
so that's what we have to do for
curiosity to be able to work with
something that large so I will go
through what the landing sequence
actually looks like so what you have is
you're coming in at roughly thirty
thousand miles an hour hurtling through
the atmosphere based off your hyperbolic
and trajectory you then hit the
atmosphere experience aerodynamic drag
and you use that aerodynamic drag to
slow you down from thirty thousand miles
an hour down to around 1,000 miles
narrow which is around two times the
speed of sound on Mars you then deploy a
very large supersonic parachute which
probably fills about 60% of this room to
slow you down to around
250 miles an hour you're then at
terminal velocity you can't go any
slower cut off the parachute and then
you do the rest of your descent on
retrorockets which are basically
monopropellant engines firing towards
the ground momentum transfer between
yourself and the vehicle to slow it down
then when we got around 60 feet above
the surface of Mars which is probably
I'd say twice the height of this room we
started to lower the rover on a series
of three tethers this is called the sky
crane maneuver we had very specific
reasons for why we selected this
architecture as opposed to doing
propulsive all the way to the ground a
lot of it was consumption reduction as
well as reducing the amount of sort of
ground-based erosion that we had the
engines firing into the ground that
vehicle had been done its job it
actually turns 45 degrees to the right
flies off and crashes at a safe distance
away and then the rover itself is the
land platform and it's landed safely on
the surface of the planet so the
challenge here was going from 30,000
miles an hour down to roughly 2 miles an
hour in a period of roughly 7 minutes
and so that's the over architecture
which is selected and Mars is nice in
the sense that it has an atmosphere so
you can use drag and having the
atmosphere actually makes it very
difficult from a heating perspective and
from a sort of an aerodynamic
instability perspective so that entire
sequence has to happen autonomously with
the onboard flight software coupled to
all the different technologies that we
showed you sensing its altitude sensing
its velocity in all three components in
order to have that happen successfully
so it was a very interesting challenge
for all of us to work on and so this is
another way of looking at it in a two
dimensional sense and so the way we
normally break it down is break it up
into different phases and so the very
first phase where most of the energy is
dissipated is where you actually are
experiencing friction with the
atmosphere so it's because of friction
with the atmosphere going so fast you
actually create this incredibly high
thermodynamic environment which requires
you to have a heat shield so that you
don't burn up and so most of the energy
is dissipated there and then a large
portion of it is dissipated on the very
large parachute and then finally the
rest of it is dissipated using our
vecchio rockets to get safely down to
the ground so my portion of the mission
actually was to work on the development
of the parachute as well as the sky
crane so just to give you an idea of
what this looks like on
face test because it is kind of
beautiful the parachute is roughly 60
feet in diameter so it's very large and
the reason why it has to be so large is
because the atmosphere is very thin on
Mars so to land the same mass payload
you have to have a much larger drag area
which drives you to your larger
parachutes which you need for the Mars
conditions so we ended up doing a lot of
testing of the parachute and it was
actually coupled largely with
computational fluid dynamics simulations
to represent the environment that it was
going to see as well as finite element
models which is another computational
technique to assess how much load the
parachute was going to see so that it
would survive here when we tested it on
the ground and then by definition would
survive when it made its way to Mars but
the biggest challenge associated with
developing these kinds of systems is
that because Earth and Mars are so
different from each other from a
gravitational perspective and from a
atmospheric composition perspective you
can't ever actually test that end-to-end
system here on earth so the very first
time it ever gets tested and to end is
actually when you land on Mars the
actual might so it makes it very tricky
so I'd like to show this picture as this
was a team that worked on it and science
say this to all the guys in the audience
who have daughters I please encourage
your daughters to become engineers and
scientists and computer scientists
because diversity is always a good thing
I think so now to segue a little bit to
talk about the rover itself the rover is
basically the size of a small car if you
ever have an opportunity to come out to
JPL you can actually see a model of it
driving around it has a very
sophisticated mobility system which
allows it to drive over rocks which are
roughly a one-and-a-half or half a meter
in diameter
so it can basically go on one wheel go
over the rock and the reason why we did
that is because sometimes the most
interesting places to interrogate from a
scientific perspective are unchallenging
which is more terrain so its intention
was for it to be able to get to the
foothills with a mountain that I showed
you in that first 3d topographical image
to see whether or not we could look at
the sedimentary layers that formed in
the base of an ancient water body so
many years ago so this is the suite of
instruments that it contains so all of
it is focused on determining
mineralogical composition elemental calm
position atmospheric composition and
then measurements of what the radiation
environment is and we do that through a
series of different techniques most of
them utilizing spectroscopy and of
course the rover does all of these
measurements itself we only communicate
with it twice a day so we upload a
sequence of commands in the morning um
we received back its data from the day
before and then at the very end of the
day we upload another sequence of
commands and we receive its data back
and so as it's driving across the
surface of Mars we don't drive it with a
remote control it operates itself so it
has a series of cameras which allows it
to do hazard avoidance so that it
doesn't you know go off a cliff or drive
into a rock and injure itself and all of
that is done of course with flight
software in the loop coupled to the
diagnostic that has onboard which is
essentially a vision system which
enables this closed-loop control
application so of course what would be
your choice of Sciences on Mars a laser
and there's a laser it's not used for
blowing things up that's more for
amusement purposes but there is a laser
which is a very high powered laser and
what it does is probably from a distance
from about me to the desk it fires a
laser into a rock and what that does is
it vaporizes the fog when you look
spectroscopically at the signal of that
vapor you can determine what the
composition of the rock is and so that's
essentially how it operates it doesn't
create something as dramatic as that but
it would burn a hole in your shirt for
sure right because it burns a hole in a
rock so it's pretty powerful and so um
those were the primary portions of the
instruments I'll talk a little bit more
about actual get into Mars and landing
on Mars and so inside of this vehicle
here tucked away inside of it this Aero
shell is the rover and the descent stage
that I showed you before and the yellow
looking conical shape you see on the
bottom is the heat shield that heat
shield material it burns up so the rover
doesn't instead it's kind of principle
of operation is the material basically
as destroyed absorbs all the energy is
you're coming in very quickly through
the atmosphere and then protects the
sensitive equipment inside of the cavity
of that vehicle so it takes roughly
seven to nine months to get to Mars on a
minimum energy subject er you can only
do it once every 24 calendar months
otherwise you miss your launch
opportunity so we launched in November
of 2011 and we arrived there in August
of 2012 the launch was successful and
the cruise was successful and we had a
unique opportunity on this mission which
I think will be of interest to you as
a software community to have a camera on
the underside of the rover so what you
see here is the actual landing event on
Mars the heat shield is falling away
this is the rover looking down towards
the surface you can see the heat shield
falling away in the distance and you can
see dark regions on the surface these
are actually ancient volcanic deposits
at the base of Gale Crater you see a
bunch of different pock marks those pock
marks are probably due to prior sort of
meteorite impacts with the surface
because the atmosphere is pretty thin so
they don't all burn up in the atmosphere
like they do on earth and you see a
rocking motion back and forth and the
reason for this is because the rover is
actually hanging underneath the
parachute so it's rocking back and forth
as it descends towards the surface now
at a point in the future a few seconds
later from now the rocking motion is
going to stop and it's going to become
more smooth and the reason for that is
because the parachute has been cut away
and the retrorockets have been turned on
and the initial maneuver that the
retrorockets do that you see sort of
right right here is it didn't divert
maneuver of roughly half a kilometer to
the side to prevent the parachute from
smacking back into it as the two thing
separates now what you can see here is
the descent towards the surface on
retrorockets now all of a sudden the
features on the ground are becoming to
go into focus because you're seeing a
better resolution of the image and
you're getting closer and closer to the
ground the sky crane maneuver is just
about to start we're starting to kick up
all the Sundin and the the dust on the
ground this is the rover's wheel falling
into view now it's just descending
descending descending towards the
surface and you can't really see much
now because there isn't a lot of light
available because the dust is being
kicked up and so the very first image
that the rover was supposed to send back
after its successfully linin on the
surface was a picture of what it would
see in the distance and so that was
confirmation that if it did that that
the landing was successful that the
rover was healthy and it was able to
communicate back to us at earth and so
this is the very first image that we got
back which is pretty exciting and I
always like to say it looks like a
transformer so what you see here is on
the shadow of curiosity in the distance
you can see Mount sharp which means it
successfully landed we were all ecstatic
because that it worked great our one
fear was that during the termination of
that sky crane event that those three
tethers wouldn't be disconnected they
wouldn't be cut away and then the rover
would get dragged across
the ground of course that didn't happen
that would been terrible if it happens
but everything was successful so we're
really happy about that and then the
other thing I'd like to point out is
that if you take a look at the region
where it landed
it looks nearly like a desert in
California or a desert in Nevada so even
though this is another planet
it's so similar to earth because when
the solar system first formed all of the
inner planets Venus Earth and Mars were
very similar to each other so something
happened in the past on Mars which
destroyed its atmosphere which took it
away and then sort of destroyed its
volcanism and we don't actually
understand what that is but why we do
these missions is to try and understand
what happened because we can probably
learn from that and better understand
our place in the universe or potentially
where we might be headed
so from an engineering perspective of
course this is what we really cared
about is that we made calculations ahead
of time using a technique called Monte
Carlo simulations where you go and you
very different parameters in your system
to say that if the winds are high the
winds are low the density is higher the
density is low the drag coefficient is
this much 5% more or 5% less you put
them together probabilistically and it
gives you a landing area that you may
land in and that red ellipse that you
see there is called a landing ellipse
and so we've said basically within a six
sigma probability distribution that we
would land within this landing ellipse
and what you see there in this white box
is where we actually did land that means
our engineering calculations were very
good it means our model of the
atmosphere was very good and the CM
basically the end-to-end entry descent
and landing sequence was the success in
terms of where we landed is we landed
where that green dot is at the top and
so the job was for curiosity to then
drive from that landing site to the base
of Mount sharp where he get the most
interesting scientific information so we
did as good as we could in terms of
getting to where we wanted to go from a
landing site perspective and the rest of
it was going to be up to the rover team
to be able to drive and gets the most
interesting scientific landing site
information so my very favorite image of
the night actually was this which was
taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
so we repositioned the spacecraft so
that it would capture the rover under
the parachute during his descent on Mars
on landing night and so we this is an
actual picture about to set towards the
surface and so we all got this image
down
our smartphones later that evening after
in a we were successful at the mission
landed and of course I cared about this
because you can see that the parachute
look good and the rover look good
beneath it so there wasn't any damage to
the hardware specifically so if you were
to get a new car and do a test from you
know your car dealership you probably
want to test drive it so before we went
off and did too much with the rover we
did an initial test drives you can see
it driving in a circle driving back and
forth to make sure all the systems are
operational
another interesting aside is that part
of doing image analysis that you have to
have fiducial markings right so you can
understand locations of things and you
can understand distances relative to
where your cameras are so the markings
that you saw see I'm a wheel there are
basically our fiducial markings but they
also spell Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Morse code so that was a way for us
secretly to encode the name of the
institution for future alien races who
might see it at some point in the future
but clearly the landing system looked
good the wheels look good of course or
not as as good shape they are now so
what we do have onboard the rover is
many many different cameras and those
different cameras including one which is
at the end of the arm of the rover are
able to take a 360 degree view of the
rover so this way we can get a good idea
of how is the entire rover doing what
does the top deck look like how is it
armed what does its wheels look like how
is the power system on the back doing
and so we're able to actually get very
good quantitative information on sort of
the health and the status of the
physical Rover in addition to all of the
telemetry that comes back from
pressure-temperature perspective but we
were able to get amazing beautiful
images of the surface both for you know
publicly reiations purposes as also for
scientific investigation purposes so i
have to show this one hope you get this
so you lasers on mars curiosity
obviously killed the cat so I like that
when I name a cat person so I would
never do that to my cat but it is pretty
funny but so but really what is actually
going on here so this is the laser that
I'm talking about is the image on the
right you see there you see a little
hole that opens up in the middle that's
because when you fire the laser into the
rock it actually does burn a hole in the
rock generate the vapor and then you can
see this spectroscopic signature and
what it tells you is like a fingerprint
so
each wavelength correlates to a specific
elements you can actually determine down
to a very detailed elemental level what
each sample it is you're looking at it's
made of which is important so you can
understand actually what it is so it's a
fingerprint which is given by this
technique which is called laser
breakdown induced spectroscopy so we
also have a weather station on board the
rover because you want to understand
what your whether a parameters are like
and so we have a Serie of wind sensors
we have temperature sensors that we have
pressure sensors and so what you can see
here on this image on the upper right is
a ground pressure and temperature sensor
and because you have the diurnal cycles
you actually have a change in pressure a
change in temperature as the rover goes
to them a period of you know daylight
sunlight to darkness and back and forth
and so this is important because we can
correlate these changes in environmental
parameters with changes in the radiation
environment and so this lower graph that
you see on the left-hand side here is
the radiation dose meter and so we're
able to correlate what the radiation
levels are with the changes in the
atmospheric properties and they do
correlate very well so having the
presence of an atmosphere actually does
a lot to help you shield out radiation
so that's important in terms of defining
what the environment actually is on Mars
for future human colonies that might go
there as well as may be a way of
creating a relation shield which uses
some kind of atmospheric material or
water as a means of attenuating out what
the radiation actually is so we have
basically daily Mars weather forecasts
that we get from the rover that's
sitting on the surface of a planet so
another very important scientific
measurement or new findings that we've
gotten from this mission is confirmation
of the presence of methane on Mars so
methane is an organic compound and so
finding organics anywhere other than
Earth is a super important finding right
because it means if you can find the
building blocks of life perhaps there's
even more than just the building blocks
of life or perhaps in the past there was
more than the building blocks of life
and so the really interesting thing
about methane is methane has only two
ways of being produced one of them is
geological and origin such as you know
from vents underneath the ground from
all volcanic activity and if you find
methane it means it's been produced in
the last couple of hundred thousand
years which is actually relatively
recent or it could be due to biological
activities meaning when cows
and the bacteria and the guts of cows
and people when you when you digest food
you actually generate methane as part of
the enteric fermentation process so the
fact that we've actually found methane
on the surface of Mars means at some
point in the relatively recent past
couple hundred thousand years there's
something generating this methane
whether it's you know enteric
fermentation based or it is a geological
base we don't know but either one is
actually a very interesting recent
finding to suggest that the planet still
has a lot going on that we don't
understand and that was facilitated by a
specific measurement that we had onboard
our Rover so what is in the future
though and I think that's kind of where
we want a segue is we want to enable the
exploration for Humanity of other worlds
so where are we gonna go next we're
already up on space station right but
space station is low Earth orbit
it's a microgravity environment we're
still protected by the Van Allen
radiation belts that protect us really
nasty sort of deep space radiation so we
really do want to explore other worlds
and Mars is a great place to go because
it has resources on the surface right it
may have a lot of access to water just
below the surface we have access to co2
in the atmosphere which we could convert
into methane actually for a fuel
purposes and it has a gravity
environment which is relatively you know
it 1/3 G is better than zero G in terms
of how human beings you know start
should great as they operate in a zero-g
environment so we have to be able to
create the next suite of technologies
which enable us to send people to Mars
and by doing these robotic exploration
missions we go a long way to develop the
initial parts of those technologies but
when you send people there you have to
send a lot larger quantities of
materials and food and matter so you
kind of have to increase it by an order
of magnitude and so that's what we're
working on hopefully next within our
lifetimes you never know I think that is
kind of the goal that we would be able
to send somebody
tomorrow's within our lifetimes and all
of that is facilitated by the
technologies that we develop across all
sectors I would say in our economies and
so if you are going to send people to
Mars you do have to have habitable
vehicles right because you because of
the low pressure environment you have to
be able to drive around safely on the
surface of the planet and you also have
to be able to protect yourself from the
radiation environment that you see on
the surface of the planet so what we do
today in these missions facilitates how
we're gonna send people there at some
point in the future and then something
you should really think about is would
you actually want to live on the surface
of another world and would you actually
want to live on the surface of Mars
because when this finally happens people
are going to have to move right just
like not have to move but they're gonna
choose to move like they did when you
know we explored the West or when we had
the you know initial exploration to
different parts of the new world over
the course of human history and so we
all have to take a step back and think
do we want to become Martians but what's
really interesting about that is that if
you do go to Mars and you had children
on Mars your children are going to
develop in an environment of a totally
different you know gravitational pull so
they probably will never ever be able to
go back to earth because their hearts
would be too weak they wouldn't be able
to survive probably in a 3G environment
for 3 Mars g environment for their
entire left of their lives and so it
really is an interesting precipice that
we're on right now in terms of going and
exploring these other worlds and what it
takes to get us there and I think that's
why we do what we do and that's
ultimately why we're engaging space
agencies around the world to do it and
so what is next over the horizon is kind
of up to us it's our choice I will say
that whenever we have these types of
missions you can think of it as it's
purely a amazing engineering and
scientific feat so all of our vehicles
are built by scientists and engineers
all of the data that we collect actually
goes directly onto the web so that
people can access it the finding that I
showed you of water on Mars actually
came from a graduate student at Georgia
Tech who analyzed data from an
instrument onboard the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter and made it a
determination them indeed those dark
streaks was actually coming from the
subsurface was water on Mars so all of
this stuff is available to us and it's
essentially of the future of humanity
and so you know the Europeans are
actually landing on Mars in October
they're very for their second attempt at
landing beagle wasn't successful the
second attempt is this entry
deceleration module which is going to
land the indian space agency they sent a
orbiter around mars which was successful
and they did that i think last year when
they arrived and i think in the middle
of there's a Middle Eastern country also
going to be sending an orbiter tomorrow
so it definitely is in the confines of
the future and everything
we do is a coupling of engineering from
a hardware perspective engineering from
a software perspective as well as
working with the scientific community to
get the information that we need so I
think that I don't think there's time
for questions but if you do have any
questions feel free to send me a tweet
or send me a message on Facebook and
I'll use your respond to answer any
engineering questions so thank you
