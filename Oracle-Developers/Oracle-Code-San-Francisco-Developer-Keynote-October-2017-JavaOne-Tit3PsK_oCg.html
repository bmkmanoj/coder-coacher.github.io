ladies and gentlemen please take your
seats our program is about to begin
believe every human being is a potential
coder physical mind somebody that likes
to solve puzzles someone who can work
within a team I think you're quite
meticulous you have to persevere you
Pantages enough to understand the logic
of the college have empathy for their
uses posting is patience like to solve
riddles
a good quarter is someone who can think
through fairly and implement their idea
into code ten years ago we're cutting
for computers but now everything is a
computer
a lot of the redundant and the
rudimentary stuff they do as the
developer will be taken over by these
automated processes things like human
brain interfaces and machine learning
and neural networks potentially a new
language sap-sucking exist yet still
believe we have a bright future
despite the self-driving cars and the
artificial intelligence interacting with
our keyboard last layouts I think we're
gonna see a lot more voice interaction
with devices hopefully not computers
coding themselves it would be like how
it's called the singularity right
I think it's unlucky I code because I
love for me it's like a brain puzzle
because I'm a builder and I I ran out of
LEGO bricks there's a lot of creative
juices that slogan I write for clothes a
lot making interested in coding stuff
it's a fascinating wide-open field where
you can do anything you absolutely want
to do having a problem that you turn
into a solution through code is one of
the most beautiful things in a job but I
can imagine doing
ladies and gentlemen please welcome
Bruno Borges and Stephen chin
hi teeth okay so welcome everybody to
Oracle code San Francisco and a Java one
thank you so much thank you so much for
being here thank you so much for being
part of a developer a great developer
community how many of you came for the
Oracle code event today the Tuesday
event great few great hands over there
thank you so much for being here
JavaOne attendees how many jump 1
attendees all right
lots of demo folks open word attendees
all right cool so we got a good mix and
I think the most important thing to
share here is what is Oracle code what
have been doing in the funny thing a
couple years ago Stephen and I did a
Java tour in Brazil and we decided let's
do 10 days driving a car in Brazil not
safe don't do that ever again so we
thought what if we could go bigger and
we thought about Oracle code events and
we decided let's go babe with this let's
go to 17 countries 20 cities around the
world we went to Asia we went to Latin
America we did here Canada in US and we
went to Europe plus we went to UK so
thank you so much for everyone who
participated and watch it all of our
content online with more than 350,000
viewers so you remember where we
announced the Oracle code event series
Virna I was mess here here an open-water
jump 1
yeah so anybody here for the community
keynote last year yeah a little noise
alright and that was where we announced
the conference series and we were crazy
we were we made 20 cities happen my
family's not talking to me but it was a
good it was a good we're back in San
Francisco now for the 21st events and it
was a great great show we had what do
you see at a developer lounge lots of
those experiences that you are
interacting over there we got some
versions of
at all of the 20 cities that we went to
and everyone could interact with all
those technologies Java JavaScript
databases cloud services containers etc
behind those experiences that Stephens
team with the collaboration with many
Oracle folks helped build and bring to
you again here this year so thank you
sniffing and thank you our team the
other thing that we want to talk about
is you guys you developers you know why
Java only you're right
sequel who writes sequel code here there
you go
everyone writes siegel code whether you
like it or not you're going to have to
write it who writes javascript code I
know you don't like it but you got to do
it but you also now writing Vogler files
who's running doctor files here today
all right cool lots of docker users and
you developers are writing all of that
together so when we thought about that
we figure like you know Oracle code
cannot be only about Java it cannot only
be about database or JavaScript it has
to be about everything everything that
you developers do on your job or for fun
so we thought about that and we also
thought maybe our initiative should
maybe change and to talk about that I
would like to let Steven speak sure so
I'd like to announce we're making a big
change for for my team in particular
which is the Oracle technology Network
group so we decided we want to have more
engagement with people with you guys
with the community with developers we we
consider all those things for
anaesthetise developers so database
administrators database developers
people doing JavaScript Java new
languages like Rustin go and our new
team name and identity is Oracle
developer community so you've probably
seen this around the conference we do
engagements at events we do lots of cool
demos and we engage with you guys
the community so thank you for everyone
who was part of OGN for decades you are
now automatically automatically part of
the Oracle developer community and we
welcome all developers to be part of
this community as well moving forward so
thank you everyone for that matched also
we have the developer portal which
stiffened can talk a little bit more as
well yeah so demo developer of Oracle
comm is a new site which we actually
launched last year at JavaOne
and we've really turned it into a great
technology resource we have videos from
awesome folks like luca cedar you can
see up here we have technology articles
we have examples of how to implement and
use different languages together with
oracle cloud and some of our products
and it's a great resource for you guys
to learn more about what we do and also
about the events we've been talking
about so it's also the portal for all
the Oracle code events including this
one not only that the way we reach out
to the community the way we really the
community together has also changed we
did a rebrand on our social media
properties to reflect that this is about
developer community not about a network
of technologies this is about you guys
so we have changed we changed the
twitter handle we change the brand the
logos on facebook on youtube channel we
did a lot of changes and we are now also
introducing our Oracle devs on medium
which if you have an article to
contribute about Oracle technologies
about open source technologies working
together with Oracle we'll be happy to
take that as part of that aggregation
channel and Steven what else what else
do we have so you can also do a lot of
online activities as follow-up from what
you're learning at the conference here
so we have massive open online courses
or MOOCs which we run where you can sign
up and train we have Oracle code online
which is the online complement for the
conference series where you can watch
videos you can interact with the
speakers through moderated chat a
developer newsletter we launched where
we're highlighting all the new features
and our
and content that we have for developers
across containers microservices Java
JavaScript Oracle zip labs so this is
happening in the developer lounge
you can grab well first grab yourself a
nice beer at our iot-cloud brewed beer
and then sit down and do some hacking at
our Oracle zip labs and we have a
leaderboard and we're giving out prizes
at the end of the conference for the top
folks and finally engage with our
advocates and our larger communities so
we kicked off a couple new advocacy
programs the Oracle developer legends
the Oracle developer champions and we're
also are creating an internal speaker
Bureau so you can engage with folks from
Oracle who implement the technologies
and the most important thing about is is
the community is important but
communicating properly with the
community is also important if you don't
communicate the right way through the
right channels you don't get access to
that community that community doesn't
get access to you so for us it's really
important for us to be where you are
where developers are and developers are
everywhere and that's what we are doing
with these Oracle code events going to
the cities instead of you know building
a huge mega chronic developer conference
for everyone to get 10,000 developers we
really thought you know we should be
where developers are so we went to
Prague we went to Beijing we went to
Bangalore Tokyo and get that and online
we are also doing that bringing that
content to where you guys are so
communication is key that's important
for us that's important for you that's
important for the developer community
and to talk even more about
communication I'd like to welcome the
stage from slack buster
okay okay okay Thank You Buster and I
take your you can take you look like
sweet thank you very much thank you
right hello everyone I'm Buster Benson
I'm the head of platformer product at
CELAC and I am here to talk about all
how we can build onto this black
platform a little better so to start I
would also like to just say that I am a
developer myself and I have a lot of
empathy for building on the platforms
and we try to bring that sort of empathy
to how we build our own platform so to
start
how many pillar slack enthusiasts or
slack developers yourselves here awesome
cool so that means I can tell you all
the rest of you exactly what slack is
slack is a messaging platform and it's
used it mostly for internal
communication within companies but we're
starting to sort of test the boundaries
and help you also expand slack
communication to other companies with
recent launch of shared channels and
internationalization so we're a young
company especially compared to say
Oracle and but we're going quickly and
the interesting thing about slack is
that people you know there's 50,000
paying customers out there and almost 2
million daily users and these people are
really connected to slack on a you know
a timely basis 10 hours a day on average
and so this creates an interface for you
to create your tools to actually connect
with people that are working and talking
to each other so I was asking a wider
body customers find slacks so useful so
valuable and there's really two big
reasons I wanted to call out one of them
is that you know edits friend out other
foundation where you know we are really
trying to bridge the human-to-human
communication so we don't like to say
that we're a chat app but we at the very
foundation we do want to help people
communicate to each other and that means
not only just talking to each other the
people that you know but finding the
right people to talk to sometimes you
have a question for a group sometimes
you have a question for some or someone
that you don't even know if they're in
the company or not by doing this in
small bite-size pieces and not having to
necessarily broadcast it all the time
we're not necessarily trying to kill
meetings or kill email but we
trying to take the value that you get
out of those things and help you make
faster higher quality decision so it's
taking the stuff that you don't really
have to do that are a little bit slower
and making them faster so building on
this you know it's coming communication
layer that's the foundation to the
platform so it's it's on and we think of
the platform as a operating system for
work so not only humans and humans
communicating but you know more and more
every company especially these larger
companies are using hundreds if not
thousands of different kinds of software
every day and so how do you you might be
a person that uses the terminal or text
editor or so like a designed app or a
ticketing system but and you might use
that really deeply we're not trying to
change that what we're trying to do is
take the other 997 products that your
company uses and make those give those
an interface that make the best light
and usable and doesn't force you to go
and click on a link and find a password
and login or request an account that
kind of stuff so bringing all that
context from all these tools into the
conversation in the human friendly way
so when you do this not only does the
context come in but you can actually
make quick contextual actions and
decisions and sort of see eye-to-eye on
a lot of things without having to leave
the conversation you don't have to say
things like I'll be I'll get back to
your we can take this offline as much
and and the end result is really to feel
that you're on top of everything that
everything that's happening is stuff
that you understand and it's all part of
the conversation so very quickly we have
a big developer community is very
thriving these 155 tiles and more
developers each one of these could be a
team we're a company in itself we have a
thousand apps in adapt directory and we
have a slack fund that invest in
companies that are doing really
interesting things on our platform it's
really sort of stepping into this larger
external trend which is that apps and
especially apps in conversations are
becoming indispensable for work there
will be a day when you know we won't be
able to imagine having to go out into
every single individual tool and work
with it individually and so we're trying
to sort of further that that future
that's coming
and so some of the hints that this is
working we do have a thousand apps if
you go to slack comm slash apps if you
haven't been there recently every just
pass a thousand and almost you'll be
surprised at not only the variety and
the sort of diversity of the kinds of
tools that are there but the quality is
also getting better every single one of
these groups of developers is sort of
learning and learning from each other
oftentimes and actually getting better
over over time and the proof is in the
fact that over 90 percent of the paid
teams that are using slack are using
apps and it's not just you know it's not
all giffy it's actually really
work-related tools I'll do i do love
goofy and each one of these apps has
been reviewed and validated to be useful
for work so that's really really the
best of the best is in this directory so
we also launched Enterprise earlier this
year and we've been learning a lot about
how slacking scale not only performance
wise but with what the features and the
product itself to work really well for
larger customers and what we're learning
is that you know every single big
company out there that's using slack or
using you know apps is is special in a
very specific way they each have their
own custom installations of software
they each have their own custom
configurations process says all this
stuff is very special so we can't
necessarily take things out of the box
and make them work but there are some
things I'm going to go through them
really quickly is that some things that
every company in every role every person
of the company wants to do better and so
you might recognize some of these things
very quickly um so one how many of you
want to know about important things
happening hmm a few of you okay I think
it's sort of a thing that we a lot of us
want to do so this can be not only like
when something's breaking or something's
on fire but also just like how's the
business doing how's this team doing
what's the status of this you know
objective so we can use pull that
information into slack and let you know
about the stuff that's happening in a
timely manner one step beyond that is we
add some interactivity so sometimes a
notification is purely for your own
informational benefit sometimes it
requires some kind of step or an action
and you can put that action right in the
note note
itself and this means that if you get
this and you're you know walking to your
bus or you're in between meetings you
can actually get things done without
having to maybe potentially log in on
your phone or figure out where to do it
we have all the contexts in slack and we
can make those things happen quickly
number three so lots of links get passed
around we've learned is that you know
because there are so many tools out
there we're always sharing links and
trying to figure out you know how do we
get this information over here and pass
it on to it over there and so one of the
things that's really hard to do on the
on the web in general is pull
information from behind the links
because they often require login you
know they're behind a firewall that can
be a lot of things the reasons why it's
hard to find but we recently launched a
feature that lets the app sort of listen
to certain domains it could be internal
or external and pull that information
into the conversation so again you don't
have to you know have everyone click on
the link and go see what it is they can
actually pull the most important stuff
into the conversation and then continue
and move on so again you can add some
action ability to that as well to make
that more interactive one thing we just
launched last week
is dialogue so we've talked a lot about
bringing context into the conversation
we also realize that it's important to
pass that context back out so whatever
whatever the internal tools are that
you're building whatever the products
and services that you're integrating
with sometimes it's important to get
that comment or that categorization or
tag or assignee back out into the tool
and so we launched dialogues recently
and so this again make the two-way flow
of context really seamless so the one
I'm most excited about is BOTS obviously
and so there are a lot of BOTS out there
and they're really hard to make but
we're learning that there's a couple
simple things you can do to make them a
little bit easier to know what both
build and use one of them is you know
just facilitate human connections don't
it's one of my favorites that I like to
call that a lot they just let you create
a channel in slack and every couple
weeks they pair you up with someone to
go get coffee or doughnut and the cool
thing about this is that because it's in
slack the app also the bot also knows
that who you talked to you regularly it
appears you with someone that you don't
talk to normally on your day to day
basis it's a really interesting way to
just take that infant
in a light way and use it for something
to serendipity meet more people at your
company so lastly I want to pull it all
together so this is all feature stuff
but how do you actually make this a
thing that makes your work life simpler
here's an example Joe is an engineer on
the ops team she's you know getting a
notification from somewhere possibly
page or duty that says hey there's a lot
of errors coming through she
investigates a little bit and decides
that this it should be escalated to an
incident so she talks she talks to
server bot says let's start an incident
and so Rabat replies saying ro happy to
help okay let's do this ask for a few
details we use dialogues to you know
choose an incident commander to get a
brief summary of the incident and to
then that goes back out to the app and
you can do anything with that you can
create another you can create an issue
you can sort of notify the right people
you also send a message back into the
channel timestamp it you know and create
a channel for the further discussion of
this incident to continue in there you
hop into this incident channel and the
bot knows hey whenever this kind of
thing happens let's pull in these three
people that are you know part of the
incident management crew and also here's
a quick way to sort of keep it'll by
peeing the channel every once in a while
for status it's just he keeps the normal
stuff that you'd have to do every single
time a little bit easier and then
eventually Jose decides like okay yeah
this is this is definitely a problem
here's the chart that actually displays
the error Ray's spiking and I'm going to
link to it it's post into an internal
dashboard but server BOTS listening for
that URL and pulls in the chart directly
so you can continue the conversation
people don't have to fly around trying
to dig up these things so that's sort of
showing how unfurls and notifications
and dialogs and all that work together
and then after this into the wraps up
the bot could then summarize the channel
back into the book main channel and move
on and it's actually just making that
process that we all do normally a little
bit more human-friendly
alright so key point is that like there
are people the reason I'm here is there
are people at every company that builds
these processes and tools that we all
use and if we go away like the company
falls apart so how do we make it easier
to build these things and really our job
at slack to make sort of give you that
power to do that and
to make things like design an interface
make things like connecting to the API
really simple and easy to use and even
pleasant so I encourage you to if you
haven't go check out api dot-com that's
where all the documentation is but also
just think there's a thousand apps out
there some of them are out-of-the-box
solutions but some of them are also
customizable and configurable to tie
things together in new ways so they
could both be the answer and I encourage
you to go look and try to find that
simplest one that solves your problem so
thank you very much for having me here
it's great to be up here as good as to
you all
so thanks mustard thank you very much
so on I'm using slack work with using
slack we have 30,000 developers using
slack and the reason we use lack is to
communicate better and we the reason we
do that is to build our cloud and to
talk about our cloud I love to welcome
the stage arm it's a very thank you
think of it thanks
hello good afternoon hope you guys are
having a good open-world Java 1 and code
event we have an exciting session
planned here today what we wanted to do
was give you an idea of how the life of
a developer has changed and what are the
things we are doing at Oracle to make
your life easier and use a lot of the
latest technologies which are getting
evolving in this space right so if you
look at I think it's a great and
exciting time for developers for sure
there's the wave you should build
applications before and how we build now
is night and day and much better as well
in terms of how you really build blended
experiences done dynamically instead of
having to do hard-coded elements the the
dev lifecycle and the time to deliver an
app has reduced drastically you're
delivering a lot of new updates on a
daily or hourly basis you should do long
1218 month
release cycles which is no longer is the
case anymore
the teams are very distributed and every
developer likes to bring their own stack
on technology stack which they would
like to use so you have different
preferences where before used to have a
very centralized team where all the
engineering was all defined very well
structured and you didn't have a choice
of what you would use to build your
application components are much smaller
now a lot of micro services based
architecture versus monolithic
applications also you're doing lot of
engaging interfaces now which is using a
lot of mobile applications very
innovative look and feel against it as
well as BOTS which we'll share with you
in terms of what's going on in that area
as well versus building another app
which looks the same at most of the time
and API first design if you look at how
the new generation is building
applications is really thinking of api's
first in terms of how the interactions
would be instead of thinking about the
functionality from the beginning but
with this it's not a lot of challenges
as well
right the new application development
requires a lot of different things in
the platform one you need to be able to
support polyglot programming languages
as well as micro services which which
landed up scaling out you want to have
elastic scaling with that you need to be
able to have containerize application
running in your platform and support the
whole lifecycle around the containers as
well I need to have really good DevOps
processes cloud ready tools which give
you
ability to build those applications
easily a lot of monitoring is required
if you have a distributed application is
very hard to know where the bottlenecks
are where the issues are so you really
need smart performance monitoring and
then be able to deliver those
applications very quickly as well so for
that we've been working at Oracle for
many years to build out a cloud platform
I will share with you what we have today
as well
but the key thing we have delivered is
the ability to for application developer
to build applications and deploy that be
able to integrate an extend existing
application we will publish a lot of
content and engage users be able to
analyze and predict actions and secure
and manage your infrastructure your
platform as well as applications as well
so this is an innovative platform with
comprehensive
open and integrated and hybrid kind of a
offering which is highly scalable
intelligent secure and we make it
available globally as well so instead of
me kind of covering all the different
aspects of it what we decided was to
give you guys a demo scenario which will
show you how easy it is to build some of
this next-generation application we took
an idea of buying a used car which is
probably the most financially right
thing to do versus buying a leased or a
new car but this very problematic as
well you don't know how what the pricing
should be we do another vehicle history
so what we have decided is to really
show you how easily you can create a
chatbot application using a messaging
based service where you can take a
picture of a car a license plate be able
to send that back to a micro service in
the backend using a lot of the api's we
provide and get the data back with the
history from services like car fax for
example and be able to send that
information back to the user in few
seconds instead of having to get an app
for a used car because you probably
don't abide that often we will show you
how quickly we can do this using some of
the micro services an API so we bring
together the ability to design and
develop api's be able to build and
deploy those as a chatbots and how micro
services architecture underneath the
covers as well as security associated
with that so you make sure your
application is secure as well to
showcase that let me invite Jacob from a
development team who will give you a
walkthrough about what we can do with
the API design and development Jacob
welcome Jacob thanks I mean let's show
them what you can do with a tea ice
absolutely thank you so I'm developer by
background myself you know about five
years ago I went to a hackathon and over
48 hours I've built a quick project for
documenting and designing and testing
and prototyping api's and then we kept
building on it and building on it and
building on it and this year we ended up
acquired by Oracle so when I meet wanted
some api's he reached up to me and said
hey Jacob we said we should build some
api s-- together and my developer nature
here I would always of course say let me
just code it and I'll be done next week
of course but then I kind of remembered
many many times that have done that
before
and how that can go wrong and most of
the things that go wrong is that I
actually build an API that nobody wants
to use because I didn't really stop and
think why people need that API or what
they need the API for
so one of the things that we've built at
a theory is a very quick solution for
you to document an API upfront and to
get a mock server to prototype your API
to give that API to somebody to try to
use it before you really go down the
route of developing and of course
eventually you have a specific contract
you have a specific documentation for
your API you go and build it but then
because you already have a document if
you don't have to reverse-engineer it at
the end and document it later and it
just serves as a very good foundation
for the rest of the cycle when you're
building api's so I wanted to show you a
quick demo today but before I do that I
want to quickly show you what the
architecture looks like for our product
at Oracle so we have two different parts
of what we call API platform today a
design engine called apiary that came
with the acquisition earlier this year
that's typically used by API designers
developers like yourself that are
thinking about building an API but just
want some feedback first it's kind of
like readme driven development just
write down what you're going to build
and show it to somebody and then once
you have an API that's developed and you
want to expose it out to the public you
might want to put a gateway in front of
it and you know manage the security
policies for example and so that's a
different role for an API manager to go
into our API platform
management portal and really kind of
configure all of the management policies
that are in there and of course those
two products work seamlessly together
and the most important thing to take
configure are these gateways that allow
the applications
well actually the gateways one of the
great things about them is you can put
them in any cloud that you want to you
can put them into your own plug you can
put them you can run them on premise you
can run them on your own computer and
they periodically configure check with
our management server for the current
latest security policies and and and and
gateway policies for for accessing your
API and then you can expose through
those gateways API to your applications
you can take those gateways and put them
into any environment has discussed into
Oracle cloud I require which you can run
it on premise so it's a really really
powerful and comprehensive solution but
it starts with API design and I want to
show you today how you can get an API
out and done in five minutes so our
first live product demo fingers crossed
that it works let's switch to the
computer all right that's not the screen
perfect so this is intro screen for
apiary it's got over 300,000 developers
already building API using the theory I
don't know if there's anybody in the
audience that or all right you guys are
awesome perfect for the rest of you that
was not paid by the way thank you for
the rest of you there's a free sign up
so go ahead and sign up today it's not a
trial it's not time limited for
developers it's free once you have a
really really large company you might
want to pay for it but for developers
it's free so go ahead and check it out
once you log into apiary you can very
quickly use several different languages
that you can take to choose and describe
an API this one here is an API for the
used cars that Amit talked about that
I've built for him and it's really just
a flavor of markdown it's really not all
that complicated describes you know the
resources the parameters that are
required or optional data that gets
returned from the API and I have a
real-time documentation rendered on the
right side so the moment I make any
changes they just get reflected
automatically in fact I get this
documentation built out of the box just
the moment I type out
a couple comments in markdown and so I
can take that and give that out to
whoever is going to be building the
client that acts that is actually
building the chat button on top of the
API for for for buying cars so this is
the documentation that not only
describes how the API works and I can
click on a specific resource for example
here and it specifically tells me I know
the code is really small here but you
know I have many different code examples
in different languages on how to access
the API in fact let me copy out this
curl command here and try a bit of a
life API const age what could possibly
go wrong and there you go i got a
response right back from the mach server
i didn't actually write any api
obviously i just documented it but the
documentation is already prototype on
its own so that's a real HTTP api out
there that you can call and get
responses back so that's great for me to
give it out to another developer and
tell them is this what you want to use
or do you have any feedback and you know
what's going to happen already of course
they're going to have feedback right so
you're going to start making changes and
those changes are going to result in
versions and then maybe multiple
different people are going to be
overriding each other so for that reason
we have an ability to take this
documentation of the api or the
specification and put it out on github
so I actually have this file out on
github and the moment I make a change
here I can you know make a change and
push it out to github and it creates a
new comment or I can create a new branch
here and I can say hey hello hello
Oracle code and I just create a new
branch and maybe if the Internet is
merciful and I get a good Wi-Fi
connection I push it out to github and
if I switch to my github repo that's
linked up
I can click click on the drop down menu
and I can see my new branch created just
here so there's a bi-directional sync
whatever I do in my repo in github get
synced up to the apiary the
documentation station up-to-date the
mock server stays up-to-date and it's a
really really powerful way to start
prototyping an API very quickly and once
you're ready with the API then you can
continue use the definition file to load
it up into our gateway and use it to
configure your policies but
for a later stage one last thing that
I'll show you here is a very nifty
feature often times at least in many
companies that I've been and we've been
fighting over what the API should look
like we've had many different teams
building slightly different api's and
there's all these standards and you know
requirements about how the URL should
look like and how the data structures
should look like and so for that purpose
we've built an ability in apiary for you
to define how your API should look like
but they're not really kind of hard and
harsh policies they're just little kind
of syntax highlights that you can see
here that says hey look I have a rule
here that an ID in a JSON should usually
be a UUID and it shouldn't just be an
integer and so it automatically actually
detected it here I have a UUID over here
at the top and if I just copy it and
paste it so that you can see that it'll
go away
and I replace this integer with a UUID
boom and the error shoot validating
should go away once I hit the Save
button or I had a life life issue there
you go
okay well it should go away but this is
a really powerful way for you to start
building api's even in larger companies
and larger contexts so that about
concludes my demo you can get started
today I'm sure you can get started with
an API in five minutes and we should
probably switch back to the presentation
now all right pickup thank you so tell
us sir
this is very exciting it's great to have
the apiary team and you at Oracle and
the work you guys are doing is very very
impressive tell us what are you
announcing at open world and at the code
event to talk about what are you doing
for developers and how are you helping
them we have absolutely you know over
the last couple years we've built out
apiary to be the largest API design
platform in the world where is over
three hundred thousand developers but
today we're announcing this kind of
unified product between apiary and API
platform that covers not only
prototyping and designing API but also
running them in production and securing
them and deploying them and so we will
have this completely seamless solution
across the full lifecycle from the start
to the end all integrated in a way that
makes you developers excited somebody
thank you great thank you
so the second part of the demo we wanted
to show is how you build the
microservices associated with what Jacob
showed you in terms of the api's so let
me invite Anand qatari from the
development team to walk us through some
of those scenarios as well
oh come on good evening so now we saw
how the API is were designed the next
step is to obviously implement them and
we talked I will talk about the
capabilities we have in our cloud
ecosystem to help you implement and
manage these apx so first thing to do to
ever any kind of micro services
development or any kind of development
is to make sure you have a development
lifecycle with built in CIC detuning
that's what exactly we have in our
ecosystem a complete and comprehensive
development tool that brings in the CI
CD the continuous integration delivery
of these kind of applications you can do
agile development right in that pool
pill just sprints manage them etc you
can do team collaboration
it has source code management and you
can do clear reviews and collaborate
around those source code you can use our
built-in tools as well as our
integration with slack it supports all
kinds of languages and not just building
applications on different languages if
you are using cloud services it's a
single tool that will allow you to do
application development and and delivery
onto all our past services well once you
develop those application in this
environment you need to run them
somewhere you need to deploy them so
that's the next capability you would
take these applications and deploy into
our R or micro services into our
polyglot runtime what it is it's an
automated system it does container
management for you and it provides you
an elastic and highly available
container run time it takes your code
essentially you just push your code into
it and you'll run it into this automated
fully managed container management
solution it is designed for running
lightweight modern twelve facto style
applications supports all kinds of
languages and you don't have to worry
about this of any kind of container
management just push the court will do
the rest you can bring in your own
containers enough said I'll show you how
these two ecosystem comes together on
this demo okay so I am just want to make
sure I'm in the right place and we are
not timed out run this is our developer
service I am in the chat bot project for
this project we had to build those five
micro services Jacob just talked about
on the front page you're seeing all the
project activities that are going on in
this project
each of these micro services are
different get repo there is a built in
source control and it's backed by git
I'm going to jump onto one of them this
micro service was built in Java I can
easily go and browse any code make chain
make some edits push it in and it will
trigger the build after that I can also
do our agile process management right
inside this developer tool I have a
little spring for these two weeks of
October one still tasks in progress once
completed I can create new tasks assign
it to developers they can make changes
and when they push their app code into
the source code repository it's going to
automatically associate that change with
with the issue finally when the code is
ready to be checked in you want to build
that codes there is a continuous build
ecosystem within this developer service
I have five different bills for them
five micro services let me get into one
of them if I go into this vehicle
history one you will see all the
historical bills that have happened you
see the output of the bills the target
artifacts these are the artifacts that
you would take and push it into the app
container or the polyglot environment
you can easily configure your bills here
define your triggers define your build
steps and once the code is checked then
you can I could do a build now but
essentially that's not what you would do
you check in a code and that would
automatically trigger off the build and
when the build is done you want to
automatically deploy it so for that very
simple go to the deployment
a console and create a configuration
that essentially gets triggered off off
of a complete build in this case I have
five already created and they target
that build our defect on to our polyglot
platform so I'm going to jump onto that
platform right from here and it'll take
me to the application container this is
where all these applications all this
different micro services are running as
you can see there are a couple of node
and three java-based micro services easy
get into one of them and you'll see that
it's running a couple of instances each
one is one good memory you'll get health
information right off of the main screen
the overview page if this service and in
this case it does if your service need a
backing service like a database you can
easily bind your application on to a
back back in service in this case I
bound it to a database cloud service you
can bind to anything and the platform
will take care of associating them
securing them making sure that those two
services can talk to each other you
don't have to worry about it as a
developer finally updates are pushed
this application happened to be built on
Java 8 released Java 9 automatically
there is a notification that there is
Java 9 would you like to update we'll
click on an update and I will do a
rolling update for you so that you don't
have any downtime so zero downtime
updates now you would do all of this
typically as a developer on using CLI
using REST API using different DevOps
tool I'm just showing in DUI but
everything that I did here is available
for you to do it from your command line
so you never have to go to this console
so with that I can I just showed you the
two capabilities want to develop your
application and then the other one where
you would push that code and run it in
that in that app container environment
we can jump back to the slides and I
talked about will talk about the another
initiative that we have been talk in
hansung here so I we we have seen a
trend around containers
and kubernetes i'm i saw a lot of hands
go up when we were talked about how many
of you do docker or container centric
development we are super excited because
we are announcing a set of capabilities
specifically around container centric
development for that it's very much
similar to what I showed the first thing
you need is a CI CD platform that is
container centric for that we acquired a
company called worker which specializes
in doing continued development gives you
a pipeline to take your code create your
containers and deploy it into a
kubernetes environment well the next
step is to give you a managed kubernetes
this is based off the CNC F we have part
of that foundation we are actively
working on different projects within
within that foundation and we the
platform will give you an easy way to
set up and manage this kubernetes
cluster whether n main monitor and them
through components like Prometheus or
even our Oracle management cloud this
runs on our cloud infrastructure finally
on top of that an experience to build
micro services and functions in a
container centric manner right you must
have heard about the the announcement we
made in Java one where the open source
the function FN project dot IO this is
essentially where we have open source
our functions framework if you haven't
checked out and crazy to check out all
of that into one single container
application development platform for
developers a nice thanks I think you
mentioned that a lot of new things we're
doing on the runtime area and as you saw
from the demo you get an idea of how
extensive the platform is so one
important part of the platform of course
is around how to make sure everything is
secured I mean here about all this cyber
security threats and breaches and to
kind of show you how our platform kind
of built-in security inherently instead
of kind of bolting it on
I'll have Arun walk us through some of
those elements welcome all right thanks
thanks good afternoon
so as you are building these
applications in the cloud you can no
longer bolt on security to the
infrastructure most of the cases you
don't even own the infrastructure
anymore so the challenge is as a
developer how can you provide security
integrated in the app itself so that
your CFO whose credentials got pawned
does not login from Ukraine so how do
you do that
so we I'm going to talk about two
products that we have the identity cloud
service and the Oracle Java cloud
service the cloud access security broker
the identical out service acts as the
Federation for authentication on
authorization and the Casbah service
monitors the risk attribute of users and
entities that the users of your further
users of your application so in this
case a bad or malicious actor tries to
log into your api's the API sends the
Federation SSO request to ID CS ID says
asks Caspi hey this is the user logging
in from this IP address what is the risk
the threat score for this user task B
responds with that I see a very high
risk because the IP address is
suspicious and I have looked up I have a
Intel feed from the dark web and I can
see that this credential has been hacked
so it gives a very high risk score and
ID CS can either step up or thent
occation at that time or deny access at
that time so it can do a multi-factor
authentication or deny access to the
user at that time so this prevents
malicious access in for your application
rather than you having to redeploy the
application with rotated credentials and
doing downtime for your application so
let me show you the console of this
application how it works this is our
console in which we have three cloud
applications that we are looking at you
have a map view of what all these
applications are some of the key
security indicators and the threats in
live feed of your applications of a
is data points this is some of the risk
events now here this API app I am
looking at and I am seeing some
brute-force attack going on on this API
app I can drill down in this one and see
more details about the threat and what I
see is that there are multiple times
people have tried to log into this
application and they have failed right
this is more than normal and this has
happened in past couple of days and this
is for a particular user I go into the
details of the user and I see a very
high user risk score because the number
of login events that I see for this user
are exceptionally high normally this
user logs in ten times this time is
trying to log in five hundred times
although there were 75 failed events the
other events kind of show that the user
got in some malicious user garden
similarly the API is the other api's are
called order of magnitude times higher
then they are called normally in
addition if you go and look at the
details you see that the user is login
logging in from all over the world the
attempts the events that we are tracking
are coming from all over the world so
combine that data with the number of
login events the anomaly's anomalous
activity that we are seen in this for
this user means that this account has
been compromised but in this case most
of these security admins will shut down
the access rebuild the whole application
rotate the credentials and make it live
again in our case you can just suspend
the user directly from here we will
coordinate with I DCs and suspend the
user here so this provides the framework
for doing that automation of preventing
malicious users from accessing your
cloud applications you can also automate
this this is I am showing you in our
console you can run this completely
headless using api's and orchestrating
this whole workflow using api's and
writing your own scripts for that we
have api's for getting risk or we have
api's for federating identities you have
api's for taking preventing action to
step-up authentication or deny
authentication actions for various users
so that was
demo of this so I don't just good for
everybody to understand what how you
guys also doing the cloud security what
did you announce this week so we are
coming out with an sdk which will allow
drop of various SDKs in node Python and
Java so you can use that with few lines
of code you can integrate any identity
store you can integrate any identity
stored whether it's on frame or in the
cloud or social identities and integrate
it in your application with a few lines
of code on Caspi we announced our API is
to pull this risk force from tasbeeh for
in real time how users are while they
are accessing the application and
protection for various cloud services
that already exists in Caspi perfect
thank you thanks for it so now that we
have built all this infrastructure for
it and that the platform the next thing
I wanted to show the last part of the
demo was you can really create a chat
bot with this so sue Haase will show us
how easy it is to build a chat bot
thanks I'm it I'm actually going to skip
slide so can you just get back to my
laptop and people have bored of things
lights so you guys saw you know Jacob
Kim climbing mock-up in API you saw on
and comment develop an API and build a
micro service and around here just
secured it so let's look at the exciting
stuff that people actually interact with
all the services that have done so I
want to take my demo in two parts first
I'm actually going to demo interacting
and and so the whole aspect of what what
I'll show you here is a conversational
UI or interacting with a box so here I
have finished this bot and I'm using
Facebook Messenger to start with this so
I'm going to still hello to the bot and
say hi and my network is up yes it is up
great this is just to make sure that it
knows that I'm talking to a body says
I'm a bot and you can get information
about any used car or any information
you have about this car so I'm going to
say you know what I'm going to upload an
image so it asks me to upload an image
so I click on the image usually we would
have a car here but we couldn't of the
car here so I'm just going to pick some
images from my standard stuff and it
said now what's happening in the back
here is that we have our AI component
that's actually processing this image
and integrating with all the api's and
rebuilding micro-services that were
built before and it did figure out that
it is is a Tesla Model S and here's the
information the reading etc again
getting information from the back-end
systems and asked me if I'd like to see
more about the card history I say yes
and connect there we go and it sort of
gives me some more information one owner
one recall excited no accident history
that's so that's good and it asks me if
I'm interested in purchasing this car
and if I wanted to hear the price
recommendation now as part of our AI
engine I'll talk about the internals in
a minute we also provide a
recommendation engine so you can
basically connect that and program that
to send other kinds of recommendations
or information to the end user so it
basically says well the recommended
price here is 64 K and so and so forth
and also that based on my zip code on my
location it identified that there are
similar cars in that area and if I
wanted to see any and I'm going to say
yes and hopefully connect and there we
go so it's basically gone and got some
new cars from there so here's the the
obi-wan car some more p90s and a blue
sedan s and are in a red Tesla model
right so this was again you know just to
give you an idea of what a
conversational interaction is with the
bot again this is using machine learning
in the backhand and and again when you
look at sort of occasional uses of apps
there's no need to now download an app
and keep it maintained here's something
I can use with interfaces that I'm used
to in this case I use facebook Messenger
but I could have done the same thing
with Skype or reach out or whatsapp or
line telegram or even integrated with
amazon.com or that you could see
pictures on that but you could still
interact with any of the voice channels
and so on so forth
now that you've seen what a
conversational UI looks like let me just
jump into what it takes to build one of
these so if I can get to my builder here
I'm gonna make it a little bit larger so
you can see it so what we have I'll go
back to the sort of the main screen here
and increase that font here so this is
sort of the bought Builder that's part
of the Oracle cloud platform and there
are really sort of three major
components of what we do or make three
major parts to building a bot the first
part is where I configure and train the
machine learning models to understand
how to interact with the user so it's
what we call the management of the NLU
engine the second part is designing the
dialogue so the back-and-forth of the
head with the bot is basically what we
call the conversational designer or the
design aspects of the dialogue the third
part is the integration and integration
has two components to it one is the
component of integrating to the
front-end ie the channels that I would
be integrating with in this case I use
Facebook Messenger but I could use any
one of the other ones I mentioned
earlier or and integrating to the
backend in other words consuming the
services that my team built earlier on
so I'm going to select the used car
purchase this is sort of the bot and
increase the font again here and so the
first thing we do in defining the the
great thing about our platform here is
that I don't need petabytes megabytes
kilobytes of data for my model to get
trained okay the way it works is that I
can just break it very quickly started
by defining what I call an intent and an
intent is essentially just defining what
the users asking and categorizing them
the bucket so I can actually take action
on that
so here it's a very simple bot we have
just two intense one where someone says
hello to the bot greeting and I come and
I just start with some very sample
phrases hello hi and that's good enough
for the bot to know that someone says hi
hello or howdy you know how to interact
with it and provide a greeting or when I
look at fetch numberplate
for license number again we just started
with about five occurrences where we
call enough sample phrases which is good
enough for the models to be trained and
we have multiple models that
automatically pick what's the best way
to train the model
as a linguistic model there's a neural
net deep learning model that uses a
combination of neural nets and and
special weird embedding to figure out
how to associate and how to determine
what the user is asking and I can test
this all in real time so we have a built
in component where I can test the baud
which is the interactions I was testing
this before to make sure I was connected
but also tests the first thing I do is
test how the NLU engine is working so
for example I can come and say you know
I have a license right and you determine
that is the fetch license type in 10 of
course granted there's only too intense
here but if I had 15 20 intents you know
it will figure out and give this ranking
this probability that you see on the
screen as well as for developers we go
into deep details you can see a full
JSON payload of exactly what words were
uttered by the user how the annual you
engine interpreted it how did break it
down and what probably did gave and for
any reason this was incorrect we can
literally just go select this other
radio button hit train and the model
begins to train itself again so a very
real time very agile and it can be just
do this constantly right so that's one
part of of what we call setting the of
the the NLU engine the second part is
what we call entity extraction so when I
go in and say you know how to buy a car
or buy a Tesla then in automatic that
Tesla is of a type car right or I want
to buy a car tomorrow it identifies that
it can take information that you've
input as the user and automatically
extract this thing as a date and time
concept why is this important because at
the end of the day I have to take all
this information I get from the user
process it and then create a payload
that I can now send back to the API
layer to perform an action right so the
entities essentially are think about
this as data types and there are either
system generated entities that are
already processed by the NLU engine so
things like address currency date
they're automatically pre-programmed so
if the user says can you deliver the car
to this address 1 2 3 4 5 whatever Lane
it'll automatically recognize that so as
a
/ I don't need to sit there and and code
all of that extract that from my payload
and say oh this is off type address so
let's map this to a GPS coordinate or
whatever it is it's automatically taken
care of by the by the Nou Engine so that
was the sort of how you be how we train
the machine learning aspects of the ball
the next part is the the bot builder in
this current version that's available
today we use a scripting language that's
a yama based format and we probably all
the variables on how you define it
essentially what we're building is a
very simple state engine but a very
powerful state engine where you can
determine sort of this dialogue with the
end user and have that pre integrated
with the NLU engine and this is sort of
where you maintain the state and context
of the dialogue right so I'm not going
to go through this in more detail and we
can have another session if you like on
how to define this dialogue but this is
going to get more and more advanced as
we continue to build on this the next
component here is the integration to the
systems of record so essentially what we
do is we have these what we call custom
components these are node.js or
JavaScript applications or components or
micro services that run in either a node
container or our application cloud
container and it's essentially hooking
into the micro services that the team
built earlier right so when we just
redesign and we deployed the micro
services we essentially use this custom
components to basically go and grab it
it could be a micro service it could be
a function call it's up to you how you
design this the final part to the the
bot builder is configuring the channels
so again we wanted to make it very
simple for you to integrate with all
these different channels now let me tell
you you can do this with web hooks it's
pretty straightforward but there's a lot
of heavy lifting that happens in
actually integrating this natively to
the to the to the channel because each
channel has a different way on how the
menu structures were the carousels look
and feel so they look and feel the UX
that you saw was a very sort of Facebook
led UX right
but if I run this in Skype I run this in
reach at whatsapp it's going to look
very different
and and with the plethora of different
channels we have it's a lot of work to
do so we actually take care of this so
we all literally just go and add a
channel so you see here our Facebook and
you basically get a couple of
information from Facebook like the page
access token or the app secret and we
provide a couple of our own token and a
web URL you put that into your developer
at facebook.com/ page and bingo you're
now connected in facebook you don't have
to worry about all the error messaging
handling all that happens in the
background as part of the bot okay so
I'm going to come back in of those the
end of the bot builder so that hopefully
give you an idea of what a
conversational interaction looks like
and what the bot builder does to build
these applications thank you so much
good so we also get a lot of
announcements around conversational AI
in the platform yeah really excited
that's two big announcements one is we
announced the conversational air part
from so it gives you access to all the
channels that we talked about yeah also
we want deeper into the AI services so
here you saw a little bit of the natural
language processing a little image
processing but we continue to add a lot
of depth into the AI the third thing is
we also announced a partnership with
chat box for building instant apps and
this is very important because as we
look at user experiences the chat bot is
really good for an unstructured
conversational interface but when you
want to collect or display a lot of
information you want some sort of a
structured information you don't go out
and have a mobile app this allows us to
marry those experiences give the user a
very delightful and present experience
perfect I think when one more thing I
think let me invite different slack back
they're absolutely gonna be he talked
about what slack is doing in for
enterprises we good to hear from him how
we can integrate slack into chat bot
boards welcome back thank you so tell us
I guess what are the exciting things you
guys are doing purses slack and
enterprises and how you see the chat bot
and the slack part working yeah so the
one of the biggest things we've learned
from larger companies is that it's the
internal integrations and the customized
stuff that really gets everyone excited
and
it's really balancing thoughtfully the
customization possibilities and the
flexibility but also keeping it simple
and I think what we're seeing here is
really taking the heavy lifting for you
know who wants to build that really hard
you know natural language processing
system they actually just want to build
the interaction and that's that's where
I see like you know a huge amount of
value how are you working with Oracle I
mean how are the things evolving there
yeah so we're really excited to have you
as a customer obviously and we're gonna
so we're going to learn a lot from just
working with you and building into the
spot rate I believe that there's already
apps and BOTS springing up since the
announcement here so excited to see what
happens
very good thank you thank you so you
want to show how yeah we can build this
integration into slack sure of it if you
can go back to the to the podium screen
so my team uh notion emilio sort of
behind my back literally we're building
some some slack bot and just this
morning they so they were going better
here's what you see on the screen is our
internal slack channel and they're sort
of going back and forth and I got
notified saying hey you know so as I
don't know if you're in customer
meetings but we've actually built a bot
for you and I killed you know this was
done at 236 feet p.m. this afternoon so
what you're going to see here is me
doing this demo for the first time so it
doesn't work under sitting here you can
blame him so let's start with I'm going
to ask the Aria bot now the lips okay
here I'm supposed to be typing here so
I'm going to ask the Aria bot to sort of
see if I can see my profile so let me
give a little bit back background Aria
is our internal employee facing
directory right so if I want to see um
it's a background or out on located on
the company directory or or else I go to
Ari and I look for it so now the beauty
about this is as I'm collaborating with
my team I don't have to go anywhere else
if I want to quickly connect to my
developer or connect to my manager or I
want to call on it I can literally come
here and say at Aria but my profile
right and it was connected and works and
this is just slack this is looks like
hello wow they have a photo of me too
cool so this is absolutely life so this
shows me sort of my information from the
Aria bot and interesting enough that
they have taken the phone number out so
that so you guys don't have it and call
me I'll leave you with ownership number
so or if I wanted to find other people
in my directory I can go to the Aria
board and say you know let's say search
for Ummat let's see what it looks like
he always looks handsome so let's look
for um it ok what I found was a lot of
amid ZZZ so here we've integrated with
the menu structure so there we omit
severity there we go and thinking there
we go
I'm sure you agree with me my phone at
all they don't have your number either a
midbrain all right so this is all done
in about half an hour now I have one
more thing and I'm taking a bit of time
here but I really did want to show this
so we had a hackathon yesterday and our
partner fishable solutions and or a
player they built this bought in about
45 minutes and it's bought using the
platform that we just showed you was
integrated to Oracle sales cloud and
Oracle Ibis or EBS 3 business systems
and this is about ordering so it's as a
salesperson
now first of all when I got this bar I
didn't know what to do with it so of
course like everything else I do this
helped and actually it's a good thing
because it does tell me what to do with
this bar so I'm going to the bar if for
EBS it tells me I can do all this I can
have different questions so as a sales
person so imagine that now you know
you're just using just to collaborate
with your with the colleagues I can come
here and say in our price for a s oops
a s five four eight eight eight right
now this is going live to the oracle
salescloud
I'm putting my I'm connected there we go
so it says the price for the unit is
1599 and i say i want to okay that's
good enough so pretty cheap so let's
order
or this part or the part is five four
eight eight eight okay so now here's
sort of where the dialogue comes in
right so I've asked to order part how
many years would you like to order I'd
say five and it then says and now this
is connected bumps is going to the
actual ERP warehouse or our EBS system
so pickup from Seattle and where do I
want to send this to so ship this to
Oracle and do I really want to do this
no I don't want to do this
the order is processed right huh and
this was built in in less than 45
minutes so I shot out the fishbowl
solutions and or a player for doing
something creme classic show up look
right one last thing if you want to do
mobile development Hey our team has
built our releases book and our author
is here JT Thomas I get one
thank you don't leave yet so Hospital
mean yet don't live there you should
have room so too many boss now we have a
robot over so this is pepper sure that
the developer lounge who seem pepper at
the developer lounge all right cool
so on we used suho's chat bot platform
on the back hand behind a pepper the
back end behind it and we implemented
the same used-car use case right you
said you can have one bought in multiple
channels and that's what we did here so
pepper is actually one channel
configured with the chat board platform
oh you look at me okay so the question
is pepper is what is the average price
of a Ford Focus 2015 Ford Focus 2015 is
about $20,000 okay you better that's all
right
yeah is that a good deal pepper that is
a bitch below the price depending on the
car history and maybe a good deal good
luck
I good luck and love that part all right
Thank You pepper thank everyone thanks
cool so I just want to quickly give you
an idea a few other things we have
announced and been working on I don't
know how many of you guys are using
blockchain applying to use blockchain
anybody a few hands all right so we
announced the blockchain cloud service
this week as well a fully managed
offering where we manage the whole hyper
larger fabric implementation and we
build a lot of the enterprise
integration as well as the ability to
have a scalable and secure system as
well a few other things around our Big
Data Platform enhancements as well so we
added a lot of capabilities around data
catalog and be able to move and run
things around Sun SPARC and Hadoop
clusters we added a service for Kafka
and the announcing also enough offering
for Cassandra managed service no sequel
service as well so if you want to use no
sequel you must use Cassandra who'll run
on the public cloud fully managed by
Oracle as well right so overall the
whole app dev platform has really been
enhanced considerably and if you see
some of the things as you saw today as
well as other areas if you want to go
and see the demos you will see things
around whole DevOps of a platform the
container native and cloud native
development capabilities you saw some of
the mobile and chatbot capability as
well ap is another thing we're doing as
well which is probably more get towards
analyst and line of business advice if
you don't want to write any code we have
a lot of visual design based tools as
well so you can drag and drop and create
mobile apps create chatbot apps as well
so a lot of innovations in that area as
we move forward a lot of other services
available in the platform as well things
as I mentioned on blockchain we have
around integration so you couldn't
integrate a lot of ERP systems
on-premise to a lot of applications is
running in the cloud
same thing with data movement across
heterogeneous systems as well and hybrid
capabilities as well if you have some
systems running on Prem some systems
running in the cloud we provide a lot of
services which can run in hybrid mode as
well so we are very excited in terms of
where we are as an offering a lot of
momentum today we have 14,000 plus
customers you use a platform 3,000 plus
part
with applications running on our
marketplace we've been growing very fast
at one point four billion dollars
revenue for a platform last year growing
at sixty percent year-over-year and the
other thing we are very proud of is the
validation be getting from analysts like
Gartner and Forrester in terms of the
categories and leadership we provide on
the pass area as well if you want to try
this out you have a three hundred dollar
free credit you can go to
cloud.oracle.com slash try it and get
and get an account instantly and start
using any of the services and see how
well you can build applications on it so
hope you have a great rest of the week
and thank you all for attending hi
Steven seeing a lot about the Oracle
services chatbots
DevOps micro containers I'm very pleased
to announce that we have all the way
from Belgium the founder of the DevOps
movement
Patrick Dubois from Zander TV he's the
CEO of Zander TV Patrick
hey miss me thanks for coming all the
way out here for this thanks for having
me right there's my slice okay so no
product announcements for me okay I have
95 flights so come a pick up the pace
from server let's do service world okay
there's a lot of things I did most
people might know me from starting with
the word DevOps and making it the thing
around the world I do a lot of
conferences and whenever I see a new
thing I just start get people together
so that's what I'm most proud of
currently I'm working in a start-up and
we basically do a white label version
similar to Facebook live in periscope
for people who cannot go on the socials
so hit me up if you want to talk about
that but that's about it for me okay
small start-up seven people and we're
running things how do we do it easy use
services back-end services community
services IT support services so he's
starting to see a pattern office
services from them services so it's
hardly that we do anything ourselves but
still we do mobile services yes I am
so we figure that using all those
services is probably smarter than
building these things ourselves it's a
principle we follow in our company
because we want to focus on our function
and our domain
we're not the only ones doing it even
the big companies are doing it like
snapchat is using Google you know popped
up and was a periscope so it's not
something as only a start-up would do
like even the big boys we do that okay
this brings me to the difference between
server lessons service full which I
mentioned I think the fact that we're
using so many different services is for
me the essence of server less some would
argue it's about the harver not running
on servers but it's actually using and
the key word there is third parties or
vendors to do parts of your work and
they're more efficient or better to do
so so about two years back we started
using serverless stuff so who's familiar
with serverless raise your hand okay for
those who aren't is basically the next
step from you know virtual machines
containers and now you only deploy
functions one function at a time on your
service so there's a couple of them I
heard that Oracle released their own now
so I should have added that but I was
too late for the slides okay so we use
all those services but it hasn't been
like always that easy for us first time
we use lambda we said okay it's great
and we built like a mean generator for
one of our customers and when you know
it got up into production we got errors
about disk full like what and running
lambda functions I'm getting like errors
like disk full
so apparently that this gets reused and
there's limit which is obviously in the
documentation but you know something we
hit then there's the other thing like we
fought so hard about getting very fast
performance and then we'll like we
looked at part of the API on the server
list and there were these cold starts
because underneath it's still a machine
and it has to start up and if it's idle
for a while it takes some time so
there's a delay the other thing we
noticed that
so we're updating our versions of
functions but sometimes the old version
would be stuck and would still see the
API responding with older versions even
though it was all deployed but this swap
from the old version to the new version
only happened
when the container was kind of becoming
idle so under full stress we had the
issue that the swap didn't happen to the
new version there's a lot of pain points
in serverless and when you look at the
topics it's monitoring the bugging
testing latency deployment that's one
which is funny because it should have
taken all that pain away and we asked
people in service what's your problem
it's all those ops topics that they want
to make you go away
but you hit them again and you know I
could say it's the problem with
serverless but in reality it's any
service we use like who's get like some
time or coffee taking a while github was
down me okay only a few npm whether it's
maven whatever is down it doesn't really
matter you get coffee you hit the limit
and you feel like oh well I you know I'm
like I'm responsible and I'm not
responsible I can't do anything about
but we got blocked for our email because
Amazon it's really annoying we learned
the hard way that for the type of life
events we do the the load bouncer
couldn't scale fast enough so we have to
kind of ask Amazon to pre-warm the
service so all these things you just
learned by using the services they don't
really tell you that upfront
so it's kind of like a discovery cycle
you go through and if it's really bad it
happens sometimes it's okay and
sometimes it's not okay those are the
worst issues because you really can't do
anything about it and you have to really
wait for the supplier of your services
to fix things in order so yes we don't
have the maintenance of running all the
software and all the all the things
behind it but in reality what we're
actually doing is increasing the risk of
availability does that resonate with you
who uses a lot of external services
raise your hand okay
whew all the others are still building
it themselves congratulations I hope you
move as fast as your competitor and you
can keep up with the pace so all this
reasoning about these dependencies
reminded me of promise theory championed
a lot by my friend Marc burgers and I'm
going to explain a little bit of the
principles and see how that gets you
about your reason about external
services so in the ecosystem that you're
working in they you are what they call
agent okay yeah need to click faster so
and you make promises to others in the
system so
ever series you provide it's a promise
don't mistake promise with like or hard
SLA so things can go down I'll get to
that later
it's a promise okay somebody should be
able to check your service like maybe
have a Status page whether you're up
whether it works or not
basically verifiable so a promise
doesn't guarantee the article it's only
a promise I'll do my best
it's my intent to keep up the service
there's no way in hell I can guarantee a
hundred percent of time no matter who
tells you that they want that it's
always a guarantee that's the difference
between the old way of thinking nothing
can go down so we built the ultimate
cluster of whatever no the new reasoning
is things go down and we need to get
better at dealing with that stuff
so there's an important difference
promise and not a guarantee of course in
chemita conditions like if I put the
load on the system I can say well you
know this is the load I can handle
beyond that load you're on your own so I
will put in conditions on the promise I
give two agents in my ecosystem and when
I do so I want to have that document
like Amazon documented the disk space
issue which I should have read but I
found out later but the promise was that
it's that amount of disk space this is
the number of limits you have clearly
stated as a promise the language of the
promise must be shared I don't know if
you've used a lot of Amazon services but
they typically are very API centric but
not very human friendly in their API so
there's always like a layer of
translation between it too
make it really usable although all the
IPAs are there but it always needs kind
of like a translation to make it easier
to work with and you need to agree on
the promise you make like it has to be
with consent
I cannot overload the system and I say
you didn't keep your promise no this is
how we deal with each other in the
ecosystem so of course an agent depends
on eight other agents and they have to
keep their promise but still you have to
realize it's a promise it's not a
guarantee thing they make the promise to
you as well and of course they need to
be verifiable documented and mutually
agree it sounds like a basic thing but
in many cases it's hard to verify it's
hard to document it and it might not be
guaranteed you're just going to hammer
the system and say well it's not working
yeah but we never agreed that this was
lit you're going to put there was never
really documented that you're going to
use this API call all that stuff so you
cannot make promises for on behalf of
the other agents you can only make the
promise on your own part so if you would
be make a promise on behalf of the
others it's beyond your control it's
something in promise theory that doesn't
work that way
and sometimes those promises can be
conflicted let's say I'm using no GS
okay so is the Java conference I'm using
Java and Amazon has certain versions
that it runs on the server lists and I
really want to have a new version
and they can pull the old version so in
their interest for maintenance they're
just going to pull the old version but
you know you need the new version so you
will have a conflict like hey but you
know you were running and providing the
service and we're going to switch the
version so this type of conflicts you
just have to assume in the system but
the conflict cannot be exposed from your
service it's probably inside your own
services that you use but you have to
deal with it so it's not something you
should just like exposed to the outside
world and so what's important to keep a
promise is that you have the notion of
choice because I if I don't have a
choice
how I going to keep my promise if one of
the agents in the system fails I cannot
guarantee or not guaranteeing but I'm
not I it's very hard to keep my promise
and sometimes those services get into
bigger eight let's say a cloud vendor a
service vendor they say well all the
similar things get grouped but the agent
then becomes the new point single point
of failure like what if Amazon's down
but it isn't lambda is down what is a
sewer is down it's still a new single
point of failure so we thought we
handled it by not having to deal with
redundant hard drives now we have to
deal with redundant clouds so we're back
to square one but it's the same
principle you're ultimately need the
choice to go from eight to one to avoid
the single point of failure that you're
using the services because they will
never go down those services something
that will never happen
so one of the jobs you have by using all
the services is that you eliminate the
single point of failures in service that
could be like okay we're not we could
use Azur Google functions or whatever
and switch between those but you can
also run it yourself there's nothing
like it's a valid approach of dealing
with the single point of failure open
files is like a docker solution for
running the functions you can run it on
your cue Bernie this and right you could
just run it on premise it doesn't have
to be in a cloud it's having the
alternative having the choice so to keep
your promise you can just switch between
the different systems that's when you're
using services that's the way you reason
about like dealing with all the agents
in your ecosystem service framework is
one important aspect they're trying to
be provider agnostic why to keep that
choice so these are just a few examples
on how you would deal with that these
are specific service examples but it
does really matter it could be for your
CDN could be for your transcoding it
could be for anything that you're using
as a service like what if your Google
Docs go done how would that hurt you do
you have a backup or not so all these
kind of things is like they're beyond
your control but your ultimate ly
responsible for your promise so you have
to deal with all these different systems
sometimes they give you an alternative
world view those agents saying like this
is API version 1 2 3 that's how they
shift by
able to move faster and faster for
different versions and the other thing
to consider if you're using a
super-agent so cluster of a lot of
different services the bigger the Asian
gets often the slower it gets as well
for change
so there's definitely like a case to be
made for smaller players and the big
players like the supermarket on the
corner and the big supermarket it's like
being able to switch feature from one to
the other and have the steady pace as
well because it's really hard when you
scale your system to keep your promise
like the the promise of the performance
that I mentioned like the API requests
like imagine okay I could probably
guarantee performance across 20 nodes
but without what if I scale that to
hundreds and hundreds of nodes that have
to go all the time the problem just gets
bigger and bigger and it promised theory
what they say is that like a promise
that you make is actually build a
relationship and I think that's one of
the key things they say is building a
relationship I'll come back to that
later so up until now we talked a little
bit of teary promise theory we talked
about the different server listings and
so I argued really hard over all these
years to get Devin ups to work together
in the same room and so on but the
problem with all these external services
is that I cannot sit down with you know
these services because there's somewhere
else they're beyond my control they
might have different approaches to the
world they might have a different road
map
I cannot control that so that's what's
kind of my aha moment in there so how
I'm going to solve that so sure
put some technology on there and that
makes it a lot easier but I don't think
that's really the answer there in a poll
I did on Twitter I asked like what's the
hard part you know and surprise surprise
it wasn't the technology it was the
people that we needed to care of and
what that one was interesting in why not
serverless he said like you can hug
servers no you can hug people right even
though you know we all had our moments
with the bad names for all the servers
and so on you know I hope we were past
that but you know it's the human touch
that we're looking for in this I know
it's really hard at a conference where
it's all tools and tools and you know
chat BOTS and communication but I never
heard about the real communication
between real people kind of makes it
interesting
somebody call it an emotional API we
need to start developing somebody said
like DevOps it's the thing of the past
so the good thing is I do not have any
shares invested in any DevOps companies
I do not make my living for DevOps so
whatever so we build on new IDs it's
going to be a night next new ID the only
thing I hope is that part of the IDs
just going to live on in the next ID and
it will be still a cultural change of
working things together whatever the
name whatever the new thing comes up for
me that's fine
so I started seeing how we interacted
with all these different external
services and relying on them and then I
realized that it's just it is DevOps
okay I might be biased because you know
I started with the term and I see DevOps
maybe everywhere even with my kids and
whatever but I still think it's DevOps
and you see these practices emerging in
a way in the field like we usually
communicate this status page inside our
own company and now we are putting it
outside like this is the number one
lesson learned from the first big outage
on Amazon they didn't have a status page
and there were just swamped with
everybody asking like what's happening
why is it down what's happening and so
this is a simple way of communicating
your status outwards of your own company
just exposing your metrics like whatever
happens inside to somebody's using your
services is very helpful because when he
needs to debug you can see what's
happening underneath I think that one is
really interesting is you know in the
bottom right corner it says severe
render errors which is a totally
internal thing of that provider and a
lot of the vendors would just shy away
of showing severe render errors in their
graphs but they're very brave and I give
you an insight on communicating how
things are happening so you can deal
with your promise to make sure what
they're happening that you're able to
shift somewhere else and they're not
saying like it's the green everywhere
they really tell you what's going wrong
just updating people during that phase
it's communication your tool is can say
it's up and down but the nice
communication that somebody gets going
and says like we're handling it it's
really nice wherever that's true email
or any other means the fact that you can
get data out of your service a really
important part like something I look for
when I use a service can i it's easy to
get my data into your service but how
can I get the information back at simple
things error definitions making it clear
what happens I mentioned that before
having an API to back up the data like
I've searched but a lot of the services
it's really hard to reproduce your
settings like what if your account is
wiped how do you reconfigure your
service a lot of them just don't allow
you to take a full dump and then load
back all your settings you know you've
clicked through the whole API thing but
it's really hard to get the the back up
and going again obviously there's a
slack slide and not because there's
slack it's because they're doing an
awesome job at when problems occur they
communicate about it in a very nice
human fashion instead of just yet saying
with a chat bot were available will not
available somebody's really typing hey
well how was your day what are you doing
this is really communicating outside
your company the post-mortems
another brave things thing a lot of
companies are doing if you had a real
failure man up to describe what actually
happened don't try to put it somewhere
in the dark
corner and not explain what happens
these are very insightful and for me
they get bonus points in when they do
these kind of things for choosing them
as a service so it's kind of like in my
checkbox if a company does that or not
so even proactive like your server is
degraded it will go down really
interesting to get that information as
well now it's simple things like a
change log of what happened
simple communicating stuff and you might
say it's trivial and we all do that but
you know there's lots and lots of
services that do not have this kind of
communication our just even talking at
conferences I learn a lot about
internals of a company when I listen to
people speak about their product and so
on it's the willingness to share like I
look at the open source stuff people are
doing or how they document things little
cubes for that some even have the road
map on there where you can influence and
say this is probably the next
interesting feature remember the
different the alignment of different
promises we make this is a way to
realign and communicate like hey this is
something we want this is something
that's interested us in all these cases
it's not that I actually talking to from
engineer to engineer but there is a
communication going like fabric another
one they just listen in on conversations
on Twitter they pick you up or you're
having a problem I'm gonna help you this
is kind of type of communication I'm I
would be looking for open sourcing stuff
what I'm definitely don't want to see is
like 16 days to get a response from
you like my biggest nightmare is Apple
at the moment for these kind of stuff
when I use a new service I send them a
gist about the feedback on what I came
across and the interesting feedback I
get from the engineers is that we've
used your gist to go to our engineering
department and say this is something
that happens something we should fix but
we had a really hard time convincing
them ourselves internally but because
you logged it we could take that to them
simple thing
communicating feedback and they loved it
it's just how would they know obviously
they would see like or you stopped using
your service but this is valuable
feedback I would expect that from my or
for my own service as well to get that
feedback to get better even getting
direct contact with the engineers like
how valuable is that not having to file
a ticket way to sell somebody respond
but just help on a channel engineer to
engineer be able to discuss these things
ok they're not sitting next to me but at
least I have an unfiltered be
directional conversation with them about
my problems
so for me if you say DevOps we've been
so focused on solving the problem inside
our own company I think now we have to
look at how we collaborate across
companies with DevOps it's even going to
be harder because we can't you know
control the other one so we should be
like equals on at the table and kind of
help that but to me that's going to be
the next step for for DevOps
so the collaboration not only inside
your company extended to the turn
parties think about promises and note
that others are allowed to fail with our
promises and it's your job to keep your
promise by going around that others are
able to fail being able to verify that
and I think to keep your promise to the
business because that's ultimately what
we're doing is that whatever technology
and communicating we're still trying to
make the business and the users to keep
that and there's probably a lot of
Technology people here but if you think
about the C CTO whatever he decides is
actually a business decision so it's not
about like hey let's use a chatbot no no
the goal is to communicate better and
then for that we might use something as
a chat bot or do that but the goal is
not to use a chat pod as such and that
means that to engineer it's not only
about your technology it's way more and
I encourage you to just take that leap
of fate and start communicating with the
others in various ways and not just be
focused on the api's and the technology
that you're using I'm always there
there's a couple of books the slides
going to be available soon so obviously
promise theory it's a little bit like
heavy but it's a very interesting read
server less in general you know this
good book and there's a good get up that
lists a lot of the resources that you
want to read about Chiron DevOps many
books but here are a few of the white
one
and is there even a graphic novel in
interested fun reading on the goal and
doing that and then I have another set
of books because I believe somehow we
need to figure out a way that we're
always repeating the same issue which is
we fall into the technology trap or the
religion that technologies can solve all
our problems and these are a few
interesting books that will get you some
IDs and show you how we how our
reasoning is influenced that we believe
technology will do the difference but
might also create some downsides that we
start being blind about because we have
solar religious about technology and
whether that's in politics or whatever
interesting set of books there and this
is my life's last slide I thought it was
only fitting at an Oracle conference
like whatever we do in the compute and
the service does really matter because
it's going to be where your data is and
that's probably where all the rest is
going to build around it so that's my
talk thank you very much

moral code you are in the exhibition
hall East earlier and did an interview

using Java I said I'm using it for my
banking sauce work but it's been
interested that all these IDs just
keeping expanded I really like the idea
of the multiple languages the polyglot
