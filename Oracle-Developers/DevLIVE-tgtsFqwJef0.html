yeah I'm getting an error message also
so I don't know what's going on there
but and yeah we'll continue we can still
record it alright so maybe the Twitter
part of it won't work well like we can
look we can record it that's the good
part
alright so welcome to dev life here I'm
your host Javed Mohammed at the open
world 2017 I have as my guest today
Chris Richardson Chris welcome to the
show
oh thank you thank you for coming I
guess the last time we met was in
Beijing there's a few months back and
how you been good good just um I think I
must have been back to China or at least
once since I saw seen you you got
frequent flyers just going there I think
yes I have quite a few miles saved up
right now but you know a lot of demand
for micro services and and knowledge
around the world so okay it's keeping me
busy so you gave a major key note over
here about micro service in transaction
e1 tell us a little bit about that
oh yeah so that my talk today was about
kind of a really really interesting
aspect to the micro service architecture
namely how do you do transaction
management okay so if you think about it
like sort of transactions kind of like
the underpinning of enterprise
applications right you know essentially
an enterprise application is code plus
database and it's absolutely essential
that you have transaction management in
place but what's particularly
challenging about the micro service
architecture is that each service is its
own Island of data you know it's
conceptually it has its own database
that's not not necessarily its own
database server but its own private data
and so yeah in theory you could use
transact
manager distributed transactions but
that sort of technology is really not an
option for modern applications and so
you end up using an alternative approach
which is known as a saga in a saga saga
saga sa GA ok you know the whatsit Norse
tales right or whatever they all right
whatever they work so and the idea is so
instead of you know two-phase commit
what you're using is this saga and a
saga is a sequence of local transactions
ok so you basically break up this big
transaction into a sequence of smaller
ones each one executes within a service
and then there they're actually chained
together through messaging or events so
isn't that so when you got so many of
these I think we have that conversation
back in Beijing but so I guess in some
cases it makes sense to have an
application that is more monolithic and
in other cases it it you know it makes
sense to go to a micro service
architecture but when you go to
something that's distributed doesn't
that when you're talking about data
isn't that cause issues of coherency yes
absolutely
yeah so like the example I used in the
talk is you had a customer service that
manage customers and an order service
that managed orders and then when you
wanted to place an order you had to
verify that the customer had sufficient
credit so you can think of that as as a
transit as needing a transaction that
spans multiple services and and that's
and to solve that that problem you would
use a saga where there was a transaction
in the order service a transaction in
the customer service and then another
transaction back in the order service ok
so what so where does where do you see
as in the grand vision of micro services
you know there's always the vision
there's where we're at today kind of
what word you use you know in terms of a
new concept or a new
I don't shouldn't use the word
technology but at a new process where do
you see us in terms of an adoption of
micro services in terms of the briga
scheme of things oh yeah I think there's
tremendous interest in micro services
you know it's I think it's obviously it
originated inside sort of the consumer
or the the large-scale Internet
companies and if you take a step back
and ask well why did companies like
Amazon embrace the micro service
architecture it actually wasn't anything
to do with scale but it was the fact
that they were sort of in this
hyper-competitive market and their
software developers needed to deliver
features very rapidly and they could not
do that with the monolithic architecture
and so they adopted what would now be
called a micro service architecture
mm-hm so and that started I think in the
it kind of on the web but now businesses
are in the same sort of more traditional
businesses or in the same situation
where you know they need to innovate
faster which means the developers need
to develop faster basically build better
software faster and the micro service
architecture is one of the key ways in
which you're having to do that so I
think large enterprises are just taking
a serious look at at the micro service
architecture as a way to accelerate
software development okay so when you're
talking distributed the thing the
buzzword that keeps going off in my hand
is you know that was a in fact yesterday
one of the interviews I did was around
blockchain because that again kind of
has this whole distributed artist does
that kind of tie in at all with micro
services or you know that that to me is
is that's off in sort of application
lands okay and and I know that
blockchain is is actually you know it
was funny I was doing a podcast
yesterday as well and one of the jokes
was you needed to come
machine learning with with blockchain
and mic receivers okay because that
would be like a you know triple hype
sounds like Nirvana yes yes funding idea
uh-huh so yeah i i i i don't see
blockchain as half as being a kind of
fundamental technology in a microservice
architecture it's much more of a
higher-level application domain specific
technology if if it actually ever proves
to be widely useful okay you know you
know it to me one of the issues I have
with blockchain you know it's just this
whole issue that is computationally
expensive although I did learn that
that's primarily private blockchain as
opposed to public blockchain yesterday
but it's sort of like you know when
we're trying to move to kind of like
highly efficient high-volume computing
you really want to pick base it on some
technology that is like incredibly
computationally expensive doesn't make
sense to me all right okay all right so
it's uh changing channels we have a
common love for tennis what's what's
happening in the tennis world Oh what
has been happening in the tennis world I
mean you know I just I just think the
tennis this year has been so exciting
basically cuz the quote old guys uh-huh
have have staged an amazing comeback
right name does that does that mean this
hope for those yeah but yeah you know it
started off with that fantastic win by
Roger Federer in Australia Australia and
and then you know with Nadal playing
well and it's just it's just awesome
uh-huh all right okay so you were
mentioning you're gonna be attending the
Australian Open and 2018
well again yes yes yeah yeah I mean it's
like I wasn't gonna go uh-huh
but then I got the email saying tickets
on sale and I just couldn't resist I
could not say no well pups we can do it
another dev live session that there's
really an open you know that would be a
brilliant thing yeah combine my two of
my favorite things into one okay
I lost my boss about it yeah yeah it
makes perfect sense this thing is always
real pleasure meeting you thanks thanks
for coming down and sharing oh you're
welcome thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
