conference session when I will
illustrate the way we adopted and use
the Java Enterprise core technologies
for our new application suite which is
called cashless free not zero is the
name of a new generation of business
services for the electronic payment
processing and debit credit prepaid card
lifecycle management okay let me
introduce you the topic but first of all
just a quick on introduction of me i am
andrew farley I am an Italian software
engineer Italian charges city of the
cashiers business unit a test group
which is an Italian software company
providing advanced the payment solution
to the global market and happily I am
living the software development of this
new generation of business services for
a payment processing let's go cashless
3.0 and all these business components
are absolutely based on the Java
Enterprise 6 and now seven platform okay
just a quick introduction of my company
my company is an Italian company is it
has over 30 years of experience in this
business area forty and four hundred
expert and we are customer in over 20
countries including the US and UK and
forest
what we provide our software application
so also in the model software as a
service project implementation
professional service and so on in
basically in these business areas and we
focus now on the cashless solution okay
okay be a casual solution to give you an
idea of our business footprint we manage
over 100 million cars worldwide
sixty-five percent of acquiring system
and more than fifty percent of issuing
system in Italian managed by our
solutions and we have a deep and widely
recognized the experience in yield me
immigration across Europe envy migration
migration is the process to migrate the
magnetic stripe cards to the cheap base
card we in Europe we already have the
chip based God but you in us there are
still the magnetic stripe card but now
with the new low so it's in the US the
credit card a big car prepaid card must
support also the chip and also the POS
ATM devices and so on must support the
chip based guard and we are specialized
in this kind for example of migration
okay and so our value proposition is
spreading the issuing transaction
processing acquiring in the management
and so on so this is the day context
that we have to face when we decided or
not me my company of course at the
beginning of 2013 decided to invest in a
new innovative suite of electronic
payment solution for the international
market and the main goals that underline
this day
cision from the mental decision for the
company where to manage the lifecycle of
car of all kinds of a payment programs
and devices physical your daddy car
credit card and so on or verbal a bullet
the mobile wallet and so on and to spend
this kind of business solution to global
market so including also countries over
the Europe and in a world wide range
then another basic goals was to reduce
the time to market and the total cost of
ownership adopting a new technology
platform and also a new development
technology approach and philosophy and
all this as to as to happen combining
the strong and widely recognized
business expertise with a new cloud IT
cloud-ready sauce ready IT architektur
and this was the basic the basic
challenge let's say because we have to
put together let's say a strong strong
expertise with a new approach on the
with a new development totally new
development philosophy and methodology
so at the end of the day we want to
standardize our software component in
terms of development deployment
distribution and installation unfollowed
customer and target environments and
this was intended to expand the
company's business footprint on the
international market and mud but also
maintaining the existing customer by
replacing the legacy solution with new
this new generation of services and so
this was
the promise so the new application
framework must comply with the time to
comply with these basic requirements hi
portability I scalability flexibility
plug ability interoperability also
genius and high-performing system
because we have a broad range of
components running part of of this
component are real-time components are
the components that had to process the
financial transaction when you make a
financial transaction with your card
there is a chain of component that must
must process the authorization check and
so on in the in a second or less than a
second and then we have an other kind of
components that are mostly back-office
component and so you have very different
requirement technical requirement among
the various component and these are
these were the basic requirements and
the advanced requirements okay the
Disney architettura was intended to be
natively designed for so architetto a
built on best-of-class open source
technology of course mul-t-lock a
multi-language multi-currency and cloud
and si es ready for multi company and
also multi Tennessee and last but not
least it had to be compliant with the
OWASP ax and the PCI pa-dss security
stunner and I don't know if you know
this security standard particular the
PCI pa-dss mateen day
our industry all the application that
you put in a production environment must
comply with this standard and are very
very strictly standard they require not
only for example the security on the web
interface but they require to put in a
safe place all day sensitive information
of the card order the Code of your car
the pan your ID and so on must be
segregated and must be created inside
application none of this data must be
stored in a clear way okay so you have
to to keep him in your mind all this
requirement not only the frame were
requirement but this advanced
requirement and specific requirement for
our business okay a lot of requirements
but that other requirements we can all
this requirement okay are not only to be
to be implemented but also to be
implemented in a transition process
starting from basically a lot of
vertical procedure on mainframe to get a
new cloud of services okay and not only
technical architetto and frame were
requirement but also impacts on the
organization because the new application
architetto should drive a new culture of
innovation inside the company based on
remote team working and ajay programming
okay so a new way of thinking and you
will design program test the
applications but the right term is a new
way of thinking and because the concept
of programming of
standard a usable and fully portable
software components is absolutely
central to all of this project and so we
have to we have to get the first point
but at the same time we have to keep in
mind that we have to to keep the
business continuity on the existing
customers on the existing installation
so we want to make a new company let's
say but also keep and maintain the
establish installation and customers so
you know we at the beginning you make a
lot of internal training knowledge
changes and sharing bidirectional and
the key steps where to where did the
following collect and data lies the
existing no I'll apply the resulting
business logic to the new architecture
we have to retrieve from the business
experience kill present in the company
or the information model information get
the business logic and apply the
business logic to the new yorka title so
that to define and clear away the new
application component services and then
after that we have to we had to evaluate
the effort because the estimation tax
definition and planning and then skill
building stuff up and so on and the what
the stuff we had in our hands were some
legacy business component written in
Kabul and we had some java web
application for data set up and
management with realize with that
technologies just set one doc you sir
and q 2 3gs be two dot one hibernate the
usage of I Burnett spring framework and
the sea framework and the press
framework
toaster google web toolkit for the
automatic generation of the web pages
access to database also directly by jdbc
okay and this web application acted as a
web wrapper on a core mainframe business
logic realized the implemented in Kabul
on the mainframe because in this
business the IBM 0s mainframe as a
central role especially in Italy and
Europe okay but now there is a strong
trend to to substitute this legacy
application with for example Java
Enterprise based application of dotnet
application so take off from the
mainframe save the mips cost and
substitute your business logic with the
open they call it open open applications
but the open application must be robust
must be radical must be an enterprise
application no more just a web
application okay and apart from this web
application we have also some a few
vertical Dre to be application so HB q
dot X also hibernate my bodies and so on
and for some specific task for example
the POS terminal management ATM terminal
management key management system k
management system because as I told you
all day sensitive data must be cryptid
so you have to use in this kind of
application what are called the HSM
awkward security module critter devices
and so on and typically you put a broker
a component between the DS this is
another component descriptor device with
the application level and we have an
the key management system component to
intermediate the code to decrypter
device ok so the shin are you okay
terminus mainframe java web application
a few java enterprise application this
is the starting point from a technical
point of view in you in 2050 ok now but
what we we had to realize what is this
casual is 3.0 what are the component
what are the drink their tasks ok they
the components as you can see in this
would picture you you read their names
ok no is ok I we try to explain you can
see here for basically four areas ok the
car management system on the left tablet
they pinon in the car production system
the another area that is called direct
link and the authorizing system in the
car management system we and they their
orange boxes are the macro components ok
you can think of these as service
provider ok car management system you
have to manage the full lifecycle of any
kind of the e-payment tools see payment
programs carved world let mobile wallet
and so on you had to configure create
and manage the life cycle ok the life
cycle means also that you had to
physically produce these tools so the
the other area that contains the
component to produce the plastic car for
example they pin envelope containing
European and so on the authorization
system area contains instead contains
the
one time financial transaction
processing components these are the
components that must reply to a request
in real time ok so the authorizing
system and the two central component the
key management system and the switch the
message which that acquired that
received the ingoing messages from their
master circuit visa mastercard a union
painter national now is very important
ok and ganda message Tecna message and
route the message to the authorizing
system for example in order to make the
authorization and and process the final
transaction and then the response
message will flow again into the switch
and switch we're out the response
message to the Islamic sacred ok so I
don't want you to become expert with
this business topics but just to give
you a picture of the complexity of the
system we are not speaking of a single
application we are not speaking of two
application we are speaking of a set of
different business components that have
totally different requirements because
in the central a box Delta ization
system what is the main the main
requirement for developer for designer
the performance just the performance
please take off all what is not required
I have to go to the database I have to
go to the database in a direct way have
to go the data in real time ok maybe
that is better not to use a engine not
to use the jpa ok but not because I
don't like GPA like jab it so much but
each of this component must be designed
must be must be really
with different requirement the priority
of the requirement are very different
okay inside inside each of that orange
boxes you have a structure all that
component as an inside structure that is
in some cases complex okay this is a
class diagram representing the
persistent entities just to give you an
example of the car management system
okay it's just a viewer because i have
200 tables inside the car management
system okay so the first the first thing
you have to do is to model the system
okay not only the persistent entities
but but also the flow activity diagram
sequence diagram and so on it's very
important because we have to understand
what we are going to realize okay in
order to evaluate the complexity the
effort what we have to do what are the
tools that we can use and we must use to
get the better performance in designing
and development another another example
the production the production of the car
no also here we have any Intel
instructor which is also complex not not
so complex guys is is easy to do but you
had to do you have to do and you have to
think that as as as I told you we
started from vertical procedure where
all this is eden was hidden we're we had
no models we have covered software so we
we had to factor in gow made the
factoring out to get this information
this great effort was a great great
effort okay so i can i can i can call
all this stuff a big challenge a big
challenge sorry it's a big challenge to
go on with the slide with a teacher with
many risk factors because of the
requirements basic advance their katha a
new architecture and you can set a new
way of thinking and you way of
development well a big challenge but
also a big opportunity for a brave heart
software engineer ok ok not exactly the
same look I know so more or less ok ok
the first and most important decision if
you were in my in my trousers ok and
this is the shape this was the scenario
you are the you your boss the boss of
the company said oh you angra falling
please give me a master project tell me
what are the platform and the tools we
have to use to to realize this new
system how many people I have to stuff
up how many people I have to hire is
it's not so easy guys but you have to
basically the first thing you had to to
to decide is the platform 25 2015 I
remember 2013 the platform but I decided
not out of this because we had to
produce we had to produce in a
industrial way software components very
very different
this must be reality for online
transaction processing four batches for
real-time response and so on java he
seeks platform was absolutely the best
option at that time mmm the another
option could be dotnet but in our
company we have Jack we are we are Java
people we are job oriented I am I spend
part of my life with Java because 20
years of job at 20 years of my work on
Java so Java e6 platform what absolutely
for me the the best option and so I
decided we decided because we are at a
staff a team of soccer engineers and we
decided to adopt the java 6 platform as
the only development platform for all
components the only development platform
java java heap let's take a quick look
okay at the decision-making process
because it's important why the Java is
six platform you can say to me why don't
you decide to use praying why don't you
decide to use a set of Best of Breed
frameworks the spring is the first
example of enterprise the framework that
you can use as an alternative to the
Java Enterprise specification okay the
first reason is to because we have to
replace the existing puzzle of values
framework various layer and so on with a
unique set of standard technology than
our independent platform now also we we
want to avoid direct dependency on
external frame work while enforcing
for complying with the standard PA
specification it's very important for me
this point is very important because if
you comply if you make software
compliant with the standard official
standard APA specification you can be
sure of portability among the various
application servers for example ok ok
then Java e-cigs provide the HB track a
bit free technology the JT JT a
technology the JPA technology and so on
so basically java e6 natively provided
us or the fetus we needed and and this
is an important an important thing that
at that time the Javas roadmap gave us
strong guarantees of future development
what does it mean does it mean that if
you remember at the beginning of 2050
and available releases of java platform
and a position where the famas rate we
whatnot for and then the new Java EE
five dot 0 and the Java is 60 and the
last table release was a Java e60 with
the reference implementation of classes
as usual but the new release was already
planning the job into the java ee 7
release the main at 2015 then in january
you know 2010 the summit system has been
purchased by hora con and this was the
situation of java enterprise platform at
that time ok so why Java Enterprise 5
was groundbreaking you know because of
the simplified programming model
introduction of annotation based
programming JP a dependency injection
for a gb and so on and the water what
happened
with Java Enterprise 5 that the java
community process and the java community
understood that they had to integrate to
get the best of breed by hibernate by
spring by all the frameworks that
substituted very frequently the native
technologies of java enterprise with
more flexible lightweight solutions
hibernate for example spring dependency
injection inversion of control
aspect-oriented programming were
introduced old by spring but the Java
Enterprise specifications during during
the time after the Java Enterprise 5 get
all this and put all this inside the
official specification using directly
the people the guys the developers of
this framework for example I brunette
for example people from spring and so on
so this was the big change of the HRI
enterprise 5 ok and so with Java
Enterprise file no more Java added
addition is the real Java Enterprise
Edition this was the bath world at that
time and then Joe enterprise 6 that was
strengthening because the rain force
improves down the new technology
introduced by Java Enterprise 5 ok and
for example you know the hybrid 3.0
javaserver faces 2.0 it should be three
point one repeat 220 CDI 120 the
introduction of the CDI for example
single tambien synchronous method so for
me the first real release that you can
that you can use in a production
environment was absolutely the Java
Enterprise 6 ok and so first important
decision Java Enterprise six because is
it includes all the technology we need
it and now we have to build the
ecosystem around the platform so the
ecosystem means tools for analysis and
modeling a tool in ID building and
distribution know all what you can you
can think you you have to do during your
development processing for analysis and
modeling we adopted visual paradigm
she's a lightweight and flexible uml
modeling tool you a melon saw a male
modeling tool supporting the joy motor
driven development Ajay model driven
development means that you start from
the model and you generate some part of
your software for example the jpa
entities from the model but you are not
forced to use in an integrated way the
flow model to software or software to
model you can but you are not forced ok
and so a mix between the agile
programming and on the motor driven
development for the idea we we decided
for eclipse Java e ID but there are now
there are guys using also NetBeans
building and distribution maven
versioning as well ticketing track
because in the company the companies has
already realized the ticketing system we
track integrated with the subversion for
fashion and performance testing and this
is interesting we use soap yui soap yui
because when you have to test the wolf
low and you have HB you have jpa and so
on you can you can also use
open a gb for example embedded inside
directly inside the code but it's more
complicated what what we do is to create
a web service so web service for each
operation that we want to expose the
dance tonight contest and in this way
you can use soap you eat to make all the
functional tests you need but the soap
Yui is also a very good tool to make
performance testing because you can
repeat and you can simulate the
concurrency the a night volume of
requests and so on there is soap ue and
load you are two products inside the
same suite and for the quality we decide
to use by the beginning sonarqube also
in the in a preview mode to prevent the
Box divots and so on and very important
for us the security violation and we
want to prevent and not to get this box
and violation during the test after the
software developing development so this
this is the ecosystem we decide to put
in place not only decode system but now
we have the platform the ecosystem and
what about the application architecture
so for me the more simpler the more
better so lean and clean architetto
based on well define on the carpet
layer's project project has to be have
to be small self-contained cohesive
project okay because is absolutely
fundamental to keep separate roles
responsibilities also to have a an easy
way to integrate that interoperate with
the external factors and
then it's very important to define from
the beginning a common set of
programming patterns naming convention
and templates you have to create a
common knowledge on this your
development team of course strong focus
on the use and portability we decide on
to not use state full session bit but
only stateless session bean a singleton
beans parallel process for performance
reasons and parallel processing through
the use of a synchronous method we
decided also to absolutely for what
regarding the persistence layer to use
the best products to put in place the
best products famos best products so the
out incremented ideas primary key for
jpa entities the version on or JP
entities for domestic locking you know
the and very important is to define a
natural candidate key on all the JP
entities in order to redefine the equals
and hashcode because in this way you can
ensure you are sure to have to not
insert twice the same record inside a
collection for example when you are in
detection state you know and the lessee
and the famous lessee Heger fetching
strategy we decided is defensive choice
but Lassie fasching less affecting for
all Association for all references and I
have to decide explicitly in the code
when I want to get the link identities
is safer to follow this way than to
design directly on the model some
Association as eager because in that way
when you make whatever choir you want on
on the master entity
you retrieve also and always the link
identities may be dangerous for
experienced direct experience then
another important thing is not to Adam
bad that sequel jpq well inside the code
but external reusable j PQ el and native
static queries and if you had the need
to create a queer in a dynamic way but
our our choice was to to use the
criteria API but just in case but the
basic thing is not to have embedded
sequel Jay Peak work inside your Java
code because it's very difficult than to
to maintain this sequel intrepid wild
coding side the Java code again about
the application architect or we decide
to create a generic reusable down to
absolute application code from the
process and details but the this this
data HS object can be used in with
different transactional management
strategy cmdb nto local transaction is
the same is transparent ok it's up to
you to the application code to start to
delegate to the content of the trade a
transaction boundary or to explicitly
control the comet run back and so on it
depends or to use also a local
transaction by jdbc by data source is
the case of the batches for example they
all use a local transaction or a be
managed transaction it depends not
important things is to keep separate the
transaction processing and batches of
course we have two distinct persistent
unit for the batches and for the
transaction processing and we are too
distant approach typically continual
managed transaction for the online
transaction processing and be managed
the transaction or lock a transaction
for batch processing so quick look
inside that the application architect or
you can see that we have a web layer
over the tire where you can see distinct
two boxes we have the web applications
interactive web application jsf and dice
face is based and the web service
endpoints are different project deploy
m-net deployable as different unit and
in the business tire you can see that we
have a service binding layer which is
connected to the web service endpoint
and then it's like an application
firewall and then we have a facet layer
it is our HP's exposing a local or
remote interface or BOTS and then we
have the business layer so the business
agb that are all local to the
application you cannot assess directly a
business a GP you have to pass through
the service binding layer if you are
coming from a web service call or facet
a year if you are coming to 2 12 hour
well application for example to from jsf
and so we have also the message facet
there for all what the messages that are
incoming from queues and then we have
the persistent layer so thou Dre PA and
it is and undeceased basically the
layers of our applications is very
simple is very the layers are well
identified the car
and people know where to put their code
and work to split the logic the business
logic inside the business hib the
control logic the application firewall
logical facet level and all is very very
clean in this way to worry about the
agile a model driven development of
course you know object oriented business
analysis the application model is all
realized that by use of UML and so am L
by useless modeling component modeling
processing so its modeling data modeling
and we can generate an automatic way the
from the from the modal the ddl and the
jpa entities and in a full way or
commenter way and then we developed the
just the business services so our focus
is on development of the business
services and then the fashion elite
performance test by soap ue so forward
engineering a reverse engineering this
way but in a July in a flexible mode and
not invasive on the application model
and on the development flow okay okay so
what about the programming patterns we
use button basically okay for the web
tires done we have stand out and plate
and composite component because we had
the standard web interface development
on jsf to using it and advance the
widget libraries which is icefaces you
can use primefaces you can use richfaces
we decide to use icefaces for the
business diarmait of course as a BJT a
jpa and some basic patterns and basic
pattern service locator you know
session for Satan message for say
business delegation on demand caching is
is frequently using outside of our
application lehmann caching and means
that you don't have to cash some static
data or when at a startup but when you
receive the first goal to that data I'm
sad factory and singleton singleton is
will be to load for example data for
also to trigger some schedule at
processes by use of schedule and
schedules we make small framework to
enable the dynamic rescheduling of these
batches it's not a static scheduling
what is a dynamic scheduling and so with
this with this all this work we can say
that we we have a smart programming flow
in the sense that for example actually
eclipse ii d is the only workbench for
developers is integrated with the matter
maven repository by thomas mavin to
eclipse plugin transparent integrated
with subversion with track we have the
on deployment on jboss for local testing
the bargain and then we have the real
time code analysis by sonar cube and
also other other tools like fine bugs
and labs especially lab set for the
security violation detection so this is
the situation of a situation now from a
few vertical procedures and realized on
my frame now we have this organization
multi-country software factoring a
standard team working we have different
teams working on with the same with the
same environment apart from the browsers
and the database is
for is a way an empiric way let's say to
ensure the portability on the various
platform because we have to comply with
Chrome Internet Explorer and Firefox
Safari you know and different version
for example of internet explorer from
the internet explorer 9 9 2 day current
12 it's not so easy it's not so easy so
we have all this team and then on the
back end we have our of course maven
repositories with Nexus we have the
track ticketing and issue tracking
system integrated with subversion and we
have the the central test environments
for IBM websphere and the beat you for
uncle illogical oracle while our our
application server for development is
rather jboss this is a way to mix
together different kind of application
server database and so on in order to
guarantee the the portability on the
values platform because you know our
application are not self consistent we
have to integrate our application
company inside very different
environments there is one customer that
this IBM branded so IBM and maybe IBM on
the mainframe on the 0s and DB 20 s and
another is Oracle another is open source
oriented and you have to to develop the
same code and we develop the same code
is absolutely portable no change to to
the source just the runtime deployment
descriptor in are different but really
we we are able to to ensure the
portability but thanks to the java
enterprise platform for this
another another very very my be friend
is maven because thanks to Melvin we we
can make what we call a smart bidding
what is a smart building for example
through the use of profiling side Marvin
different profiles you can in a
transparent way create a distribution
for jboss on posterous 4g bus and my
sequel for websphere and the beat you
for well logic and Oracle just a click
just launch day Marvin cleaning store
and distribute and package with the
correct option specify the current
profiles so this is very very important
for us because to be able to in
automatic and transparent way create and
recreate the distribution for the values
environment we had to support well by
modern you can you can also enable or
disable for example the multi-language
support because maybe that customer is
is Italian so in its only Italian and
not English and why you have to to
enable the multi-language support in
that case also they we have the
possibility to insert an inside the
distribution some specific set up
scripts of San specific artifact for
each single customer and it's very
important and another important things
that may them makes make make me an able
to do is that to plug in the custom
component in in a dynamic and
transparent way because you can through
the use of CDI specializations
you know stereotypes alternative you can
inject in a dynamic way in your
distribution the implementation unit
that you need of some custom component
you put inside the standard code
standard code of the product a default
implementation of this business delegate
and then you can inject in a dynamic
wait when you create the distribution
the right implementation for that
customer it's very very important to
keep the couplet the standard of the
product and they custom the
customization and the custom component
absolutely is fundamental and so by
means of this smart building we can
create a dog packages assembly true
Marvin labrys delegates and custom
implementation are automatically
included in the final deliverables
specific to the client and this is very
important now what about the Java
Enterprise seven okay because we adopt a
bit java enterprise 6 ok now we have the
Java Enterprise 7 and we have white fly
and recently also the IBM WebSphere and
yesterday I heard that also the weblogic
12 dot 2 is compliant full compliant
with the Java Enterprise 7
specifications so we are now working on
the rear I arrangement for example of
the batch processing accordingly to the
batch application for the Java platform
so the shank oriented programming you
know they are they have integrated
basically the spring batch framework
inside the official specification and we
want to follow this way because now our
batches are the couplet funded from the
online translational processing but are
not I realized as as procedures
basically procedures and we want to
adopt them the pattern
of the batch applications then we are
working about the usage of the
concurrency utility for the java
enterprise see in order to improve the
performance of a synchronous processing
and again the use of the improvement of
the approved CDI 1020 api and the usage
of html5 and WebSocket even if the web
interface for us in many case is not so
important because we have to integrate
with customer that already have this
their interface the web client tension
is that is more important to have a wide
range of one define web services rights
web services in that case so we don't
put a lot of effort on the on the web
interface on the native web interface we
put more effort on the web services
especially restful web services so
that's all for what regarding this
presentation I would like to to show you
it's possible to sure to disguise the ID
and ness
okay so this is the the way we develop
you this is the car management system
just one of the box one of the box what
is important for example that the
business tire is to identify the models
the deployment units each of these
couple of heb project must be deployed
as a gb jar is a self-consistent okay
what is it very important for me is not
to deploy a single here yes I have a
single year but I can also deploy the
client the web and the gb separately or
the values a gb models a single
deployment unit and of course the
batches are deployed in in a different
deployment and and then we have the jpa
GPA with the persistent unit with the
native queries and so on also we finish
the time so if you have any question
absolutely yes sorry
yes the migration is not the right tire
migration because we make a process of
rethinking ok so you don't have to to
think about immigration take a procedure
and transform it to this new yorka title
because it's impossible you have to get
the information from let's say people
that are used to work with legacy system
and they explained to you the thinking
in their language then you have to map
and map is absolutely fundamental so you
have to to get all the information
filter the information and map the right
information on the new architecture and
this is the most important thing in this
process if you make in a right way this
step you have bri change to to get
success with the new architetto because
you had to define in a right way the
boundary of your business services
starting from procedural programming ok
and this is the most difficult step we
had to face yes
absolutely right now you have a back
channel you have a movie channel so
pretty card whatever so and you are
using the version number to avoid optics
louder yeah so right now the back
channel actually acts while they use the
procedure as I believe that's what we're
talking about so after the balance
lesson we got all the funk from this
unit how can they how can they actually
who is still there charity from
processing unit how can I to do is still
get a breather the recent information
because reversion now for our no okay of
course we use the native versioning
diversion for optimistic locking on the
transactional processing because they're
the main requirement is to guarantee the
concurrency transaction you make a
transaction and another user open the
same data but you already make the
commit so the other user must receive a
message by optimistic locking and
refresh data and so on for batch but the
data that you create that you process in
the batches are frequently are not
directly on the same table on the same
on the same table and that use the the
user of the transactional processing and
for the batches frequently always i
should say we use a direct connection a
data source to retrieve data to make up
data to make an insert and so on okay so
a direct a diet
a connection to the database and and I'd
are it and handy management of the
version at the hand of the of the
processing okay so you don't have to
update the version each loop you make
during the batch okay because it's it's
an override and so we don't use a jpa
when we process huge volume of data
because we are speaking of huge volume
of data here you have to think that our
system the authorizing model is capable
to process four hundred to four hundred
to five hundred transaction per second
this benchmark we made this venture for
e-commerce payment transaction so we
made a benchmark on jboss and postgres
for our customer and we simulated the
concurrency and we saw that the winged
one installation one installation to
curve virtual machine Linux with jboss
and on the same on the same partition
postgres our system can manage from 400
to 500 transaction per second payment
authorization transaction coming from
e-commerce and now we are going to start
with Oracle the process for all time
code to optimize the system on the exa
logic exadata architetto and they say
you can improve your performance and
overcome the 1000 transaction per second
let's see let's see we hope we also
just POS you can we manage POS okay ATM
POS and of course we applaud POS
ecommerce and we have all the component
that you you have to you have to use to
manage the chain or the chain it's
difficult to have a better time because
that cupboard procedure were absolutely
optimized for mainframe but just and
only for mainframe okay my components
can run on mainframe but of course also
on all the other architetto please come
in sorry okay we finished the time thank
you very much guys thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
