about service in the Java ecosystem and
before we get started just want to get
an idea of how many people know what
service is okay so a few people my
question to you is are you sure you know
what it is all right so what we're gonna
do in this session is we're going to
talk about service service architecture
and what actually is service will also
do a demo using the FN project but we'll
talk about where we currently stand in
terms of service architecture and what
it means to developers my name is
Prateek patel I run a small technology
startup in the city of Atlanta in the
United States I'm a Java champion and
all these other things so let's jump
right into it and talk about what is
service again we'll go over the
architecture we'll also discuss the
ecosystem in some detail so first
question is what actually is service
this is something that is unfortunately
it's a very bad name all right so when
we think of service what is it that
we're actually trying to understand what
does the 10th term actually mean all
right in a lot of ways the the name is
actually not very good so if you
probably have all seen this movie this
is an office space right so it's not so
much about destroying our servers but
there's a guy who's pretty big in in the
social space his name is Kelsey high
talent and he tweeted this music he said
we asked 10 people to define service
when we got 10,000 different answers all
right so fortunately at this point in
time because service is such a new
architecture in detail we haven't
defined as a developer community what it
actually means yet right so the
responses to this tweet were hilarious
actually
so one of the responses was like again
the question is we asked
people who'll answer lists and instead
of one line of code we got 10,000
containers right so this is honestly a
joke against microservices in containers
in kubernetes and that at the entire
ecosystem and then the answers or the
responses got even weirder ID services
saw geo cities for the enterprise does
anybody remember geo cities from the
late 80s or 90s
some people write few not remember this
is what he's doing it was basically a
platform for publishing stupid web pages
and fortunately somebody's marketed but
we talk about service yes there are
still servers obviously we have to run
our servers or our application somewhere
okay yeah
so yes there are servers so it's not
technically serverless right type of
service the idea for developers service
is something that's cheaper to run in
terms of how much you pay your cloud
provider to run your applications but
more importantly for me as a developer
it's about the ease of use and the ease
of the point more detail but this wave
of micro services with corners and
kubernetes and draft and have and is key
oh and this entire constellation of
things around my what I want to do I
want to focus on writing applications
and delivering to our customers
we won't have to worry about how boy
something you know am I using loud
containers what I wanted to do
especially this one nothing like mine
doesn't matter if you're in this bunker
big company your goal as a developer
build applications and cheaply as
possible right so servos has also known
as a couple different things I actually
like these terms much better so a couple
of other terms have people used
interchangeably with civiles it's often
referred to as fast or functions as the
stands and sometimes people call what
this means in a few minutes but again
we're talking to define what service
actually but again there are servers ye
the overall kind of metaphor behind
service is that and this is why it's
called service is that when we're
developing we don't really think about
service you just think in terms of
applications and functions that might be
totally someone of the server from our
developer and might sound something push
your button and it gets to blow up
that's the idea that's why deterring the
service so again it's running code
without having to provision servers
without having to think about am i
running this in the docker container and
how's it going to talking how do I set
up the IP whitelist and other things
like that we don't want to worry about
these things as plumbers we just want to
write code build features and deploy
them towards
so the idea behind service is move the
metaphor of the server and more
importantly remove this concept of being
a DevOps person we just want to be a
developer something else it takes care
of scalability force takes care of
availability and lots of other things
right so typically when when I deploy
something in a service style I don't
think much about security around the
operating system or the container that
I'm running in and other things like
that I don't care about how I'm going to
configure the network or load balancers
someone else takes care of all this for
me so I can focus on writing my own code
and delivering features to my customers
I mean but along with this so service is
about two years old or so now right it
was originally started by Amazon and
what's known as Amazon lambdas okay but
since then we've evolved and the way
that we think about service and an
overall architectural model is also very
different so I would say that's
frivolous aside from being all the
things I talked about right push-button
deployments and you don't really worry
about all these extraneous things that
developers today have to worry about
it's also a new architectural model in
terms of how we think of composing our
application and building from a small
application to a medium to a large sized
application that's what we're gonna
focus on as we go through this so one
way to think about this is when the
micro computer came around right people
had a IBM PC or something on their
desktop and you would install some
software on it you would install Excel
or Lotus Notes or something and that's
how you would use or that's how people
use computing right so the shift that
we've made over the last 15 to 20 years
in terms of desktop computing or
consumer computing is we now have
software as a service right you can go
to Google sheets for example and use a
spreadsheet directly from a web browser
if you're people in your company use
Salesforce they don't install anything
they just open a web browser they log
into salesforce.com and they have all
the things that they
need to do for marketing and sales
management and CRM and other things like
that right so that's the shift that
we've made in consumer competing over
the last 20 years is we've gone from
having a micro computer that has
everything installed on it or you
install stuff on it to you just open a
web browser today or your mobile
application on your phone and you can
start using software as a service
similarly when we think of the
enterprise with what happened with AWS
right and all these other cloud
providers is those were infrastructure
as a service providers and the shift
that we're making today and have been
making for the last couple of years as
developers is we're going from that
metaphor of infrastructure as a service
where you manage servers or virtual
servers in the cloud yourself to going
completely service so this is this jump
that we're making today right and this
is something that in my opinion is going
to be very big in the next few years
especially if you're developer and
especially because of the things I said
it's faster easier and also cheaper to
run a utility in a service fashion
rather than using infrastructure as a
service all right so if we look at our
typical pyramid right this is where we
are today what we have is at the bottom
we have our standard infrastructure as a
service see if this works let me stand
over here okay
we have our infrastructure right so this
is just basically your bare metal or
virtual servers running on Oracle cloud
IBM cloud Google cloud whatever it is
right you basically rent a VPS and then
you choose what kind of platform you put
on it typically people put some kind of
Linux or some kind of Linux derivation
on top of that and today where we are
with micro services or this recent surge
in micro services we have our
infrastructure we have our operating
system which is the platform and then we
have containers right so these are
darker containers and we layer tools on
top using containers right we use docker
and then we might use kubernetes to
scale out each do for composition and
other things like that and then finally
at the very very top this is what we're
concerned with as a developer we're
concerned with the applications that we
have right this is what we normally care
this is what we care about all the time
we care about yes we care about
deployment but we focus most of our time
developing applications right that's
where we spend the majority of our time
thinking about what our customers need
from the requirements and other things
that we get
until we build applications that's what
things look like today in a non-service
world so what's happened today is right
you can see I've used function as a
service instead of servos because I
prefer this term so we still have
infrastructure at the bottom platform
and containers but here right underneath
our application we also have functions
as a service and this is how we build
applications in a servlet style
so we sit on top of containers right and
again a lot of this is automated away as
we'll see in a few minutes and we build
our applications by composing functions
right so instead of building small
little bits of code we conceptually
think at a coarser or higher level right
not all the way at the app level but
somewhere in between basic small units
of code and your full application to
construct apps all right so when one
slide to fast okay
so again as a developer I don't really
care about all those things that are
here at the bottom right I don't care
about platforms or infrastructure or
even containers right yes I do care
about them but what I want to focus on
is I just want to focus on these two
things at the top as an application
developer right whether you're building
a web application server side
application in Java doing machine
learning with Python whatever it may be
what I care about are the two things
that are at the top of this pyramid I
care about my applications number one
and I build those applications using
functions as a service or cloud
functions and we'll see what that looks
like in just a few minutes to give you a
better idea where the future is heading
and where we're moving in terms of a
developer community all right all right
so it is a new architecture what we do
is we focus on building applications and
all these infrastructure things like
docker and kubernetes we don't really
care about these things anymore
all right that's somebody else's job or
maybe it's automated away a lot of this
has been made possible in the service
world by automation right because that's
one of the things that developers are
very good at well
good developers are good at
my good developers what do they do if
they have to do a task more than once
you automated right so you don't have to
keep doing it over and over manually so
we focus on building applications in a
service architecture we don't worry so
much about the infrastructure stuff
that's somebody else's job or it's
something that's handled by automation
okay
so one of the things that we can do is
we're building our own functions as a
services obviously we'll have to write
our own business logic our own functions
as a service right the code has to come
from somewhere and you have to write
that but as part of this model we also
have the ability to use or reuse
functions that we've created and
functions which are available for
purchase or for free or whatever it may
be and we'll talk about the distinction
between functions as a service and
libraries in just a few minutes we'll
get to that in a sec but let's think
about what this actually means right in
terms of architecture the other core
tenets of service architecture is that
it is an event-driven type of model okay
so what is an event there are all sorts
of different events the events can be
almost anything but it's the conceptual
model around having small units of code
that are triggered or fired by events of
some kind it could be an HTTP call it
could be something coming off a message
queue it could even be some kind of file
system monitor that looks for something
that changes in a file system or trigger
in a database or whatever it can be some
kind of event that's the metaphor that
we think about and when we think in
terms of service architecture right so
what are some facets I mentioned
something already right so we have you
have a message queue HTTP call file
system or database monitor inbound email
or even saying okay Google or hey Alexa
what's the weather today right anything
can be a trigger for a service function
it's not necessarily something that's
very very constrained right something
that evokes functions so at this point
you might be thinking okay this sounds
great new architectural model I buy into
this but have we been doing this already
have we've been using servlets style or
service architectural style programming
already
the short answer is you probably have I
know I have so I'll give you an example
so this is a feature in our application
the application is a mobile app but
again in service style architecture the
event can come from anywhere in the
event can be anything in this case the
event or the initial trigger event is
just a restful HTTP call right but what
we do for this specific feature in our
application if this is what we call an
image translator you basically I'm in
Bangalore I don't speak or read the
language here I get a receipt that I
have to file for expenses all right so
what I can do is I can take a picture of
that and our application goes into the
cloud hits our functions that we have
our service functions that we have in
the cloud or cloud functions and it does
these three things it orchestrates these
three different things so first it does
an image OCR but so obviously it has to
read this menu or this receipt or
whatever it may be so we do an image OCR
first and then we have to do a
translation from whatever that languages
into English so that the user or me
knows what's going on on that specific
thing and then we have our own business
logic that we've wrapped inside of our
own function as a service so our startup
is pretty good but we're not so good
that we wrote our own image OCR right
because this is something that's a very
complex problem and would have taken
this a long time to do same thing for
translation all right for the
translating from Hindi into English for
French into English or whatever it may
be we didn't write our own translation
service what we do is we use cloud
functions that already exist to do both
of those things and we weave them
together and we have our own function as
a service that adds our proprietary
business logic to complete this feature
so we actually have been doing this for
a year so we rolled out this feature I
think about four or five years ago and
we've been using functions as a service
we didn't even know it right so we use
image OCR basically say here's an image
Doan read it for us and tell us what the
results are we take that we feed it into
another pre-existing cloud function that
does translation of that
ocr'd data
then we have our own function as a
service that takes those results and
PRIZE applies a proprietary algorithm to
it to make the results better than just
straight translation right so we've been
doing functions as a service for a while
and we have all this running in a single
instance and it basically it wakes up
the event is a HTTP call coming in with
the image data and we get data out of it
that shows the results as you can see
here on the bottom right so you can see
that it's translated OOP
this is gone crazy so you can see that
it's translated from whatever the
original language was into English okay
so the short answer is that we probably
a you probably have been actually
already doing some kind of service
computing or functions as a service or
cloud functions already okay but now
what we need to do is a developer
community is understand how this fits
into an overall model and how we can
build all of our applications to take
advantage of this easier and cheaper way
of deploying and running applications in
the cloud all right so there are lots of
confections that are already available
if you use Twilio to send an SMS text
message you're using cloud function if
you use stripe or some other payment
gateway like PayPal you say here's a
credit card this is how much I need to
charge this customer you're using a
function as a service already right etc
etcetera
image resize sending emails so all these
things already exist and we're using
them today already all right so what's
the next leap that we need to take in
terms of an architectural shift what we
do today is when we want to use some
functionality that's not provided for us
what do we typically do we reach for a
library write whatever the library is
say we're parsing CSVs or we need to do
an OCR character recognition on the
image what we'll do and again it doesn't
matter if you're doing this in Java or
in Python or Annette or any other
language right we reach for library and
we say ok we need to do this thing we're
going to include this library in our
application we're going to use the API
that the library provides us and that
will give us the functionality so that
we don't need to write this right as
developers we've got really good at
reusing things
when you do reuse today by libraries so
the architectural shift that we're
making now is instead of importing a
library into our application what we
want to do in a servlet style
architecture is we want to think well
maybe we don't need a library to do this
specific thing maybe what we do is we
find a cloud function that already
exists or maybe my teammate over here
wrote this other cloud function for
example for doing authentication right
because in your company not everybody is
going to write an authentication
algorithm or whatever right you you have
somebody in your company right at once
and then the other developers in the
company will use that so that you don't
have to reinvent the wheel a hundred
times so instead of including a library
to do authentication all right what a
lot of people do today is they prop up
some kind of HTTP endpoint and they say
this is the endpoint this is what you
invoked the endpoint with and this is
how you can authenticate you get some
kind of token or cookie or oh ah Thor
whatever it may be back all right so
this is our contextual shift that we
have to make as developers when we start
thinking in terms of architecting a
service application we don't think okay
let's reach for this authentication
library or for this library to do image
recognition or whatever it may be what
we do is we think let's see if there's a
cloud function that I can use that can
pass the data to that we'll go and run
this thing for me and give me the
results right so this is our specific
architectural shift that we have to make
as developers so when we think of a
function as a service and what level of
granularity how much code is in a single
function as a service the the basics
around this are kind of vague but when
we think of a function as a service we
think of it as being a small unit of
work it's not something that contains a
whole feature necessarily it contains
one small thing or a couple of small
things which are related right and they
generally should be single purpose when
we write a cloud function because the
idea behind the cloud function is that
aside from being small it should also
execute very quickly it shouldn't take
forever to run and of course when we say
execute very quickly exactly how long
does that mean the answer is it depends
if you're doing image OCR it might take
a second or two but if you're doing
something like authentication
it should be sub-second maybe maybe
maybe 100 or 200 milliseconds it should
be very fast so we want to weave this
together or weave these cloud functions
together to produce a overall
application that may take much longer to
execute so your functions as a service
should be small and should have a
well-defined API also right aside from
short running your function as a service
for your cloud function should also be
stateless all right so this is where
people generally say well I can't how do
you build something if it's completely
stateless that doesn't mean that your
application is stateless it just means
that that specific function as a service
or cloud function is stateless right but
we obviously obviously need to have
state in our application you have a user
that comes to your website for example
and you know for building something like
a shopping or shopping cart application
you you want to remember what the user
has put into their cart as they navigate
from page to page or look at different
items and then at the end you want to
calculate everything due payments and
all those kinds of things so you do have
to have state but the function itself
shouldn't have state the state should be
external to the function because you
don't necessarily know when the next
call comes in from your user that it's
gonna land on that exact same instance
of your function running in the cloud so
the function can reach into a database
or something like Redis or whatever it
may be whatever using to store state
right again it could be database could
be Redis or whatever right so you can
reach in to that and say the users come
back here's their token give me all the
stuff that they put in their shopping
cart so far right so it's state is there
but it's external to the function
alright so this is one the core tenants
don't grab state it's there but your
function itself should be stateless
right which is a big difference than how
we write web applications today the
other thing around functions as a
service is we generally model them in
two different ways
synchronous and asynchronous because
there are certain cases where when
you're building a function you may say
you know what I don't really want the
result right now I'm gonna go do these
other things for a bit so
run this function with this data and
then I'll come back at some point in the
future and get the results and there are
several different reasons for doing that
architectural you may say I just don't
need the data yet or the users doing
something else or it may be that the
function is doing some kind of
long-running task and you don't want to
wait for it and block the user from
moving ahead okay so functions cloud
functions can be both synchronous and
asynchronous depending on the specific
situation in which you wish to build
them how you wish to architect your
specific application
okay so again async is for long-running
code you get back an ID and using that
ID coming can come and get the results
at some point in the future when you're
ready to go and get them okay so let's
do a quick kind of demonstration of some
of the fast implementations that are
available in the Java space okay and I
believe after this session there's a
deep dive into the FM project so they'll
show you like exactly how song this
comes together what I want to talk about
is convey the idea the concept of server
lists and what it means architectural
okay oh one thing to remember let me go
back to the slide one thing to remember
is that even though what I'm going to
talk about is fast implementations in
Java the client can be anything the
client can be a web browser right
JavaScript or it could be a Python
application running somewhere it doesn't
matter as long as you define your
endpoint in the appropriate way and you
make that public and you know you have
some documentation around it the person
calling it can be anyone it doesn't have
to be Java alright so the first one I
want to talk about is the FN project
alright and this is something that's
sponsored by Oracle it is completely
open source and again there'll be a
longer demonstration after my talk also
what's popular this has been around for
a bit longer something called open risk
it's open source and I believe it's an
Apache project or it's an incubator but
one of the nice things about open wisk
as well as FN project is that you don't
have to build your functions in Java you
can also build them in JavaScript or
Python or go or whatever so almost all
these service framework support
multiple languages that you can
implement the actual functions with so
you're not constrained with necessarily
just writing things in Java okay so and
the third one is Amazon lambda of course
so this is the one that is the oldest
and also it's been around for a while it
supports multiple things but there are
certain things with Amazon lambda as
developers that with developers that
I've talked to don't really like a lot
of the stuff you have to do with lambdas
you have to do in the cloud it's kind of
difficult to do local development and
other things like that right but they're
working on solving those problems so
let's do a quick flyby of the FN project
so that you're ready for the deep dive
in the next one
so what we do is we do have to have
darker running on our laptop and we fire
up the FN server by doing FN start and
then when we want to create a new
project we say FN in it one time in this
case we pick Java and we give it a name
and then we can just go and immediately
execute it from this command line again
using FN so you have to install the FN
project on your laptop or on your
development machine and you do have to
have docker running it uses darker
underneath the hood but all that stuff
is kind of hidden from you through these
command line utilities and what does
this specific Java implementation
actually look like it's pretty
straightforward so when you're writing
and when you're writing these things in
this case you can see we just have one
cloud function it also generates a test
for you but if we look at the hello
function not Java but this is what it
looks like and what we care about is
this specific thing here right we say
public strengths or interfaces right
here at the top handle requests and in
this case we're just taking a string as
an input and we're returning a string as
an output all right but that input and
out can be anything you want it doesn't
have to be something as simple as a
string
give me an array some kind of JSON data
structure whatever you want write
whatever is appropriate for the specific
application that you're building ok so
once we have this what we can do is we
can do it F and run which does the local
execution for testing or for development
or whatever and just a local execution
but when we want to run it inside of the
F in project server we set up the
registry we tell the F
and command-line to deploy that specific
application using this name and then we
can go list all the things that are
deployed inside of that FN project
server which is just a docker container
running your code ok so again the folks
coming on after me is going to do a deep
dive of this I don't want to go too much
into this but this is how easy it is and
this is one of the great things about
service development in my opinion is
that it takes away a lot of the friction
that we encounter when we want to build
a project and we want to deploy right
again as a developer what I'm interested
in is building great applications
building code getting stuff out to
market as quickly as possible for my
customers and as cheaply as possible as
well right so one of the the one of the
other things that are included in the FN
project is that it does have an embedded
database for persistent storage right
remember we talked about how functions
are supposed to be stateless where do
you store that state in the case of the
FN project actually comes with the
database built in I typically tend to
use a ready store because it's an
in-memory store that I can cluster very
easily behind my functions but the FN
project comes with the store and also
comes with the message queue so that you
can do serialized executions of
functions as you wish right so these are
all architectural things that come
together that allow you to build a
complete application inside of the FN
project in a servlet style all right so
a couple of other things that come with
the FN project they're building out
something called FN flow that allows you
to orchestrate multiple function calls
because if you remember functions are
supposed to do one thing and not a whole
bunch of different things or a group of
related things so what we typically do
as you saw in the OCR example that I
gave is we call this function we take
that data might do something with it
call this other function call another
function to compose a complete
application right so let's look at the
orchestration bit very quickly right so
hopefully what this will do is this will
give you an idea of what granularity you
should be building your cloud functions
or your service applications all right
this is the approximate correct level of
coarseness that your functions as a
service should have okay so for example
we have something that we need to book
flights and cancel flights so we'll have
a single service function that does both
booking and cancellation the flights
let's say that we need to book a car or
cancel a car reservation similarly we'll
write a single service function that
does that and you can see we have a
couple other things hotel bookings right
and emailing the the final details to
the actual user etc right but this is
the correct level coarseness that we
want to think about when we think of
building stuff in a service
architectural style it's not super
low-level right so we're not saying ok
let's take a flight or I want to book a
flight that has these specific details
from these airports and blah blah blah
yes we pass that in but the the verbs
that we use here are very simple we have
this function that has two endpoints
booked and canceled and that's about the
level of granularity that you want to
keep things when you're building stuff
in a service architectural stop okay so
for the FM project you can deploy this
on your own servers or you can deploy it
into the Oracle cloud and to make the
friction even less Oracle is going to be
offering managed instances where you
don't even have to set anything up you
basically just say I want FN project
server running somewhere in the cloud
and as you saw here when we wanted to
deploy this locally we set up this FN
registry right and we said this is where
we want to do the deployment so in the
future what you'll do is you'll
basically just use your registry name
that's provided and you could set this
up on your own currently on any cloud
provider the FN project is open source
so but the Holy Grail is having managed
instances where I can just go to a
website and say I want an FN project
deployment just click a button it's set
up it gives you back a key and that's
all you have to do as a developer you
don't have to worry about setting up
darker kubernetes or a CMS or any of
that other stuff basically you write
your application you push a button or
from the command line you set something
up and it deploys it for you
automatically ok so let's do a quick
compare
matrix between the different fast
implementations which are out there
there's open west project defend open
fast cublas service project there's a
bunch of these right now so as you know
when tech takes off or when a new type
of tech takes off a lot of people build
implementations and you know at this
point in the serve list game we're still
very early on so when we think of what
amazon offers and what the FN project
and open wins can all these they support
multiple platforms right so if we want
to look at a comparison matrix for this
unfortunately the space is moving so
fast things change very rapidly so for
example if you use Google Cloud Google
cloud currently supports cloud functions
but they only support wanting them in
JavaScript currently they don't support
running them in any other language AWS
lambdas can be written in Java
JavaScript Go Python and multitude of
other platforms right but my point with
this slide is that we don't really know
where the space is going we we have an
idea where it's going but it's moving so
rapidly that things are changing very
quickly that we don't exactly know what
the future holds three or six months
from now yes you can build server
service applications the market is
evolving very quickly currently we have
loads of service applications out there
right now so it's not something that you
have to wait for all right you don't
have to think yourself well we don't
know what the future holds right now but
if you're building something with Java
you can use the FN project or you can
use Abaddon lambdas but you can't use
Google Cloud functions currently to do
that you will be in the future as my
guess but all these things are evolving
the way we think about orchestration and
security in the cloud is also evolving
very quickly ok but that's one of the
reasons I like service functions is for
me as an app developer I can focus on
exactly what I want to do to get an
application out to my customer as
quickly as possible and I don't have to
worry about security and deployment and
all those other things around it right
and it will just get better over time so
are we at a point where we're ready to
destroy our servers right maybe sold
right now is is this right yes this is
great currently building stuff using
libraries and
we've always spent a lot of time and
resources building out our microservices
architecture and we're starting to
understand what micro services mean and
how we should orchestrate micro services
and how we should split our application
into smaller micro services all right
and if you're doing that currently and
you like it
by all means continue to do it but if
you want to leapfrog ahead of the micro
services looking into service
architecture and writing stuff in a
service style is probably now's a great
time to do it you can get onboard early
you can start thinking about how you can
structure your project with a service
architecture with some of the things
I've given here and we can get a better
idea of how we build stuff in the future
right so we're not quite ready to
destroy our servers quite yet but one of
the things that I tell folks is that
I've said that yes it is cheaper in
terms of how much money I spend to host
my application in the cloud using a
service infrastructure or service
architectural stop and the reason for
that is is all of this service providers
specifically we talked about AWS and
Amazon lambdas what they do is they only
bill you for the exact amount of time
that your function actually runs for
other cloud instances so say you go to
just get like a mini or large or
whatever instance on AWS or Oracle cloud
or whatever what do you do you pay for
every second that you own that server
right so you pay monthly fee or weekly
say you fire up the server and you're
using infrastructure as a service you
pay for that five days or that one week
or however much time that you are
actually using and own that server
whereas in the service world again
because we're whittling everything down
to such a small thing you only pay for
the exact amount of time that your app
is actually executing so let's say that
your service function right we'll just
make this a little bit simple let's say
you have one service function that
service function takes 200 milliseconds
to execute every time you call it and
you call it a thousand times a day you
only pay one 1000 times 200 milliseconds
of execution time okay so a classic case
study in this space is there
a online travel portal called Expedia
does Expedia exist here in India okay do
you're familiar with Expedia they
basically took their infrastructure or
their cloud costs from six to seven
million dollars per month to about five
hundred to six hundred thousand dollars
by using a service architecture right
because again you only pay for that
small slice of time that your function
is actually executing and that's where
the cost savings come in okay
but as this slide says as a developer
sometimes the actual cost of running
something in the cloud doesn't really
matter to me that much
right if I'm expedient I'm spending
seven million dollars yes it does right
but for us we maybe spend one hundred to
two hundred dollars per month on servers
in the cloud at my startup all right so
it doesn't really mean a lot to me what
I really care about is how long does it
take me to get a feature ready out the
door and into the hands of my customers
it's the time to market that I really
care about and on top of that the other
thing right because developers are
expensive everybody in this room gets
paid real money right it's the cost of
development the cost of the actual
developer for myself and the three
developers who are on my team how long
does it take us to build a feature in
terms of engineering time because
engineering time is money right having a
developer working on something is money
that cost often is very large compared
to the actual cost that I'm paying to
have a server running in the cloud
somewhere so it's the time to market
that I care about and it's how long or
how much time does it take how many
resources do I have to put into building
out a feature that's the other main
thing to care about yes I care about how
much I pay for infrastructure costs but
that's the least of my concerns
I care about those two other things more
okay so thank you for listening you'll
have some references here the slides are
available online and I'll turn it back
over to Steven thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
