the first time I've been to Java 1
obviously I'm from the UK I'm from
originally from Cambridge in so that's
where arms based arm is a computer chip
company you may have heard that we
designed the processors which we then
licensed to the silicon provider so the
likes of freescale for example ta TI
stmicroelectronics and so my background
is really more in CPUs and CPU
architectures obviously I've done some
software engineering but I'll be frank
I'm sure that you guys are probably more
experts in Java than I am what I'm
hoping I can do is give you an overview
of the overview of the hardware and the
boards and the kind of applications that
aren't getting designed into today and
you know this isn't a huge room or a
huge group so if you've got questions
please just fire away I'm more than
happy to answer those and so funnily
enough start with a couple of marketing
slides so it still amazes me the arm
partnership remember arm doesn't make
the chips but the arm partners combined
the shipping around about eight nine
billion chips per year I mean this is a
very very big number and this spans from
the really tiny 32-bit microcontrollers
that you might find in the cortex-m
range so you heard some announcements
from from Freescale earlier on this week
and they talked about the kinetise
microcontrollers so these are based on a
three-stage RISC architecture you know
they're in the range of hundreds of
megahertz but they go down to really
tiny cortex m0 processor based parts
which are are really where we think the
big volume for the Internet of Things is
going to be but we don't stop there
we've also got stuff like you know the
cortex a range of processors so the big
difference between the cortex a and the
cortex n being there's a memory
management unit on the cortex a series
of processors and then right up to the
servers and network infrastructure
obviously the nice thing is that the ARM
architecture is consistent across these
and in terms of Java support or
the java remy is more focused on the
cortex-m range of products Joe Bresee
embedded more on the gateways into
clients and then obviously Java e up on
the high end and and I mention arm
partners because it's not really us
alone that does this we work in
combination with most of the major
semiconductor partners we work in
obviously with guys like Oracle in terms
of software providers and there's a huge
ecosystem of third-party tools
developers operating system vendors etc
that support arm-based devices and the
Internet of Things is becoming a big
buzzword at the moment and this is
interesting for me so I've been working
in the microcontroller area for around
about eight years and it used to be that
you know I was working stuff inside a
washing machines and cars and no one
really paid much attention to this stuff
and now I meet people that are totally
outside of the electronics industry and
that you know that they're using Arduino
there they're alive to the possibilities
of what a microcontroller can do
embedded in everyday objects and I think
this is really interesting and there's a
confluence of different things that's
enabling this so so one is the
capability of the microcontrollers and
the price point they're reaching one is
the awareness of what you can do this
technology and the other is the
development platform so you know back in
the day I start to a program assembler
on the ARM architecture so you know it's
very focused on one particular device
and this is this is okay and there's
microcontrollers that are based on the
pic architecture or the 8051
architecture or the AVR architecture and
you can use assembler on those but it's
quite difficult to move projects across
to with different devices so obviously
embedded C became more popular in the
2000s I would say and then you have this
ability to migrate across devices a
little bit more easily
maybe reuse use your code across
different projects and microcontrollers
very diverse they've got different
peripheral different packaging different
memory options so this is important and
so this is this combine is really I
think enabled this new mindset of the
internet and things and
from my point of view I'm focused on the
device end of things so I'm looking at
the the small sensor or wearable devices
that combine a microcontroller maybe
some MEMS technology battery and these
are going to build up the bulk of
devices but the move away from embedded
C to something which is more platform
based so the likes of Arduino Raspberry
Pi or Java that elate allows you to
raise one level of abstraction above the
device itself I think is opening up the
possibilities to an even bigger audience
it's partly because of the the
capability of the devices so you know
they go onto smaller geometries in terms
of silicon technology the memory sizes
are bigger and so we've seen a pretty
sharp uptick in terms of the number of
cortex-m so I'm looking at the low-end
stuff here so I'm talking about
microcontrollers so I'm chips around 1.9
billion of these things and these are
going into so the microcontrollers I
mentioned the radio so when I say radio
I really mean it could be a 2 2 dots to
spur 15.4 it could be Bluetooth could be
Wi-Fi and also smart sensors now not
every sensor has embedded intelligence
in it today a lot of them are just
analog out and you put it into an A to D
of a microcontroller and it's done there
but particularly for the MEMS sensors
where you've got sense of huge in
algorithms having some intelligence
onboard is important and you know when
people talk about the Internet of Things
there's a lot of data potentially be
generated by these little gadgets or
sensors very important there's some
intelligence to firstly give context and
filter out unnecessary stuff because
often the communication is the more
power hungry part of the system so I
wanted to draw attention to this guy so
this is 2 millimeters by 2 millimeters
squared chip it's got a 32-bit ARM
Cortex m0 processor inside and this is
you know this isn't like a an R&amp;amp;D
project this is a commercial product
available from freescale through
distribution and I think this is this is
pretty cool and you know they're
inspired by a medical swallowable device
so you know with the right encapsulation
pairing it with some kind of radio
endoscopy z' you can have a patient
swallow this thing and it will transmit
the data wirelessly obviously you don't
to retrieve it after it so the wireless
part is pretty important so you know I
mentioned the confluence of events there
in terms of developer awareness and the
technology so IOT standards are another
big one and I don't know did anyone see
Zack Shelby's presentation today the
chap from cents an old arm
so I'm actually acquired a company
called sensor owned a couple of weeks
back and you know a couple of notable
things they've been up to so they
they're driving standards in low power
connectivity so if you 6lowpan so ipv6
for lightweight devices and also coapt
and the idea here is when you've got
advice which is very limited on resource
remember some of these micro controllers
can be kilobytes of flash and RAM it's
important to minimize the kernel size
but it's also important to minimize the
amount of communication over the system
going back to the kind of little later
becoming big data thing and so by using
you know dedicated protocols that are
compatible with but optimized for low
power networks they've got some pretty
compelling stuff there so you know arms
pretty pretty much bought into that
obviously we acquired the company we
believe having open standards as the
foundation with Internet of Things is
very important so I'm curious as to how
many people here actually do embedded
projects today I mean are you doing
stuff for mobile so there are some
embedded guys here today
so are there anyone is there anyone who
doesn't do embedded but it's just
interested okay that's that's really
interesting okay
I mean this is this is what we're we're
starting to see is the you know you may
have been doing mobile app development
or PC app development but people are
starting to think hang on we can do
physical extensions to our application
we can create you know a device that
communicates by a bluetooth to our app
or we can have some kind of sensor that
can then connect up to the cloud and
this is I think where
one of the excitement around the
internet things is coming but the point
is that you know unlike a mobile or a
desktop type platform where you've got a
fixed UI you have a fixed well you have
a baseline of resource that you know is
available microcontroller is a very very
constrained they're very tailored to the
specific physical situation that they're
in so you know you might be wanting to
design something that connects to your
phone measures your blood-alcohol
content before it lets you text so you
know there are alcohol sensors out there
which are five dollars they connect via
A to D you can connect this to a
microcontroller and you know pretty much
exactly what device components you need
and in this design and how much memory
you need and so if you're manufacturing
this in volume it's very important to
cost reduce what you've got and this is
why there's so much diversity in terms
microcontrollers so they're spanning all
kinds of markets and as I mentioned
before you know connectivity is really
the key trend that we're seeing at the
moment in terms of vendors of
microcontroller devices so these are
some of the guys that doing arm powered
devices today and there's a lot of them
there's about I think 2000 different
SKUs of ARM based microcontrollers and
what you've seen is the Java world the
Java ME world in the microcontroller
world is starting to overlap so you'd
have already seen that Raspberry Pi with
the arm 1176 as a port of java Remy
you'll have seen that the stm32f4 hard
was it 200 has a port with the Kyle
board and I know that the kinetise 70
from freescale is now starting to get
support from java as well so slowly
these worlds are overlapping that's not
to forget of course that jar se embedded
for the higher end of the roadmap I'm
talking about the low end stuff here
there's the mid-range of the arm
roadmaps already already very well
supported by Java but I think maybe my
bias my background is the Internet of
Things and the broad base of sensor type
applications that are arising and so
what I'm talking about what you can do
with the cortex n these are resource
limited devices but it makes them low
cost it makes them low power you know
things like the Pebble watch you may
have heard of so this is
and a watch that tethers by bluetooth to
your smartphone has an e-ink display you
can customize the application as to what
it displays it's really neat wearable
device crowdfunded which i think is on
the next slide so this thing is based on
the cortex m3 vital sign monitor again
this is a cortex n based device that can
be used to measure temperature and you
know pulse oximeter and all this kind of
stuff smart lighting so instead of
having lights that go on and off you can
have an intelligent ballast that dims
them I don't know if this is a problem
in the US but in the UK the local
governments they can't afford to keep
the lights on so they're turning off the
lights and this is you know obviously
has implications in terms of crime so if
you can dim them or do this more
intelligently you can save power and
money furthermore instead of sending
people out to you know on maintenance
runs to work out when the lights are
broken or not you have you know a
proactive monitoring of the lights in
the situation's they're in and this kind
of sensing and field proactive
maintenance and detection of problems is
important not just for lighting but
we've seen stuff like the big belly
trash compactor then you've heard of
this one so instead of having a trash
cart that goes on a fixed run to collect
the trash the trashcan sends a signal
over the net to say I'm full come and
fashion up the betch of the trash and
these seem like trivial ideas but of
course this is a lot of trucks on the
road a lot of traffic a lot of co2 being
produced the other one smart parking
actually have that in San Francisco
pumping cooled Street Line networks is
doing SF Park so they have parking based
sensors and they know when the parking
bay is occupied or not they pair it with
an app instead of driving around looking
for a spot you're directed to the
nearest spot and you can pay remotely
with the app so this is some really cool
stuff that's going on again these are
cortex-m based devices the cow thing you
can kind of guess is another kind of
medical earth type device and the other
interesting thing is as platform support
for microcontrollers is coming online
and Java among them we're seeing company
create physical applications rather than
just you know mobile or desktop ones
physical applications from almost
nowhere and this is a really cool
example so Pebble watch has anyone heard
of this thing before everyone's heard it
already okay I won't go on it part it to
you long but the point is whether they
requested a hundred thousand dollars and
they got 10 million that's not a bad
deal so in terms of the cortex-m
processor roadmap you know the
instruction set is kind of down there no
one's really expected to read exactly
what these instructions are the
important thing to say really is there a
superset of each other obviously if
you're programming in Java this stuff is
completely abstracted from you anyway
for the most part so perhaps not that
interesting but in terms of the
capability even the lowest end we got a
question even even the lowest end can
support pretty advanced protocols for
communication and in terms of
instruction set so the the very smallest
cortex m0 uses the thumb instruction set
and so this is a 16-bit wide opcode
which still uses the same 32-bit
registers and is implemented for very
very small code size for a
microcontroller where you've got
embedded flash this is very important
obviously it's you know optimized for
low size in terms of the the decode and
the implementation of the core as well
but the important thing is that the the
thumb architecture and the thumb to
architecture there upward compatible
anything that you you write on the
application code that you write on ends
eros theoretically will run on the
highest end arm cause there's a
continuum of instruction set
architecture there and you know I didn't
know whether I should start talking
about this here I imagine if you're
coming from a Java background maybe 8
and 16-bit processors aren't things that
you really look at very much but in the
world I'm from you know there's there's
8-bit processors and 8-bit
microcontrollers of comparable price to
the 32-bit and
people make choices should they use an
8-bit one should these are 32-bit one
and typically what we see is that the
the code size for cortex-m is
significantly better than the 8 and
16-bit and this is you know it depends
on what you're doing and if you're doing
a simple turning a light switch on and
off toggling a pin then perhaps the a
bit architecture is going to do better
but as soon as you start doing any kind
of filtering any kind of DSP algorithms
any kind of control code that requires
protocol stacks for communication where
the addresses are going to be wider than
8-bit this stuff just it doesn't work as
efficiently as as 32-bit and this is a
little bit of an example why so a lot of
the Internet of Things applications are
communicating with the outside world
their sensor beta coming in which is
going to be analog converted to digital
and typically you know 10 12 bit is
common if you want to manipulate at
16-bit type multipliers are required
maybe you don't ever need to see this
stuff but the point here is if you're
doing it on an 8-bit micro a 16 by 16
bit multiply gets deconstructed into a
whole load of small 8-bit per tick and
register shifting type operations and in
the cortex-m obviously this is one
operation this may seem a little bit
trivial but from the from the code size
point of view you gotta remember in in
terms of the silicon designer and MCU
that flash memory consumes most of the
die so the mote the more you can do to
reduce the code size the better what I
do I press the wrong button
now again
and the other benefit in terms of
efficiency so looking at some of those
remote sensing applications we saw
before and that could be smart parking
meter it could be medical it could be
any number of these types of internet
things application the important thing
is to maximize the battery life of the
application you don't wanna be charging
your Pebble watch every day you'd much
rather do it every week and and the way
it achieves this kind of power
efficiency is making sure the duty cycle
reactive you just like it is minimized
so you're really only powering up for
the communication of data and you really
want to minimize that for the
compression and also you want to get any
processing done in as few cycles as
possible so this is why we've seen you
know pretty good uptake of cortex-m in
in the low-power wireless type parts
which get associated with
microcontrollers for these kind of
internet things sensor applications and
this is actually I borrowed this from
freescale so this is a cortex m0 so I
lettuce L micro controller up against a
couple of sixty in an 8-bit mine crews
have you got any questions so far is
this making any sense okay I realized
I've gone quite quickly through this
stuff
and in terms of sensor so I lived to
this part earlier so you know sensors
are really going to be the bulk of the
the end nodes and Internet of Things
applications and having intelligence of
that sensor no that's going to do some
pre-processing we talked about sensor
fusion app applications before doing
some compression and really you know you
might imagine you in a situation where
you've got some kind of input that's
processed through a cortex-m device you
really want to minimize the
communication on the system or the
communication to the bigger processes
that have to wake up them and do
something about it so that's partly the
motivation for why people are putting
these microcontrollers at the end nodes
and so in terms of embedded development
obviously you mentioned before there's
different approaches to it you could be
using an Arduino board and Arduino
shields to put the specific peripherals
or communication devices on top of it
you could be using a dip form factor in
bed with a breadboard and you could be
putting different components next to
that you may be just spending your own
your own board immediately there's lots
of different ways of prototyping how are
you going to get this device form factor
together you might be using the Kyle
board or the Raspberry Pi board and
simply using some the i/o or the
expansion to put your your components
next way I think the important thing is
from from the Java point of view because
Java REME has these specific I squared C
in GPIO constructs you can you can do it
pretty much as you would any kind of
Java program there's nothing
particularly different about it but you
do need to be aware of what component
you're pairing it up with and in terms
of you know what are you doing so I've
got a an overview of an ST
microcontroller here I'm not going to go
into all the details of the thing I mean
that the key thing is you're more than
like you're going to be connecting it to
some kind of you know radio USB Ethernet
you want the thing to communicate are
obviously the protocol stacks exist
within Java and me to do this and you
want to be receiving some kind of sensor
input
that's not to forget you may be using
actuators you may be flashing lights
there could be all sorts of other ways
you're doing UI but again these exist as
either you could be communicating by you
are to your Bluetooth module you could
be using a 2d to communicate with your
round call sensor all of these things
are pretty much presented as as you
would normally develop Java and there's
nothing particularly different about it
but you do need to be aware of what are
the registers within these different
devices if they are I squared C what are
the 8 e commands if you're communicating
with a mode and over over here you are
and one thing we do have but on is a
components database that helps give you
a view of what the different components
there are out there to pair with
microcontrollers it's also got some good
guidance in terms of hello world code
and what the registers are in each of
these devices as well as some examples
of how you put them on the board so this
is something that's quite interesting I
think and in terms of Jeremy today
obviously that's ported to specific
board instances and that has some
abstraction layers there that could help
you potentially scale beyond just those
implementations in terms of Java Remy
embedded so one board is supported today
I know for sure is the stm32 board I
think you know it's worth highlighting
here is the Internet of Things is just
coming to fruition as the capacity of
these devices goes up the complexity of
the applications all MCU but also java
re' is coming down and we're just at the
beginning here the java world opening up
to all microcontrollers and I think you
know I think it's it's definitely
getting there obviously there's more
than just a couple of wards out there
but I think you're going to see over the
next year or so this is going to scale
quite dramatically and I talked already
about you know the types of
communication you might have in an
embedded application obviously Java ME
makes good provision for the API is
using 80 commands and a 2ds and all of
this stuff
and so in terms of resource and again
this you know this is an interesting one
from my point of view because resource
today actually that you know that
they've done a good job with reducing
down Jeremy from Java s he embedded in
terms of the requirement so 130k Ram 350
flash for the minimum implementation
obviously there's you know some MC use
that just don't require that don't
require a full Java ME stack and don't
have quite the capacity to run it today
but I think you're gonna see more and
more of an overlap as the years go on as
has anyone used Java ME on a cortex
microcontroller yet so I've interest oh
good okay how about Raspberry Pi okay
yeah this is Oracle yeah
and the work flows you know using the
NetBeans IDE and it's kind of business
as usual I hope from your point of view
the idea itself is free of charge and
hopefully makes it easy to get access to
this stuff so so this is the stm32 board
and you can see it's got an LCD display
it's got Ethernet connectivity you can
press the buttons and interact with the
board like that I you know from my point
of view you can definitely do graphic
interfaces using a cortex-m core the
libraries exist but if you're in the
java world and you are not resource
constrained i would be tempted to use
the SE just because of the extended
graphics aport you've got there so
you've got java effects on on ER SE
embedded which is going to make things a
lot easier
and obviously the cortex m3 has support
for graphics but it's more of the kind
of it's not you know full motion video
or 3d rendering or anything like that
it's really very simple UI kind kind of
capability and typically a lot of the
that's not to say exclusively because
certainly for the K 70 and the cortex m4
based microcontrollers you do see some
pretty advanced graphics on them but
when you go down to the lower level
microcontrollers certainly these tend to
be headless type devices so things like
your Fitbit for example or the Nike
FuelBand these are both cortex m3 thank
you cool when does have have a display
there but it's not you know not a full
VGA display or anything like that
and you can see how you know that we
talked about the different iOS that you
have on your microcontroller device and
you can see how these are you know
mapped to a class in Java and map to
variable was in terms of GPIO pins that
can then be assigned values you know all
of this stuff should be pretty familiar
to you and so that's that's Jeremy so
that yes he embedded addition has been
around for a few while a few years
longer and there's some significant
optimizations that have been done in
recent years to help support
floating-point so we have hardware
floating-point in in the cortex a cause
which is now supported in geography we
have the thumb instruction set which is
got some specific sort support now in in
gyrus here as well so yes so that you
know the thumb to architecture I
mentioned earlier on so the whole idea
of thumb two is reduce the code size in
the same way as Thun but it's a mixed 16
32-bit instruction set architecture so
you're still getting the full
performance not compromising on the
performance and this is something that
the latest releases of Java is exploited
but obviously you get the support of
Java effects and the graphics libraries
that that go along with that as well so
in terms of Java EE type development
boards and I think a me and I see a
ported to the PI if I'm correct that
sound right yeah and it in you know in
in the arm vocabulary you would call the
Raspberry Pi an NP you rather an MCU it
isn't embedded flash it's not a you know
it's a slightly different approach than
with typically class as a
microcontroller however just the price
point of the thing and the availability
and that the peripheral expansion means
people are using it for microcontroller
type developments and also with the the
idle exercies of
scale part the party there is a Broadcom
1176 boys so this is a free scale I am
EXO this is a quad-core free scale
cortex a9 this is you know extremely
high performance so go ahead I think the
answer is on the on the one board you
mean on the one board I don't believe so
today but that stuff will be coming and
I do you know there's nothing stopping
you pairing it through some kind of
connectivity to the board but I
understand you probably want something
that's pre certified and all this good
stuff yeah exactly yeah exactly so you I
think the question was do you have it on
one board that's already because if
you're getting on to cellular networks
you probably need it certified and all
this kind of stuff yeah I believe so
I believe so but this informations from
Oracle so I think and I think actually
there was an announcement on the one box
IOT approach from freescale and Oracle
earlier on in the week and I'm fairly
sure this was the board they referring
do that so yeah
yes Java as he and this one box is also
at the Oracle booth
that's right yep
okay I finished my presentation half an
hour earlier than I thought we would so
are there any questions other than the
ones we just had any any okay I'm really
on the microcontroller side of things so
yeah yep
that is a very good question I mean and
I know in the cortex n in the
architecture you have a specific you
have a cystic time which is specific
memory map location and a specific
interrupt and in the hardware it's all
there
whether it's hooked into Java Remy I
don't know I need to check that okay I
think my colleague over there might have
a better answer I'm afraid I don't know
I can find out for you as our Java
expert Andrew slot is not here so that
their friend the microcontroller guy
here so I can tell you all about the our
microcontrollers but I mean if you wanna
give me the question I can go and find
out the answer
so let's find the so in the java remy
stack model there you can see there's a
hardware abstraction layer and basically
basically I believe that the porting is
done per device and there is going to be
variation between those devices and so
you either need an abstraction layer
that can accommodate the different
peripheral layouts and and register at
the moment that I think this is why at
the moment we're seeing you know kind of
piece ports to specific targets and not
across the board because there is
variation and this is the you know this
is the nuance of the embedded world
every part as a subtly different
like you say peripheral map and pens are
varying between different devices and
the resources vary so yeah you're right
that at the moment I think you would
need to modify the porting layer there
and that has to be done per device on
board it's a good question for Oracle
