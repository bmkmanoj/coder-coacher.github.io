the first kickoff event in 2018
I'm your host Javed Mohammad and I have
as my guest today once again
Siddhartha Agarwal VP of Product
Management Siddhartha thank you so much
for giving us your time now thanks a lot
for having me Javed all right so I
thought Sadat I'd just gonna kick off
the conversation this is the first event
we had about a 21 City Oracle code event
huge all across both nationally
international we're doing it again this
year
you wanna kind of just kind of take us a
little back what happened in 2017 and
what I had how things change for this
year literally now I'm in 2017 was a
huge year for us across the various
events we did as you said across Europe
across Asia Pacific across North America
Latin America we had about 10,000 plus
folks who came to it not to mention the
number of registrations we got which
were greater plus we had a lot of people
attending the hands-on labs the zip labs
etc and we had 350,000 views of the
online content because some of the
content we record we make available and
we got a lot of feedback from developers
about what they liked what they were
excited about and that's gone into
significantly how we're thinking about
2018 around Oracle code 2018 they wanted
the next generation of content so we're
bringing in server less and function
based content into the mix talking a lot
about AI and ml and actually the
application of AI and ml we're also
talking about blockchain use cases
around blockchain and how people could
build their own blockchain technologies
definitely chatbots
being able to have new interaction
paradigms where you can use image
recognition with chat parts to be able
to you know be able to build even more
interactive applications so very you
know next generation of content even
though it's just been a year huh but you
know connecting with the developers
around that so I saw the keynote you had
an excellent presentation no thank you
I thought you were gonna do the buying a
basketball together and I thought maybe
you'd even change it from the Warriors
to the Lakers but you did something even
more interesting
you sold of Larry's car and you still
have a job which is amazing so okay for
those of you who weren't at the keynote
it was an amazing demo where I think
Siddhartha had spotted Larry's Lexus I
don't know what the name of the car sits
there
it's the Lexus LFA there are only 500 of
those produced okay and larry has one
yes and we had taken a photograph of
that but let's not say that you know I
saw this car where we used the car as an
example
uh-huh to actually be able to say
through a chat part I could sell the car
and that goes on to a dealer network
where multiple dealers are participating
and then someone else who you know let's
say made a lot of money selling Bitcoin
and whatever it is wanting to buy a
really expensive car and that expensive
car is not on the Lots of all the
dealers so now they could get that car
off of this blockchain network of
dealers and that was an interesting use
case where we actually use chat BOTS in
the front end or the user interaction we
used functions to actually be able to
put the car onto the blockchain network
to do the CARFAX report on the car to
validate that is the car that is being
said and then showed the ability to
build a blockchain network very quickly
and easily as a developer and it should
actually show the distributed ledger
yeah actually the transaction actually
happening going from one dealer to
another and all the kind of the steps in
between yeah so we had effectively we
were able to put the car through one
dealer onto the blockchain network and
then all the other dealers had
visibility into those cars that were
part of that network so that's called a
private permission blockchain and then
when a customer came and said hey I'm
looking for an expensive Lexus right the
dealer while he didn't have the car on
his lot he could go off onto the
blockchain network look at the cars and
then do a secure transaction to transfer
the car from some other dealer to
himself and then have the customer come
in to test
the car to fill out the paperwork etc so
it's it's really made the transaction
much more efficient much more seamless
much faster much easier and effectively
expanded his inventory significantly
from not just what's on his lot but
what's available on this blockchain
network so one of the things I wanted to
kind of get across to the folks who are
watching this live or will see this
later on is that we're providing a lot
of opportunities actually for folks to
actually try out some of this technology
and then you talked about FM serverless
yes so there's a you want to talk a
little bit about that in terms of things
folks can do absolutely I mean server
less is a really important technology
because the key benefit of it is you pay
for what you use meaning your code is
instantiated and run and you only charge
for that portion of time it is run and
then it goes away as opposed to spinning
up a VM and paying by the hour or by the
whatever it is generally instantiated
the chemistry running etc so with
functions today for example you have AWS
lambda based functions but that is very
proprietary because the only way that
you can use those functions is against
the AWS cloud service you can't run it
with it on your laptop you can't run it
in a third-party cloud and the other
thing is when you want to chain together
functions it's very hard because you
have a Yama file which is an xml-based
descriptor file and that's kind of hard
to define a programming construct of
what to do and what to do when they
recover when an error happens and how
you recover so what we've done is you
created an open-source project because
we really committed to making sure that
innovation is very fast
it's called FN project dot io so anyone
can go to FN project project that IO yes
FN project or IO and there we given
people the ability to write their
functions in any programming language
they could you go they could use
JavaScript node.js etc we deploy those
functions on containers and we give them
a server that can actually it's just a
piece of code that can run on their
laptop that can run in Oracle's public
cloud it can run in their data center
can run in a third-party cloud it
doesn't matter so now they're the code
or the function that they written is
portable across different clouds
they could do dev tests on their laptop
if they wanted and then we've given the
notion of what is called FN flow where
we can chain together these functions
into a application if you will because
that's what you do is you build an
application like in the case of the car
you had to you know check the CARFAX
report you have to check various
elements of that before you said yes
this car can be put onto the network and
so that we're giving you a programming
paradigm and job are to be able to
compose it to be able to easily do
debugging on it and monitor those
functions one of the key takeaways I
kind of got from your from the whole
presentation was even with something
like blockchain Oracle kind of takes
care of a lot of like not only what goes
on on the front end but also a lot of
the backend work yes and so it's a
really great opportunity for folks to
actually try it out and I think that the
Oracle code events you want to talk a
little bit about the great deal we have
going on for people to try yes any of
the cloud services right well the thing
is that you know we want we want to
reduce the amount of DevOps that
developers having to do because they're
doing less coding if they're managing
the infrastructure managing the
operations of that infrastructure even
if it's something like kubernetes but
they have to manage the orchestration of
kubernetes scaling up of kubernetes
being able to have high reliability
around kubernetes so you providing a lot
of cloud services for open source
software like kubernetes like Kafka like
SPARC etcetera and in order for enabling
them to experiment with their technology
to play with that technology for those
who are coming to the Oracle code events
we're giving them a $500 credit okay and
the $500 credit is actually being burned
at the infrastructure-as-a-service rate
so that even if they're using past level
capabilities not for my service
capabilities they're getting a
significant amount of time it's I think
something like six thousand hours were
at the time that they could use these
services for well it sounds like a great
deal of something really worth checking
out yes so Siddartha is always a great
pleasure meeting you thank you so much
for coming here Jerry thanks a lot for
having me here thank you yes thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
