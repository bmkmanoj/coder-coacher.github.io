got a number of folks here I think we've
got about been 50 measure so I wanted to
talk to you about some interesting
developments going on in the what we
call ioe some people call it Internet of
Things internet of everything
machine-to-machine is another common
term lots of activity going on and we
have representatives from from Oracle
and Qualcomm here my name is Joe to camp
I'm product manager for our chipsets the
number of chip sets that are going into
wide variety devices m2m ioe type
devices so pretty much non handset non
tablet type devices and we're seeing a
very large opportunity out there in the
market in this whole market for cellular
based chipsets beyond the traditional
handsets and tablet market essentially
we're seeing not only Wi-Fi but also
cell phone chips you know 3g and 4g
chips are proliferating across a wide
variety of different types of products
security home automation electric
vehicles telematics and the automotive
space fleet management to all sorts of a
you know industrial scientific medical
applications where it makes sense a lot
of cases to use cellular in some cases
it makes more sense to use Wi-Fi Wi-Fi
is little lower lower costs and then for
certain types of products maybe for you
see maybe some interesting concepts like
connected light bulbs where you can from
your smartphone now have a you know the
change the temperature of the bulb you
know the color of the bulb and also the
brightness speakers you know you've seen
the the thermostats you know the smart
thermostats maybe more sense to use the
Wi-Fi or low-power Wi-Fi type
communications for those type of
products Qualcomm is an all joining a
sort of framework for connecting
products doing it seamlessly which we
have been discussing on I think there's
a strong ecosystem developing around
that but my far focus today is really in
the 3g 4g space and to discuss some of
the solutions we're enabling
you know this internet of everything
type of a ecosystem and there's a lot of
components of the will talk about the 60
to 70 T which is our our 3G chip this is
our low-end 3g chip very popular it's
been deployed way over a hundred million
devices all around the world in every 3g
market and a wide variety of types of
MDM oh I internet of everything type of
devices and then we have a 6,200 based
products remit to your 3g with some
additional capability some functionality
a little higher tier also with the same
type of functionality now the ability to
support a Java Java ME right on the
processor so the sum of key value of
that running java you know obviously a
very strong ecosystem of java developers
and we have a essentially the processor
available on on the on our chip so
eliminates the need for an external AP
so it saves on bom cost it saves on
board area very very important when you
talk about very very small embedded
internet of everything applications when
you want to get 3g and 4g chips you know
in all sorts of new types of products
they have to be very small very cheap
low power and we believe that the 60 to
70 T is really very well suited to that
now we'll talk about today something
called our ioe development platform
which is this case has a 60 to 70 T chip
or low end 3g chip which has an arm 9
processor on there essentially running
the the Java Java stack JVM and provides
a quite a bit of functionality in terms
of processor capability so again
eliminates the need up typically what we
see is working with module vendors
module vendors take our chip and
integrate the 60 to 70 t we're on the
run the Java stack on on the t and then
it's open for third-party developers if
the module vendors are others to develop
applications specific for for the
vertical
and it's really a way of abstracting out
and simplifying and using obviously
above the you know very large community
developer base of Java programmers out
there you don't you know you don't need
to access the lower level details of
accessing modem function and like 80
commands we still allow access to 80
commands necessary but Sir abstracts it
out and allows much simpler faster
programming of applications across these
verticals from smart energy to health
care to logistics to fleet management
and it allows you know this abusive up
you know this very powerful Java
platform to develop these applications
quickly to meet the vertical needs so
just a quick summary and we'll get into
some of the you know the little more
details on the ioe internet of
everything a development platform but
this is working with our partner digi in
terms of we have products available for
a distribution to allow developers to x
develop actually on the platform itself
so that has the 60 to 70 based you know
60 to 70 modem in there and we have a
simple setup very easy to get going you
know it comes in a box bring it up
quickly hello world you know bring it
quickly awesome onboard sensors you can
prototype very very quickly you can add
there's interfaces to statics other
external sensors and and you can
basically develop and then test the
application on the actual device very
quickly and then this enables you to you
know through your partners are through
you know that your customers to rapidly
go to market again the key value is you
know running right on the chip extremely
important for these low-cost you know
ubiquitous MDM application we want to be
a very compact small platform so again
allows you to from concept rapid
development we had up Developers
Conference of dump link in san diego and
and we had a calf on we're a number of
people you have these boards got up in
the morning and develop very very
innovative application
just in a few hours utilizing this board
so from concept prototype demonstration
action on the network you can run it we
have this busy a sim card you can you
can run it right on that over the
wireless network and then optimized you
know your your design you know as you
bet you go through the prototype and
then working at GABA see with you know
module vendors are working to
commercialize through your partners to
develop applications for the specific
verticals any any questions we r think
we're gonna have a Q&amp;amp;A session at end
but i wanted to you introduce a shoe
with the he's you know one of the key
drivers within qualcomm for this old
java development activity on the are 60
to 70 and also 6200 products we're also
looking at 4g based products we see a
need for certain segments of enabling
higher speed data capabilities of also
in the 4g space okay oh dennis is next
okay i'm sorry Dennis from or Cola oil
and then we'll hand off the UH shoe
hello everyone okay my name is Dennis
Magna I am one of the technical leaks at
Oracle's Java ME embedded team and in
the team I am responsible for porting
Java ME embedded when different chipsets
boards and hardware including the ioe
development platforms that we are going
to discuss during this session so let's
go ahead and talk a bit about a flavor
of Java is that we are using in this
particular board but before we start
just read this general information that
you may see in every presentation from
Oracle's employee generally there are
three different Java me flavors from
Oracle that coexist in the embedded
market first of them is Java card as
that is targeted for such constraint
devices as sim card payment cards IDs
and more then we have Java ME embedded
Java mean but it is mainly targeted to
devices with memory requirements between
1 to 10 megabytes and the last one is
Java is embedded that is mainly used on
the devices which has a bunch of memory
and other resources assume but this
platform footprint requirement that you
see on the slide is quite artificial as
for java aamir we can it can be
successfully leveraged on on the devices
that data for java see embedded and in
addition we can build a particular java
in embedded configuration and run it on
some Java on some Java card targeted
platforms and as you can guess for ioe
development platform we you
we are using Java ME embedded the first
and maybe the most obvious reason why
why why we are using it it's just
because it satisfies platforms memory
and tragedy resources requirements but
that's not all among other benefits we
have that Java ME embedded is optimized
for low footprint ARM architecture
devices it can be easily ported between
wide variety of hardware chipsets and
boards as for software stack we have our
best-in-class multitasking virtual
machine and additional api's that make
it easier to develop comprehensive and
reach applications that are targeted to
the embedded market and also we take
care of developers and trying to make
our development tools to be best in
class 2 chainz for example you can lead
java sdk tools and emulation and
developed directly from NetBeans eclipse
then let's take a look at Java ME
embedded software stack as that is used
on Io a development platform here we
have in blue you can see standardized
Java libraries the libraries are
standardized by java community process
in the end blue the main library is
sealed DC virtual machine is our highly
optimized virtual machine in addition to
the basic functionality eaten it
supports multitasking on-device
debugging and such features like and
memory and network monitors in green you
can see additional libraries one was the
most important of them of these green
libraries the green libraries are
Oracle's additional api's that are not
standardized but whatever but were
developed in order to to support some
required functionality in in Java ME
embedded a CAD system one of the main
library ski is device access
I this library gives you ability to to
get access to on boards peripherals and
sensors decorations and so on so forth
and the last one is I have already
mentioned previously Java me is decayed
tools emulators and netbeans set Eclipse
plugins the last supported version is
that we have four ioe development
platform is suited for it was released
just quite just two days ago on Saturday
and in addition to the software's take
that I showed you in the previous slide
it has some new features that i would
like to highlight the first one is full
feature to link over serial OS be using
this feature you just now can plug in
your board into a laptop and ova using
USB wire and start developing these
netbeans or eclipse different
applications and what else i want to
mention organizes features it now at
this moment it's only available
exclusively for i/o a development
platform so in the near future we are
going to provide the same functionality
for as a supported platforms from oracle
like raspberry pi or discover boat and
so on so forth but at this moment you
can try it only on this cheap on this
board again next device access library
was updated from version to version be
the update includes support for ADC deck
in pulse counter peripherals and some
additional enhancements and improvements
that makes make it easier to develop and
has applications for the embedded market
and the last thing is you don't need
until your Board will be dealing with
you at home you can start developing
giovanni embedded applications that are
targeted to Qualcomm I you development
platform right now and you could test
every
on sdks emulator emulators immolates all
the hardware's it presents on the board
and as soon as you get your board you
can launch your application on the bar
without me at any additional
modifications and some words about
zeroed more the roadmap that was that
was negotiated between croco moment
oracle at this moment or curl at least
is going to support three different
chipset families first of them is 60 to
70 T as Jacque has already mentioned
this chipset is alleged leveraged in our
development platform and from Oracle
site Oracle has already delivered to
java versions for this plate from 0 2
and 0 for other chipset families 6600
and 96 1582 15 also planned to be
supported and it's and I suppose aterial
noodles you may see as the same versions
of the libraries on these chips soon too
but as i get is i guess any embedded co2
is already support you tent maybe exists
in the market for the for the chip
families 6600 it for the future in
during this ja 1a i suppose at you my
you might hear about in e8 that was
announced announced during the keynote
and in the near future we are also going
to support the same ocean we are going
to support any 8 platform on Qualcomm's
chipset families and concluding this
particular i read development platform
thank you and i would like to hand over
the remaining representation to ashok we
will describe everything in details
hello hear me yeah thanks Dennis thank
you 20 for energy saying I me and giving
us a good overview of the ioe
development board special fans how many
embedded developers or hear any any
embedded developers okay there you go
there is there's a there's one okay so
what's what's great about this platform
and we actually have a couple boards
here so feel free to come over and take
a look typically you don't see a lot of
Java programmers doing a better
development this board and Java ME in
particular allows you to do that allows
you to hook into iOS you know peripheral
buses and all a lot of the things that
you would want to do for the m2m or io e
space by the way my name is a shiraz dan
I'm an engineer at Qualcomm myself on le
been working on the engineering aspects
and Ali's going to also give you a kind
of quick rundown on on some of the demos
that we're doing here at javaone so
let's get into the slides of so in for
froyo e or m2m typically what we've seen
is that you need some sort of local
connectivity with sensors for that you
need you know to support peripheral
buses i squared seized by things of that
nature you also need a local compute you
need a processor in order to do
development on run Java and me running
applications on and as you mentioned we
want to make sure that you know the
costs associated with that solution are
minimized so in this particular example
the modules that are based on Qualcomm
60 to 70 turbo chipset they do not need
an external processor they don't need
external RAM it's everything that you
need to run your Java applications is
available on the module and all you need
to do is hook up the i/o
those peripheral buses to the sensors of
your choice and then you know get
started that way and the the development
platform which the images of which
you'll see in the upcoming slides lets
you develop your software in parallel to
your hardware development so that I
think that that reduces the overall time
to market which is a huge benefit for
developers so like I said there you know
for m2m you need some local connectivity
so we've got bus support for spy i
squared C there's also storage
capabilities you've got an SD card slot
and and in addition to the local
connectivity to sensors and peripherals
you do need in a lot of cases
connectivity to the back end to your
cloud where you're going to be
aggregating all the data so in order to
do that we we support cellular
connection so there's a sim card you
know basically your choice of carrier
you can use AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile any any of
those carriers you're supported and you
can get going writing applications you
can communicate with the backend over a
3g network the the 60 to 70 T chipset
that geo mentioned it supports hsdpa
rates and we'll talk a little bit about
that in the upcoming slides also to to
to make sure that true portable
applications are supported we do have a
battery that supported on the on the
board so you can take this and simulate
your mobile test cases there's GPS on
board so you can take the board carry it
with you and kind of test various use
cases where you would be moving assets
around and you need some sort of you
know GPS coordinates of the track track
asset so GPS is available as mentioned
here there's also support for Wi-Fi so
the 2 dot 4 gigahertz Wi-Fi a/b/g/n is
supported on the board senator I touched
upon there's tribe and UMTS and quad
band gsm support and there
plenty of RAM and flash that that's
available on on this platform in
addition to sensors for prototyping
applications so you know you could use
the accelerometer and light sensor as
well as the temperature sensor to do a
bunch of cool things and we have some
some of these sample applications
available on Qualcomm's website that you
can take a look and also at qualcomm
booth here at hilton you can take a look
at some of the sample applications that
are really cool so this is what the
board and the platform looks like
there's a that's the main board on the
left we call it Orion and it's got a an
adapter board on top that contains the
modules so this this thing you see over
here is all you need for the final
solution that module it has Qualcomm
skus 60 to 70 T chipset memory and all
of the things you need require to get
your applications running and all you
need to do is basically hook up your
sensors to the headers might fell off so
so the board you see on the left is
basically an elaborate breakout board it
breaks out all the interfaces that the
module brings out and you can connect
your sensors to all the headers and
there's also scope for extensibility
because there's a connector and you can
have for example you want to use
bluetooth interface you can actually
tack on a board on that connector and
get started with you know data transfer
of over Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi if
you don't need it some details on on the
capabilities of the chipset itself like
I mentioned it's hsdpa modem compute
ways it has an integrated arm9 processor
running at 400 megahertz so it's it's
quite beefy for m2m applications as
we've seen there's GPS on board all you
need to do is hook up an antenna and
you're good
our location capabilities go and also
memory it gets kind of summarized here
Java ME running on the board there's
typically 10 megabytes of free ram that
you can write applications for and also
a lot of ROM as far as storage is
concerned so there's you know there's
on-board storage in addition to the SD
card storage that that's available just
a quick snapshot of the the api's that
are supported on the platform the jsr s
there is file connection messaging for
SMS and we'll see an example coming up
when we show you the code and run run
you through and make you know kind of
show you how easy it is to develop these
applications with with the set of ApS of
exposing Amy there's web services you
can you know hook up your application to
a web server and communicate and send
data over and exchange information for
security there's a crypto api's location
API kind of talked about GPS so you have
that exposed on the platform so you
could be you know figuring out where the
board is actually located there's also I
PNG and XML API support one of the
critical things in m2m ioe space is
being able to hook up to sensors
peripherals you know working with gpios
so I think one of the critical aps is a
device access aps that's listed at the
very bottom so you can you can get
access to gpios i squared seba serial
peripheral interface a DC and AT
commands that's that's a very powerful
API set and that's that's something that
Oracle has made sure it's exposed on our
on the platform on Io a board and also
for remote application management
there's an amsa PS so you can install
reconfigure applications remotely from
the cloud that is available through the
headless AMS and CLI support
how are we doing on time good okay so
what we put together a few examples to
just show you how easy it is to program
on the IOA board some of these because
i'll skip over but some of the important
ones one is you know location
information i talked about gps and this
is the first example we're going to talk
about so this is to tell you how easy it
is that you just set the accuracy that
you want the level of accuracy you need
in your application so this in this
example we're basically setting a
horizontal and vertical accuracy of five
kilometers and then you get a handle to
the location provider instance um in
Emmy Java ME by the way this code is is
for Java ME 32 it'll also work on any
three or so once once you have that
instance you feed that accuracy
requirements in and all you need to do
is basically get the location you just
make a call to get location ApS so maybe
I should use the pointer here there's a
gate location API expose enemy you just
do that and basically convert the
location the returned values in and two
double and and you'll get the the
latitude and longitude and you know like
six or seven lines of code it's
extremely easy and this is a you know
it's a critic one of the critical
applications depends on the vertical and
m2m but location tracking asset tracking
that that's a huge use case and this
just shows me how easy it is to track
the module location another example
sending and receiving SMS is that's also
something that's very common once
perhaps you're in a certain location for
geofencing applications if you're trying
to if your asset leaves a certain
perimeter you want to notify your you're
the cloud that that event has happened
so SMS is a is one of the tools you can
use in addition to you know data traffic
you can do SMS so this is an example
where you're sending an SMS you know
your address just needs to be four
I'm at it in this particular format
there's a port number and the subscriber
ID and all you need to do is get a
handle to the message connection
connector and create a new message and
then set the payload and invoke send so
that's that's how easy it is and then
you know close the connection the
connector and similarly there's also
receive SMS or inbound SMS this is a
snapshot there's a couple of things some
exception handling that you need to do
but for the most part this is the
structure of the code you basically you
listen on a certain port for SMS inbound
SMS a--'s and once you receive we
basically crack the message open and
figure out what the payload is and it's
there's not a lot of parsing that you
need three or four lines of code will do
so that kind of shows you the power of
the platform how easy it is do these
kinds of things AT commands Jill
mentioned that you know this
traditionally a lot of these things that
we've mentioned we're done to be using
AT commands and it basically it's like a
it's almost like a serial port where
you're sending 80 command and then
getting return values it's not very
flexible so a lot of the things that
were traditionally done in AT commands
for the module vendors are now supported
through MEAP is but if you did still
wanna you have some legacy applications
that still use the ad command set you
could still do that so that that is
still available on the board and on the
platform so we support an extensive set
you can actually look up information on
Qualcomm's website as to what AT
commands are supported this just gives
you an example of you know what the
subscriber number is for the sim card
that you inserted in the platform the
ioe developer board so you can just send
an 80 command seen them a question mark
and that tells you the subscriber number
or the phone number of that sim cards so
just free lines and
that's so and you can you can do
different interesting things like you
can get the signal strength of the
cellular connectivity you can send
receive SMS is using AT commands it's
quite powerful but it's much easier now
with Emmy to do the same thing with with
actual Java API s and like I said a
local connectivity to sensors is
important and for spy i squared C this
is an example of i 2 c-bus you know you
you're essentially writing a device
driver using java so you know
traditionally java developers and
embedded programmers there's kind of a
gap there you can actually write device
drivers in Java here for so let's say
you have a and this is some of the
things that we've done in a platform
library that that Ali is going to go
through in the next few minutes we've
we've written device drivers on top of
Java and this is how easy to do that it
basically is sending commands over i
squared c bus you get the slave ID so
your sensors will have a unique slave ID
you format the message as a byte buffer
and you write and then read the response
from this from the slave so this is how
easy it is to write a device driver just
you know tcp UDP i think we don't need
to go over that it's fairly simple you
can take a look at these lights later
and that's about it we can you know feel
questions in the end towards the end of
the presentation I'll turn it over to
Ellie now who will go through the board
actually in action rape right here
that's a different noise the same way
you have to click
hi everyone my name is Ellie going to
quickly go over our platform library
which we have available on our Qualcomm
developer Network website along with
some sample code so if you're looking to
get started with development on our
board quickly there's a lot of resources
available for you including our platform
library so I'll quickly talk about what
it is what it's helpful for and then
maybe do a little bit of a hands-on demo
to show you how to write an app in Java
and run it on the board what that
involves so the library what it is is
it's it's it's a completely optional
library just makes it easier to
interface with peripherals that are
already on the IOA board so if you buy
the board and you want to talk to the
temperature sensor or the light sensor
with accelerometer you can either write
Java code yourself using the device
access api's like a shoe showed the
example or you can leverage our platform
library which basically exposes commonly
used things that you probably want to do
with the temp sensor or light sensor so
it's completely optional it just makes
it easier to to get started and start
working with the board and basically if
you were to write those drivers yourself
you have to look at the data sheets for
those peripherals which are available
and we've published them but it's a
little bit more work on your side so
just just to make things easier so this
is an example of what a class would look
like in our library so this is for the
temperature sensor
so it has common functions that we think
people would want to use for the
temperature sensor the main one being
get temperature and then you can also
register for interrupts save the
temperature passes some threshold 30
degrees you'll be notified of course the
temp sensor might have a lot of
additional functionality so we haven't
exposed everything just what we think is
commonly needed so if you do want to use
something that's not supported here you
have to use the Java API yourself the
device access api's so this is just for
commonly used stuff this is just to give
you an idea what it takes to write the
device driver so if you were interfacing
with the temperature sensor you have to
basically go to the data sheet it has
this table shows you all the different
registers you have to read and write
from these four different registers to
set up an interrupt so this is showing
if you want to set up an inner up to
trigger when temperature crosses some
threshold you have to read and write
these registers and you have to figure
out what format those registers earn and
so forth so this is the code it's not
meant to be readable just to show you
that it's a big chunk of code and this
is if you use our library it's much much
smaller volume of code and this is for
the g sensor again it's pretty simple
you get the instance of the g sensor and
then you can call AP is to get the
current acceleration or to register for
interrupts if if there's a change in
acceleration so these are all the
different classes that we support some
temperature sensor light sensor or a
couple of big ones g-sensor a DC which
we have on board and a bunch of other
things and this is all on our Qualcomm
developer Network website and i'll try
and quickly go through the demo
for riding the app
so I'm showing you an example in
netbeans where you can do the same thing
in the clips as well we have plugins
available for both so I'm creating a new
project embedded application in this
case I'm using three dot to but now
through dot 4 is available so you can
start using that
okay so that creates basic template of
the application for us I'll close this
okay so essentially the Java ME apps
have a life cycle which they follow and
so when your app is started the startup
function gets called and typically you
would schedule a new thread here and put
all your processing on it but for for
the sake of time I'll just do our
processing here so the kind of
application that I would hide in mind
was basically using the accelerometer so
we'll register for interrupts from the
accelerometer if there's any motion
detected then we'll send an SMS so just
to show you how to use the cellular
connectivity and then the onboard
sensors and and how easy it is to do
that so first of all we need to import
our platform library so I'll do that
quickly that that's the one that I just
talked about the optional library
so now I should have access to the
library so I'll use the g sensor
so that gives me
oops
that gives me the instance to the G
sensors and I'll register my event
handler which will get invoked when
there is an interrupt
ok
so yeah this will be called whenever the
g sensor sends us in an ER up so we'll
register will tell the g sensor that if
there's any motion and you can specify
the threshold send us an interrupt and
when that happens then this function
gets called so at this point i'll put a
printf first g-sensor interrupt and we
can send the SMS so i'll fill out this
part in a bit but before that so this is
the first this whole block just
registered our event handler and now we
need to actually tell the g sensor that
send us an interrupt when acceleration
crosses some threshold so this is
documented in the exactly how how you
determine this value is documented in
the javadocs so 15 is a very low
threshold so almost any motion will be
will trigger an interrupt so to send the
SMS with you java emmys ap is so this is
how kind of how you do it called
connector door open you say SMS and this
ah she went over this in one of the
slides I'll just put my phone number and
you specify a port which is basically
can be anything for now doesn't get used
and then message connection
ok
so now I'm going to get a new text
message from this class so I once i have
the connection object i call new message
and i'm going to say i want a text
message oops
and you get that back oops
don't know
faster
okay so then we got to fill out the text
message with our content set payload
text
then we use the message connection to
send it
and then we can close the connection
because we've done we're done sending it
so hopefully that's it and I have the
board you're connected I'm going to
double check that it's alive so this is
the command line interface that you can
one of the ways you can interface with
the board so I think I don't have an IP
address so the old version of Java 32
you needed a Wi-Fi connection to debug
but in three dot forward as Dennis
mentioned it's all over USB so I'm just
going to reset really quick coming up
there any questions
look at the comment sir for research
yeah I guess there are some profiling
tools that maybe can take that they're
talking about the benefits of jar used
no I know the benefits of our local
language
bless my coat but as far as resource
utilization
using running a jpn adding everything
interpreted versus running
what kind of difference are you seeing
Reese
tsuritama can use some resources right
to do because it's just as you don't you
are talking just interpreted by code but
King John just get to a place book
letter that let you running vacation on
wide variety of hardware here you see
you guys at you more 33 develop
applications typically for this hardware
what we are doing through simple in work
of a very trying to demonstrate Johnny
grid is to develop a Java in the
implication and start in Zen exempting
just spent around five minutes and
running on one more generalizable dr.
demonstrated it can be done easily what
else just just just makes it more easy
we could be developed since I'm also
that quite a good experience in
developing
by the development by using C language
or assembly but I was really surprised
when there was one demo that we were
preparing from work on site for jawani
Moscow and initially of the court was
developed amazing on Kyle board which is
also supported by Oracle and then we
spent all the ten minutes to run the
same complex application on the
Raspberry Pi and I was really surprised
and pro- game it's just the most benefit
javabeans use ingredients spicy ash wait
who consumes resources and when were in
Seoul suppose but not so much from
Falcons perspective you know the chipset
which is mentioned turbo here CCTV
senator Valley has additional and can
kill her
since the arms at 400 megahertz we don't
have any numbers right now to share with
the help out how the ladies are there so
I not sure if you guys thought I
basically press play here and that
launch the application so it shows that
it's installing this week and you see
some of the printf showing up so I'll
move the board and prints that the
g-sensor sent an inner up and I should
get an SMS yeah so that's my phone
getting an SMS so that's basically it
and we're out of time as well but the
whole thing that we're trying to show
it's very easy to develop apps and
specifically for this board if you want
to get started you can use our library
make it even easier so we can open it up
for questions if anybody has</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
