two three hi hello it looks like it's
working
so welcome so so we are the what
prevents you know we are we are in
between now and the JSP party right so
so the so who is coming through the JSP
party yes so there's some invites here
if you're anyone wants to invite some
doozies p party just can i'll just put
here in the first chair i'm not sure if
it's to available for people should get
out there I'm just gonna put here for
anyone on should SP party invites just
coming here I'm hoping that you can just
bring this in and get in the party but
the party starts exactly in the middle
of our talk right so don't don't leave
for the party okay stay it state to the
end all right so we're gonna talk a
little bit here about testing and
pipelines so I think yes okay lots of
people walking around you see good thank
you okay
right so yeah so what since everyone is
walking around let me anyone else
neither one here get one here one here
all right okay one more all right so yes
okay just get get get some get one here
okay thank you alright
okay if you don't if you don't didn't
get one sit down with someone that has
one and go to the party anyway
okay Brasilia style right yes all right
so let me start you know before before
we start talking here but let me let me
ask you this whole discussion here's
about Jesse and pipe on a pipe line so
who here is already have a automated
pipeline okay about half of the room
most more than half a drawer that has an
automated by plan so who's already more
or less yes okay alright so you already
have an out made pipeline but right so
who here is already you know you don't
have to do anything you it's
automatically goes from from your your
code repository to production doesn't
need to be you know just commit and go
to production not not like this
everybody know the hope
the pipeline does everything
automatically okay that's a dream for
someone's okay that's good all right so
who here has already does this really
automatically right to you
you know you commit your code and then
eventually shows up in production are
you doing anything alright just a couple
of people and they didn't they didn't
leave their hands up and for long enough
so they so they're not so sure okay
that's okay
that's good and so just just a quick
thing here your land is looking for that
camera and she asking your phone number
so yes okay good all right okay all
right so okay so so so we're gonna
discuss this the pipeline is in the one
the reason why most of you have an
automated pipeline and then we don't put
things in production automatically is
usually because we don't trust right you
know we don't trust what we're doing and
instance we don't trust what we're doing
the last thing we want is that something
that we don't trust shows up in
production right and so that's the whole
objective for us here is talk about you
know how we can how we can trust this
this this whole pipeline right and one
interesting thing is that you know every
time we try to talk about automation of
tests what happens is everyone so who's
doing a web application here web who is
in a mobile application here right so
who's doing up the case that has no
interface okay a few of you people right
so api's mostly cool right one of the
things so the guys that they're doing
api's and it has no interfaces it
usually don't have that problem but
every time we have an interface an
application what is the thing that we
love to do is say well I can test
interface right because it's right s
interface
I'm testable application that's great
right so so basically what happens when
we do this is that we end up you know
putting a lot of tests to do the
interface and and we kind of ignore the
rest of the test because we're test the
interface anyway right and the biggest
that we have there's there's three
things that test and needs to do for it
should be you know
remember we have we want to trust right
and to trust our suite of tests need to
do three things right first of all it
has to give us fast feedback if you have
a suite of tests it doesn't give you
fast feedback what happens you don't run
it right or even worse you ear on it but
you run infront frequently or sometimes
your tests you start runny and take
several hours or several days for that
test to run and then when it comes back
the result you know you see oh that test
failed oh but that was code that I did
last week
all right change it so I ignored it you
know I just ignored the results right so
it has to be fast otherwise those things
happen the other thing that has to be is
it has to be you know repeatable it has
to be you know how to trust that when he
fails it fails when it misses it misses
right and a lot of times we need to you
know because if you have a test run one
time it works you run out of time he
fails every time he fails you say oh yes
it fails from time to time so don't
worry about it so you can order tests
right so you know if you have a test
like this then what happens is that you
you should remove it from from your
suite of tests because it's it's just
kind of preventing you from thinking
about and the third thing that your test
our test has to be is it has to help us
find where the problem is right because
you know you have a test something
failed and if you don't know where it is
you say oh that's his codes right it's
not mine is his code so you know he
worries about it right
so we developers were very good at
throwing the problem to someone else so
you know so because of these three
things when you only focus on testing on
the interface that's the interface fails
on those three three-card cry tears
right because interface test is very
it's it takes a long time it's very hard
to do it takes a long time it's it's no
it's it's resource consuming its time
consuming so you don't run it frequently
enough so you know if you put a lot of
tests on the interface that's not that's
fails the second thing is that interface
test it's very flaky writes you know
sometimes you run it one time in there's
a tiny delay of milliseconds delay then
it fails if it doesn't have to mean
lazy works right so you're always unsure
if the tests really failed what was a
network problem was something else you
know so it's very it so it doesn't work
around this and the third thing that
tests that that interface test happens
is that every time you know once
something happens you have no idea what
what went wrong right there's so many
things going on in your softer that you
know if the test fails was the database
what is the you know what's the network
was something else a good example is
this if you do let's say you we create a
bug on the login screen all right so you
users cannot log in a hundred percent of
your interface that's gonna fail and
you're like oh man the whole thing is
down right the database is problem there
has promised it the the API has our
prime number no it's just it's just one
little component that's failed because
it's very hard for you to find out
what's going on right so that's why
instead of you know so that's why when
you talk about trusting our codes we
have to think much more than interface
test and it's very natural when you
don't have trust in application that
we're gonna put a lot of tests on the
interface right and and the end result
is that we actually make it worse
instead of better
right so that's why we have to talk
about more than just interface test we
have to have a whole pipeline off test
right and so to talk about this I have
here on expert on testing and aleeah's
it's you know his is a guy from Brazil
that's that's why I have the Brazilian
flag over there but Eligius is an
especially interesting that's what he
does for a living he only works with
testing testing comes in con suiting of
large companies and large code base
about testing and he is the he is the
coordinator of the test tracks of sever
important events in Brazil so with you
alleles Nogueira you know the brewery is
the most important person about java
brazil so thank you
goodbye them okay right so try to be
easy with me because I'm a tester
another developer and I'm a developer
really well I love it the tests at the
test out of my life engine up to now so
we're gonna talk about first about
different test levels so we got a lot of
different test levels this one it's call
it that's not pretty good in the screen
but this is a test pyramids what this
test parents do we have on the bottom of
the parent the units tests so we have in
the middle of the pyramids while you
called service tests with components
integration in the API test and bar of
the parent the web or mobile UI tests
why we have the unit tests on the base
of the pyramid can you guess why because
this is yes it's pretty fast and if you
find a final bug on the unit's test
you'll be really fast to try to make it
burn working for you and you can spend
less money try to fix it isn't it but if
you if you find a bug in UI it's gonna
be hard than it you're gonna spend more
time in more money at least ten times
it's call it mayors rules stink by the
mayor's rules so we can also create some
tests not in UI and not and use tests
that can be done for for nowadays about
API tests about Microsoft's tests you
need to trust your Microsoft and
Microsoft is the base of the between the
your back-end and your UI UI what
everywhere if you use on mobile or
rabbit or web and you need to focus in
these each levels and unit about code
coverage and aesthetic analysis
it will be more faster to find bugs and
usurp Slayer you need you must to do
steps marks and service tests and you a
test you can do all of the timing
automated test in a UI perspective and a
visual regression testing to see off
your front end will broke with a some
button of some different colors some
different eye things on the on the
screen on the user perspective so if
you're gonna so so the the reason you
know so every time you if you really
want to trust your application you know
you need to have tests in all those
little those layers right because if you
just focus on on the interface layer for
example then you know you have all this
problems you're talking before and and
so so base what we're gonna show you
guys here is how you can you can use
tests and all those layers and in these
layers it's all the time ultimate all
the time automated what's right
if interests it's all about end-to-end
tests you start in the unit's test since
you want to stop on the UI this is
include the end-to-end test yes and to
home and test we can put in the this
pyramid into entering tests and which
type of tests we can put into our code
base and your pipeline
this is agile test quadrants we supposed
to work with agile methodologies see
most of companies so we're gonna start
all the time about testing on units
testing components test that's the first
egg for the q1 and after we gonna work
if the testers or somewhere in the our
team to do functional tests or some kind
of touches that need to be functional
like start test prototype is own
examples in this functional tests we
need to focus on at least and the three
main things the hep path I'm do all the
things right and on the other user
interface I need to this one I need to
do the sad path the things that can
wrong I need to guarantee that it's
gonna be wrong and this perspective if
you try to fuel some inputs that are
required you don't feel it and you used
to be to also do the alternate paths
three types of tests in the functional
test is a lot of tests but it's do it
and after we have the q3 the most
important thing here is about user
acceptance testing like let's suppose we
found a start-up to sell fried tickets
what is the most important function on
my app for example let's read gas
I will sell tickets Oh needs to
guarantee I continue sell tickets so I
in the user interface I supposed to have
try to find dates so you feel with two
dates and airports and how many tickets
I I will you have to buy after probably
are you show the all the flights I will
select one and the next screen I will
show how you can pay it and put my
personal data and after you get a
receiver it's the client or it's okay
you can fly it tomorrow so the most
important thing
user acceptance - means do all these
steps ok and the functional I will do
like you try to fly a date to put the I
will go today and we will come back
tomorrow or will come back yesterday
it's not allowed the net it's more
functional test as user acceptance
testing
and the q4 you have some tests that that
are not all the time doing or our
pipeline but you need to put in your
pipeline you need to put in your test
code base about performance testing
security testing your the ility testing
there's a easel and I want to six about
ility testing about some kind of testing
we don't go all the time with our code
base with your pipeline and do a
performance test in it if I run a my
pipeline to get a feedback and I have to
from station probably two takes too long
to get my feedback but I need a must run
performs tasks in one once per week or
whatever you guys want to run it okay
you have a lot of different test types
to putting our pipeline here so with
this we need to get some insights on
your pipeline about machines and about
how we can execute this in a wave way in
a mobile way e anyone micro service ray
so we need to meet mid servers for
integration test for service test for
api tests we need to get machines from
execute a web test with the Firefox
Internet Explorer doesn't that's not a
web there's not a web browser but we use
it and we need to get some devices to
execute in UI perspective for mobile you
need to have it in kind of trace on
docker machines it's a pretty good and
cloud device on promise on wherever or
with our real devices or real servers on
the honest on your site so basically you
know we have we have those two different
views of testing right so one is the
test quadrants that's that you you have
all those possibilities of test for you
and and which one is it's it's the best
for each you use and on the pyramids
basically we have two a the idea of the
pyramid is that it allows us to think
about well if you're doing a you know
unit test we should do a lot of those
tests because they run very fast right
we're gonna do a UI test we really have
to focus on just the very few use
acceptance tests right so so you have to
take a look at both the quadrant and the
pyramids to actually decide how many of
the tests you're gonna do because
otherwise what happens is that if you
don't think about the pyramid you kind
of end up creating for example very few
unit tests and lots of UI tests and then
what happens that you get into all kinds
of trouble to anybody is in the DevOps
way we need to talk about a continuous
delivery continuous delivery has one
principle that's at three principles one
of this is a continuous testing so we
need to post QA or testers together
working with development operations we
know we know about that but a few
examples we can do this between
development and testers or QA we can
automate builds and deploy automate
testing as well between QA in operations
we can automate the testings in get a
continuous feedback from the operations
create some scripts to try to realize if
your application is running our green
off it's it's not runny before execute
all the tests and between operation
development automated provisioning from
some machines some cloud device some
clouds servers okay so we have to
create some interactions between all
these three people the developer the QA
and operation to try to start a real a
real pipeline with tasks okay yeah and I
think that I think that the most
important thing that we that we we all
want is to actually create this
automated pipeline every time we talk
about DevOps and it's it's it's so
really the the the way to implement
DevOps is to create this automatic
pipeline right because they have offices
it's a mixture of automations process
that will help you from development out
of h operations and and so you have to
get have involved people from from both
sides actually make this happen
but really what we want to do is
actually add to this pipeline to the
DevOps pipeline everything that we need
to be done for our koats you get from
from from development all the way to
production so we're gonna focus here on
the specific steps of the the passing
pipeline so so inside of your pipeline
you're probably gonna have you know
beauty application you will package your
application you're gonna deploy
application different places there's
lots of steps you're gonna do and then
we're gonna focus here on the steps for
the testing right so you guys have a
pipeline in your code base so we need to
put some testing some testing of testing
in your pipeline so we have here all the
levels of testing is starting about unit
testing and following by integration
testing service doesn't I can be
translated by API testing web started
testing acceptance testing functional
testing sometimes it's functional test
come first about acceptance test but
here we try to figure out if my in my
startup if it is I cannot sell tickets
why you can run functional test with I
know that I cannot sell tickets but I'm
not I need to first try to figure out if
all my user perspective is running
greens when well okay so for integration
test we need to marks
some things to get a faster feedback
from the user perspective and from the
test perspective in the service test we
need at least four different levels for
API test for rest types of our Microsoft
starting first one is the smoke test and
it's just points to my API it's all
green it's HTTP mm it's okay and
contract as I need to send a get a
guitar post and I will come back with a
JSON and we've returned with a string an
internal objects and a try to figure out
if the contract if all this those
properties it's okay it's not a it's all
that oh oh it's all there or it's have
some more that they can not figure out
before someone has a lot more
information and I cannot see it before
and I have the functional testing that's
I came asserts that's all the data
returning with my API it's okay an
acceptance that I will create a test
suite with all this the scenarios for
example try to buy a ticket before the
user interfaces with this services okay
after we have the septons testing yeah I
will do is mock testing with the most
important test that I have in the flight
tickets my flight tickets and
fulfillment assets basically this the
high path they set paths and alternate
paths all all this last two I which we
need to run in parallel education they
are really really slow to the kids
comparing to service integration on our
unit tests so it's wrong it's faster in
a Perl education with some servers some
browsers different mobile devices with
how the integration test from functional
test I need to do non-functional tests
in yours levels
not not in your pipeline all the time
but I need to put there to execute
sometimes and 4/4 creates this all the
test coding base I need to put some
screenshots to validate that I passed I
passed all the tests and I can guarantee
that there is acute it logs reports data
management is sometimes I will automated
a data management as well I not put some
hard code hard coded items onto my
codebase so I need to run a few odd my
IDs on my bank account is the same it's
a bad thing if you're putting in the
test code base and I have two parameter
out of the parameter parameterize that
all the things to get like I can point
my website to a local site for a testing
server or for a production server so
it's really easy but sometimes most of
the vapors and tested forgot to change
this output is in the parameterize it
way and so so you can see that there's a
lot of tests you can do to get trust on
your application right in and when you
look like this and say well there's a
whole lot of work that I need to do but
that depends on on how much trust you
need to put your application in
production right so a lot of times when
you're just starting in in you know you
today you do some kind of like quick
test before you put in production so he
start to automate you start to put more
and more of those tests until you get
you know the level of trust that you
that you want right and so and there's
there's there several tests are very
easy to start so to do so for example a
smoke tests are just kind of say you
know is it runny right so those are like
you know very very easy one so you can
you can start with those just to have
initial any test that you push it lets
that's one interesting thing about test
of course when you talk about all those
kind of things all of those
possibilities it looks like well I'm not
gonna never gonna do test then because
it's so many things to do but if but
what ever think you how you do more that
you do today you get more trust in
application so in test is a cumulative
thing right the more
you do every time you run them you're
gonna get more trust right so by
starting to do those things it slowly
you're gonna get more and more trust in
the application so we have a tool box
that are going to show to you some free
tools first will be the register it's
for the test for the API Stanford API
test Informix from work services
following by selenium webdriver it's a
well-know browser automation tool and
after the appian that's a like selenium
but for mobile device okay I'm gonna
show a live code about these crystals so
we have a little example here about our
pipeline I don't not go shown to you
about inside and Jenkins inside a circle
CI I would just show to you how to use
it with tools and you can put easily in
the yard pipeline so we have a service
test acceptance testing functional tests
with this three toes okay so basically
basically we're gonna do it out so so
what we're gonna do now is actually show
all of these things weren't running and
you can see that of course it's a small
application but you can see that there's
not a whole lot of things they need to
do to automate all those kinds of tests
and and and in some times even if you do
you know just just by as I said before
just by implementing a few things it
improves you how much you trust in your
application and and then you can keep
adding more and more things right so a
good strategy would be for you to do one
of one test of each one of those and
then keep adding it to your software
until you you have the the level of
trust that you need
here I have a rash assurance that's
really easy to to use we're sure that
works with the Gherkin style given
Maidan so all the things you need to put
in a given wind anyway so like the
insert person given I have the contents
type like JSON and the body a new person
you are a senior so when I post person
then I get stat coach 2001 it's pretty
easy
yes that's a smoke test right you just
say it's okay yes right so not testing
too much but these we call it a smoke
test we just insert a person and get the
stud codes it's it's running okay it's
all green okay these are our is mocha
today smoke tests so in the lead in
delete third person in get person I test
basically the stats codes here okay I
just don't care about the data right now
after I need to do some functional
testing so you go to show you it's
running on the endpoint my local host in
the this base path so now I will like a
gutter person by IG I will start a
person first we forgiven when n style
given I have the content type D so with
a post me Haley Elias when I post person
then and stretch the ID because I need
to first create a person to after try to
get or try to deletes try to alter the
fifties person
so after when I got person with the data
G that was created then content type is
JSON and the body name is equal Elias
and the address is RS and the hobbies
automate tasks and the stat codes its mm
that's okay this is my test this is my
assertions it's why the magic happens if
you go on agreeable going read on your
tests it's the same for the others this
test here insert person is the same
delete person is the same but I just
change some assertions in some stats
code here it's pretty easy isn't it you
can test a lot of micro-services with
these two with russia shreds
we're such a good question I have a
back-end here running in a Java spark
it's already running I have an API here
with my with a database so I have the
server running now with the old API here
can read yeah if you register shirking
keen with swagger into the magic yep
and after that's it that's any questions
about what assurance no sorry King hero
authorization yeah it is supported but
he's just at occasional way so I don't
have it here it's fully supported on
taking shelter ization management
cookies okay
how you start a server I hear is that
manually just to show to you the codes
how can you use versatile to put your
pipeline okay after we have the yeah the
thing the thing they're not showing on
the demo is is the whole process of the
pipeline itself I so yeah to be product
so this so those are the test but that
would be inside like a Jenkins server
for example that would deploy the
application and everything so so we're
just kind of running and just showing
the test itself for the web interface I
have here unscripted with selenium
webdriver there's a pretty verbose but
they're pretty easy to understand and I
have a front-end here I will do first
test model model test creates a person
like Bruno address SP Harvey Java that's
working pretty good so I will do the
same with the the descriptive with
selenium so first I need to download
some driver about the driver that are
gonna use not after all the drivers are
all the open sources they have some kind
of code that's not open so I needs to
get like a translator between the my
codes in my Rio browser it's colored
brown it's called a driver for selenium
so I have the chrome driver from the
Google Chrome execution I have the
Google Chrome here with selenium
webdriver all the selenium webdriver
start with start within webdriver class
so when i stanch it with the any browser
Chrome browser Firefox browser
international Sparta browser
I get the all the counter of this
browser so I can get the page that you
access after I need to try to find
elements in my web page to try to
manipulate it try to send some
information try to get information try
to click on the buttons so for this I
need to inspect my elements like this
Add button
in the process Spectre and I gonna show
here I'm gonna see here if this button
has an ID and has a class and has a NJ
click so all the web elements that has a
ID is a good idea because I can find by
ID that's sometimes not change sometimes
change but I can get the element and try
to find this like a driver find element
for me that element is by ID add and
clicking it but in this line as I'm user
angularjs interface so it's supposed to
be some synchronous requests when I try
to add someone they screen the screen
not change just I'm show up like a
pop-up shortened like my Moritz and HTML
tags here so when it's to wait for
anything in the next screen to try to
get another fields and try to fill it
because selenium doesn't doesn't care
about if I have a synchronous requests
or not they just running as fast as he
can
so I need to tell selenium wait for some
time wait for any button or any requests
or in a message and after you can
continue and after right after I post
all this information like the same way
drivers find to me an element within
some IG or some CSS selector or some
names or some XPath there are other way
to find elements in the web I can after
but some assertions to guarantee that is
running okay okay but let's run in this
script
you're gonna see and only go nuts I'm
gonna see but not order we're here
pretty fast script and it's all bring
here down here
it runs seven seconds it's not so fast
but you try to run again you know so
that's that's an interesting thing right
so you have one test that took seven
seconds right when you run a unit test
you sometimes you hunt you you run
hundreds of tests in one second right so
you know that's that's the thing we're
talking before about the interface test
is a lot slower than than you know it's
fast here in one test but you know it's
a lot slower if you're doing like a lot
of them and for mobile testing I have
the same app the same user interface but
foreign Android sorry call it a Pew if
you it has has the same API that's there
selenium has so that is the same creator
but the little difference here is I'm
gonna test as a UI advice mobile device
so when it's to tell to a pew which
mobile devices it is here I have an
Android running in the Android emulator
with this previews app install it with
this package named is activity name and
I have it here
running on genymotion it's the same we
have on the the web because I use an API
and forget all this two things so to
make it happen it's here above it's same
as selenium that a previous show to you
a driver find by elements find elements
by a deed and clicks and get taxed in
what the difference here is about the
ages and how can expect some ideas or
some components in a mobile device I
need to get UI Automator viewer and
androids
and now I can inspect all these
components
like Bruno like this button and I can
see the no details about research eg the
class the package the content
description and all the same way which I
haven't researched I do you get it
because it's my ID and to round this are
we gonna use the ape you on like in the
NPM package so a paean session over
right it's run a server here to try to
connect with the device between my codes
I will close my application
you're gonna run
or mobile script it take a long time
because you know emulators take much
time to execute
automated testing and of course we're
dealers yeah of course we're doing
emulator here but the exact same test
you can run on the device or in
themselves right but you can also hire
cloud services that will provide you you
know hundreds of different devices you
can run the same exact same code on on
the cloud own device there on the cloud
so you don't have to manage the devices
themselves if you these are actual
lawton running because he don't see it
the presence of the ID the fab button
that's this Add button so let's try to
run again you can see it all the time in
the emulators in a real device he's
supposed to not happen and so that's
another example it's good that happened
because that's another example so you
see that he run the code and failed and
then he's just running the same code
again right and he might work right so
that's that is the problem of the UI
test right even in a simple example like
this sometimes the UI test works
sometimes it doesn't and and if you rely
a lot on the UI test what happens is
that you know the developers gonna say
wow it didn't work this time but he
worked it last time so that's okay I
don't need to change anything and in
fact there might be a code problem it's
really flaky emulators so it's all green
but took it at least 37 seconds to the
kids said a lot of time yes you know so
one test run 37 seconds so if you if you
rely you know there's some people that
couldn't don't want to create that
instead of creating thousands of unit
tests they create hundreds of off UI
tests and then in the ends you have a
big problem because even hundreds of
tests are gonna take a long time to run
and they're gonna be flake like you just
saw here and and the end result is that
you end up not trusting your
pipeline at all because of those things
and how I can put all those codes in the
my pipeline my real pipeline I can just
create a test to it and put all the
class to execute one by one so in the
this for API test I gonna turn around
first my smoke test my smoke API test
that will points to the get or post and
return some stats code a function of
Mach API test
I have markets my API first to execute
to oh it's all green so I can run the
production or running data server and
after the function of API is the same
from the mobile or the web tests here I
can have sweet classes with add pairs on
other person in balloon person the
complete suite for recruits application
first two after try to do the functional
tests like it try to not feel all
imports interact saving the person and
the same from the mobile suite so I can
put this all these test Suites in your
pipe in our pipeline easily and brandi's
with without some problem so if I
already have a problem if you figure out
in a pipeline with less pain okay
okay is it
yeah so let's go back to the
now as you can see we create some
scripts and run it to make sure that
pipeline will make real so we can put
and Jenkins our circusy I in any CIA
tools all those does in the easily way
all we have to do is create and test and
and know about these tools and start
using these tools and as we said before
you can start right you know just by
adding one of each one of those those
tests in each category you already get
more trust and then you can iterate and
every new version of you know you you
can add more tests and then the more at
you know the more tests you adds well to
limits right you know you you add enough
tests that they give you confidence and
then you can really put this whole thing
to own an automate my plane and then you
can then you can get you know from
comets shoe production out totally
automated with trust right because any
of those tests we will would would stop
your your application should go into
production with application instead bugs
okay okay
so we we're not gonna have a lot of time
this is one question I might we have
sometimes to work for one question but
you know all the source code for for
this example is available on the github
and also you know we are we're doing
Alia's is gonna do like a more deeper
dive onto this discussion here for
testing in a bottle cup when you go back
to Brazil we're gonna do a webinar where
are we gonna kind of have a lot of time
to answer your questions and see your
problems that you are having in your own
you know on project so if you want to if
you want to have access to that you know
you can come to code for life it's a
list of we have a series of videos about
career there and aleeah's are gonna do a
webinar on code for life about testing
so if you want to join that you can just
join that site right there okay so
anyone has any questions like one one
question one minute we have one one
minute no questions okay everyone oh
there's a question right
right
so his discretion was you know if you
should clean up the data right insert
data you should delete the data right
you need to do that it's it's about the
data data management's on the holder
pipeline you need to get all the data
clean before the secrete testing or
create some strategy to clean up all to
use or reuse some data in your pipeline
strategy for database testing we have to
be units there's a great tool I use all
the time
java faker not for database testing
we'll create some data without just
input data in the code it's a
the last one a java faker yes David
faker faker faker a fake
yes so on on that on under on github
there is the list of tools and there's a
step-by-step that you want to if you
wanna run this yourself okay all right
