sessions about the Internet of Things
it's kind of an overview of the
application and I'm just if you're not
familiar with internet things it should
give you a good examples of a just the
end application of it so I'm so I work
for a telemetry down here in the
watermark in the lower right-hand corner
we provide a lot of back-end
infrastructure for the Internet of
Things applications so there's a
disclaimer I think we do have some
products that would fit nicely into this
slideshow I did include him I'm trying
to stay away from the sales pitch things
I don't think really people really
appreciate that but of Justice disclaim
I'm going to try to stay pure on this
and not not be a Salesman here but all
right so Internet of Things it's kind of
like it's kind of become kind of like
teenage sex right you never when
everyone's talking about it no one's
really doing it more like later years
teenage sex where people are starting to
do a little bit but they're not really
experienced that all that much so it's a
little awkward kind of in that stage but
basically yeah I mean it's you take it
an embedded device like a raspberry pi
or something that stick on the internet
and that's kind of Internet of Things
it's not really a great explanation of
it I mean it's pretty close one second
year yeah all right so there's a little
more to just this than being area of
things but it's it's pretty close so
it's a pretty good simple diagram quick
quick explanation of with what there is
there it's normally a break it down into
a little more than just telemetry data
but telemetry data is probably the
biggest part biggest component of
internet of things that most people are
interested in a lot of times and people
talk about like I of T scale they're
referring to telemetry data telemetry
data is just sending data from devices
that have sensors to some other devices
usually servers the typical use case is
a lot lots and lots of sensors all
funneling down into the cloud or servers
somewhere that's typically how it goes
so
broke it down into four main problems
that I you have to solve when you're
doing IOT and each of these problems are
actually pretty hard the the middle to
storing and analyzing the data those are
pretty much compass by big data you
there's lots of research papers lots of
tools it's pretty well studied we can do
it well it's still not really it's not
easy it's definitely hard topics two of
them both of them the first one the
moving data it seems like it's an easy
problem like it's easy when you're
talking about servers right because when
you're moving data between servers so
we've got all sorts of protocols lots of
technologies use HTTP most of the time
sometimes or some pub/sub protocols but
we're talking about moving data off of
embedded hardware into the cloud that
that gets a little trickier for for a
number of reasons one of them you've got
really constrained devices constrained
applications what that means is devices
you know don't have much memory for one
I got a low-end some of these devices
only have like four KF memory wow that's
that's complete that's the operating
system if there is one that's that's the
the program code like the instructions
and it's also the runtime memory like
the stack and the heat whatnot that's
it's not much so if you consider like
HTTP when you're sending a message
oftentimes the overhead just the headers
and all the overhead for TCP can easily
run you up like easily one k if not like
nkd sometimes and 100k if you're using
lots of cookies or something like that
so HTTP isn't always the best choice so
we tend to go some other protocols we're
going to go over this a little more
detail later but I'm just kind of giving
an overview of some of the problems with
moving data off of a device also i mean
there's also you got to consider the big
shift with IOT is so the traditional
internet you had very few clients right
you like each bus would be a client
right just like I don't know 20 or 30
devices in the room with IOT you might
have each person might have
devices cover covering your body so I
have each person might have a hundred
devices and so it compounds really
quickly so you can easily get a lot of
data producers that are sending data and
so when we talk about IOT scale it's
like the level up above web-scale just
because things compound so quickly you
can get massive massive torrent Cepeda
coming in granted each data producers
producing very little data but when you
combine it all together it's a lot of
data so we already talked about storing
analyzing that's the big data problem
moving that's let's cover our new thing
we're going to spend a little more time
on that and then lastly reacting to the
data and that's that's kind of the
essence of IOT it's the thing that
everyone's going after IOT use it's kind
of like when you you were walking down
the street san san francisco kind of
smell smell coffee like I must be a
coffee shop nearby and you see the
coffee shop you walk in your kind of
observed you're taking all these
observations from the world around you
and kind of making decisions so now
we're basically at making devices act
like humans were we've always done this
like if you take a thermostat you know
thermostat reads the temperature and
changes the temperature in the room but
now we're doing it more complex scale
we're taking more measurements from more
sources and making more complex
decisions based on this information this
is what kind of the cool thing about IOT
we're just we're just now getting into
it right but it's going to get more and
more complex as we get better at doing
this sort of thing so I'm going to have
a couple of couple of probably about
three examples of IOT applications now
we're going to get more into the details
but so the first one wildfires I'm I'm
personally I'm from Colorado I live in
Colorado and I like hiking but sometimes
trails get close because of wildfires
sometimes houses burned down because of
wildfires I remember a few years ago I
my where I lived I almost got evacuated
i live near Boulder Colorado there is
the the sunshine Canyon fire almost got
back but it was like a mile away from
the evacuation zone so this is a really
real problem right
fire spring up throughout the the Rocky
Mountains and they they just kind of go
where they go and it's hard to stop them
the the interesting thing problem with
fires is it's a natural part of the
ecosystems you can't just put them out
you just just got a container because I
mean the ecosystem itself relies on the
fires so instead of putting them out you
just try to contain the damage of the
fire so so generally so the part the
National Park Service does a great job
of detecting where fires are likely to
occur if a fire sprung up and trying to
evacuate people quickly and they have a
lot of ways of doing this sometimes it's
drones that's still kind of a not
entirely legal way of doing it or this
gray area there also there's a lot of a
lot of sensors like you can kind of see
it here but there's some telephone poles
that they have have a lot of sensors are
reading some of the chemicals in the air
like the the carbon dioxide carbon
monoxide sulfur those my detective of
fire has already occurred there's also
other readings you can take to kind of
predict where a fire might occur and
kind of did a figure out like during
like yeah middle of July there's high
winds and really dry temperatures may be
either is going to be might taking might
be a really high likelihood of a fire
occurring in a valley somewhere and they
can use that the topology of the land
and there's a lot of different
parameters that it might use to predict
where a fire to occur so it's a pretty
useful application of IOT however it's
also a really extreme environment think
about it but if you've met a Colorado
but the temperatures can can range
really out of Allah a huge amount like
50 degree range Fahrenheit throughout
throughout the day is pretty typical and
in the mountains I can get really cold
really windy it's a pretty hostile
environment so your typical devices
might not work so well anyway so so a
couple problems that we we incur that
occur with just
this particular example is first of all
the devices are going to be
geographically just disperse like Park
Rangers they actually like doing this
they do this thing they call we used to
call sneakernet back in the 90s where
they'll walk around you know probably
like 20 miles in a day with like a bag
of thumb drives and they they get to the
next device with sensors on it and I
swap out the storage device and they go
through and collect a whole bunch of
them and I mean if you're a park ranger
you probably like walking like that
doing little hikes but honestly if we
could probably do a bit a lot a better
job if we could automate this whole the
whole process so the geographic
distribution which kind of ties into the
wireless communication part if you can
latch on to a cell signal then you can
just send this data or the cellular
network also electricity right if you
think about it we're going to get your
power from are you going to you probably
going to run off battery power but you
probably can't just like plug into a
wall or something like that is you don't
have you know easy access to power so
we're going to get a powerful there's a
this is where energy harvesters usually
come into play like solar panels win for
mount wind farms but you know windmill
my brother has a company starting around
metal alloy called nitinol that he made
a made a well I did it is thesis on
generating power off of the change in
temperature throughout the day so it's a
really cool technology like so as the
day heats up in the morning it generates
power but also again at night when
attempter is cooling back off it also
generates even more power so it's a
pretty cool technology I'll have a slide
later on that gets you a link so we can
point that out and write that down but
yeah so there's there's a lot of
challenges faced here with with just
this particular use case the next use
case is just trucks on the road these
are like trucks like cross country
shipping routes this is so it's a lot a
lot less hostile than than the
environmental monitoring scenario mainly
cuz like you know the power the energy
harvesting isn't really big issue
because you have this big honkin
generator sitting in front of you so if
the power isn't so much an issue but you
still have the wireless network problems
but so some of our clients that
telemetry actually have the welder kind
of into this business and we've gotten
some pretty interesting insight like for
instance they tend not to use the the
cellular network just because they say
it's really really expensive which I I
tend to agree them I look at my cell
bill my cell phone bill every month and
it's not insane but anyway also in in
this particular use case if they can
make a driver they can monitor the
behavior the driving if they can make a
driver slowed down five miles per hour
on average of the course of a year they
can save millions of dollars which is
just saying to me so there's a lot to be
gained from the sort of application but
so as opposed to the environmental
monitoring situation this is a lot
easier but you still have some problems
right so of course you have a reliable
energy source the network is less
reliable so if you think about environm
environmentally if you find the cell
signal you just plop something in there
and it just has mostly the same signal
now given you this winds change but
other than that for the most part can be
mostly the same the truck is a little
less reliable network but you can still
use the cellular network when possible
again like I mentioned they tend not to
use a cellular network so usually what
we'll do so it'll drive it to a you know
truck stop eventually right and just hop
on the wireless network and shoot a
bunch of data up so you got like what
like six hours of data that has been
loaded like backed up backlogged and I
shoot that across the wire and it tends
to be pretty big pretty big Network
packets and so interesting side effect
of that is when all the trucks all at
once shoot all their data from the last
six hours across network
you tend to run into some problems on
the server side ingesting the data you
all probably work on the JVM I have that
garbage collector if if one of these
Network packets goes into one single
array that's a large object the just
feature that in the garbage collector
that large objects like that they they
don't they don't even go into the Eden
generation they go straight to the old
generation it's really screws up with
your garbage collection strategies so
there's there's a lot of ways from at
it's not a huge deal but it's things you
don't really think about when you're
dealing with these sorts of things last
example is a forklift trucks my dad is a
software engineer with Raymond
corporation so I'm just it's identified
to the array so they may produce
forklift trucks just for just for
warehouses this is like the total
opposite end of environmental monitoring
so environmental monitoring you have
like really hostile environment this is
about as tight even environments you're
going yet sure there might be dirt on
the floor but if you think about it just
the wireless networks can be perfectly
designed right you can you can get
perfect coverage if it's not you just
tweak it a little bit you can even
control the traffic so that you can make
sure the networks aren't being congested
too much so this is about as control of
environments you can get so I think most
people in this room are going to be
somewhere in between you're probably not
going to have quite as much control as a
warehouse but you're probably not going
to be have to put up some of the
problems of environmental monitoring but
anyway as far as this goes there's some
interesting problems so they wanted to
be able to remote diagnose problems with
the truck which you know makes sense
like for instance one time I could ha
like down and out 10 15 years ago he's
worked here for there for decades but I
guess one time 10 or 15 years ago
they're having this one this one plant
was one a warehouse kept on returning
they returned like two or three trucks
in a row due to you like that the
chassis the chassis of the truck just
breaking cracking in half and it was
like why is this matt
of chassis breaking and half doesn't
really make sense so they sent a couple
of engineers on site to see you debug
the problem see what see what's going on
turns out a couple goof off and third
shift workers were taking the forklift
truck off the loading dock so I that
could do it if you ever mean if you
throw a couple ah ok I think the name
you know sensors that can detect
vibration that problem would have been
detected yeah accelerometer there we go
thanks that that problem would have been
detected easily you know within like two
seconds I get to figure that out so I'm
nikka to say a lot of time that's just
kind of a funny little story about
people who work third shift right yeah
so as far as there's also a lot a lot to
be gained by doing this sort of thing I
probably have to convince you too much
about this but yeah so now we're going
to we can move through the first part
we're gonna talk about some solutions I
think as we all came here for so MQTT is
a message queuing telemetry transport
there's been several other sessions on
MQTT those were done much better than
I'm going to do right here but I'm just
going to give a quick overview bus and
some tools you can use so MPT MPT was
first made by your IBM in eurotech like
15 years ago or something like that and
since they just open it up because it
made sense so it's it's open standard
which I as an engineer as a software
engineer I look for open standards
because they're there night I don't
really I don't really want close
software I don't really want clothes
standards they don't really work for me
right I'm sure you guys all identify
with that as far as the protocol itself
it's very compact and efficient it's
made for IOT applications it's mage have
small overhead it only has two bites of
overhead it's really small so it's good
for this it's also publish-subscribe
architecture which i personally think is
is perfectly suited for for telemetry
data because it decouples the publisher
from the subscriber so if if your
subscribers doing like massive machine
algorithms and say crashes guess well
it's complex math and I've got a
nullpointerexception or something that
doesn't affect how the publisher
publishes data so that's that's a really
nice feature of pub subsystems and of
course there's a lot of other pub sub
systems out there but I'm just showing
you one that seems to work well for this
but that would they be something you'd
consider that instead of going with HTTP
or since our rest architecture you might
choose a pub sub architecture the last
bullet point here durable connections
and queuing that's really important
again we're talking about unreliable
network connectivity a lot of times
devices just drop offline what do you do
and so message is lost are they at they
lost or well with MQTT you can arrange
to have those messages sent to the
device when it reconnects so that's
what's really nice feature something you
look forward an eye out key protocol so
we're all at javaone so here's some java
clients so pajo is the reference
implementation it's the one that IBM
made that the third one debate open
sourced and it's been something carried
on a few generations the second one view
source it's a protocol it's a client
that I've used of course there's there's
broker there's brokers and clients I'm
just highlighting the the clients
because that's usually what you're more
interested in it integrates into your
code a few sources more aimed at a
parallel parallel processing ideas and
then cutie also caters to the
asynchronous processing also zenki TT
was actually made by one of our clients
and I actually love it it's my favorite
out of all of them I know pas hoes like
that the reference implementation but
the the code that you that the client
code that you write to integrate with
your client is it ends up being just
really really clean Java code they have
a lot of the modern principles i really
like like yeah they use final whenever
possible the shallow of class
hierarchies using types liberally I'm
muscala developers so I tend to like
that kind of style even if I'm writing
java code integrated that way
also it's IOT so we got to include some
embedded see clients the interesting
thing about embedded see clients like
normally when you get a networking
library and Java it's the full package
right with embedded see they only do
ninety percent of the client the last
ten percent would be like the the
networking is when you get an embedded
device you're not usually handed a TCP
library or the TCP library is different
in every case so it's not quite
straightforward so you tend to have to
they tend to just give you most of the
library and then people just poured it
to all the specific devices just to
adapt it to the networking libraries so
again pajo has a seat well pajo is a sea
version also they also have so it's Java
Sea I think python and lua live MQTT
this this top one that's i asked the are
embedded guy and he's like yeah this is
the best well that's when i always use
so he swears by that one i don't know
i'm assuming is pretty good MQTT SN is
not an extension to em cutie it's a so
it's it's a it's functionally compatible
with anchor TT there's gateways that
translate it so all the features that
aren't ktt are available at QT SN
however it runs on UDP and unreliable
Datagram based the transports instead of
yeah MKT runs on tcp PSN runs on UDP
this is this is more for the edge the
edges of the network like if you have a
body area network like the sensors all
of your body we're all over your car you
might throw a MPD DSN gateway and then
have all your devices beyond like a
zigbee or some sort of 6lowpan network
6lowpan is just ipv6 for mesh networks
so that that's the sort of thing you
might do the i think the selling point
of MKT DSN is is this this here the
configuration free discovery i think
that's that's probably the the selling
point just because you can plop a
way onto a network and through UDP
broadcasts it just discovers clients and
clients discover gateways and you don't
have to configure individual devices so
if each person this room had a buyer
body area network we might all have 100
200 sensors on our bodies you only have
one gateway so it's only one thing to
configure instead of hundreds of things
configure and that really plays in that
whole device cardinality metric really
really plays into decisions that you
make when you're going through the
process of making an IOT app so again
okay so I haven't talked about this yet
but Co app is it's like HTTP it's the
core features of HTTP exists in co app
however its binary it's very compact
binary and it runs on UDP 6lowpan it's
the same basically the same slide as the
last one except for its it's a rest
architecture so I was talking about
telemetry data and now I'm talking about
like command control stuff you want to
say tell the device to do something you
can do it you can also implement a pub
sub it has so co-op has this really cool
feature where you can send a get request
and set an option on that get requests
called observe and so that every time
that resource changes it the server just
pushes that update to the client so if
they implement pub/sub up on that so
it's currently an ietf standard and
co-op mq at the bottom here that's a
another IETF standard just brand brand
new out it's not it's not solidify don't
think even co-op has solidified but
there's co-op clients for for java and
4c vetted see everything also device
management the the lightweight I'm den
work some people call it lwm done I
usually call it a living in them is a
another protocol for device management
so more of it comprehensive protocol
we're a framework I guess so you can you
can gather statistics about your device
like battery power my wireless signal
strength you can even push easy to use
you can use it to push
software updates and you can do all this
securely so you can secure the device
channels so that yeah so Packers don't
hack your devices so again like I said
before there's lots of alternatives MPT
some of these are pub/sub some of them
are well yeah most of these are pub/sub
some of them are like like data bus and
d mp3 you're very specific to like
certain industries but they're all
they're all out there i I'm not going to
push certain solutions say this is the
only way there's definitely other ways
it's just through our experiences
through my experiences that these the
ones i'm highlighting seem to be like
the winners they seem to be doing really
well and i'd be willing to bet on them
one note about rest i know a lot of
people are saying well I think HTTP is
going to win because everyone already
uses it and it's so pervasive that's
true well maybe we could pair refs with
co-op and have like the real the real
edges fought the far-out edges of the
network use Co app and just gateway
translate it into HTTP so we could yeah
maybe issue will be pretty good one the
HTTP of two point oh if you've seen that
spec it's not it's not final yet but the
HTTP 2.0 has has some features for
server pushes you can implement pub/sub
on so maybe in the future there might be
a little better of a mapping between
HTTP and a co app I don't know be nice
alright so back to those bullet points
work to the analyzing part this is this
is kind of an important part I'm not
going to spend too much time on this but
so apache spark when you're this this
seems to be a pretty good way to it for
the storing note we tend we tend to use
Cassandra just because it's really good
at ingesting large amounts of wealth yet
time series telemetry data quickly you
know just a pen another column onto a
row have one column per device so you
can have like millions of rows and even
millions of columns on those rows works
real it pretty well apache spark runs on
as it as a back-end is a data store it
uses you can use HDFS or Cassandra
so we use it for Cassandra because it'll
still have that data locality attribute
on Cassandra so it works pretty well for
for getting some analytics off of
Cassandra which is nice because
Cassandra is actually a kind of opinion
to query so apache spark kind of eases
that that pain a little bit again i'm a
scala programmer so I like that
functional style and yeah so this is
just kind of some of my my insights here
we we also like using elastic search
just because it's nice to have that full
ad-hoc query ability if if you follow
the others like this guy on Twitter
called ice Twitter handles a fur i'm
trying to think was named but anyway he
does a lot of distributed system stuff
she has some criticisms criticisms about
lastic search saying it wasn't fully
consistent and yeah it's probably true
we haven't really seen much problems we
get it we had around the consistency
problems that it has by using patchy
Kafka so Kafka is a pub sub but it's
instead of MQTT we're MPT pushes data to
the subscriber kafka lets the subscriber
pull data so you can make the subscriber
can pull data only as fast as elastic
spiritual take it and so it eases the
consistency problems that a fur was
pointing out the my favorite thing
personally about cabana is compared
about Lester just cabana here so the
alternatives elasticsearch would be
solar because again it's a leucine
indexed em down the bottom solar and
elastic search by that distributed
system to it cabana is the web interface
and the LSP do ad-hoc queries you just
open it up we're we originally found a
teasing log stash but it turns out it's
it's great for even just doing that just
observing a telemetry data I'll so you
need a lot of trend trend line sorts of
stuff not super complex visualization
but when you can when you can do you
pair it with a patchy spark it's it's
it's pretty nice yeah we use mostly for
visualization and it's also good for
just brow
data up front so this of course it says
this isn't really automated analytics
but it's there's that manual component
that's really really a necessary to you
do some like manual exploration so you
can figure out what automated analytics
you need to have so lastly the reacting
this is kind of our kind of coming
towards the end here of course like a
little subtitle says kind of at some
point we got to remove that human
component we got to make devices act
like humans right they read the sensor
values and they make intelligent
decisions based on the data they have so
I threw the slide in that last minute
because it's really it really is
necessary I wasn't thinking about a four
bit is anybody heard of the all seen
alliance or all join it's really cool
technology so it's underneath the the
Linux Foundation right now it's total oh
say they do do a little bit of telemetry
data but it's mostly for command and
control like making your refrigerator
talk to your microwave no idea why you
do that but anyway so I'm like that it's
it has has us the smart home in mind but
so the the special thing about it is
it's built on d bus so if you're
familiar with d bus and linux same exact
thing it's just for IOT so offers up if
you have a capability like you have a
capability of showing it notification
you offer that up as an interface and
consumers can just query the whole
entire local area network for any
anything that supports that it that
capability which is really cool mix
makes communicating between devices
really simple the next thing about all
seen are all join is instead of being
just simply a protocol it's the full
package it's a software it's the open
source project you can just download and
pile it's ported to the most let's go to
a lot of chipsets that's great the other
cool thing is it's look at multiple
transports so I can run a Wi-Fi
Bluetooth but it's not like Wi-Fi only
or Bluetooth only its you can you can
run it on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and my
power line communication and one device
that's on why I thought I can commit
Kate with viruses on Bluetooth just
using the you know the devices in
between it's that mesh network over
we're IP which is kind of cool and I
think this is probably the biggest point
is it does offer a lot of utilities
including like the security and identity
component which is really crucial for
IOT a lot of people haven't been
thinking about it so this is this is a
really cool technology i highly
recommend just looking it up I think all
seen alliance org might be website you
might start at all so so this is this is
more this is back onto the telemetry
data problem if you so MQTT warren is a
little Python tool it's kind of pretty
simple but it's surprisingly helpful so
it's basically you subscribe on an FPT
MQTT topic and when a message comes in
or the MKT topic you just execute some
one of these services like pushover I
don't know if you've heard of pushover
it's like Mobile notifications the
billing system is kind of weird though
instead of paying for pushing
notifications you pay for receiving him
so that's what different I think amazon
has similar yes SNS but it has a whole
bunch of different services it can pump
into you so the you know disclaimer
again this is the rhone product thing
fabric it's does the same thing as I'm
cutie warren of course MPT d Warren was
open source and free hours you have to
pay us money and stuff but but we allow
us we will actually do some
content-based filtering so actually I
wrote the sequel component for it's
really cool I'm excited about it so you
can you can view a MQTT subscription as
a table and sequel and you can join to
topic spaces together you can join fdd
messages with say a sequel table or
something like that actual Segal table
is sitting on disk this you can do a lot
of this content-based filtering joins
aggregation and the most important point
is it's it's enterprise-scale so unlike
Python client that's sitting on your
desktop this actually will scale up to
really high message throughput we've had
some pretty impressive results with it
oh yeah I guess this is well kind of at
the end of the presentation is shorter
than I was expecting so some resources
so i mentioned that i would point out
this is the nitinol power Harper Stewart
here I'm hoping I he said he was I
actually put a real web page there I
don't know if he actually has got it
there but he's not exactly the most
organized brother um the I didn't I
forgot to mention this earlier but so
there's there's a start-up in boulder we
were just meeting with them they're
still in the incubator faced with a boom
town and boulder but I think this really
cool technology I don't think it's a
real product yet because you're still
figuring out the kinks making the
product but they can take any kind of
structured data like a Jason object or
an XML document or something like that
and convert it into just plain English
they do it to english right now but they
say it's just as easy to do it to German
Chinese whatever they can they say it's
like a linear complexity of scaling that
illumination was then sounds like you a
day I haven't heard that one alone it
might be geography left but there was a
database called QA probably 25 plus
years ago was one of the first database
systems that I work with and you could
you could do natural language queries
with it Oh a bit like Google Siri now
that sounds polygamous yeah sounds
really need so their their product they
just simply just convert structure data
to English which is which is pretty
helpful like if you want to send like
SMS text messages you might just run it
through the service so they actually
asked me not to mention their name just
because they're at such an early stage
that are not sure if they can actually
pull this off they don't wanna that on
have that fear of failure but if you're
if you if you if you do find it
interesting just connect with me and I
could probably let you now and when
they're they're ready but yeah so
there's some resources I was just
talking to some of the guy
is the Eclipse booth by the way eclipse
is probably the best organization for
for looking for resources for IOT
especially in Java some of their
products like this cura thing I can't is
going the cura that's an extension to
the Eclipse IDE that's watching the demo
the other yesterday is really cool it
just streamlines the whole debug
experience and streamlines the
development and deployment it's really
cool so I OT eclipse.org has a lot of
information a lot more about MKT and a
co-op and few other things has a lot of
also open open source implementations of
all that stuff so highly recommend going
there I I was forced to to put a link to
our product so do you want to go there I
highly recommend it absolutely also kuja
I was also seeing a demo that yesterday
is also really cool simulator for a
Kentucky operating system continues
really cool I totally forgot to mention
that back on the co app slide there's a
really cool research paper that I saw
where they took a chip on the contiki
operating system and the waco app is
does doesn't like the reliable
transmission it's its bets at a fixed
interval so they're able to keep the the
radio on like the wireless radio they
able to keep that off ninety percent of
the time and only turn it on just a
small percentage of the time they were
able to really save a ton of energy by
doing this so a lot of really cool
things like that didn't include that one
but so that's that's pretty much it so
given my twitter handle thanks phys
anybody have any questions at this point
can sell a few minutes left so
approximately operating in the US or do
you also have international clients we
we don't personally have international
clients but there's a lot of people in
Europe is a really heavy development
going on
and Europe summin summin Asia but yeah
which reminds me just scares the crap
out of me how we're not even prepared
for the old internet and now we're going
to the new internet and yeah so yeah
there's a lot of just really simple
problems that aren't even solved that
well where people just don't know how to
do it well so yeah even stuff like that
as any other questions oh right packs on
let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
