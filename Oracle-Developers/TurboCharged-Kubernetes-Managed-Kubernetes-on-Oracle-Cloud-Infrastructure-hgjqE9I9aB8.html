get through today so I'm gonna get
started on time so welcome welcome to
Java one and welcome to open world my
name is John Reeve I'm a senior director
of product management here at Oracle and
basically I from a problem management
perspective I own a lot of the
cloud-based container management
offerings here at Oracle and today we're
going to talk about running kubernetes
on Oracle cloud infrastructure and I'm
happy to be joined by a highly valued
partner of Oracle Veritas
please welcome faboo here who's going to
be talking about really running
kubernetes on oracle cloud why they
chose kubernetes how they're moving to a
micro services architecture and their
experiences on on running that on Oracle
cloud as well today
real quick the obligatory safe harbor
statement so agenda why it's gonna talk
a little bit about the background around
containers hopefully many folks know
about containers so we'll go through
this pretty quickly a little bit about
the market then I'm going to hand off to
Babu to talk about what Veritas has been
doing with their platform and moving you
know their products to micro services
based architecture how they're looking
at kubernetes and Oracle cloud
infrastructure and then I'm gonna be
making some announcements about some new
services that we have coming out in
early access we're announcing today so
some actually quite a lot of
announcements I'll be making during this
talk and then we'll open it up I'm
hoping to keep five minutes at the end
for questions so please if you can hold
your questions to the end or definitely
appreciate that so I just wanted to
start out with kind of what are we
trying to do here writers so as part of
the application development portfolio
here at Oracle what are we trying to do
from from a container native perspective
so there's many announcements being made
today essentially what we're trying to
do is build a container native
application development platform where
to make it seamless and easy for
developers to build up their
applications deploy them test them and
operate them at scale and there are a
number of aspects to that that you'll
hear about here at JavaOne
that includes things like serving us and
what we do
there but also at the infrastructure
layer what are we doing around
kubernetes and what are we doing in
terms of giving options to our customers
for them to adopt and embrace
communities an Oracle cloud
infrastructure so that's what we're
gonna be talking about today so quick
primer will real quick show of hands how
many folks have used darker today I
heard of docker containers okay
so the majority here it's obviously the
big difference between a virtual machine
and container as in the VM world I ran a
guest operating system in every virtual
machine right I replicated that complete
OS I have all my binaries and
applications rep in each OS obviously in
the container world were showing the
underlying kernel we're showing the
underlying OS and we just packaged up
our applications and binaries in
different containers and run them
essentially we have this portable
artifact right that we can hand off in
our development pipeline from
development to stage into production and
we can be assured what we've always got
the same stuff inside our container why
are people using containers so this is a
slide from a docker server survey
actually it's about a year old now but
obviously a big driver to begin with was
being developer productivity right
developers embrace have embraced docker
use it on their laptop do integration
testing on their laptop spin up spin up
new versions of their application
integrate them test them so forth
containers have moved off or started to
move off of the developer laptop right
into other parts of the organization
that means I need to be out of hand off
these containers to other people to run
I need to be able to maybe run them in a
testing or staging environment
ultimately I want to run them in
production and we're starting to see
many more of those use cases big drivers
are the move to things like micro
services to decouple my applications
into you know different moving parts
that I can manage discreetly migrating
to the cloud hybrid cloud use cases
multi cloud use cases and we'll see that
when we talk about kubernetes in a
second so container orchestration so
we're at a kubernetes talk so super most
folks know about container orchestration
but essentially once I you know move
beyond running a single container based
application I'm running my application
in a bunch of different containers
there's a number of things I need to be
concerned
about in terms of those containers right
so how do i network those containers
together the different pieces of my
application how do they talk to one
another how do they discover each other
so things like service discovery how do
they get scheduled rights or if you know
where do I place this container
placement those kinds of things affinity
anti affinity you know many of the
things we saw in the VM world now in the
container space what if a host goes down
how do i reschedule that container so
forth secrets how do I deal with secrets
inside of my containers what do I put
them how do i you know how do i does how
do I maintain that desired state of my
application so that's orchestration
right doing all that stuff and then we
came out with essentially Auguste
raishin as a service so containers as a
service platforms so rather than having
to stand up your own docker stand up
your own orchestration system whether
that's me Zaza kubernetes or docker
swarm whatever that is rather than have
to do that yourself
there's obviously offerings on the
marketplace now that allow you to
basically whether click bring up her
bring up a kubernetes environment bring
and run your applications you don't have
to maintain that environment and so
operationally it's much less expensive
you can focus on your applications and
the benefits of things like kubernetes
without having to maintain your own
communities or auguste raishin
environment so we have a couple of
container services well we have one
today and one that I'll be announcing
today so we have the Oracle container
cloud service on the left that was a
that is a docker service that's
available today on the Oracle cloud and
you know it's great for a lot of folks
are particularly getting started with
docker you know starting to run their
applications in containers today we're
going to be talking a lot about
kubernetes
kind of this second face we see a lot of
folks as they move into production
obviously they have a lot of operational
concerns around their containers and
application so how do I operate this at
scale how do i do logging how to do
monitoring had a how do i ought o scale
those containers potentially how do i do
secrets how do i you know there's a lot
of things you have to worry about once
you move your applications into
production and fundamentally as we said
before we're looking to provide you and
and developers
really an integrated end-to-end platform
for building deploying and operating
your container infrastructure okay all
the way into end and we'll talk about
that and we'll demo that today as well
quick a couple of words here around open
source so you know Oracle's been doing a
lot in open source so we know we have a
lot of work to do and you know we're
doing a lot of work in open source too
to embrace that across the board you
probably saw recently we joined the
cloud native computing foundation which
is essentially the owner if you like
although the foundation that owns
kubernetes today we've made a lot of
announcements this year around putting
Oracle software for example on the
docker Store to make it a fruit you know
things like the Oracle database and
WebLogic available in docker format for
folks to consume we made some
announcements at core OS fest back at
the start of June around our commitment
to kubernetes and how we're actually
contributing back to the communities
community and I'm going to be focusing
on that and we also released some of our
opens our own open source software so we
delete we released a number of utilities
that you can find freely on Oracle
github today and they're based on some
of our experiences around deploying
containers in production troubleshooting
them in production and really providing
some of that learnings in available to
you as open source tooling and we also
released a kubernetes installer that
I'll talk about as well on a second so a
big commitment to open source not just
kubernetes but across the ball in fact
you know the talk before me was a fan if
you attended was about spinnaker and
using that and how were you know making
spinnaker work well on our Oracle cloud
infrastructure so a big commitment
across the board so let's talk a little
bit about kubernetes you know what it is
and and why have folks adopting it right
so kubernetes was started back in
essentially 2014 and add and open source
by Google it's part of some of their
internal infrastructure that they've
been using for some time so Google
kindly donated that to the open source
community that has subsequently become
part of the CN CF so the
native computing Foundation which is a
foundation again that we we announced
our membership of recently that owns
kubernetes as well as a number of other
cloud native tooling and applications to
support cloud native applications
significant community growth right so
docker certainly had a lot of adoption
kubernetes if you like as the
orchestration system on top of the
container runtime has also just had a
ton of adoption right so something like
you know 13 almost 1,400 different
contributors across a wide range of
companies are contributing to kubernetes
so it's moving very very quickly as I
said a very heavy focus on production
and operations so moving out of
essentially from the developer laptop
how do we really start to build and
scale and deploy applications in
production something like a release
every three months probably a minor
release typically so it's moving very
very quickly
olara new features coming in all the
time and really a powerful platform
right for you to run any language that
runs in a container and almost almost
becoming kind of like the new
application or a big foundational piece
of the new application stack that's
emerging so a couple of words just about
darker and kubernetes so again we offer
a docker based service today again we're
going to be talking about a new
kubernetes manage services that we're
announcing today just a little you know
there's no good and bad here necessarily
but just some of the things we've seen
and observed in the market you know doc
has done a great job of really reaching
the developer community providing
essentially the de facto container
runtime for developers to use great
developer onboarding very simple to get
started and many folks for example might
be familiar with docker compose and then
start to use a little bit of swarm as
they as they as they play around with
docker consequently on the on the other
side kubernetes has really focused again
a lot on production grade kind of what
our core operations and DevOps
widespread adoption also they're very
powerful tool set so again things like
auto scaling rolling updates of your
container based applications kind of
built into
is support for state stateful
applications it's pretty pretty wide
kubernetes and pretty deep and and
there's a lot of stuff in it for you
know those kind of operational use cases
well go too much into this but again
just some numbers you know big growth
you know somebody had surveyed recently
that it's close to seventy one percent I
think it was of enterprises are actually
using kubernetes to manage an auger
strike their containers and so you know
another stat was eighty-four percent are
using it in production so it's pretty
being pretty widely used today by many
many companies and with that I'd like to
hand off actually to to Veritas and
vibhut who's going to talk a little bit
about why you know how they're
approaching their next generation
applications how they're decomposing
nose into micro services why they're
using kubernetes and some of their
experiences with the oracle cloud
infrastructure thank you John
so I'm gonna briefly talk about you know
our next-generation platform and how we
are using communities and also how we
intend on using oracle cloud so this is
a brief agenda we are gonna talk about
talk a little bit about the cloud
transformation that we have been seeing
for past decade in the journey that the
customers have taken you know what the
Veritas vision is for for their
customers and the new platform that we
are building what are the benefits that
it it brings to the customers why we
chose kubernetes as our platform to
build our platform
why Oracle cloud was also chosen as one
of the one of the things to host our SAS
offering so if you look over past decade
or so we see different phases of cloud
adoption happening the first generation
was all about the infrastructure people
bringing and forklifting their
applications from their traditional data
centers to the cloud as is that regular
operations that were there were as it is
implied to the cloud the second
generation we actually moved to the
application economy where you know the
application became very distributed in
nature and the infrastructure also was
being provisioned using their
and other other other such tools it and
you know a lot of containerization also
happening so the mode of you know
delivery but it became a little
different than what it was traditionally
and how we see the cloud breakout
happening as a third generation which is
going to be more like an information era
where the multi cloud as well as the
hybrid apps are going to be a given you
know the customers are going to somebody
doesn't like the third generation of
clouds but anyway you know the
compliance and security as we see it is
going to be going to be going to be a
big big bigger problem moving forward
when we see a very tough vision of of
the multi cloud data management platform
our customers are asking us to how to
support these particular cross cloud
transactions in terms of data and
information management the information
spread itself is across multiple clouds
it is available on private cloud public
cloud or SAS workloads and so on and so
forth so if you go and take a look at it
at the bottom of the pyramid is the
protection of the data the protection of
the data is what we're it has has been
involved in for past couple of decades
but the customers are also wanting an
orchestration of those particular access
to the data and of course they want
governance of the data make sure that it
is compliant it is not escaping the
enterprise in an insecure way everything
and there are transactions which are
actually securing that particular data
content and the Holy Grail is to
monetize that particular data you know
what are the returns that that data data
will provide to the enterprise can they
make really good decisions based on the
data spread so we see about 85% of our
enterprises actually have a multi cloud
strategy which is baked in right now by
the CIOs and other other such folks so
the very test platform the key benefits
that Veritas platform brings to the
table is that
single pane of glass for for managing
the the data across across different
data sources we will give a 360-degree
view as far as the curse customers are
concerned from their data and they can
take corrective action along with the
complete policy loop that we discussed
in the in the previous slide and all of
this will be encapsulated with a
flexible subscription model so you know
John already mentioned about some of the
some of the benefits that kubernetes
this is just to reiterate those
particular benefits you know we are
seeing a lot of customer adoption or a
lot of customers actually building
platforms on kubernetes so these
particular platform the main main issues
that were that what needed to be solved
previously as far as a self-healing of
the of the platform is concerned as for
upgrade downgrades and other aspects are
concerned they come fully baked into
kubernetes as a result you know we have
a beacon and innovate and innovate
directly on the business application
rather than being worrying worried about
the infrastructure so in a nutshell you
know about couple of months back we
which we we started venturing into
Oracle cloud you know there were there
were definitely certain challenges up
front which we had to resolve but we
wanted to move our SAS offering to two
Oracle cloud and we really looked at
some of these particular key pieces
which would you know which which were
acting as a differentiator for us so the
throughput aspects of the storage which
we needed as a data company were were
available on only on Oracle cloud and
none of the other CSPs
the orchestration piece which we work
closely with in terms of terraform
scripts and other things that that that
were actually included in the next
generation of the open source offering
or next generation of scripts that we
are we are open sourcing and moving
forward we see certain needs
that we had we had asked Oracle folks to
Oracle folks to include in their
offerings were you know the no sequel as
a managed service the docker registry
also the elasticsearch as a service and
while while working on this particular
presentation about half an hour back
with John we know that a few of these
particular key items have already been
incorporated and will be will be
available soon so that's a that's in a
nutshell what what our journey has been
on Oracle cloud and overall we have been
extremely satisfied with the progress
done and soon you know we our our
offering will be completely supported in
Oracle cloud once all these particular
matter service is going thank you thanks
Babu thank you very much so as we Babu
said you know kubernetes has a lot of
great support for when you deploy your
container based applications I can do
rolling updates I can i can do i can do
roll backs those kind of things but what
about upgrading the kubernetes
infrastructure itself right what if you
know because I said kubernetes is moving
very quickly as a release every three
months kubernetes 1.8 just came out on
Thursday last week how do we move to new
versions so as we've spoken to customers
we've heard about a few common
challenges that folks are facing with
their kubernetes deployments
specifically upgrading is one of them so
obviously you've got your your
kubernetes masters which are the control
plane for kubernetes and then you've got
your your nodes or your worker nodes
that run the actual pods or workloads
that you need to worry about from a
version of kubernetes perspective as
well we've heard challenges around kind
of doing that how do I make sure I have
a highly available control plane right
because if I have one master and that
goes down then I'm kind of hosed at
least in terms of being out of schedule
new containers or change anything in the
environment how do I figure out the
networking so as many of you know
communities has certain requirements on
networking in terms of pods being able
to communicate with each other via IP
addresses and so forth and
Orage how do i integrate storage and
generally folks just want that stuff to
work right I want to build my
applications in kubernetes I want to
deploy them and I want that storage and
their networking stuff to be figured out
as we start to move into production and
you know out of development like how do
I set the right kind of access and
controls and security governance on who
can do what with what clusters right so
maybe I don't want everyone being out of
touch to a production cluster maybe only
certain folks should be out a deploy to
that cluster maybe certain folks should
be able to read and see what's happening
but maybe not change it and maybe
certain administrators should be able to
spin up and change new clusters because
typically if I'm running this on the
cloud and I'm creating a new cluster I'm
spending more money right because I'm
consuming more compute resources so I
need to have controls operational
controls around my teams and how they
interact with the environment and
finally kubernetes doesn't stand alone
right it's like it's a great deployment
vehicle for us to run our next
generation applications on but I also
want to make sure I have a completely
integrated pipeline right I want to be
able to build my applications in an
automated way I want to be out of push
those to the registry that I'm using I
want to be able to deploy that to
kubernetes I wanted to all be integrated
because fundamentally I'm looking to
achieve agility right better agility I'm
looking to many of you are looking to
iterate faster take mmm new products to
market faster and reap some of those
benefits so real quick so what are some
of the options that Oracle cloud
infrastructure offers for kubernetes and
orchestration today and so you've
probably heard and there's many talks at
the show around the Oracle cloud
infrastructure itself the great
performance that we was talking about
from a compute networking storage
perspective not just a storage IO but
the low latency and the very high
predictable performance you can get from
both bare metal machines if you want
them in your environment or indeed from
the virtual machines in your environment
so we've seen a number there are a
number of options for customers right in
terms of containers and containers
orchestration today obviously one option
is you can run your own august raider on
oracle cloud infrastructure and we'll
talk about
an option we have for you with
kubernetes in a second but really a lot
of folks are looking to also consume
kubernetes managed service and from our
perspective that should really hit
excuse me a little bit of a throat that
should really hit a couple of goals one
is it should be easy for developers to
consume so as you come on board as you
spin up your kubernetes clusters you
just want this stuff to work it should
be easy
you know kubernetes always isn't the
easiest if you're if you're working with
it you know in certain situations very
powerful but can be pretty complex but
at the same time you want to make sure
that you can integrate with your
existing enterprise applications right
so if you kubernetes typically doesn't
stand alone in your application
architecture it's working with databases
it's working with messaging queues as we
saw it's working with no sequel excuse
me
and so you want it to integrate in an
enterprise context with all the other
stuff you have so one of the things we
announced a couple of weeks ago was the
terraform kubernetes installer for
Oracle cloud infrastructure so this is
out on github it's available freely it's
open source you can use it we've
developed it in conjunction with a
number of our customers and partners and
basically what this does it works with
the terraform provider that vibhut
talked about for our Oracle cloud
infrastructure and it stands up a
kubernetes cluster for you in your
tenancy so if you create an account on
Oracle cloud infrastructure you can
download this thing literally within a
few minutes you can have a fully
operational highly available cluster
that you're running in your own tenancy
multiple masters multiple EDD nodes
again there's all this stuff that nee is
needed to make kubernetes work from a
state perspective from a control plane
perspective this makes that highly
available for you so you don't have a
single point of failure in your control
plane it creates the underlying
infrastructure elements for you so it
creates essentially a virtual network in
in in the Oracle cloud infrastructure it
creates low bouncers it creates
instances you have the control over the
size and shape how powerful you want
your VMs or bare metal shapes to be to
run your communities workloads so this
is available to you today you can scale
up your cluster you can scale it down
it's a it's a great way to get started
with kubernetes on Oracle cloud and
again you can spin up a cluster in a
couple of minutes the other thing and
the big announcement we're making today
is we're announcing Oracle cloud manage
kubernetes service here today together
with the manage registry and what we're
calling pipelines which was the worker
product so again our goal is not just
around kubernetes but it's to a really
enable you to build your applications
deploy them to a registry spin them up
in kubernetes and provide end-to-end
integration across those so the manage
kubernetes service today really hits a
few key points so one is it's leveraging
standard kubernetes as of today 1.74 but
will shortly be moving to 1.8 in early
access and really it's a fully managed
service right so we're managing the
control plane for you you don't have to
touch it
you can choose to spin up your worker
nodes in your tenancy we manage the
control plan for you it's developer
friendly right so you'll see as I go
through the demo very simple to get
started very easy to create your cluster
very easy to scale your cluster and get
running with kubernetes immediately also
Enterprise ready so a number of things
I'll go into some of the features in a
second but highly available control
plane node pool support full REST API
and we'll go through the details in a
second but typically you're wanting to
deploy your clusters across multiple
availability domains so this is just a
picture showing that where we've
provisioned the network for you the vcn
a virtual cloud network we've
provisioned your cluster nodes across
multiple availability domains for a
redundancy integration with low
balancing that many of you will need
with Oracle cloud infrastructure built
into kubernetes integration with
persistent storage that we saw was also
one of the
needs and also a fully managed registry
that we're announcing today as well in
early access today so again we're
introducing this service it's completely
managed service allows you to create
clusters scale them and manage them full
integration of your build your registry
your your clusters and providing a full
integration there across the board for
end-to-end kind of lifecycle management
controlling who has access so a big part
of this again is the security and the
governance who can do what with what
clusters how do I give them the right
permissions how they're getting in the
right roles whether that's a development
cluster or production cluster and really
enables you to get started quickly and
and gives you a really a developer
friendly environment but couples
kubernetes with the power of the Oracle
cloud infrastructure if you want to
create clusters of bare-metal machines
to run your pods on you can do that you
don't have to have any hypervisor you
can get full native performance to your
kubernetes
with no hypervisor in the middle if you
want to subsequently you can also create
VM so you can create combinations using
no pause for the clusters that you
create as I said we're also in addition
to the kubernetes manage service we're
also announcing a container registry
service in early access so this is a
fully v2 docker API compliant registry
where you can store your private images
full integration with the build aspect
so the worker pipelines and the
container engine some some stuff under
the hood that really makes it nice in
terms of consolidating and deduplicating
your storage usage obviously docker with
the the layers and the different images
does a lot of that for you but we've
taken that a step further so it's
deduplicating the storage within an
organization and again like the
container engine like the clusters you
can control access to this registry who
has access to it who can push to it who
can pull from it all that good stuff in
your teams and it's co-located with the
container engine for low latency right
so these are running your instances
we're running the same region so that
you have great performance from from one
talking to another
so a little bit about the details I'll
go through some of these so again we
talked about you know the container
native end-to-end lifecycle management
fully integrated registry standard and
this is very important because not
everyone uses standard kubernetes
standard upstream kubernetes right so
we're committed to open source we're
contributing back to cuba Nettie's we've
got folks working on it and being part
of the community as new versions of
kubernetes come out you want to adopt
those quickly right so our goal with the
managed service is to make it so that
you can move to those new versions very
quickly or be in a controlled way
so when 1.8 comes out you have access to
it and you can control in your clusters
when you move to one today right very
quickly integrated with the underlying
storage so as I said many of you are
looking to do use cases with persistent
storage volumes in kubernetes you have
maybe some stateful applications you're
looking to get integrated with the low
bouncers in in the environment so forth
to expose your community services we'll
show that in the demo very simple kind
of streamlined UI one-click clusters
we'll show that in a second built in
cluster add-on so when we spin up a
cluster it's got the kubernetes
dashboard running on it it's got cube
cube DNS running on it which is pretty
common both those things we're also
installing helm and Atilla so for those
of you that are packaging up or
leveraging so for those you don't know
helm is essentially a package manager
for kubernetes that's become very
popular to package up and deploy your
applications so we're running that on
the cluster out of the box too and this
is standard docker runtimes
so right so the underlying nodes or
cluster nodes that we spin up a running
standard docker
you can SSH into them if you want to if
you configure it that way you can run
docker command line against those nodes
so the familiar the docker you're
familiar with Enterprise ready access to
the full performance of Oracle cloud
infrastructure you can spin up clusters
of VMs bare-metal machines whatever you
want to highly available control playing
we're managing the control plane right
no single point of failure in the
control plane we're coming out with that
from the get-go multi ad or zone support
so we call zones availability of domains
on the Oracle cloud infrastructure so if
you want to deploy coming in these
applications that are resilient
and you know essentially we tag those
nodes so that you can do that and deploy
your pods across multiple availability
domains
no pool support and self-healing
clusters so you can have different kinds
of shapes you could have a cluster that
consists of VMs and bare-metal machines
or different shapes of VMs and bare
metal machines if you want to and
leverage the power of kubernetes that
way self-healing clusters if I know Goes
Down will attempt to heal it for you so
if you specify you know kubernetes is
trying to heal your pods right so if a
node goes down kubernetes will risk it
to attempt to reschedule it but if we
see a cluster node go down or we see the
number of cluster nodes reduce beyond
what what you wanted to be there we'll
try and reconcile that and create create
new nodes for you and again team based
access control very important in terms
of who can access your cluster who can
do what on it who can spin up new
clusters those kinds of things so with
that I have about 10 minutes for a demo
and then I'm going to open up for
questions so I'm gonna jump over to the
demo real quick out of PowerPoint and
just to set the scene so you're looking
at the worker user interface here and
you can see along the top here there's a
few different tabs for what we call
pipelines releases and clusters
pipelines is essentially where I do my
builds of my product releases is the
registry manage registry piece and the
clusters are my kubernetes clusters and
I've actually got an application on
github
pretty simple hello world it's a go
application that I pulled into my build
process and I define what we call a work
flow so I'm going to kick that off in a
second so that's going to basically
build pick up any changes from github
build that application push it to a
registry we've also taken a step here
we're dynamically Auto automatically
injecting any credentials that we need
into the registry
sorry into the cluster and then we're
deploying to the cluster so live demo
and all that and caveats so I'm going to
go in and and make a change to my to my
github file here say hello open world
Java one
put a few exclamation marks and I'm
going to commit this and what we should
see here is a build kicking off yep so
it builds kicking off we're building it
we're going to push it to our registry
and deploy to our cluster let's let that
go for a second doesn't take long but
let's look at the the clusters that we
have set up here so if I want to create
a new cluster to deploy to I simply go
to the create cluster button I give it a
name call it my job or one cluster and I
created in my in my session I'm going to
choose my version of Cuba Nettie's that
I want to run on the master here this is
one seven four again we'll be moving to
1.8 pretty shortly here and I can define
my cloud credentials right so if I've
already got an OC I account and you
require an icy out o CI r account
account today you can give your cloud
credentials so we're able to spin up a
cluster in Euro CI tenancy okay you can
specify a given compartment that you
want to spin this up into if you want so
compartment is an ocean and o CI where I
can divide up essentially my compute
resources between different groups and
you can also provide an SSH key if you
want to have access to those underlying
nodes like we talked about before I can
take some of the suggested cont sizes of
my cluster or I can create my own
cluster so like we said before you have
full access to all the underlying shapes
on the Oracle cloud if you want to spin
up a cluster of VMs you can do that if
you want to spin up a cluster of
super-powerful dense i/o
bare-metal machines you can do that too
potentially these things can run
thousands of containers right so and
have no kind of hypervisor layer so
that's great I can do that let's look at
an existing cluster so this is one a
running today I've got essentially six
nodes spun up here six VMs in this case
and running two in each available you
availability domain because I want a
resilient cluster again these details
pertain to your control playing at the
top we're managing the control plane for
you you don't have to touch it
you just have to define the worker nodes
or the nodes that you want in your
cluster to run very simple again for a
developer to get started so you can
download your coop config file here
which is the father interact with the
cluster you can launch the cubans
dashboard we give you instructions on
that
and again you have the ability to add
and remove note pools so again you can
have different shapes in the same
cluster can have VMs and bare-metal
machines all in there so on the releases
side actually let's let's go back and
see real quick it looks like our build
ran it's successfully pushed into the
registry and it deployed it to the
cluster we'll go launch the application
in a second let's have a look inside the
registry so here we can see we
automatically created a repo here that
image is being pushed to the registry
looks like about a minute and half ago
when we just kicked it off we've
actually interestingly tagged to this
image with the actual commit from github
so one of our goals right is to get
traceability from source to what's
running on our cluster so we can
understand hey which get commits we
actually generated this image from and
then we can actually see we actually
will show you in a second we label the
pods in the cluster so you can see which
version of your software it comes from
what git commits for actual pods that
are running right now so let's check
that that worked yay hello Java one just
for those of you that are familiar with
the the command line we blow that up a
little bit I can do like a cou control
get all for example and see so in this
case we've done a kubernetes deployment
and you can see we've exposed that
service which is called hello world or
an external IP on the load balancer so
we've automatically gone and basically
created a load balancer for you we can
also see that in the basically the some
of the same information in the Kuban
Andes dashboard so if you can see this
here you can see here's our hello world
service so you know you can just get to
that service again by clicking here and
we can see the various we're actually
doing a coup Benes deployment here and
you can see that the humanity's pod
actually hopefully let's have a look
here it's good looking ooh it's just
gonna look to see if I could see the
labels but you can see some of the
labels here in the objects have the
commit hash so I have traceability again
from what got deployed to the labels
that could deploy
the various objects here so again
end-to-end workflow right from all the
way from bringing in my github account
defining my build process to pushing
that image here into the managed
registry that we saw to deploying it
onto the cluster that we defined
completely integrated end-to-end
lifecycle so this is we're announcing
essentially a number of noun sment but
this is going into early access today if
you are interested in getting access to
this you can certainly come and visit us
at the booth we're in the Java 1
development lounge we also have a page
to find so if you go to worker comm
forward slash tech - preview you can
have us there's a sign-up page here if
you'd like to get access we love you
know we'd love to hear from you
we're going to be we're going to want to
hear feedback on this product obviously
and with that I just give you a couple
of pointers to some other sessions so
there's a number of kubernetes related
sessions at open world for a quick kind
of cheat sheet to many of the container
native kind of sessions that goes more
into more details into the worker
pipelines piece the the registry piece
and the ok piece sorry the managed
communities piece you can you can check
out these resources worker dot-com /oo w
gives you kind of a cheat sheet - some
of the some of the key sessions that are
happening so I think we time that pretty
well I've got about five or six minutes
left
I think oh let's open it up for
questions any questions on anything
today questions from the front
so the question is can you can you
leverage third-party docker files yes
one of the one of the important things
about this platform is that we showed
you a kind of an end-to-end integrated
flow from the built from our build piece
to our registry piece so I managed
kubernetes piece you can certainly
provide your own pieces in between so if
you don't want to use the build piece
you can you can leverage the registry
and the Kuban at ease if you're already
using jenkins or something like that
feel free to leverage that and plug that
into the registry and the clusters so
these essentially interchangeable parts
you don't have to use all of them but
obviously we're doing our best effort to
make sure that for all three it's a
great integrated experience to do that
so on the worker side there's definitely
more sessions that go into detail on
that but we use a worker worker yeah
more formats
to build the docker images today what
other questions we have question from
yes or the question okay so the question
was how what do you what are we doing
specifically with persistent storage and
go into a little bit more details about
that maybe specific around databases so
so one of the one of the notions in
kubernetes is we have a concept called
system volumes and persistent volume
claims essentially we've written our own
persistent volume driver and a
persistent volume claim driver so that
when when inside your pod or inside your
deployment if you specify that you want
a persistent volume essentially will
automatically go create one for you or
choose it from a pool that you've
already created and how those work is
that you know if a pod for example the
good thing about these is if a pod dies
for example and gets rescheduled on
another node the storage will
automatically move with the pod so this
is this is something that's in
kubernetes which is great because the
you know that wasn't so easy perhaps in
the docker world essentially how that
works under the hood is that it mounts a
block volume so the block volume
performance that you have on that we're
talking about an Oracle cloud
infrastructure you get that pass through
to your kubernetes infrastructure it
mounts a block volume if the pod moves
to a different host it'll um mounted
found it automatically to the other
volume so you can run databases those
kind of things and leverage things like
state from sets and those kind of no
notions in in kubernetes the question
what other questions go ahead question
yes so absolutely so when we span up
when I spent up that deployment I didn't
show you the deployment but when I did
that coop control if I do a coop control
get service and then hello world right I
should see here that what's happened is
I've I've specified a service of type
load balancer so when I put that request
in the kubernetes file it automatically
span up a load balancer on Oracle cloud
infrastructure for me and assigned an IP
external IP to that service and so you
do that inside your kubernetes service
by doing type load balancer okay so you
know kubernetes support such a few
different ways to expose your services
to the outside world and load balancers
one of them and it's that's integrated
here as well what other questions to
folks have
okay great we'll be here probably for a
couple minutes if anyone have any other
questions here after the session but
definitely come by swing by the booths
we can show you more in depth and thank
you very much for your time today thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
