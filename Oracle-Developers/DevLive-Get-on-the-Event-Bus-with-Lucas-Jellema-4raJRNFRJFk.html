life of Lucas gel Emma the developer
what do you do I made you walk in boot
up the computer and what is your first
go-to application after you're done with
social media and blogging Thank You one
because my days are very different one
from another GRI is a typical place to
start because that's where my work is
defines then the depending on the
technology using it could be JDeveloper
or Visual Studio code or sublime or any
kind of editor really I'm all over the
place
so here at this event and I think you've
presented this a couple different places
you've been on your mind for a while
about micro services and orchestration
exactly yeah why has it captured your
imagination
well micro service is I think the way I
define it because I think there are as
many definitions of micro services there
are people talking about it but my
definition of micro service is very much
to do with teams taking ownership of the
entire lifecycle of their products so
we're talking about products now a micro
service is a product and team builds it
runs it and fixes it they take care of
having that service that functionality
running all the time and in order to do
so they need to have full control over
their service and over the interactions
their service has with the surroundings
and we still as a company want multiple
micro services to work together to carry
out certain business processes and
that's also one of my backgrounds I've
been doing people I've been doing bpm
there we talk about business processes
but there the notion always is
orchestration there is someone in the
driving seat telling each serve
to do something now it's your turn now
it's your turn now you too have to do
something that means that the
orchestrator and Microsoft and the
services in that case they have an
interdependency and if you change one
you break the other right that's what we
don't want to have so that's where
orchestration comes in the microservices
know what they can do and in the
orchestration they know when an
opportunity comes along for them to step
in and do their thing but no one is
telling them to step in and do their
thing there's no conductor no
orchestration going on it's them knowing
from the routing slip that's an
important concept on the orchestration
that the next step that has to be
carried out is something they can carry
out so now we have micro-services that
dance together in this orchestration but
they don't know about each other they
are perfectly isolated as microservices
should be ah
and so it's madness it's chronological
but it's not necessarily linear it
sounds like we're this routing slip as
you call him might spin this up while
this is happening in the or come back
and rejoin no absolutely some symmetry
there's some asymmetry yeah things going
on in parallel some things that need to
be sequential that's all set up in the
routing slip that's not something the
microservices know they just have a task
to perform and the routing slip will
tell them if they are free to go and do
that thing so do developers actually
write the routing slip or does that
happen automatically as part of the
framework or who here's what I'm trying
to get to and my friends at OPN will
like this who is in charge that's a good
question and the routing slip is not
provided by some framework so the team
responsible for the definition of the
business process will be define and
design and implement the routing slip
for that particular business process and
anyone who runs a micro service can also
publish routing slips and the only thing
you have to agree on across your
enterprise is what routing slits look
like otherwise you don't understand each
other
right that's the only thing so seems to
me like one routing slip can decide to
cut in line in front of another routing
slip not really
the routing slip defines the action that
that need to be performed for each
instance of the process there will be an
instance of the routing slip at
microservices we'll listen to events
that's where the event bus in my session
comes in listen to events that tell them
there is a workflow instance that needs
attention take a look at it and it's the
order of the events that determines
which actions will be carried out so
events from various workflow instances
will intermingle one event from this one
one event from another one and then
depending on the order of the events
micro-services will do their job but of
course since the micro services are
horizontally scalable right we can have
multiple instances of micro service so
the same activity can be carried out
multiple times in parallel by different
micro service instances for different
workflow instances you're kidding you
have to come to my session at 3 yes to
see it all in action hey there will be a
live demo you actually have that working
yeah I have it working for now yes for a
few hours time yeah well let's talk a
minute about some of the cloud services
and speed up the context of the cloud
when you're running your micro services
I mean do does it make it easier to
orchestrate or a more difficult to
afford this change the interesting thing
is it doesn't really matter whether the
micro services some could be running on
premises some could be running on the
Oracle cloud some could be running on
earth third-party clouds as long as the
events are bridged so I need an event
bus on each environment and event buses
need to synchronize that's the only
thing I need and at that stage I don't
care where the micro services are so
actually this is an architecture that
gives you a lot of freedom in deploying
your micro services
that's good and does the census the
cloud actually the cloud platform that
you choose does it can it help the
performance of a micro service based on
how it's designed or hinder or well both
it's possible what what I would like
from a cloud platform is that it
provides management for my micro
services so based upon performance
characteristics that it monitors live in
real time it will scale up if it has to
and scale down if it can because then of
course the bill is reduced as well but
it's something that a cloud platform can
provide or perhaps does not provide your
Oracle container cloud service for
example does provide it so that's
important if I deploy my personal there
and I specify that I require a certain
number of instances for the micro
service I require a certain performance
then the platform will take care of
making sure that that number of
instances that's required is actually
running nice it is very nice
well we thought about that ahead of time
we're said something we added later it's
still evolving
I kept the whole emotion of micro
service or at least the implementation
of it using containers it's very new
tell me what was the first application
you ever wrote it was when I first
started at Oracle consulting in the
Netherlands in 94 now it's not the first
application if the first application I
ever wrote was on an auto set expectrum
in 92 in basic and application for the
world the World Cup football really what
it was a betting application then I was
embedding Ohama
it was collecting all the met results
and enlisting them again into a loss and
it was graphically challenged command
line tables to line up and a little bit
better perhaps but not a lot now very
simplistic lot of fun though
really yeah do you think it would still
run today well I think there are
emulators on Windows that those still
runs at expectance applications and it's
amazing what in those days we could do
with 48 kilobytes of memory yes he had
to prioritize yeah it doesn't even feel
like that in retrospect but it was quite
amazing and of course my application
wasn't anything special but I was
playing chess and doing arcade games as
they were called at a time and they were
fun and now we need gigabytes of memory
and and high-resolution graphical
displays or at least that's what my boys
tell me yes what's baby all right you
know what you should point them at that
applications they look hit yeah I want
to be interested yeah it was fun doing
and of course it laid a foundation for
my later programming okay so tell me
what editor do you use at a moment as
usual Visual Studio code right and it
used to be notepad plus plus I'm still
using notepad plus plus and I try to use
sublime it for some reason it didn't
really appeal to me but maybe I haven't
gotten across the first one of those
things a I'm finding that most
developers will pick their editor very
early and they stay with it
some state with VI and I think writing
but I have to use so sometimes but I'm
I'm not good at it yeah well Lucas thank
you so much for sitting in with us today
that's been great now you have to grab
lunch and then you have to shake hands
and sign a couple of autographs on your
way to your session so you're so
sick well thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
