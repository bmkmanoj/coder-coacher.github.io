so it's going to be a relatively short
session to think analytics are meant to
be pretty simple and there's some key
stuff that want to talk about so
actually there are two sessions that
I'll be covering today one is just on
this is more on inside analytics so it's
more higher level but we'll talk about
and also exchange some ideas I think
while you work with the mobile
application pretty closely I know
certain are certain it does so I
certainly want to hear your thoughts so
the presentation itself is going to be
relatively short the second one that I'm
going to do is at five o'clock I'm going
to focus on and talk about bots and chat
BOTS in a lot more detail and we'll have
you know a few more fun demos at five
o'clock so hopefully you can stick
around until five o'clock and be at the
session so just to introduce myself
Joe Wong I'm part of the product
management team at Oracle looking after
bots and mobile cloud platform for
Oracle right so I'm what I want to talk
about today is how you know it's
basically different ways to get
actionable insight into from mobile
application and bot
you know different examples and
mechanisms of getting that so that you
can improve your application and also to
that effect bot now mobile application I
will argue is something that's probably
better known in terms of how you want to
get insight into mobile applications we
just talked about what what we're doing
and as an example of the type of data
analytics data were collecting from the
mobile application as far as chatbot is
concerns a new area so I'll kind of talk
to it but I also want to get your
thoughts around what you think of the
different things I want to capture with
bots and
and also things could go haywire when
your your the information you collect
automatically feeds into the application
so just very quickly what are the
different challenges that we typically
see with mobile application development
how that fits into providing analytics
to solve these challenges what these
actionable insight is and also demo
again pretty a short session I think
after a whole day of sessions I think
you can use a shorter session
lighter-weight and then at the end we'll
have a little bit fun at five o'clock
okay so there's no doubt that the
world's gone mobile and I think one of
the things that the analyst has told us
is an average person looks at our mobile
phone over hundred fifty times a day
right so which sadly means we actually
look at phones more often than our loved
one in a lot of cases but that's the way
it goes but that's also just an
importance of using mobile devices and
how we're interacting with mobile
devices okay what are some of the
challenges that I think for mobile
application and involvement and how does
the you know these inside analytics
actually helps to to solve that so the
simple thing is let's look at a very
typical mobile application right if you
look at this mobile application it's a
human resources application it's very
simple to develop and if you are pretty
good at I think you know you're here and
how many we have done mobile app
development okay well that will say a
half day so so you know that was the
mobile development tools nowadays you
can probably create a UI that represents
this application in a couple hours right
and relatively simple however the hard
part is to map the data into a different
type of data of different groups of data
that a mobile application needs to
present right so for example a simple a
HR application you need to pull the
names from
say for example people thought in Europe
it could be s AP application and
certainly you need to get users social
network information and then performance
information comes from Taleo work or
talent cloud or from all of the
third-party products right so all sudden
you have a big integration challenge to
deliver these data to mobile
applications and only that but also
deliver in a deficient and quickly and
inefficient manner so that the
application performs them get balled
down by processing these large
applicator set of data and beyond just
be able to connect to different back-end
applications there are also different
other challenges for example picking
different tools for mobile application
what tools are you comfortable with or
the different mobile application
environment there are needed to properly
manage an application so for example
development test production environment
how do you migrate these go into
different environment or the different
mobile services that are needed to build
a mobile application so for example know
what mobile app do we typically use were
most often it's the ones that keeps
beeping right the one that we keep
getting a push notifications and I think
most of you may be in the Washington DC
area and certainly even not in
Washington DC area I came from work HQ
in the past six month you know if you
turn on push notification for one then
use CNN apps for whatever your favorite
font news or whatever every every other
hour you'll get a push notification
because somebody says something and so
forth right so that's the type of
application you're likely to use well in
order to support that push notification
in a scalable way you also need a
platform to support that and also you
need to know whether users actually
using these application and receiving
these push notifications right so all of
these goes into getting a feedback from
mobile application how they're actually
you know do they actually see when they
the push notification click on the link
to get into the application so these are
the things that you want to collect
security security is a slightly
different matter
right so for example you may need to
know whether end-user is logging in from
different part of the world and maybe an
end user is logged in from you know Asia
and all some when are later this person
logging in from from the US there's
something wrong with the with that login
right so again that's something that the
analytics will help to capture that's
key security information and also
obviously integration the ability to
connect to the back-end services and not
to mention not the very least is the
ability to choose client development
tools so enter standard all that in
order to understand how effective your
mobile application is that that's where
the monitor and analyze part of the a
challenge comes from so so the date
that's what we're going to talk about
again very quickly what these different
things are and basically form a mobile
application development perspective
there are different type of you know the
fancy term persona but just different
type of users that are involved with
developing mobile application
you know commonly we think of this
person of mobile app developer just
developing the application that that's
fine
there are also someone who would figure
out how to connect mobile application to
back-end services and integrate with
back-end data however what's more of
interest to these Lyons business
stakeholders so for example these are
the person these are sponsors of the
project that build mobile applications
they want to know how successful the
mobile application is they want to know
how many user are you actually using it
where they're using it from and so forth
admin very simple same thing needs to
know how many user per day is using the
system so they can anticipate the usage
and enterprise architects to know now
even go back to the developers
developers their analytics and
insightful need is typically has to do
with
basically are there any bugs or they're
issues of their API call that failed and
so forth these are all the type of
things that that important to these
different type of what we call personas
but but from an analytic standpoint
these are the the key information that
they would need so that's one of the the
other thing that you know and and
there's a hopefully there's no there's
anyone from that Gartner analyst firms
here but but one of the things that I
think we're seeing already is that
although great great great majority of
the enterprise's are building mobile
applications but very very few of them
is able to gather meaningful insight
into from these mobile applications so
we'll discuss two ways that we'll do
that okay so this is another very
interesting slide word or type of data
on measuring so how do you how does
someone actually goes out and measure
the effective of a mobile application
and and again this is an analyst firm
fancy term digital traction right but
basically just measure how well the this
digital transformation initiative mobile
application is being used by by the end
users so some of the key metrics that
the analyst pointed out right is for as
very some are pre obvious so for example
user metrics right basically new users
active users being active and returning
users you know just basic statistics and
also usage so be able to see the how
often the application is being used very
very basic analytics information that
you want to capture from your mobile
application just to see very you know
how how many user is actually using the
application the second level is a little
bit more interesting is basically be
able to do the next level analysis and
then understand the type of users the
oops the user the segment of the users
are actually using the application then
go after these different segment users
right so that's the advantage of
building mobile applications that and
this is one of the best practices that
we're recommending is that you want
instrument the application in such a way
that not only captures you know the the
information that techniques developers
you know you all need to know but also
keep in mind what business users needs
to know right so what business user
needs to know is they need to understand
different type of users they want to be
able to go into the different type of
users and figure out okay for this group
of users in this location there's a
disproportionately high number of users
that fail to complete a transaction
right and then from that point on the
business users can then take this
insight and then target that group of
users in that location to say why and
help them to complete the transaction it
could be also for example used to
analyze a product let's say we just
found that a certain type of product
tend to be left in the shopping cart
more often it is the Inc ecommerce
application than the others then you
want to be able to take these
applications and web sorry take that
information and then create a promotion
out of that product so you can maybe
move them out of the way so all these
involve gathering these types of
information some of the other things you
want to be able to an business user
wants to do is be able to do so the
cohort or in retention analysis
basically again this is a fancy term but
basically it just means that analysis of
how likely your users returning to use
your application right so again we can
capture that information by seeing how
often the user are coming back to use
the application and then then analyze
whether the application successful in
retaining the user again that's another
set of kind of data that you want to
gather from engagement at
help increase the engagement the other
one is something more around predictive
metrics so basically term meaning is you
know basically the users that never came
back so you also want to be able to
gather these types of information and be
able to analyze how many users actually
stopped using the application and then
the fourth one which is also very
important is that whenever you gather
these information from mobile
applications you also need to build a
channel to make an actionable meaning
that okay let's see if you do identify a
group of users you want you want to
target by giving them special discounts
and so forth now to reach these users
while these are could be push
notifications right you want to push to
notification to a group of users then
you need to think about how to build up
the infrastructure to just target that
group of user and further on I think
personalization and this is even a
harder thing to do
so basically being able to capture all
of these specific attributes of the user
and then be able to do analysis that's a
big part of being able to do data
gathering and take the next level of
analysis another part of that I think
we're seeing more and more often is the
integration with marketing campaign so
in other words some sort of integration
with the marketing system to be able to
marketing system are great at running a
campaign you know doing everything that
needs to be done emails or whatever and
planning it out but what a marketing
campaign and marketing system doesn't
necessarily have or the insight that
doesn't have is which group of user
actually could benefit from this
campaign and that's where the mobile
this sort of mobile analytics would
would benefit the these marketers is
that the by gathering these type of
information from a mobile application
then it can do the next level of
analysis and lastly the other thing
that's also important is be able to
capture these type of information from
multiple channels and sources because an
end user could be using a mobile
application as well as the web
application to perform a task you know
for example you know when I buy stuff on
Amazon a lot of times I browse on a web
browser but I complete my transaction or
I track my water on my mobile phone so
the ability to track these interactions
and provide data analysis through
different channels are very important so
they just tell them to high level things
that you you want to capture I'm not
going to spend too much time on this
marketing slide but this is basically
okay oh it looks really different but
basically this is just shows all of
these components of the the the oracles
that you know cloud platform for mobile
and one of the key things off to to the
side here is what we call it customer
and experience analytics and that refers
to the ability to be able to take and
these user attributes and do the next
level analysis right and and again this
is a today and primary Jers talk about
capabilities right and what does provide
just skip over these now the one other
thing i wanted to talk a little bit more
is see okay I'll do a demo surely what
some of these looks like but before I go
into a demo you know I think most of you
have done mobile application which one
of you have actually well it's probably
a tricky question but most of you have
you seen the one of the keynotes this
morning where we had a demo of bot I
believe some of you seeing it right and
that presents a different challenge for
analytics I don't have a slide on that
but this is a kind of evolving area that
how do you capture
analytics data and make a meaningful
from this new channel right from one of
the key and then and as with the mobile
application analytics
there are always two areas that both of
analytics set of interest right one is
purely more of a technical interest
which is how long does an API call page
how long does a what is the latency and
what is the list of all the API errors
in HTTP five hundred four hundred errors
or that the application gets and these
are and what are the intervals and these
are a type of technical and oolitic
information then the second group is a
business business type of analytics
information and these are captured as
part of the mobile application to see
for example were the different statuses
of service request as it traverses
through different statuses for service
requests right so these are business
related analytics I think chat pod
probably has the same type of use cases
as well right so for example from a
technical standpoint what does technical
for chat bot really mean the the sorry
one the key for a successful rollout of
the chat bot right and is you know most
of you seeing it tries to mimic human
interaction okay that's great but a
successful chat bot doesn't mean that
it's the most friendly chat well it
should be friendly I guess but it's just
say please but but most successful one
are the one that most accurately predict
what user actually wants to do and also
the conversation design such a way that
allows the end user to get to what they
need in the quickest way right so
they're all kind of related as well so
meaning that if someone can ask a
question
containing all of the attributes that
they may be asking so for example if I
want to ask for you know what is my you
will see this demo in five o'clock what
is my account balance right well anyone
most of us has multiple type accounts
bank account so it could be checking it
could be savings and so forth right so
then the question is you know are you
then a more efficient way for someone to
ask the question is what is my checking
account balance right and then the then
I must design the bot to be able to
understand that so one of the things
that I think similar to sort of the
technical analytics information that
we're gathering for mobile the technical
analytical information for bot is how
effectively are you actually deciphering
what user wanted and how fast they can
get to get to the answer so similar to
the number of clicks in the mobile
application right the number of
sentences you you need to ask before you
get to a certain point so that's that's
one attribute I think for analytics
that's important to for Chapel to
understand how quick words that someone
has to speak to to get to what they need
the second thing is accuracy so how do
you gather user input to say well I
asked for checking account of balance
but you're asking me if I want to do a
transaction you misunderstood what I'm
saying so how do you provide that type
of input back into system that's also
something that these type of analytics
and syndication that you want to capture
from a bot you want to be able to take
that and be able to provide a mechanism
to let user say oh you know what this is
you know so after is a very typical way
of designing your bot is after someone
you gave them the debauch gave someone a
reply give user a chance to provide
input and say you know what this is not
what I'm asking for so you know I can as
a body I can ask you know this
is this what you're asking for and then
and then we'll capture that interaction
then provided in analytics form to the
two of the developers a developer can
then adjust the input and also capture
what user actually typed in so you can
add that example into the into how you
train the bot again we'll go into more
that I'm going to maybe we should have
flipped the two sessions the bot first
and then this one first and then second
but anyway so that that's part of the
analytics now the other now the
interesting aspect of also of leveraging
analytics to capture bot feedback is
that it gives the developer and chance
to analyze the pattern of whether
something is not being recognized then
train the bot based on that rather than
give user and user ability to do that so
there are actually systems and there's
some early attempt there's actually
another company that have created the
bot I'm not going to mention who they
are that actually quite cleverly and we
can do that as well to do automated self
learning basically give the user ability
to to say oh is this what you're asking
for
no okay so what do you actually mean oh
I mean that okay the capture that and
then that feedback automatically goes
back to the to the bat bot knowledge
base and so next time the user Askia
that that question is able to learn from
that that's great now the problem is
that as you know this is actually a
actual example is it's very then easy
for any user to skew the bot right you
could just you know you can just imagine
any user whether it's malicious were
just some teenager you know getting
bored can just say oh you know want to
make a could easily change the sentence
and change meaning of how a sentence
could be interpreted
into something completely different you
know the I could be saying I want to see
my transactions but I would every time
that you shows me transaction I'm going
to tell the pod no I don't want to see
transaction awhile I want to actually
pay pay my credit card company right and
after enough times that you keep
training it if there's a automated
feedback loop it's going to remember
that so it actually did happen with them
with one other things so that kind of
calls out to some of the best practice
how you want to look at doing analytics
for a bot it's a still relatively new
area but that's that's one aspect for I
would say a technical aspect for
forgetting analytics for pod the more
business side of it I think that's more
similar to what a mobile application
typically would need you know you were
still as you a bond helps the end-user
to execute some business transactions
you still want to capture these
statistics into the system and then to
be able to do the next level analysis
okay so let me just give you a quick
example of really hard to see let me see
if I can do a duplicate
okay good all right so on to an example
of and this is what work owes mobile
cloud serves homepage looks like right
there are some key functionalities here
some of the functionalities are geared
toward developers looking at gathering
basic analytics information on the
application itself so for example I can
go to this thing called mobile backend
it's a funny name but just think of
mobile backend as a mobile application
just your one the mobile application
project for example you have an
e-commerce application okay you have a
mobile backend for e-commerce
application you can go into that
back-end and open it one of the first
thing we'll show you is a diagnostic
screen right so so for example I can
look at something I was doing earlier
the resolution isn't very good okay I
can see that for example there are a
couple requests that had returned HTTP
400-500 error right so so what these
things are is these captures all of the
API calls from mobile application to the
back-end system in the back-end system
returns 400 and 500 then is going to log
that and then you can drill into the 500
error and look at the response time and
context what API it is actually calling
message level when the status and so
forth but also has a correlation ID so
it is one of the things is unique to all
the work organizations that unique to
Oracle product all the work about it's
actually prevalent in all Oracle's
product is this correlation ID and so
this correlation ID goes all the way
down to our database layer so let's say
for example mobile application calls
Oracle mobile cloud service then in term
call some Oracle let say e-business
suite application and that calls the
database that call will all have the
same correlation ID right so this shows
you from a technical you know as an end
developer you have an opportunity of
being able to trace the call to an
entire stack okay let's see some of the
other things that think one to show is
well and also the number of you can also
look at the entire log and that just
gives you all of the requests going
through the system again you can pick
out the ones that you want to to look at
and analyze that as well as the health
right so if you're getting a lot of HTTP
errors then well actually from here you
can basically look at the number of
errors if you're getting reports for for
example from end users you know they're
getting no no results from their queries
or and things like that you can very
quickly come into the into the admin UI
and look at the error count and drill
into the detail so again this is the
type of data that a developer would
appreciate right be able to help them
debug the application and also look at
the overall application performance now
moving on to someone who's a little bit
more business minded and administrator
right so if we look at the one of the
things first thing that administrator
would want to see is basically where
these users are logged in front right so
we have some and this is something that
mobile platform and mobile you know and
mobile application should be able to
capture again there's something that
we're captured you know all of the
mobile application a good mobile
application platform should be able to
allow the and mobile application to
capture and then feed into this type of
location data this is very useful for
example to look at let's say if for
example a user in particular region the
world that say Japan is generally not
login or using the application then you
can home in on exactly what happened in
the in the region and maybe with the
translation of localization service
really didn't work in that region this
also allows you to look at the active
user accounts things like that going
down to next next level is I can also
look at a macro level the number of API
calls so this will tell you whether
users actually using the application
again this is something that all of the
good mobile platforms should be able to
allow you to do is not only look at the
number API calls and this is a demo
instance so it doesn't have a lot of
data but does tell you on or the day
looks like and if I expand the horizon a
little bit this is a yellow lines
particularly is particularly interest
because it will actually tell you the
response times for the API right so if
the user is so that allows you to
actually monitor this and then
proactively work and find out whether
there are some performance issues in
your stack for example to connect into
back-end application and services so I
can also narrow down to a specific
mobile application and API call now
moving on to from a more technical
technical sort of sub M analysis type of
information to more business type
analysis again any good mobile platform
will allow you to define these custom
business event right they allow you to
instrument mobile application to capture
statistics that are important for for
that mobile user so let's take an
example of a very simple fill service
application right
and for fuel service application it's
all about tracking the progress for a
service request or work order we'll have
you want to call it right so the work
order service clip may have a status for
orders accepted order dispatch anjo
rejected and resolved right so all of
these events are instrumented in the
mobile application and these are sent in
batches to the mobile platform as events
then once they're sent to the platform
as events then we'll be able to use the
features of the platform to look at the
information so I can see that there's a
trending down on the number of a work
order dispatched this past week right
and then it helped me to kind of hone in
to what's going on you can see clearly
trend down then is something that then
you can say okay if the the work work
order dispatch is going down reserve
problem with that the number of
technicians are able to receive the
request or is it just the work orders
are getting larger and larger and taking
longer to to work on and I can also look
at other statistics and maybe this is
what's tell me what's going on maybe the
work orders on a hold or maybe some of
those are rejected and you can see the
different trend you can also do the next
level analysis of what we call funnel
analysis a funnel is a best way to think
of a funnel chart is it helps you to
plot out a stages of a business process
as a funnel so for example I can compare
the number of order work order dispatch
okay great
all of our dispatch versus the one that
are rejected versus one that are
resolved and so forth and that's bad
news nothing is getting resolved and I
better find out what the heck is going
on and then I can click on a particular
funnel and then drill into exactly what
the
the number of work order rejected for
each week right so this helps me to look
at analyze the groups of data I can also
even start to a show for example the
breakdown of the work order rejected by
operating system I see that iOS is
particularly high so maybe my iOS
applications sucks
all right so I need to go and fix the
iOS application or I can look at
location right so and well this is
probably us based at beta but us is
particularly high but what about other
countries and there are some unknowns
you know maybe the application is not
working correctly so again a good
platform allows you to look at and slice
and dice these type of application data
not only in terms of these custom
business events but also these key
information that's important to a mobile
application okay so let's my promise is
going to be short so I better wrap up
all right so let me see okay these are
just different example of some
additional analytics that we're working
on so for example show me the user from
this particular zip code who add an item
worth $100 or more but did not purchase
app crush right so this helped me
identify which group of users that want
to go after in this particular region
right and an i/o to 100 they're really
Hill so probably want to get to probably
want to push for some high-end Gucci
bags or something to them hundred is
probably not enough it's probably a
thousand I get for that zip code right
again the the other thing also is
I don't know what was going on with this
yeah you can also do the next level of
funnel analysis again do follow me I
just show you some very simple funnel
analysis I've shown the different work
orders and then look at the user
location and things like that well what
if I want to go into more than just a
user location right maybe it's a group
of user based on demographics and so
forth another thing is to be able to do
kind of cohort or user retention so for
example see which of the users have
returned to use the application and
where are their backgrounds you can
break down the group of users based on
them their demographics and then find
out which group a user are more likely
to return to to use the system maybe it
could be a simple thing as a application
font
alright maybe there's a group of user
just likes that fun better than the
other okay there's just some of the
things that we were able to do I want to
show just one quick and talked about one
quick customer example and this is a
customer example they're based in Brazil
and it's a they're the largest parking
company in Brazil you know Sao Paulo is
a very large city like 1015 million
people and they all have a lot of cars
and parking is a problem so this is a
large parking African company and the in
Brazil and what they have done is they
build a mobile application based on the
platform that allows the their customer
to find parking pay for parking there's
a Electra concept electronic pocket that
they can low money on or even allow the
end-user to load up the to even open the
certain parking garages and one of the
things that they're able to leverage
analytics is be able to look at the
information capture from their mobile
application for example they introduced
this electronic wallet they're trying to
figure out where is the right amount
for default mount for the for the wallet
right so they set it to something like
let's see you know a thousand literal
very high and they think that user would
just load up the values and use the up
and then use it up gradually and then
what they found out is no one is using
default value all of them are using it
at a much lower 100 lira they just want
to load up enough to to use the system
so that tells the application developer
to set a different default this is a
very simple example but the type of
information that you can capture from
from leveraging analytics capability
from a mobile platform and to get these
type of insight okay so that's really it
and I want to talk about today just on
the links and information that you can
see from Oracle mobile just in the
quickly the three minutes that we have
any questions on kind of just a very
high-level again best practice around
analytics in a bit of an ad-hoc
discussion on chata
analytics any questions comment yeah
yeah
boy yeah Wow
that's a good question I think the can
chop out is such a Wild West and how
that plays into regulatory environment
is breath is really a new brand new
topic with mobile apps that are say
beginning to be a more more well
established standard right there's some
there's a concept of a mobile medical
device and there's a regulatory stand
around that for bots you know what type
of information are you capturing or the
privacy informations boy that's a good
question I am yeah I think the from that
perspective the biggest risk and I think
this is something that we can kind of
think about and there's some Bank and
we're working with some really banking
customers and this has come up is for a
lot of b2c scenarios and you know less
regulated it's perfectly okay to use
Facebook as a channel or social network
popular social number as a channel and
more regulatory environment these tent
these customer tend to build a custom
client so still use chat still use the
natural language processing to figure
out what people using but they build a
specific chat client with specific
certifications security to to make sure
that these interactions are not
intercepted you know I I want to imply
anything Facebook is getting intercepted
by some apparently of our whatever can
be intercepted but I won't go into but
but from a regulatory standpoint at
least when what we see you know banking
financial industry the customer tend to
go with a custom
chat client solution where they ensure
the application is you know fits into
the regulatory security compliant I
think that guy off the bat that's the
first thing I can think of as far as the
data captures concern that's still a bit
of Wild West as well right because from
chat bot one of the key attributes for a
avenge for the chat pod is to be able to
capture all the conversations so you can
improve the users experience so so you
know going back to the analytics for a
lot right you we can capture all the
conversations that the user would have
and then based on that someone can look
at it and say okay I want to improve
that but that's the privacy there's some
privacy implications with looking at all
the conversation and as well I don't
know there's any standard around that
maybe there is but just that someone
haven't thought about capture only not
capturing that information but certainly
from a client perspective I think that's
where most people are starting to kind
of clamp down on what they're using in
the regulatory environment so that's all
I can think Nick anything else
okay so come to the five o'clock session
and we'll make it more interesting and
most it will be mostly demos we're not
working we're not working all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
