you for being a part of this session as
well I know it's a fragment of the day
and you would have already exhausted
yourself from you know the number of
presentations that you would have gone
through and absorbed all of them so
let's hope you know we keep this
entertaining we keep this information I
know the very nature of this particular
presentation should make it interesting
it's about fashion it's about you know
how we can dress better and how we can
make the retailers smarter so we have
this product called dress aiya it's an
advanced analytics machine learning and
AI based solution that is for malls
retailers fashion brands and airports
and what it does is it helps them
understand what products can be shown to
which customer in real time it works
both online as well as in the
brick-and-mortar you know offline space
now it's a brick-and-mortar offline
space which is what we are primarily
targeting to give a bit of a context you
all can see these slides and that will
set the context of you know why we are
doing what we are doing you know a
mission as you would have seen is to
make sure that the brick-and-mortar
retailers are well equipped to handle
the onslaught of Amazon and help them
prevent getting Amazon and how do we do
it is what we'll cover in the following
slides so you can see very well the
current spate of retail you know these
three charts say it all is the
proportion of online purchases going up
do we understand that
clothing as a as a space is not very
amenable for you know for online buying
it's not so conducive as maybe a book or
music so there is some opportunity there
is some hope for all of fine retailers
and how we do it you know how do we make
sure that you know that they can not
just get consumed by the discount waffa
waffa you know which the likes of
Flipkart
or any other big ecommerce that he is
raging you know in the scenario but they
should be able to stand up and you know
and and hold on to what their strengths
are which is provide the touching feel
experience coupled with providing you
know a much much more superlative
customer experience now to enable this
you know there are three must-haves that
retailers need to have digital fluency
holds us the central role in here
equipping them with understanding the
customers behavior is paramount see what
the e-commerce players have is they are
able to they're able to track each and
every click of the customer and
understand the customers behavior look
at her purchase history
look at her click stream and are able to
provide some recommendations you know in
real time how accurate they are you know
that's a topic for another discussion
and what's the scope for further
improvement you know we can we can
always debate on that now once they are
equipped with digital fluency they
should be able to understand customer
who she is what she wants what her
preferences are and how can we serve
them better as she walks into the store
right because when the customer walks
into the store you know nothing about
her you don't know who's walked in what
she likes and how can she saw her better
if the retailers can be equipped to
provide this kind of you know assisted
recommendations client telling as you
call it you know then it would be a very
different experience both for the
customers and you know pretty beautiful
for the retailer's as well and once they
are equipped with information about
customer intelligence you know that is
needed then they would be able to
respond faster to the change in customer
demands the customers preferences change
if retailers can be made aware of what
the aggregate preferences of customers
are given any particular region then
they should be able to know what to
stock in which store and further on what
they should be manufacturing which has a
higher probability of you know flying of
shelves so this is the biggest problem
that customers have customers in the
store and you don't know who is who and
what they want anyways the biggest
problem is you know how do you drive the
traffic back into the stores so we'll
come to this and we spoke about this
customers today you know are accessing
your digital storefront through various
channels be it mobile be it the website
you know and through different devices
as well
they even shop off like so how do you
get a consistent view of the customer so
you are able to recognize that this is
she and this is what she wants
well now let's look at it from the
customer standpoint there are three F's
as we know it from a shoppers
perspective three problems find fit
flatter find is all about well you know
where can I find what I want is it in
that shop or is it in this you know with
this retailer that department store and
does it have that particular top or the
dress that I'm looking for
fit well it suit me you know how well
will it you know augment my my my style
my body shape and then you know how do i
what do i pair it with so how design
helps you know address these pain points
it all starts with understanding what
the customer is influenced by
understanding you know what she's
looking at understanding her the social
context capturing her stated and
unstated needs which is so much more
important understanding her body
proportions so you can find the match
between the different products that are
there and the you know the set of
customers who come in various you know
body shapes over a period of time we
built a rich product genome you know
which breaks down each comment into an
atomic-level into its attributes and
together you know this will construct
the complete garment so i'm talking
about features like not just the fabric
but what kind of fabric colors different
shades of colors prints what size of
friends what color of
prince what's location was a density you
know and how do they impact the customer
they are they up there hundreds of
attributes that we that we consider you
know sorry oops wrong button
yeah so essentially yeah so essentially
you know it starts with catering to the
digital first scenario starting with the
online journey ensuring that this
customer walks into the store build the
complete Universal profile data set of
the customer which goes beyond the
boundary of any particular retailer and
personalize the entire inventory in real
time the differentiator we have is that
that the algorithms work even if you do
not have any historical data about the
customer so you know you know nothing
about the customer on the fly can you
understand the customer now if you
recall that is exactly what used to
happen in the moment pop stores of
yesteryears and that's the whole magic
we want to recreate the malls the
department stores have grown in size big
enough not recognize you big enough not
to provide the the kind of exclusive
service that you want in in you know in
those you know in the golden era you
could walk into that moment pop store
the store owner would know you by name
would know what brand of cheese you like
and would have it stopped for you that's
the kind of interaction that's the kind
of experience we want to provide okay so
coming to the features we have we have
as very first one personalized
navigation and what it does is if a
retailer has a million customers we
create a million stores yeah each
customer can have her own unique store
which will have items that she wants to
see so you cut through the clutter you
don't see what you don't want to see you
have something in mind it should pop up
in front of you you don't need to even
type styling fit advisor and you know
that works for Apple that works for
jewelry and we have you know a bra fit
advisor so it's you know they're in the
laundry space as well an outfit build up
given each item
what do you pair it with what shoe
what accessories what outerwear what
bottom where the works and you know it
provides multiple options for you for
each one of you for each product and
then you know on the bi suite fund given
the deep level of customer intelligence
we have like I said you have attribute
level intelligence about each customer
you can leverage that to do one-to-one
marketing because you have you know
understanding of what the customer wants
and how she wants to be reached and you
can provide her content which is
contextually aware and which is relevant
for that customer and each customer and
demand planning insights like I
mentioned earlier you would help the
retailer understand what items can be
shown to WHO so we have a demo for you
which we can run through for the
personalized navigation so here you know
there's a typical you know app let's say
or a site of a retailer you browse
through all the different clothes one by
one until you reach a particular you
know dress that you are looking for the
other way is you know you can click on
your personalized navigation just like
it would be in a mom-and-pop store you
know you walk in they show you a few
items which is what we do we show you a
few items dresses here in this
particular case all you have to do is
let us know how well you like them or
don't like them so maybe we can fast
forward this you know it will run on for
some time because you know depending on
the garment of garments that we have in
here it could be anywhere from 10 to 15
which would take you you know maybe a
minute to to answer a minute or two but
this is to be done just once it's not
that each thing you decide to go
shopping will pop up these questions in
front of you it has done just once you
build your profile you are set each time
you go to the shop or any shop you will
have the entire inventory of that of
that shop in front of you on your
digital you know device so this is how
the profile is made and once it is made
you know you have a simple sign-up
process you know you enter your name
your email ID
your mobile number and there was an
additional question as well since you
know we were doing this particular app
for a certain retailer whether they are
the loyal members or not so once this is
done yeah you you sign up select the age
group and you sign up and lo and behold
you know from here on you will see your
personal closet now these are items that
you would want to see for you for
yourself so every time the retailer has
new seasons clothes you would see those
which really matter to you which you
would have a affinity for so that's how
you know it works and we can move on to
the style picks the fit advisor the styl
adviser and I request madula my head of
technology to walk us through that the
mic is not fitting me somehow so I'll
have to use this mic so so now coming to
the style pick spot so initially we
thought of all the preferences that a
customer wants or what she likes and
based on that we showed what you know
she would want to see but there are few
factors where we understand what what
would fit her better
what is her style what will look good on
her so this is one demo which shows
about the style picks again you go to
the app you click the style picks
here we ask few questions about the body
proportions so that we know what to will
suit a particular customer so very
simple questions and it they also have
images so you know it's easy to
understand we have given some
illustrations so based on that we show
them you know what would fit them better
and we also have some stars at the top
which shows them which is the best which
is OK which is average you know all
those so five star four star three star
so based on that they can do it and once
they have done this they can select a
particular category and look for that
particular category if they are looking
for tops or trousers or dresses they can
choose that category and go ahead and
then look at the inventory is that you
know when it comes to stipend times you
don't have anything in mind you know you
are open for the retailer to suggest
something for you so in this particular
case twenty seconds is what it takes to
make your your style advisory you know
profile once you have that you know six
questions is what we ask on some further
changes once you have that you'd be able
to see the entire inventory across
categories be it dresses via Top's
beards be it skirts you know as if not
we're doing it for women so I know
there's a majority of men in here but
you know we've every coming out with
with menswear personalization as well so
you know 20 seconds effort would yield
you know information to you about which
items would best suit you so I think
from here on we'll take you through case
study you know a quick case study of you
know what we've done with a large
department store these are you know some
images from that particular in a moment
now what we did was we set up a you know
a small you know 10 by 10 by 15 area
which was just outside the western wear
you know women's
room and we had this tablet and um you
know I know and a desktop in there any
customers you know who would spot us
would you know who'd come to us would
make their profile and they would be
able to see the entire inventory and you
know they could they could choose and
and buy from there on now one of the one
of the things that we'd like to
highlight is know the conversions so we
were able to drive about fifty to sixty
percent of you know conversions
improvement and and we were able to
influence twenty to thirty percent of
their incremental sales basket size
again you know went up by the same
percentage about fifty sixty percent
yeah so we are also you know working
with some top jewelry brands lingerie
plans and you know we are you know as we
speak exploring Europe you know and
another job fees as well
we have a partner dredge still effect in
there if we work through us siglo but of
course we are accelerating you know we
are being activated by Oracle and we
were finalists in some of the events
here is a second case study which you
know Madden orbit take us to South Asia
luxury laundry brand so we're we gave
them a fit advice and you know we advise
the customers to actually take the
measurements and then go for laundry so
we found that ninety percent of the
customers were satisfied with the fit
the advice that we provided because it
was not just the advice on what size but
what style they should go for so it also
had a lot many other factors which told
them what would suit them the best and
even ninety six percent of the customers
who used the solution bought those items
because they were right suggestions for
them so this way compared with those who
did not use a solution the conversion
rate was around forty two percent so
that is the the difference as you can
see in conversions sorry over to you
yeah okay so now we love
this again gives you a graphical
representation of you know the laundry
scale study so which is on based on the
customers and what styles with them so
most of we had made various bus profiles
based on our questions and our this
thing so based on that we found out that
25 percent of the customers fit in a
particular bus profile and so the
retailer knows what's - what to stock
more or what styles are best suited so
we also showed them a granular level of
each style that suits the customer or is
the best recommended one for the
customers so based on that you have a
granular graph as well here which tells
you the best suited style and which they
should be stocking in their shops more
yep so more yeah this again gives them
an insight of the sizes that they should
go for the more number of sizes that are
you know they're in their customers so
based on their customers they can stock
again those sizes or make those sizes
okay so quick least one quick again demo
on our jewelry application so here also
we suggest which jewelry suits whom so
we did get to know about the skin tone
or that by using these questions the
face shape what suits them
so yeah so once they have answered these
questions about it about their body
shapes and all they can choose a
category that they want to shop and then
they will see the most suited jewelry
for them so this is something we are
doing with our jewelry brand here in
Vancouver and they can like any of those
whichever they like they can heart it
using the red heart button this tells
about so once you heart it you can see
it in the cart and then you can go to
the cart and see what you have hearted
so what you have liked so the sales
executive there can get these items for
you and you can try it on if you want to
see a detailed description you can again
go to the detailed description page and
see the item but who is our technical
mentor at oracle so he is the recording
to you okay thank you guys the like I'm
from record start upload accelerator or
what we call Oscar you might be seeing
us outside here like we having a booth
and I think I interacted with a couple
of you folks here if you are startup
then you definitely need to talk to us
with me I have Pawan who is also program
manager upon so basically what I would
be like to talk is like I'm a cloud tech
mentor at or I could start up products
trade up this is the architecture that
this company desire who who's one of our
cohort selected teams and this the sort
of architecture they had in HD on Amazon
AWS what you can see here is they had a
bunch of Tomcat machines
with MongoDB initially and they were
running it on ec2 and they were actually
integrating with a couple of retailers
and news feeds and for a load balancing
or they were using H a proxy once again
open source solution and this is the
Alicia setup that they had on AWS as a
part of the program what we do is we
give startups a cloud credit worth of a
couple of thousands of dollars and then
we also guide them to migrate to a
record cloud can you support the next
slide yeah yeah here what we did was we
identified the blocks that we could
migrate from AWS
to Oracle cloud like you can see that
Tomcat MongoDB and whatever data backups
they were taking we just migrated wanted
to migrate we identified that we decided
with Ashish and that CTO offer decide
how they want to scale up fewer on the
line do they have an integration
strategy with any other product that we
did after that after they were selected
after a couple of months what we did was
we did the migration here this is what
you see the word I could cloud stacked
like we still use the same hecha proxy
or any one guys using a proxy or have
heard about it anyone is a super like
lot of people use like for those who
don't know like it's basically open
source project like you can have any the
next machine you install a a proxy and
you can have many other solutions
running it can have a round-robin League
of checking whether the machines are put
down if something is drawn it
automatically goes to another this
ensures that I will it is there so we
use which a proxy here this is once
again which was running on Oracle
compute what we call OCI
Oracle cloud infrastructure and the same
the Tomcat whatever they had its once
again running on Oracle compute
infrastructure they also had an option
of using Java cloud service which is in
the roadmap but right now they are not
done it
having said that they're using block
storage cloud storage and couple of
compute machines the MongoDB that they
were using on areas they also migrated
onto our Idol cloud and in terms of
paths platform as-a-service they're
using mice
to manage some of the data and the
latest thing in terms of analytics that
report has been analytics cloud it's
something very similar to data
visualization or DV cloud what we used
to call and they are using that for
analysis of data that they're getting
and this is how the bigger picture looks
like once they are migrated so I'm the
couple of things that they have in the
roadmap is they want to integrate with
IOT basically when they when they walk
into a store they want to do a facial
recognition or read an RFID or
do some sort of IOT related stuff so
that's what they are also trying to do
in the near future in terms of SAS the
marketing cloud service is something
that they are using and this is the
overall architecture looks like right
now and we'll be adding more components
so that as we proceed further
any questions on technology part of it
back to you ok so this is from the
business perspective like where each
data fits because business wants to know
what they own what retire owns
especially with the GDP are in Europe
they were real they are really sensitive
with the what customer data goes where
so this picture tells you about you know
what fits in the retailers space and
what is in with desire so though
retailer has the customer information
it's something that retailer keeps with
itself we just take a mobile number and
we just build the profile based on what
questions we ask so our customer data is
completely separate from the retailer as
long as they are happy to share the
loyalty data only then we take those
feeds and we probably use it for
marketing or you know marketing mailers
yeah and these are the various
components that we will be using for
doing the analytics so we use it with
our existing case studies also they
we get the customer profile the product
profile because we sell we tell them the
best styles the customers or you know
what they are looking for on what are
the trends and based on that they can
stock it or you know they can even ask
their product team to design it so these
are the various parameters that we have
so it has a result man managed product
sales info as well because after a
person has liked it whether though for
our customer purchased it or not is also
based on it so we also do some analysis
on that and give the you know invoice
value or what was the contribution of
desire to make that sale happen so yeah
so so far we have a retailer based
application where we want to integrate
with the retailer but we are looking for
doing is this is something in our future
that we want to do that we want to have
our own application desire application
such that a customer can log in with any
social media plugins or will be using so
that they can log in from Facebook
Twitter or you know any of those and
they can go to multiple retailers so the
suggestions that we give would be from
all the retailers not only from one
retailer so this will be a customer
centric app that we are looking for and
we will also be able to give them some
customer relevant marketing posts which
they can post on FB Instagram or any of
these social media sites because now
that we know the customer we know what
she likes we can obviously give them
though you know those marketing mailers
so probably somebody doesn't want to
know a particular item that has come in
so that mail won't go to that particular
customer because it's not in her area of
liking so based on that we give some
relevant marketing pose
this is for in-store experience yes
so it's more of a digital first strategy
that we have see what we know is that
70% of the you know customers have
already made a decision on what they
want to buy before the step into a store
which means our point of influence is
much before on the goal wherever they
are you know at home in the office which
is where we want to reach out to so it's
a digital first strategy you know which
would be aligned with the retailer's you
know own digital you know transformation
plan and you know we put along with them
reach out to them now this is a spurt
the other option that you know that I
was talking about where we would also
continue with that same digital first
strategy where we will have a presence
you know and and be there when the
customer wants us because our goal is to
influence erm at the origin of a
perception of need you know so
understand when she wants something and
be their influencer and then drive her
to to the nearest store yeah because we
see opportunity in that you know when we
when we work with retailers that we show
on her app would be in store inventory
so she would know which store to walk
into to see what she wants
and I think loudest
yeah so it has an analytics cloud there
so here we have the R for MLA I all of
that that's right that's right
it's again online mark no online store
and will provide that why would be deny
you know a sale when it has to happen
but you know what is important is that
we need to have Cygnus
there are various categories and various
price points of items where customers
may want to have the touch and feel and
feel that exclusive experience they may
want to you know like as for the latest
insights that we have from Gartner you
know what they say is that click and
Collect is something which customers
really would want we provide that
opportunity as well you know they could
add any of these items to their to their
cart to the wishlist they can decide
when they would want to pick it up from
the store and bit store and you have all
of these you know sort of you know
retailers who are with us they need to
they need to walk in into the store if
they have to collect it that's right
okay that's right because then you are
promoting more of cross-sell and upsell
for the retailer as well there is an
opportunity for the for the retailer to
provide some client dating service right
so exactly yeah so we mentioned about
the outfit builder and outfit advisory
so there is you know more opportunity
for you know for increasing the cross
sales as well shall we move on to the
next slides or there are more questions
at this stage we are happy to take
questions as you you know as we move
along you can keep it interactive so you
covered this or you are to cover this
you to come okay so we have some more
plans or with IOT and mobile services
like having some Bluetooth beacons near
the shop where it runs on non low
Bluetooth energy so when whoever has our
app will get a push notification which
says that you know whatever you like is
there inside the shop you can just walk
in so there was kind of notifications or
if a customer wants some assistance from
the Clio retailer executive what we have
planned for treasurer is when the
customer gets a push notification she is
also asked
she wants assistance if she says yes
then retailer executive will log into
her part of the application and look at
the customers preferences and present
those items to the customer so that
customer can easily get the what she
wants and can move out as well faster if
she's in hurry so we also have RFID
detection plan where we'll be issuing a
desire card which would have a ref ID
chip and the RFID readers can be you
know installed in the entrance at the
entrance
so whenever the customer comes in we
will have to write a program which reads
the RFID data and we come to know that a
particular customer has entered and the
treasurer assistant can then walk to the
customer and help the customer in her
journey geofencing again one or one of
the services that is there so where we
again give the boundary of the shop and
if the customer is around she gets a
notification again she is asked whether
she wants assistance we are not giving a
compulsive assistance because sometimes
people don't want it so they might just
feel spooked that you know everybody
every time I go past this shop they ask
me for assistance
so if only if she opts for it she gets
it and we are doing a POC for face
recognition as well using computer
vision open CV so we are in a process of
building that POC where we it's actually
a plan when a person has a mobile with
no Bluetooth on probably has forgotten
her God has you know doesn't have her
GPS on but obviously has her face there
so yeah so we just do the image
recognition and find out you know who
has come in and we know the customer
okay all right so you know then we come
to this next section where we talk about
you know how we are applying some of the
machine learning and AI stuff into doing
what we are doing
so as you know you know you could it's
important first of all you know to make
sure that you that you do all of these
it's not that you know you pick up some
particular algorithm and and start
working on it it's important to keep
experiment experimenting with multiple
algorithms depending on the kind of data
that you have depending on the you know
the volume of data that you have
depending on the kind you know the way
the outliers get treated and depending
on you know how much of an or fitting
you know problem you would want to solve
now of course you know if using using
unsupervised learning methods you know
which essentially are around either
clustering or dimensionality reduction
we've tried all of these methods you
know to understand which is the one that
gives us the most accurate output so we
use you know all of these that you've
mentioned here right from you know using
Gaussian mixture model to you know SVD
or or all factor analysis know or or
even you know the k mode given the fact
that it's more of a discrete data
categorical data that we have to deal
with and then of course you know when
you look at the supervised learning
methods that we've used right from nave
buys not to logistic regressions and you
know using bagging and random forests in
all just to understand the you know
underlying pattern in the data you know
and and then you know we've also looked
at like I said you know all of the
combinations even Kate or or or enn and
then there are some others which are
planned once we are able to build a lot
of you know data points because you know
you need for each customer see our goal
is to be able to predict what each
customer should be recommended now that
means you need to generate a lot of you
know sort of let's say images construct
a lot of wise if you will for each
customer and that needs a lot of deep
learning so you know obviously we would
go to a combination of ganon you know
and and and discriminative you know sort
of combination which is where you know
we would be launching the next phase you
know once we understood all of these
different you know attribute you know
construct it which is where we'll use a
combination to
reach out to multiple customers you know
at the next level I you know I mentioned
about the product genome now just to
provide you an insight into the extent
to which we are going yeah so you know
we collect information around hundreds
of attributes and the various sub
attributes so like I said you know if
you're looking at you're not just
looking at color or fabric of fabric
luster or the way the garment drapes you
know or the hemline length or the type
of hemline or the type of sleeve or the
length of sleeves you know so there are
a whole host of you know attributes that
we look at a postulate of list of
witches over here but if you look drill
down at at each of these you know
attributes and you would see it blows
into you know blows up into multiple
levels as well for example silhouette
you know you could look at shift and
sheet and you know a line skater
empire-waist whatever you know so they
are there are dozens there as well and
within each of these there's another
layer of complexity which is around all
the other attributes and the interaction
with them you know so if you look at a
particular shift you have then look at
you know the different body types and
and what it you know augments and you
also look at the interplay of patterns
for instance you know so what kind of
patterns would go well with with each of
these other attributes and see if there
is any confounding effect you know then
if you look at the other side of the
equation which is the customer profile
so here we collect all of this
information rights you know from the age
group to the location height you know
her stated preferences her unstated
preferences as well you know because we
continue to do the implicit tracking as
well you know and you know while we are
more gung-ho about and and we promote
the explicit preference profile
mechanism which is we capture the
information on the fly about what the
customer wants to let us know about her
you know so we are gdpr compliant you
know given the fact that we are you know
also working in Europe you know with our
sales partner so we want to make sure
that every information about the
customer that we collect is compliant to
the GDP our norm and the customer has a
right to be forgotten as well so that is
why you know we are much
more you know much more aggressive and
much more gung-ho about the explicit
preference profile mechanism that we use
now here are you know some examples of
some of the tests output you know that
we that we are done now we try to do
this in a constrained environment given
the fact that you know you could come
out with much better results if you had
like hundreds of thousands of items but
if you have a constraint a forced
constraint item environment which means
in a given scenario you know a customer
walks into a store and there are no more
than let's say 300 race items how can
take algorithm find you know and
optimize on some of the best suited
garments for her so you know let's say
if if if this is the clickstream
information that we are collecting so
the customer is browsing through and she
has made these particular clicks she's
looked at each of these items now there
is a certain pattern in here given those
hundreds of attributes that are
collected in the background okay so now
let's you know if you look at the top
five personalized items that would
appear now there is a certain certain
pattern in there you know so there was
there were some bright clothes you know
there was some kind of a silhouette you
know there was a kind of pattern
actually not much of it you know you
could see only at the bottom on the
fringes and then maybe there's a
waistband you know and then there's a
kind of sleeve and a hemline type so all
of those get taken accounted for and
here is the outcome as we had seen you
know using this implicit methodology
which means you know even if even as the
customer is browsing we should be on the
fly being able to personalize the entire
store for her and she should be able to
see not just you know top 10 recommended
items if there are like 10,000 items we
should be able to show her all 10,000
items she browses through them you know
in that in her preferred order this is
the next five set of items you know
there's a certain pattern in there you
know which here is you know you know we
didn't want to we didn't we don't see
what we wanted to there are some prints
in here as well but then this is a
constrained environment like I said you
know there aren't too many items in
there you know so we the database that
we had taken
just about 300 just to demonstrate you
know that the the whole algorithm could
work even in this constrained
environment you know here is the next
five you know so there are some sheets
coming in as well now this is another
method you know where we look at the
historical and the current context of
the customer so the customers
information could reveal that she's
bought a certain I'd you know certain
set of items these are her current
clicks you know when she's visiting the
site today she's looked at these
particular items but then we know that
she has had looked at for example you
know on these particular historical
items now how do we know which are the
ones that we should be presenting to her
so here are again in the top five on the
user's product list page you know as you
can see there are some if you look at
the current clicks she's looking at
dresses you know which are either black
or white have some abstract print you
know some bold prints and the silver
TIFF you can see the shape you know is
somewhat more form-fitting so which is
what you know it takes into recognition
here there is a different sort of a
plain you know in here there are more
bright colors you know it's again black
there are no not much of patterns in
here so which is what it takes into in
two copies ins and presents the top five
items you know which are more
form-fitting which are black or white
you know have some patterns in here you
know you would see some bold patterns as
well as we move on so there are some
prints in here you know again
form-fitting achromatic here are some
other bold fonts you know which have
bold prints which have come up so these
are all on the first page itself you
know which shows the top 20 or 25 items
made her propensity to click and buy one
of these items really goes up you know
so this is what we wanted to do to show
to you about how our algorithms are
working now you know as you scroll down
you know let's say there are some three
pages the mid page would have items like
these which definitely have some some
prints you know and there are these are
not as you know probable for the
customer to pick them up and here are
the last ones the bottom ones so as you
can see the whole profile
of the clothes in here which are
presented to her at the bottom you know
is is actually not suitable given what
she is browsing but then it will learn
based on you know the clicks and correct
itself because if she clicks on any of
these which means you know there are
some faults you know some some false
positives here as well no which is what
you know we can begin correct and then
there is okay yeah I'm sorry I didn't
get you is this part of a recommendation
to the customer which is based on the
classification algorithm on machine
learning yeah so so classification
algorithm is part of machine learning
itself yeah that's right that's right so
this is you know essentially you know
around the personalized navigation here
the fit element does not come into play
that is that is a separate feature here
I was demonstrating about you know how
you know a personalization can be
provided on the fly when we have some
current information about her when we
can leverage the historical data as well
or a current clicks this is implicit
what we had demonstrated on the width
through the video was not none of this
right because that in that we are
engaging the customer we asked her to
look at some items and provide her
preferences on each of those yeah so the
two methods work very differently thank
you and and here again you know if let's
say if she selected this particular item
then which are the top similar items for
her now again this is again a
constrained environment so you know it
recognizes that it's a maxi length you
know in here but you know there are
there are some similarities in terms of
if you can see the neckline it's deep
you know it's you know there's a hemline
is you know till it's it's more but in
there it recognizes that there aren't
down to many such items but you know
these come close to hold the customers
attention here are some more you know so
again let's say if this is the kind of
garment that you select then here are
the similar items now you would see of
see some whites in here as well because
of our research and understanding that
the blacks and whites typically a
chromatics you know go hand in hand so
we know these can be shown together
similarly you know there are some more
if you if you notice you know the one
over here is pretty much and you know
skater dress and the top three items
even this gets figured out probably the
same model as well maybe the the
algorithm is recognizing the model two
again you know here it's got a different
sort of you know you know a fall and you
know if you can see the algorithm
recognizes that the top half has a
different play you know to the up to the
entire feel of the garment and this is
what it could it could get you know
closest to this one has a sort of a
similar but not much resemblance to the
previous one but then these are working
in a in a constrained environment here
there are you know it's it's a printed
body hugging sort of item and you've got
a similar one you know over there and
most of these you know are are pretty
much similar in terms of the other
attributes well so that's all we had and
we'd be happy to to take more questions
if you will
yeah so that's you know so we've used a
lot of our own proprietary algorithms so
you know especially the knowledge that
we that we bring in in understanding and
deconstruct deconstructing the entire
government comes from us you know so we
tied up with NIFT and you know be
ourselves picked up this this particular
field and we're not just picking up some
algorithms from the library because that
can be very easily copied okay suppose
startup is a personalization framework
in showing it in the website no let us
let's say food or some some completely
different domain and there is some
algorithm deciding what is first what is
matching the matching part is separate
once you know what is closer how to
display it how to bring the top ones in
the front and not so relevant towards
the middle and the ones in the back yeah
that part of it did you build that
that's why from scratch that's right
that's from scratch so we have a ranking
mechanism for all the items like I said
if there are a million items we'll have
a score for each in every item and they
are it's like a Google Pagerank so you
know it's its it ranks pages but here we
rank the products every product has got
a certain number associated with it and
it's you know it's rank spotted in that
particular manner
yeah and it's broken down to the
different attributes as well so we know
the preferences for each item connected
to a customer and how the interplay
works so using this you know we can
construct what she may want to buy in
the future as well
it's per slice it's not a comment like
otherwise it wouldn't work if it's a
common ranking again they will end up
seeing the same thing all the customers
would see the same thing I'm sorry I
didn't get you much historical and
current trends yeah so it's yeah it's
it's it's based on you know some just
like you do forecasting you start off
you know it's as good as tossing a coin
you assign a fifty forty with let's say
vintage and then as you as you progress
you adjust theories
yes it no it's not it wouldn't work if
it's fixed because it has to be dynamic
and then if it has to keep learning
sorry are you done with the question
what you had more pricing okay pretty
good question
you know if the retailer wants it yes
because one of our options that we
provide is you know optimizing on the
price front and I'll give you a give you
an example there is a certain retailer
in Europe that we are trying to work
with what they do is you know they sell
unsold garments unsold inventory of the
top brands now so you have an Armani
Armani and they couldn't you know sell
it sell certain pieces of comment now
they sort of stock those items and you
know if they have a digital storefront
and you know you can buy from there the
model works in in in a manner that you
could provide the advisory service to
them saying that these particular items
you know while you have marked them down
by 50% perhaps have users who could have
bought them at full price so you save
dollars for them so optimal pricing to
answer your question yes that's
definitely in a you know needed but not
to the extent which a certain retailer
had done and got beating you know
because customers started complaining
hey given my profile you know that I am
rich and you know you are pricing me
higher no got that so I won't don't want
to take names but
mentioned stitch no okay yeah so so well
you know there is another model that we
are working on but you know I know it's
it's in the in the pilot stage so
without you know spending too much time
on it what I would say is we provide
this option for the customer also to be
able to build to be able to you know
tell us what they want and we and we and
we build the pricing accordingly
you know so that's thanks for bringing
that out so that's another thing that we
you know customer centric you know
everything from the customer side you're
not sort of you know playing games with
the customer that is precisely what we
want that's one of our modules as well
and that is what we want to do so in our
demand planning insight module currently
what we do is there is an aggregate set
of customers and we understand their
behaviors we understand what they want
you take all that information together
and say hey you know given these set of
customers that you currently have here
are their preferences here is what the
aggregate set of customers would want
and here is what you are buying you know
in the yeah so in the case study that
medulla presented on the lingerie brand
that's exactly you know what we have in
the brand in in that slide the given the
customers you know who who took the fit
test here is the set of you know items
products Eskie use that that that they
you know would want and here is what you
know you have in stock so here is an
opportunity for you to correct right so
you can have you can have an
understanding of what is the universal
preference score for a particular
customer and a product and then you can
compare it with you know how it stacks
versus you know against what they
currently have so there is a scope for
improvement no and it provides them this
entire spectrum of visibility as to what
they have versus what they should be
making
because that's a blind spot for for them
they don't know what they don't know
okay
so then it's then it's purely random
you've got a 50% chance of you know
stumbling upon something that you want
yeah the best way is to test it and
we're not you know we've gone through
that process on the fly you know when we
have set up our booth and you know there
were retailers who said okay here are
some of our you know women colleagues
let's run this test pass them and see
how well it works
so to go to an example you know no I
didn't get this last part I get your
point yes yes and that's how it works
we don't have that in the demo right we
have it in the slide okay so the very
first screen the customer sees is how
you know how they would want to choose
the inventory level store level City
level or pan country so when you choose
store level your closet would show items
only from that store if you choose pan
you know city across the city then let's
say if you are in lifestyle you would be
able to see all the inventory suited for
you across our lifestyle stores in the
city let's say you said you're standing
you know at hundred feet
that's our option being the you know the
model that we have know coming up so if
you are at 100 feet Road in there
another it will build your personal
closet out of let's say all fashion
shops within a mile radius and it will
help you know which particular shop to
walk into and you know and get what you
are looking for but yes you know what's
important is to show them an endless
aisle to choose from rather than
restrict themselves to you know smaller
inventory items
different colors okay so wouldn't it be
better like if you can give a single
colors yes we fold we fold the
recommendations otherwise you know they
will have to scroll through so many
pages that we get boring yes we face
that because that's that's what the
algorithm would see they will bring all
the blacks together and then you know
it's a cumbersome process for her to
sift through so you fold all of that you
know and let us see only you know one of
its kind
so that's yes yes yes and there are
other factors also not just the color
but here the dominant factor is the
color because that's what you know the
customer wouldn't want to see there may
be changes to the shape of the fabric or
the pattern and that is fine you know so
you're right
that's how it works
I can't hear you sorry what data
visualization for the retailers so so
there are you know multiple levels of
visualization that they would be able to
see they would be able to see you know
at a at a customer level if they want
what are the what are the what is the
person closet for each customer they
would be able to see you know I'm moving
from you know button to you know to the
top level they would be able to see for
a store level what are the top products
which are suited to an aggregate set of
customers who you know who are who are
frequenting that store they would be
able to segment you know slice and dice
data this data based on their loyal
customers versus non loyal customers and
you know that was a good insight that we
could see when we when we were doing
this with one of the top retailers you
know the conversions for their non
loyalty customers was much higher it
jumped up by 183 percent compared to the
conversions that we had for loyal
customers so those are the kind of you
know insights that you can provide apart
from the product information you know
what they should stock what they should
buy what they should manufacture so all
of that information you know they they
would be able to have and then there is
a client tailing part as well right
so we mostly promote an opt-in filed
Madonna did touch upon you know all the
other stuff that we're trying to do
which looks cool since the fusion and
you know augmented reality for face
detection and you know the facial
recognition but what we are primarily
looking at is the customer opting in
voluntarily to let the retailer know
that she is in the store and she would
want to have an exclusive service once
she signs up you know in the store she
sees the entire inventory post nice for
her now that is the opportunity we use
to provide a client caring service as
well
which is you know there is a
notification to the retailer and from
the retailer you know to the appropriate
sales staff to be able to know who the
customer is what a prior history is what
kind of a profile she has demographic
you know psychosocial graphic all of
that along with her preferences for
clothes and the next best
action for her so all of this
information you know would be presented
to so that's that's another slice and I
see no piece of information that can be
leveraged in real time by the retailer
and we are using oracle DB if you are
interested in the that's a short
response to the big explanation I
provided but yes we're using record DV
for you know the various so any more
questions happy to take more questions
I'm sorry okay so you know with lingerie
there are eighteen across two and then
jewelry we are starting off with three
and that's where we are and you know we
are also doing a product genome
construction for a certain other you
know party so you know that would help
us you know train our you know our
algorithms is better yeah and once this
is done you know the opportunity to
scale is huge because the kind of
retailers brands that you know that we
we have they have like three thousand
plus you know multi brand outlets they
have tie ups with the national chain
stores you know which is 250 300 plus
and then their own you know exclusive
brand outlets which is around 15 to 20
so yeah the opportunity is huge
once the results are driven home well if
the outcome is any such indication there
should be
okay thank you so much probably there
was one more thing I want the shipment
moves from one store to another like the
same shipment suppose it's gets rejected
let's say let's say 50 50 pieces of some
some let's say some product ID okay they
go through first the merchandise the
exclusive thing outlet and then goes to
the next one then ups to the next one
you're getting me so how does it track
all here like suppose some product has a
low conversion ratio so let's say I move
from this outlet to the next outlet so
that the next outlet will have its own
customer you know customers I get and
they should have its own another pricing
another so is there any lat analytics
over that also and the conversion not
yet what you're talking about is a is a
beautiful problem to solve in the next
step is well you know when we get deeply
integrated with the retailer as of now
the best that we can do is the current
set of retailers that we are talking to
you know what they've agreed upon is to
provide a data feed refresh every five
minutes so it's up to them to help us
understand what is the stock status of
each of their sk use then and that's
what will have to take but we cannot
really go in and behind the scenes and
and and work to you know to to make
visible their inventory which is in
transit and at a different stages that's
a different problem to solve and that
would in a way deviate does as well from
our core which is of you know providing
recommendations we'll see when we get
there okay
are we done any more questions thank you
thank you so much thank you so much for
that wonderful audience you've been
thanks for the questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
