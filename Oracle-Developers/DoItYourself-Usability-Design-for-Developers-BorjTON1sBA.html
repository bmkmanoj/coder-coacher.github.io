many people here I really didn't
expected considering that this is the
very last session I thought I'd be
sitting here with five people at max but
usability is important it seems I'm glad
about that ok let's start ok when
quicken came out in the 80s there were
about 46 other application which allows
you to do your taxes just to do is just
two years later quicken was the number
one tool for doing taxes for small
businesses when the ipod came out there
were hundreds of multi I mean of mobile
music players first they didn't do work
very well but once you were able to use
the output with Windows it quickly
became the market leader and had more
than I more than seventy percent market
share and maybe more recent example the
nest which came on the market and it's
doing extremely well what we can see
here are three very different examples
we have an application for small
businesses we have a consumer device and
household device and all of them were
amazingly successful but what's
interesting about these three examples
is that none of them were the first all
of them established well I entered well
established markets the case of Quicken
already said it there were 46 some
applications like that available yeah
there were I don't know how many mp3
players and similar tools available when
the ipod came out so they were in the
first they didn't add any new
functionality whatever you could do with
these devices or this software you were
able to do already with um with products
from the competition and none of them
was cheaper than the competition in fact
for these two guys they were they are
much more expensive than the average
competition but what what all three of
them did far superior than the
competition was usability so we can see
usability is important it can determine
if your product succeeds or fails but
unfortunately only very few software
development teams are equipped with a
professional user design user experience
designer so what I want to get show you
in this talk is some techniques I
learned during my career that everybody
can use in the product even without any
prior knowledge without studying
usability to make your products more
usable and and hopefully than then also
more successful so my name is Michael
you can see my i have a blog which is
kind of not really being updated right
now but I'm changing that pretty soon
yes my twitter tag and a word for canoe
so can you is a company that's focused
on front-end development and not it's
not really specific to any technology
but it's more about really providing
good usability having nice design so in
other words delivering and use a
happiness so if you want some help with
these interfaces just give it a call but
that's enough of the marketing so let's
get to the content this talk is divided
into three parts first one to talk about
what usability is then I want to talk
about a good process for creating a user
interface and tools that you can use for
that and last but not least show you
some specific techniques that you can
use in your projects ok let's start
about to talk about usability there are
many definitions for usability out there
but lately one from Nielsen who is
probably the expert for usability design
for software usability design created a
definition that gets accepted by most
experts and it invites usability into
five categories
the first one is learnability that means
if you have a new user to a system how
long does it take him to accomplish the
first initial basic task Heaney's needs
to accomplish next one is efficiency now
we look at the experienced users how
Laden does it take an experienced user
to accomplish the more complex task his
daily work using the tool next is
memorability this depending on what
software you have can actually be the
most important factor in here we mean
that we look at an experienced user who
hasn't used your product for a while and
now it's coming back how long does it
take him to to accomplish certain tasks
so for to like an expense reports this
is really crucial because most employees
will do that expense reports maybe once
or twice a year and so they have to kind
of relearn it every time when they use
it and in that case memorability is
really a crucial factor um one thing
certainly this error is errors we have
to look at how many errors does a user
make and how long does it take him to
recover so the second part is also very
important it's not just about avoiding
errors but once the user doesn't error
is it possible at all and how long does
it take him to recover from that error
and the large part is satisfaction and
that's actually the part why or the one
part which makes it so interesting for
me so it's not just about you know
efficiency making people more productive
but it's also about making them feel
good while doing this so that's the key
factor for me while I like to to create
user interfaces now in theory we could
stop this talk right now you know what
usability means you know how to measure
it so in these cases you could just do
tests and measure how long it takes
people to do certain task and then you
just watch over time if you if the time
decreases and for this one you just can
do it surveys and you can see if the
user get get happier while you while you
optimize your product
unfortunately it's not so easy and the
reason for my opinion is why this is is
what's called the curse of knowledge now
that's that concept sounds kind of weird
when you first hear it right knowledge
that's usually something good I mean
that's something you want to achieve how
can that be you curse and the idea
behind that is once you know something
you're cursed because you cannot imagine
any more what it was like to not know
you can see that every time when for
example a student of Java comes to you
and ask a question about Java how hard
it is to explain an expected to answer
the question to him you don't want to
overload him with all the stuff you know
but you want to certainly honest the
question correctly and what you want to
want to make sure that he understands
but this is it is tremendously hard as
all of you have experienced I bet
there's an interesting experiment that
was done there are two people one is
giving a list of songs popular songs
which they are supposed to tap and then
there's a second person who's supposed
to guess which song that was so here we
create this set up again we have one
person with the whole knowledge and
there is another person without the
knowledge and by just allowing the the
person with the knowledge to tap the
song we limit it that's we limit the
knowledge that he can cheer so what was
interesting about this experiment is the
people who were tapping the songs were
asked what they guess how many people
would be able to to guess the song
correctly and the answer was about fifty
percent maybe I mean this already
popular and famous songs like happy
birthday knew some people song things
like that but when the experiment was
done it turned out only 2.5 percent of
the persons were able to guess the songs
by tapping it so what we can see is
first of all guessing a song
by hearing the taps this is tremendously
hard what was even more interesting is
how how big the gap is between what we
when we try to deliver a message that we
bring it across versus how often we
actually get it across when you think
about this in numbers imagine you're
standing in a class of 40 students
somebody asks a question you answer it
and you think about half of them would
understand it but in fact it's just one
student in this whole class of 40
students so the gap is huge with
usability design it's a very similar
situation because you're sitting in
front of you use interface for weeks for
months you know every button by its
first name you know exactly if you want
to execute a certain functionality you
need to click on that menu click that
set menu set up a certain configuration
press the button and you're done takes
less than 10 seconds but when the user
comes and sees your user interface for
the first time he probably doesn't even
know that he has to click the menu so
and he gets stuck so the problem is you
cannot really see your own user
interface from the eyes of yours users
and I will show you a little later how
we can overcome this gap but first let's
talk a little bit about process and
tools so what does a typical process to
create a new user interface look like
you sit together with your your
customers your clients and you write
down the requirements the specs for use
interface after that you go to you ide
you write some some mock up some some
wireframes takes you a couple of days
maybe one or two weeks you send that
around you get feedback you keep
tweaking and optimizing it until
everybody's satisfied but this is that
really the best approach for this
creating a user interface is a
tremendously hard and creative task so
we should look at other professions how
they do go about creating
new things so let's take a look at
painters so when Michelangelo created
this painting do you think he created
his first pick painting and then he
gathered feedback and kept tweaking and
optimizing it to him until he was done
probably not what he did was he created
sketches and drafts he tried different
ways how you can draw at the toe he was
studying the the body posture of the
main figure and just only when he was
really sure what he wanted to do he
actually started the painting and we
should take the same approach when we do
use interfaces when we talk about the
user but the process for created user
interface I want you to remember two
curves the first one is complexity when
we start with our user interface we
should start very simple with sketches
similar to Michelangelo when he did his
sketches for the painting and over the
curse once we know what we want to do we
should add the complexity the other
curve I want to you you to remember is
well parl ism maybe it's not the right
word but what I mean by that is the
number of alternative solutions you're
working on at the same time and you
should start with many solutions and
many alternatives in the beginning and
reduce them during the course of your of
your project and why is that well there
was an interesting experiment done very
close to here actually in Stanford there
was a class of design students who were
given the task to create a web ad banner
for using for advertisement in the
internet and they had a whole semester
to create this hole at this banner and
this class was divided into two groups
one group was forced to work in a
sequential mode and one group was first
forced toward in a parallel mode so the
group forced work in the sequential mode
created a draft gave it to the teacher
got some feedback
created a new draft gave it to the
teacher and so on until they created the
final draft which they gave to the
teacher the group working the perla mode
had to create three different drafts at
the same time and they had to turn in
all three at once then they got feedback
for those three drafts created two new
two new ones again turned the men
created I got feedback and then they
created the final one and the whole
experiment was set up in a way that all
of the students would get roughly the
same amount of feedback and would also
create the native the same amount of
drafts or the same number of drafts and
then the results were given to a group
of experts and it turned out the group
work in the pearl mode got far better
grades than the one work in sequential
mode but this isn't really a good proof
but what they did after that they use
actually the banners 22 in the web and
link them to web pages and we're
tracking them and compare the results
and again the group work in the parallel
mode I'll perform the one working
sequential mode by far not only did they
get more clicks but also the people
stayed longer on the page which means
they they also got more of the right
people to that website so the
researchers try to figure out or to try
to find reasons why that is and they
mainly found two reasons for that if you
have if you're working on several
versions at the same time you can
already compare them and draw your
conclusions and improve each one of them
just by comparing them to the other ones
but the other one or the other reason
which is maybe even more important was
that you're not as attached to your work
when you work on several versions in pro
if you have to if you were just working
on a one draft and somebody criticizes
it you can easily take it personal you
know it's it's your baby you don't want
anybody to criticize it but if you work
on three versions in pillow and somebody
criticizes it you know it doesn't really
matter so much it you just take it for
what it is it is feedback for one of
your three
laughs but it's not a big issue so you
can actually incorporate feedback much
easier if you have several versions um
you work on in provo okay so what does
that mean for the software development
process when you start your project the
first thing you should do sketches I bet
everything is doing that already you
don't have to be able to to draw very
nicely I mean you can see I sucked
pretty much a drawing but you can
already see what this user interface is
supposed to look like what I what I want
to encourage you is to create as many
sketches as you can you can think of I
mean really a dozen to dozens if
possible a good technique I've found
which allow me allow you to do that is
called 568 for that technique you take a
sheet of paper and you divide it into
eight spaces of the same size and then
you set a clock to five minutes and then
you try to create or create six to eight
different sketches within these five
minutes so that's why it's called 568
five minutes six to eight sketches and
creativity is really interesting thing
whoa and for example when you put some
pressure on yourself on your brain you
become more creative suddenly I get bit
everybody who's worked on a deadline has
already experienced that right as long
as the deadline is far away you know you
don't really make any progress you don't
have any ideas but then when it comes
closer and actually feels like yeah
there's a deadline I have to do
something you suddenly become much more
productive you have new ideas and you're
getting into the flow now certainly
there is a point when there's too much
oppression right if the deadline is
tomorrow and you're not done yet you
know you get tunnel vision and you're
not creative at all anymore but some
other pressure really helps and this
technique takes advantage of that and
because these five minutes are just
artificial but they still help anyway so
here you can see an example where did
this for the application I was working
on right now and we're spare time or
have different creative different drafts
within these five
minutes for specific problem i had now
the interesting thing is none of these
sketches are usually a very useful right
I mean you just have seconds to create
them but you get lots of new ideas so
for example here you can see I was kind
of stuck with this idea to have one
overview and you can see in the back
there's some some so it's an application
where you can configure you could create
a presentation and first you start very
chaotic and then I wanted to you to zoom
to be able to zoom in and create some
sketches and I was kind of stuck
thinking about it you had this big view
for the one slide on to work on and the
overview can see almost everywhere
except here there's this one idea
whether with a slider and later when I
looked at this I thought this is
actually a cool idea and I switched and
moved the whole thing and created now
like a storyboard so it was like none of
these as I said normally sketches really
i use in the end but it gave me new
ideas and it gave me new insights ok
once you've done you have enough
sketches next thing you should do is a
paper prototype so um to show you what a
paper prototype it I think it's the
easiest to show it in action so there
are many videos on youtube or you can
see how prototypes work so proto oh wait
sorry you don't see that right um or is
my mouse no so how does a paper
prototype work well you create your
prototype on paper and you create all
the different screens and all the things
that you want to show and then there's a
second person who's playing the computer
so that people the person testing the
user interface uses types the buttons
here and then the other person plays the
computer and updates the screen let's
basic idea of how a paper prototype
works
okay and you can find many many examples
on youtube and on similar sites oh no no
okay I'm sorry about that can hardly see
it from here
okay so there we are okay so and the
great thing about a paper prototype is
you can create new or you can work with
new ideas extremely quickly right while
you're testing something and you get
yellow actually I need a dialog box here
you just draw it and you're done in five
seconds so it's it's extremely fast and
it can be very creative like in this
example here i'm using sticky notes
coated paper so you can draw something
on it but when you delete it I just wipe
it out you know everything that comes to
your mind you can use in a paper
prototype um and it's also a lot of fun
you know it's not like you're just so
just sitting in front of your computer
but you're suddenly able to work with
crayons and scissors again it's almost
like you're you're back in kindergarten
work which was probably your most
creative time in your whole life right
so I enjoy a lot and I use it like as
much as possible the next step would be
the low fidelity prototype the most know
the best known ones is probably the the
wireframe towards that you can use in
their tools for specific platforms of
general ones they are online towards
their tools you need to install some are
free some custom something it's just an
amazing amount of tools that is
available just try them out and see what
works best for you there is not really a
single best tool in my opinion it really
depends on the context on what you're
working on I don't want to go in too
much into detail because I assume most
people are familiar with those via
framing towards another option for a low
fidelity low fidelity prototype is
actually PowerPoint you can use
PowerPoint to create mockups and you can
even and make them interactive you can
select an element and then you can say
jump to another slide and this
new flight line shows the new state off
you use interface now this certainly
only works for very simple user
interfaces right because what you're
building here is a state machine there
were all different states in your user
interface um have to be modeled in a new
slide but for simple user interfaces and
especially once that or a wizard like a
PowerPoint is actually a valid option
the the interesting advantage of that is
that even non-technical people can use
it and modify it and and so you can use
it to work on it simultaneously like
that there may be not they may not be
able to use a wire framing tool but
they're definitely able to use
PowerPoint and the last option you have
is you can actually use your favorite
development environment to create your
low fidelity prototype but you have to
be very careful that it actually remains
a low fuel a low fidelity prototype so
you should just implement you know small
event handlers one or two lines whenever
you write anything else or your code
becomes longer than one or two lines you
should stop immediately and think about
it if you're still working on a low
fidelity prototype because it's still
about you know creating many or trying
different things out as fast as possible
to get the feedback quickly another
thing you should be aware of is that I
made the experience if you show
applications that look too perfect
people are kind of hesitant to give you
a really strong feedback let's say I
mean if the tool looks like it's almost
done nobody will tell you you know this
looks like crap start all over so and
this can happen if you use your favorite
tool so what I do is I change the
styling these cases so this is a gel
effects application so it's a full-grown
java application but i changed the CSS
style i removed or gradients and removed
our colors and use this fund which looks
kind of you know it's hand drawn and
when you do that you get much better
feedback
because this released it looks like
somebody just you know drew it in paper
quickly and personally I don't use low
fidelity prototype that much anymore
because for me they're still even though
it's simpler than really writing the
final application there's still kind of
cumbersome and there's always something
that I want to do that's not possible in
the tool I'm using at the point and I
get stuck and have to have to fight the
tool which I don't want I want to create
you know new ideas and new you know
feedback I want to incorporate that as
quickly as possible so I try to use the
paper prototype as long as possible and
keep this face as small as possible now
certainly there is one major drawback of
a paper prototype you cannot share it
remotely right if your team is
distributed in different locations or if
your client is in a different location
paper prototype doesn't work everybody
has to be in the same room so in that
case I actually I still use low fidelity
prototype otherwise actually not anymore
and the last step is the high fidelity
prototype so from a from usability
perspective it's not some not so
interesting anymore in my opinion
because at this stage the user usability
questions or you should be answered you
should have an idea what your user or
what you use interface should look like
so the high fidelity prototype in my
opinion is more about you know using the
platform you want to use for building
your application taking the wireframes
you created taking the graphical design
from the graphics designer that he
prepared and putting it all together and
see how these things work without
implementing too much functionality so
it's actually more of a proof of concept
than really a a tool that you can use
for usability testing so yeah there's
some one which doesn't show the right
design yet but this is some final design
for the application was working on so
going back to these two curves i showed
in the beginning i think now they make
much more sense right
you start i'm here with very simple
sketches but you create lots of them
dozens if possible next step our the
paper prototypes they're slightly more
complex and you create less of them but
you should try to have you know a couple
at least of paper prototypes because you
can create them still very quickly now
somewhere here's then the low fidelity
prototypes and that stage you usually
just have one or two versions you're
working on and you're experimenting with
different alternatives and the same is
true for the high fidelity prototype
here the complexity is already quite
high and you should only really try out
minor things and you shouldn't really
consider redesigning stuff at this stage
because you should have been honest
those questions on here now the ver
beginning at the very end you have the
final final product what you have just
one version of that and all the
complexity in it okay so let's look at
some techniques that you can use in your
project to create to improve usability
the first thing a usability designer
does is a field study that means going
out and watching your users doing the
task you want to create your your your
application for and there's no reason
why we as software developers cannot do
that right we should it's it sounds kind
of obvious but I'm always surprised how
often i talk to people who built some
applications have never seen their there
have never seen their users using the
user interface for example i've worked
in the bank until recently and there
were lots of people building software
for traders but these people have never
been on a trading floor I mean for me
this is hard to imagine how can you how
can anybody expect that you create a
good application for traders if you've
never seen traders doing their work but
that's actually very common nowadays
here's an example where I think
definitely that was never done any field
study this is a ticketing for machine
for the public transportation in Prague
where I used to live for 47 years what
you can see here are a bunch of buttons
there are numbers there seems to be
different between full price and you
know for kids and senior citizens maybe
there's a difference but you know
whenever I pass one of these machines
there was a group of tourists standing
in front of it and they had no clue
which button to press I mean this stuff
works great for people living in Prague
I mean like the fastest way you can you
can get your ticket right you just click
this button up here you pay and you're
done it takes you less than a minute to
get your ticket but for tourists it's
just not usable and whenever you go to
these tours and also can I help you
what's the first question you ask it's
what you want to go but where is this
question being asked here you know and
that's the only thing the tourists
usually no they don't know how long it
takes to get them there they don't know
which the zone the the place they want
to go into is in there just suppose I
mean there's somewhere you know really
meters away there's a list of the zone
so you can look up your what you want to
go in which zone that is and then you
have to go back and pick that here
accordingly I think if the ingenious who
designed this user interface just went
out once and watch this ticketing
machine in action they would have
redesigned it very quickly so please
don't do that go out and watch or even
better do the task your users are
supposed to do yourself either they're
using the the product of the competition
then look at that and try that write
down what's working well with the
competition and what doesn't work so
well if there is no software at this
point there's usually a manual process
or maybe they're using Excel or things
like that just watch how they do it and
what it is like and what you have to
could
theater when you design your user
interface the next technique is called a
personal it is very popular among user
experience experts so what is a personal
a usability expert when he starts in
your project usually does studies does
some surveys and tries to figure out
what the user is like but then instead
of working with this abstract results he
has a usability expert would create this
description of a persona they would and
the person is a typical representative
of that user group so for here for
example here we have two groups of users
we have software developers and we have
designers and then you start to think of
a typical background for that person
you're right you know what would how
many kids do that does this person have
or does it it does he have kids at all
what other hobbies were ddd is education
and and what are the things they're
interested in and you write that down
based on your your your survey and
studies and then you use that later to
unser typical question like um and the
reason why this is so successful in work
so well is because you can create or you
have much more empathy with such a
personal because this is almost like a
real person and you can really answer
this question now I have these
alternatives a and B what Marcus prefer
version a or version be better you have
it's much easier to answer this question
I'm thinking about okay this abstract
group of software developers and
designing this application for would
they prefer version a or version B you
know it's hard to answer that so person
us are really great because they allow
you to feel empathy with your users now
the disadvantage is it's really hard to
create them you really have to know what
you're doing and that's what usability
experts come in and and what they know I
mean for for for software
upper it's probably even hard to just
create a survey which doesn't influence
the results right and and usually we're
actually I've not given the time to do
these kind of studies before we write
our or start or projects so but what we
can use instead is a technique that's
called proto persona and what is that
well it's like an ad hoc bright stomped
personal that you create a prototype of
your persona that you keep improving how
does it work you get the whole team into
one room and do a brainstorming session
why you just think of what do you think
how your typical um users look like and
then you create personas very much like
like a usability expert would do after
he studies um no you know this isn't
scientific this is just a guess right so
during the course of the project was
while you're talking to real users and
and you learn more about them on when
you figure out oh you're proto person
that doesn't really match your your real
users then you keep changing and
updating them and improving them so
proto person is just an initial guess
that you keep optimizing but otherwise
you use it pretty much like a real
person up it's not as scientific and not
as well proven and not as good as a real
one it's a real person uh but the
results of very good and almost I would
say even almost as good as using real
person us another technique is the
empathy map so this one is very popular
in the startup community because they
have a very similar problem when you
found a start-up and you create a new
product you don't really know who your
customers are so what they do is they
create this thing of this empathy map
think about you know what do what do we
think that our typical customers will
hear what of his pain and gain points
and again you do a brainstorming session
and you answer all of these questions
and you give it a name and then you use
it very much like a pro two persona
meaning when you want to answer question
you wonder okay if this if you
all this one bill how would build think
about how the decision I have to make if
you figure out your users are actually
different and what you put into your
empathy map you just update it and keep
improving it so it's also very useful to
technique from my experience this one is
easier to use in the beginning because
you have all of these categories that
you can think of and it's easier to
answer these than to write a pro to
personal from scratch but in the long
run I think in protic persona helps you
more to feel empathy with your with your
users and give the right answers to
questions about usability you have so
initially I would start with this but
once you have used empathy maps once or
twice I encourage you to try out a pro
two personals now let's imagine we're in
the middle of our project and now we
want to get some feedback and how we can
improve the usability of our product and
one technique we can use for that is
called heuristic evaluation so how does
that work you get a group of expert that
these could be colleagues in this case
not from your project that's very
important they shouldn't work on the
same toward you're working on but this
could be colleagues from another team
from another project so you together
three four of them and you give them a
task they should accomplish and then you
give them a list of heuristics that you
want to follow what you think or is
important for good usability and then
these experts sit down and they do the
task maybe once or twice just to get
familiar with it and then they go
through it and write down every time you
break one of these heuristics let's look
at some examples what this ristic is so
this is a from a list again from Nielsen
um he created a list of ten juristic
switch are very good starting point but
you can certainly add your own
heuristics that you deem important
to that list so one for example would be
the visibility of the system status
meaning at all times it should be
visible what in what state your
application is another one would be a
match between the cistern and the real
world which means are you using the
right the same words people would use in
the real world in your application is
the mental model the same like a good
example of the desktop is for example
you know using folders in a trash can
that's a very simple mental model that
really fits well to the real world so
and here you need to see is the mental
model in your application does it really
match what is happening in the real
world another example would be user
control and freedom for example so is
the user in control of the process and
also how easy is it for him to recover
from errors so once he did the wrong
decision that's also very important if
you want to make sure you use your
fields in charge and he's the one who's
giving the control in the direction you
also need to make him feel comfortable
that once he does a wrong decision that
he can easily go back so and there are
more heuristics like that as I said
there they are 10 on the website from
Nielsen but you can also add your own
your own heuristics so you um you give
these does it this list and the experts
they check where you break these
heuristics and then you put will get all
the or three or four of them together
and then they should discuss what they
think are the most important or the most
critical issues that they found while
doing that problem of this approach is
it gives you some false positives and
negatives so the people you will get
some results where you break the
register istics but it's actually not
usability issue so for example maybe at
some point it's not visible what the
system is what in what state assist
using but the user actually knows so
it's not it's not really a usability
issue even though you broke the this
heuristic up here and also they may
overlap look certain usability issues
because they're just focus on the
heuristics but nevertheless looking at
the the costs of this technique I mean
it costs almost nothing nothing it just
costs you asking your colleagues a favor
so if you compare the costs of that with
the results you get it's definitely a
tool that you should add to your tool
set when you do when you want to improve
the usability of your application okay
and another technique which I will call
it probably the queen of all usability
techniques is a usability test now when
we think of usability tests we usually
think of a usability lab so you have a
one room with cameras everywhere and
microphones ever were and you want to
record maybe even though I you want to
even track the eyes of the user things
like that and you have a second room
from which everything is being
controlled and you know this kind of
stuff is really expensive it can easily
cost ten thousand bucks to do a
usability usability test in such a setup
and that means it's pretty much out of
reach for most of us for most
applications but there's actually a
possibility to do a low-budget usability
test all you need for that or two
conference rooms in your office in one
room you have the application you want
to test installed a screen sharing
application and also screen recording
application because you want to record
what's happening so that you can watch
it later and then you have a participant
of the study and you have the experiment
eight ER who is running the test so um
the the participants should be people
who have never seen your application
before the reason is that if they know
your application they may fall for the
curse of knowledge as well
they already know certain things about
your application and and overlook
usability issues that a new user would
have so it's important that the
participant has never worked with the
application before so what's usually
done is that you get people from the
street you just put an ad in to
Craigslist or on the blackboard in your
local college things like that and you
ask people for help with in a usability
study and you pay them for one hour 50
bucks or something like that which user
usually gives gives you enough interest
from people so the people come in you
explain the setup and what you expect
them to do it's very important that you
explain to him that it's not them you're
testing right you're testing the
application so because otherwise what
can happen is that you're the user gets
stuck at some point in your application
and then they feel embarrass and they
start to freak out and and you know
that's not really what what you want
during your test you need to make sure
that they understand they are actually
helping you if they get stuck you have a
usability issue that you need to fix so
it's actually good if they get stuck
it's like a tester who finds the buck
you know it's not bad if a tester finds
a bug because the but was there before
you just pointed out to you right and
it's the same for usability test the
participants have to understand it's not
them who are going to be tested it's the
application that's being tested another
thing that's important to explain is
that you cannot answer question why
they're doing a task you want to test
how a user works with your application
without any help from outside so but if
the person if you would just help them
all the time you know you don't you get
the wrong impression from that you
should always reserve 10 minutes at the
end of the session where they can all
answer all the questions they have and
you can discuss all the details but
during the experiment you shouldn't you
should try to avoid answering questions
certainly if people get totally stuck in
the first task and you want them to
finish to
task two and three and four as well at
some point you must help them so they
don't waste all the time so then the
participants need to start work on their
working on a task and you need to ask
them to think out loud which means they
should say at all times what they're
thinking about what they are looking at
and when David with stuck why they're
getting stuck what were they what what's
causing their confusion and that's how
you can overcome the curse of knowledge
because this technique asking your
participants to think out loud gives you
insight into the head of the user you
suddenly see your application from the
point of view of your user by using this
technique and that's also why it's so
important that they should never use the
application before because otherwise you
would you wouldn't get the real thoughts
of a real user in this situation in the
second room it's important that you
gather the whole team and that's why you
use the why you need the screen sharing
device because you want to share what's
happening on this screen on the other
computer so that the whole team can see
what the participant is doing you need
to have microphones here so that they
can hear what the person is saying what
he is thinking so that all of them
understand and feel the pain the user
has with the application because if you
do that everybody will understand how
important it is to fix those usability
issues ok the question now is how many
of these some tests do you need to do in
average and there was a study from
Nielsen again what he tested look at are
taking an implication with usability
issues how many participants how many of
these tests does he need does it take to
actually find on of the of the issues
and the surprising result is that 15
participants are enough
you don't need more than that another
important number to see is when you do
know usability tests at all your
knowledge is Europe right don't forget
that if you have just one participant
you can already find about a third of
all the usability issues in your
application the second one will increase
that to what is it maybe sixty percent
with all with every further participant
you gain less and less knowledge the
people will fall into some of the traps
people before have already found in two
but they've also discover new ones but
it's becoming less and less and so the
the recommendation is to do just three
to five tests where the participants
because at that point you already found
the majority of usability issues and
what's even more important is you found
the critical ones you know the usability
issue you find up here that means 14
people had no no issue with that it's
not a critical usability issue just the
15th person found this out but here
that's the one that almost everybody
will trap over so if you have to as
three or five participants you find on
the majority of the issues and you find
important issues and then the
recommendation is instead of you know
just taking 15 you find all the issues
you fix them and you're done it's better
if you just use three or five you fix
the issues that they find and then you
do another round again with 32 55 people
I'm you fix the issues they found and
you do another one some people say you
should do five at minimum because before
that you know it's kind of you're not
really sure about the result once you
have five purchases participants you see
clear patterns of where your usability
issues are another line of thought is
and that's one I am mostly agree with is
just using or just doing three usability
tests in one session and the reason is
if you do just three you can do that in
one morning you started nine every
session takes one hour so at 12 you're
done get
the whole team for lunch you discuss
what you just saw and you decide what
you want to focus on and fix in the next
month or so until you have until you do
the next usability study if you use five
you know doing these kind of studies
it's very exhausting because you have to
watch every word you say very closely
because you don't want to give any hints
to the participants and and doing this
for four five tests it's almost
impossible to do this in one day so you
have to split in two days and then in
that case um you won't get the whole
team into the room together so but if
it's just half a day you can convince
the team very easily that this is time
worth spent and they should watch it and
that's really critical at this point
okay to finish my talk I want to show
you crooks love usability testing one
usability test is one hundred percent
percent better than none thank
so we have about seven minutes left do
you have any questions yes please how do
I compare the importance of usability 20
that's a very good question so the
question is how do I sell the importance
of usability a very nice trick to do
that is to invite the people who make
the business decision into one of the
usability issues you know they should
just stop by for for a couple of minutes
maybe you can tell them and they should
just go to the room with a team and
watch the usability test and what will
happen is they suddenly really notice
how important it is and usually they
actually stay longer than they plan to
because it's such an exciting and
interesting thing to see I mean well
actually the first time you do it it's
actually pretty painful and very
frustrating because you suddenly realize
how back you use a bill earlier you use
interfaces but um you know you get you
stirred you get over it and it's
important to invite the if or if there
is some resistance to that it's
important to invite the people do it you
know explain them you just want to do it
once it's an experiment you know it's
it's not too expensive right and then
invite them so that they can see the
results themselves and usually after
that they are totally convinced how
important usability is um so up here
maybe with white teeth okay my question
is you know you talked a little bit
about natural real-world merciful
helping usability my question is why
don't kids get stuck with
in traces what were your kids seemingly
pick up devices a neighbor reviews much
more easily than adults them i was
informed yeah so the question was why do
kids pick up new user interfaces so much
quicker than adults right okay well I'm
not an expert in this but I think
they're just not scared to do mistakes
they just experiment play around and
that way they can pick it up much faster
than an adult who is usually very scared
not it doesn't want to destroy or delete
anything so that's one thing I often
observed with my kids they have no issue
trying new things and just see what
happens so the question was if we should
think about using faces user interfaces
were having side effect or new so if we
should design them not having immediate
side effects no I would say that I would
say it's important that that it's easy
for the user to recover from an arrow so
they should notice immediately okay what
I did was not what I intended and be
able to recover from that quickly so
that they don't that they are not afraid
anymore to do mistakes because it's so
easy to get back right if you have a
redo undo history that helps a lot you
know to make people experiment with you
use interface because you can just do
undo undo undo until you're back at the
state where where you did the way you
had a correct state I think that's more
important than thinking about not having
immediate side effects okay any other
questions so um maybe here you gotta
compromise how much
how the person has budget product is
really testing it for example the
comparison selling out the street versus
somebody in the HR department yeah
that's that's I would say that's an
ongoing debate about this topic going on
so one thing is oh sorry I need to
repeat the question right so the
question was um if know what was how to
work the question yeah yeah okay do I
ever compromise on the knowledge user i
said in the talk that the user should
have no prior knowledge about the user
interface well if possible i should add
that's true so in some cases for example
writing an application for a traitor and
a stock market you cannot get people
from the street and use that application
because you need so much knowledge about
the business not about your application
but about the business that you can't
just grab people from the street in that
case you need to get users who have the
the business knowledge you know the
context but still haven't seen your
application before it's a lot harder
that's that's for sure but it's
important to do that one way of doing
that is actually doing something that's
called a remote usability test so the
because it's hard to get these people
into your office but it can sometimes
convince them to do these kind of
usability tests at their computer in
their office or at home and then you
connect them with some screen sharing
device and you talk with them by a phone
or Skype or whatever and then you can do
such a test even with people who are far
away because when you need such experts
you need to pick them up where they are
okay thanks any more questions so
there's a question right here
so the question was if there if I've
ever experienced any differences between
adding a new feature to an existing
application versus on creating a new app
from scratch right okay oh yeah so there
are huge differences the main issue is
that when you have an existing
application where you just add a feature
you already have users who are used to a
certain way of doing things and for them
actually changing the user interface
even though you're totally convinced
that this is much easier and faster for
them it doesn't appear to be that you
know it's there used to a certain way
how user interface works and there they
they are fast with this and they like it
so I'm the problem that often evolved
from that is if you change it even
though you may simplify it objectively
you get resistance from those users in
that case it's really important not from
a usability point of view in my opinion
but it's more like a political point of
view because you don't want the current
users be against your your changes right
and it's it's tricky and you have to
find compromises in this case does it
onto your question okay great any more
question okay last one yeah okay great
thank you ok so I hope get it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
