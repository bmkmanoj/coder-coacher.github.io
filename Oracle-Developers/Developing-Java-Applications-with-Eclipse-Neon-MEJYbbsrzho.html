morning we we realize we're competing
with the Java nine people next door so
we're glad you could come and see us
anyway appreciate that thank you
before we begin people in the crowd who
today is already is currently using
eclipse to do software development I
keep your hands up if you're doing just
Java or I'm sorry not just yet just if
you are doing Java development how about
like C and C++ anyone doing that okay
PHP okay JavaScript oh very nice okay
good little hand wavy thing yeah okay
cool excellent who here actually has an
eclipse foundation account and uses it -
who has ever made a bug reported a bug
against eclipse excellent thank you so
much those of you that have done that
for the rest of you I find it and
fantastic and very it's heartwarming to
know that you have never ever once
encountered a bug or a problem with
Eclipse software I'm gonna tell the
developers they're gonna be excited that
this many people anyway yeah who's
waiting for a bug to be addressed come
talk to me after sorry actually I'll
warn you actually we have another talk
that's like a half hour after this one
so we're gonna try and run out of here
really really quickly if we don't have a
chance to talk to you afterwards we do
have a booth down in the exhibit hall
and I'm gonna be there there most days
so please come and talk to me if there's
a bug that's bugging you I need to talk
and talk to you about it we actually
have some changes that we've been making
at the foundation and there's hope there
is hope yeah there is hope so
my name is Wayne Beaton I'm look at the
slide for that little jet-lagged I'm
from Ottawa Canada any Canadians in the
group all right Loki Loki we I'm the
director of open source projects at the
Eclipse Foundation
and my my colleague Gunnar here is yeah
I'm working at Salesforce I'm working on
well we have an IDE that's based on
Eclipse but I've I've been doing a clip
stuff for I don't know 12 13 years now
and we've been working on together on a
couple of Eclipse projects not just like
the Java development that we talked
about today but there's there is
actually a bunch more and that's that's
if you're interested in yeah there's 30
minutes after this one there's another
talk about where we talk about open
source in general and what we do so if
we ran out of way right if we run out of
this room it's not because of the
content or we say something it's reaches
we have to get to the other one to give
that more so the title of this talk is
building applications with eclipse neon
we what we really expect is that
everybody here really just cares about
writing doing Java development using
Eclipse neon is our our annual
simultaneous release and I'll talk a
little bit about specifically that in a
second something that most people don't
know about eclipse and the Eclipse IDE
is that the Eclipse Foundation employees
at well this is actually a relatively
new thing traditionally we employ
absolutely none of the software
developers who build this to build
eclipse they all work for different
organizations the Eclipse Foundation
provides a place for them to come
together and collaborate recently though
we've actually hired somebody who is
doing actual development on Eclipse some
of the this is the faint hope on this
bug that made this long-standing bug may
come from there we actually do have one
developer on staff and we have been
contracting other developers and and and
actually the Eclipse Foundation is in a
position where we're we are starting to
direct some of the work but most of the
work I don't even want to say the nut
you know guess a number but you know 99%
of the work is being done by people in
the community IBM I think is well known
as a long
contributor 2 to eclipse projects Red
Hat has been doing a great deal of work
a great deal of contribution into the
platform and other projects at Eclipse
we have Wind River Salesforce is doing
some contributions as well we have a lot
of different organizations and you know
some large some small that come together
to collaborate the thing that most of us
know as the Eclipse IDE when you
download a product off of our website
it's actually the composition of a whole
bunch of different separate open-source
projects that have their own development
team there what we do with these with
what we call the simultaneous release
this year is called neon as we help
those projects coordinate their
communication and their schedules so
that we can actually have all of this
goodness all lumped together so I've got
a conceptual picture of the Eclipse IDE
for Java developers and the Java tools
comes from the JDT project platform
comes from the platform project that's
kind of what most people think of I
guess when they think of the Java
development tools but if you download
that product you'll see there's also a
maven integration stuff that comes from
a separate project the mtoui project
which is staffed by a bunch of people
who actually work on maven - its kind of
neat they actually are as they're
developing our integration with maven
they move maven forward in different
ways at the same time because they're
the same same developers the
recommendation engine if you've not seen
you maybe you've seen this there's a
it's a it's been it's been in for a
little while where when you do content
assist the Eclipse will say will give
you the the most likely thing that you
want to have based on the context so if
you've created a new window the next
thing you might want to do is open the
window right and not you know that we've
scanned our code use in lots and lots of
different projects and determined what
you know the next they what the most
obvious thing people want to do next is
and then the recommendation engine is an
add-on into eclipse that that uses that
intelligence that's a very cool demo I
don't have time
in this session to show you if you come
by the booth I can I can show that to
you
XML editors come from the web tools
project git integration comes from the
the egit and jagat projects if you've
seen the task focused UI work so called
myelin that all comes from the myelin
project very cool the papyrus project
provides UML tools that's be part of the
modeling package Eclipse ID for model
developers there's a handful of other
projects I've got on the outside of this
graphic that contribute different things
if you're doing charts the business
business integration sorts of things the
BIRT project contribute contributes all
of our chart development chart chart
building software and all this stuff can
be added to your IDE something that yeah
it's it's it's a powerful concept but on
this a at the same time it's also a
little bit of a weakness like eclipse is
like APIs are a lot of things that you
can put in into the IDE and some
sometimes projects are very eager at at
integrating and elaborating and using
the same concepts that are exported and
at the platform level and it just to
make it feel similar sometimes projects
do not and but that's where the Eclipse
Foundation actually is taking on a more
active role in in the reason time to
start keeping pushing projects or
helping projects organize better around
this I said the simultaneous release
what the Eclipse Foundation provides is
the structure the infrastructure and we
have a body in the Eclipse notation
called the Planning Council which is
also made up of people from all sorts of
different organizations coming together
to to collaborate for a number of
different years we the first one that we
named was Callisto back in 2006 and
we've every year on this June in June
we've made a new release of the Eclipse
software again it's all about
coordinating all of these different
open-source projects to to coat to to
communicate and and one of the one of
the neat things is we have some pretty
world-class
build systems and and an integration so
all these different projects are
producing their software and what we do
is over the period of a year is we're
regularly putting all of those pieces
together we're regularly running our
builds we're ready regularly running our
integrations and testing everything so
by the time June comes along it's
actually a fairly dull time you would
think you know leading you know the week
to you know a couple of weeks or last
month leading up to a release should be
a very stressful time and in fact by the
time it gets that it's sort of dull for
us because we've done it seven times
already at that point seven maybe eight
nine we've done it a bunch of times and
and we've worked out most of the bugs
now every once in a while we have a
little bit of a scare or something but
but by and large our our processes are
pretty solid its enviable I think by a
lot of
more proprietary or your close
organizations well for the majority of
the project of course there are projects
that are always rushing at the last
minute but windowbuilder dropped off
that was a little bit disturbing this
year so over the years the number of
projects open-source projects that have
participated in what we call neon has
grown this year we had 84 I think was a
final number 84 we estimate about 69
million lines of code have gone into the
various projects that that make up make
up the the neon release and one of the
things that I'm particularly happy with
and maybe a little bit proud of because
this is kind of coincides with my taking
over as director of open source projects
is the number of non committer
contributors a number of people from the
community such as yourselves who have
stepped up and given us get commits you
know given us patches has increased over
time the the number of people number of
committers a number of people who are
maybe paid by their employer or have
authority to actually write into our
source code repositories is relatively
stable but the number of people that are
just showing up and and participating in
the projects and being embraced by the
project
James is definitely on an increase and
again I think that's awesome so we have
these different products if you come to
our website to download you may have
noticed there's an installer the
installer will give you the ability to
install an Eclipse IDE for Java there's
actually a way you can go around the
Installer and just go and grab a zip
file and do the same thing that we've
always done for for more than a decade
now 15 12 17 years just unzip it into
your favorite directory and you're off
to the races
but once you have that that IDE that
that that product installed there's a
bunch of different ways to add features
to it the best one is the eclipse
marketplace so if you go to marketplace
eclipse.org you'll see this wonderful
marketplace of play where you can find
different plugins to extend eclipse in
all sorts of different directions
in that there is an eclipse project
marketplace and these are specific
solutions from Eclipse projects
themselves the open source projects the
broader community can contribute if you
have plug-ins for Eclipse that that your
company is produced or you have produced
you can add them into the marketplace
and make them available to the community
this marketplace has this actually it's
a pretty cool feature you just the
install button if you drag that install
button and just drop it on top of your
Eclipse workbench it will install that
feature it could take you through the
process of installing that feature we've
made this I think about as easy as we
can there's another way if you go into
the Eclipse marketplace client this is
accessible through the help menu help
just I think it's marketplace Eclipse
marketplace it'll open up the Eclipse
marketplace client and this is native
Eclipse code that you can do searches on
you can narrow the markets again there's
an eclipse project market there's a
tools market different categorizations
of tools if you're looking for support
to do something then this is a great
place to go I've there's been a handful
of times where I thought it would be
cool to make a plug-in that does
such-and-such and then I
actually last one was test regular
expressions help me build regular
expressions turns out there's about four
of them already in the marketplace the
final if the final step I guess if the
marketplace does not contain what you're
looking for you can get at the stuff
that's part of the simultaneous release
this one I should have this is a
screenshot from Mars using the install
dialog personally I think the install
dialog is something you shouldn't
unleash on your best friend it's a it's
a bit bit of a challenge to work with
marketplaces much much more streamlined
for working but if if you're looking for
something that's not in the market place
the install new software option
underneath the file menu or it's
underneath the help menu is another
another option so in this case I'm
showing you installing the C and C++
development tools into my IDE and
actually I'm surprised by that
occasionally I run into people who are
not aware that you can extend Eclipse
and that's kind of our thing right being
able to extend it to do whatever you
wanted to do or needed to do is is is an
important part of the Eclipse experience
okay yeah let's look into some of the
new features in yarn there are some
improvements to to the marketplace as
you mentioned but we actually collected
a few for you over in in the slides
there's well you you realize that
depending on the people and the
different people that are working on
eclipse and everyone has a bit of a
different focus but there's some there's
some little things that that I think are
very helpful such as I don't know who
uses it like there's a neon you can
actually start saving your editors
automatically so you don't have to you
never have to worry about forgetting it
to save and you can actually set it up
and then whenever you close or whatever
it is it is persisted so next time your
laptop crashes or eclipse crashes or the
JVM crashes your content still has been
saved there's little things I don't know
who needs
I'm surgeon binary file files and never
I never used that before actually
surgeon binary fine well let's do of
course you've never used it before yeah
so Eclipse by default will has in the
past exclude binary files now you can
optionally search search them if you
want you pretty pretty much like the
full screen mode yeah so that that was
an improvement driven by an individual
who will who uses Eclipse a lot for for
example for presentations or for giving
tutorials or trainings and then he likes
working on a projector in front of a
group so he decided I want to use the
post screen mood mode so this is new and
then you can launch eclipse in full
screen and hide the toolbar and get a
really nice setup for for those kind of
presentations or if you just like
working without any distractions that's
good to you one of the features I really
like is the you can do the shift the
plus plus and minus signs to increase
the font size across the IDE that's
something a bit of a pet peeve of mine
over the years it's been addressed with
neon as well it is addressing UN but
like yeah in the early days in the early
days I remember using a plugin from well
it wasn't on the marketplace back then
because the manga base didn't exist but
like one of the presenters and speakers
were the plugin that allows you to do
those zooming cuz when you broke on
projectors as well we have this little
ponds impossible to read in the back
now you can like in a browser you can
zoom and make it larger okay question
the implementation is actually bitmap
based at this price at this point if we
have two different resolutions of icons
so the way it works is on especially
this is about high resolution displays
that Eclipse now ships with two versions
or you can actually if you're
distributing accepts applications or
Eclipse plugins yourself you can
actually put in different versions of
the image like a larger scale version
that is then being used on those high
resolutions displays which makes the
icons look a bit nicer right I think
there are no like there is no committed
items on this I know it's on a wish list
for some but unless someone steps up and
you say okay let's do it I don't think
that it's a pressing item right now I
don't think it's currently in plan for
oxygen what they're our SVG viewers but
it's not in the plan on using them in as
two items were like an idea
so whoever used whoever used the import
wizard to set up projects in Eclipse
okay starting with neon you can actually
you can you you can stop worrying about
having the right things installed right
because there's a new smart import
wizard which actually tries to figure
out what kind of project you are
importing and then configuring your
Eclipse as well as the project's
automatically to make like the imported
small app as smooth as possible this is
an this is in the theme of helping
reduce the complexity of getting started
with eclipse right or or or bringing
existing code existing project so it
might be from a different ID or two
spoke on the command line into Eclipse I
think the people really working behind
this especially also was red had very
interested in in developing this
yes yes that is actually that's actually
something that's exposed at this UI
which is we discuss it's not at the
right complexity but those project
configurators is what you as a plug-in
developer can actually plug into Eclipse
right and then you can discover your own
project types for this word wrap in text
editors I don't know how many people I
actually asked about that feature years
and years ago finally we got it
ten years later so try a bit more
positive tone yeah no no no I'm not
saying that it's cool but I prefer
writing not writing so much text oh yeah
this one is good this one is really good
and remember whenever you open a file
like I don't know windows now I'm gonna
make these days but you open and if I or
you open an INF file which is a text
file or the p2 INF you open it on
Windows it actually starts some cryptic
system editor which totally crashes with
those files now with me on eclipse is
actually smart and says oh you know I
don't have an editor for C files or for
JSON files or whatever and it gives you
choice to say you know what use the one
I have installed on my system which
could be sublime or text error or
something or a native application or go
to the marketplace and search for a
plug-in that would allow me to to use
those files if you like if you are
extending eclipse and providing your own
support there's some trick you can do on
the marketplace to get your plugin
listed as a result but basically it's
just saying okay my plugin adds support
to eclipse for those pyle types right
but now you that's another way of making
it easier for people to get find their
way in that Bazaar with all those many
plugins and extensions it's basically
you open an unknown fight type or images
like images for
there's a couple of good really good
images images viewer on the marketplace
and now you click on an image the first
time you never used one before probably
you didn't even know about it
it shows you there the result and you
can insulate all within that single
operation that actually I like a lot
that feature
yeah marketplace one one addition to the
marketplace is favorites I think you
have some pretty good things about like
some background content so yeah so one
of the the eclipse marketplace is a
client club sorry the Eclipse
marketplace now is the ability to mark
things as a favorite so you can pick a
bunch of plugins that you really really
like you enjoy using and then those
those favorites can actually be moved
over into the Eclipse IDE into the
Eclipse marketplace client and it makes
it much easier for you to apply your
favorite favorite extensions to your
Eclipse to other installations so maybe
when you upgrade to a new version or
maybe you have multiple workspaces you
can apply those favorites more easily
across those this actually all comes
through something we have now called the
user storage service the idea is you can
create an account with the Eclipse
Foundation and we will store information
that you want us to store favorites is
one of those things so favorites in the
marketplace you can also I want to
stress can this doesn't happen
automatically
you can choose to store preferences with
with the Eclipse Foundation the idea
here is if you have multiple
workstations you install Eclipse you
configure it with preferences into the
state that you like the next time you
install Eclipse you have an option of
saying reapply all of those preferences
or you can go into another workspace
running on another workstation and say
apply the preferences here and Eclipse
your Eclipse IDE will pull them from the
Eclipse Foundation storage service this
again this is a relatively this is a
polis it's an absolutely new thing not
just a relatively new thing and it's
worth I just did the cat
here is that the data is not stored
privately the preferences in particular
can be shared preferences can also be
shared so just if you do decide to use
this feature be careful what preferences
you store if company names are in in
some settings or what not that
information would be propagated to our
servers so don't do that yeah I think
think of it like public repos and github
right so like the same way if you if you
opt in to synchronize preferences it by
the way it uses ooomph who uses who uses
the Eclipse feature and Mars to
synchronize or store preferences
globally and they in the user home
directory okay so there is a there's a
feature since Mars which actually allows
you it's called the preference recorder
it actually tracks what preferences you
said in your Eclipse Works book space
and then saves it into the user home
folder and then reapply is it every time
you open a new workspace which makes it
more convenient because then you don't
have to export and import and have this
apply the same settings in again and
again and with that preference recorder
you can actually select which preference
you want to share between different
workspaces and which one which ones you
don't for example the workspace name
right that's pretty much individual or
unique per workspace you don't want to
record that but that that setting is
then also used to upload it to the
Eclipse Foundation where you everyone
else can then look at those preferences
the one one note about the security that
password is a stored in the native
secure store on the operating system
it's the iCloud it's the the keychain on
Mac and Windows password storage on
Windows so it is secure the okay this is
a screenshot of the JavaScript
development tooling which got some
improvements and made a big step forward
in the club's new release it basically
God well I wouldn't say rebooted but
there's a contributor stepped up and
improved the existing plugins did a lot
of rework in it and added very liking
features to make it pleasure to work
with give it a try if you're welling if
you're developing in JavaScript and
sometimes not just JavaScript but oh I
have the slides here yeah the JSON JSON
pod is becoming public there's now a
JSON editor available as an eclipse
project which is available for and for
neon put the packages maven integration
there's some further improvements
there's a new better just saw recently a
new a new view that's similar to how
Cradle does it that allows you to easier
run maven builds from within eclipse the
greater integration also got a lot
better in neon especially around
coloring syntax highlighting
so the question was is the maven
integration now bundled with the basic
Eclipse or do you need the Eclipse for
Java EE so for those of you to give some
context we have those packages at
Eclipse the basic Eclipse is sometimes
people refer to that as the thing that
was originally called the Eclipse SDK
the eclipse SDK is not a package it will
not include any of those additional
plugins or other it eclipse project it's
a thing built by the Eclipse platform
team really just as a purpose for their
target platform what they are developing
is if you go to the package the maven
integration should be it's in the Java
package and into the drama EE package
right and if you if you use a different
package and you really think the maven
integration or the greater integration
should be in that package and it's not
or something else should be in that
package and it's not please raise a bug
or discussion somewhere so that we can
track it and discuss about it yeah
greater integration got a lot better
there is now also there's no syntax
coloring on the grade of house which
wasn't available Amar's PHP development
tools also made some improvements as
noticeable is of course the support for
PHP 7 what else oh now the good the Java
features so again the little things that
you probably not all of us you knew or
or even some use some don't there's of
course a new options in the code
formatter to make it easier to adjust
the code the way you want it there's
some improvements for quick fix
canary cysts an additional time and the
null analysis has really got got a lot
improvements that's actually a great a
great investment from Stefan and team to
really make your code more safe by doing
some static analysis while you're
developing of variables which can be
knowledge runtime and which cannot be
non-time they use annotations for that
it's really cool it really helps making
the code you write say River so if you
don't use it today I suggest you give it
a try in the well in the Java package
Explorer you can now select or
interviews you can now select down and
you multiple let's say constructors or
method and search for for them at once
which which is in particular interesting
if you have let's say method with with a
couple of overloads you can now search
for any any of those at once and you
don't have to use the type hierarchy for
this as a workaround anymore the code
completion got some improvements
one is subvert or substring completion
you can now start when you when the code
assist is open you can now start typing
just parts of the method and you find it
in a result saying there's for them
there's two new interesting templates
for very common very often written code
if not now lower if now just type if n
and then you invoke the qanun assist you
get the templates proposed the info so
the severity and the compiler can could
be configured can be configured in
eclipse for a long time lately they
added another severity level called info
this is interesting if let's say you
want to experiment with denali analysis
or with some other special special
compiled features that the default
compiler does not want and if you don't
and sometimes people just find it very
interactive in that workflow if you
suddenly flip a switch on and you find
like 600 warnings in the code because of
some special analysis you're doing you
can now set those two info which makes
it Ness critical or or less critical or
less annoying are the cool Java stuff
that I personally use very very often or
the safe actions so the the thing that
got really good in in neon is and I'm
amazed by it all the time I have a lot
of
from from the the all Java 7 code that
I'm migrating partially to Java 8 not
all at once but as I go through the
files for example anonymous classes or
anonymous functions that I use in the
code now it's just a safe and Eclipse
converts them into lambda expressions if
you want to and if it's possible with
the functional interfaces and the safe
actions can also be configured to do a
lot of other stuff like make sure that
your code is properly formatted you can
even sort the method if you want but you
can wrap like you can apply a lot of
things so yeah so a lot of teams will
use that to enforce coding standards for
example if you have a if you have within
your project you have a way that you
want the team wants to do things you can
use these so if you actually pull for
example the Eclipse platform code and
start doing development work on it
anytime you save it will automatically
put the file into the format that the
team has decided they want code due to
appear anyway there's a lot of really
handy things it's one of those untapped
bits of power that I think a lot of
people don't don't see so we've been
doing some work with Java 9 I heard
recently that the the date has shipped
for for Java 9 which I which is
disappointing but you know better to get
it right then then not that's that's
cool a little disappointing we kind of
had a big party planned and you know for
our Mars 3rd you know third update
release in March we're gonna kind of
make that that be kind of a cool big
splash but we're just gonna have to make
oxygen work oxygen is in June the timing
of that is a little different a little
off from the July timeframe but we're
still gonna make a go of having
something we're not quite sure exactly
how this will manifest but we're gonna
make sure that the Eclipse support for
Java 9 is available when Java 9 goes is
shipped we do have some stuff happening
right now though in Java 9 for starters
if you are experimenting with Java 9 and
you would like to just run Eclipse
itself on a Java 9v
em you you need to do a little bit more
work and your Eclipse ini file we need
to add this one little line add modules
equals Java SCEE
there's a bit of a problem the default
set of packages don't include some
classes that Eclipse requires to run so
if you add this this switch into your
your Eclipse ini file everything should
should go well
Java eight and below should just ignore
this least that's the working theory and
I've actually not tested that come to
think of it which is something I should
have done but anyway this is a temporary
work around with the next release of
eclipse we are going to make sure that
our launcher does this automatically to
make sure that Java is configured
properly so anyway so if you're
experimenting with existing versions of
Eclipse you need to do this if you are
interested in seeing our beta very early
support for Java 9 you can pull that off
of the Eclipse marketplace there's a
it's the titles right there Java 9
support beta for neon if you take one of
our neon builds and you configure it to
run on Java 9 if you just drag and drop
this install button on top of your
Eclipse it will start to be able to deal
with Java 9 compiler stuff now the limit
the support right now is been focused on
the very fundamental things so we have
the ability to specify and edit and
syntax highlight a module info file we
actually found a couple of interesting
emissions in the not the specs not quite
the right word in that anyway the
specification right now our teams found
a couple of interesting challenges with
using keyword names on package names but
they're they're sorting that out anyway
the clips does what it's supposed to do
here but anyway the ideas are the
example I'm showing here is I've got
this is actually a an oxygen our next
release early build that I'm playing
with
a bit of weirdness on the screen there
but module info file specifies some
required modules suggests what packages
are exported here and if you look down
in the stuff dot Java file on the bottom
there it's giving a complaint about
accessing frame which is not part of the
Java dot base module or anything that it
it re exports so so eclipse is due and
if you change that require statement to
Java desktop everything the the compiler
kicks in and everything rebuilds and
frame is perfectly accessible this is
also exposing some early work that's
being done on allowing multiple class
paths in a single Java project currently
we have a single class path there's
we're not quite sure exactly how this is
going to manifest it's still something
that's an under development but the the
Java sorry the source folders right now
a source folder has is kind of being
treated like a module we're probably
going to have come up with a different
concept of a module that that will be
part of the release again not quite sure
what's happening if you are you know
what's going to happen the team is still
kind of experimenting and working on
this if you are curious about those
communication communicating with that
and understanding what what's happening
or being part of that discussion if you
go to wiki dot eclipse.org slash Java
nine there are some pointers there to to
the the plan the project plan and the
bugs that are open and most of our work
is well all of the work is exposed and
discussed in our Bugzilla instance so
you as a community member if you're
interested in some particular aspect of
this development you can register
yourself or CC yourself on bugs and get
get to inform to the communication even
better if you can provide input that
that's totally awesome so with that we
who here actually just out of curiosity
who here in the audience
uses open-source software you know
everyone uses uses Eclipse which is
open-source software but who uses open
source software and put in things that
you produce like an apache library or
the eclipse cann unification framework
or or eclipse link or something along
those lines who gives back like who
actually contributes to the open source
projects that they use who's like
contributed a patch excellent excellent
I've noticed that about we've been
talking an awful lot about contributing
and and the people are stepping up and
and and providing code for Eclipse
but frankly what you guys really care
about is writing Java code right that's
really why you're here
che is actually not technically part of
nyan who's actually heard of the eclipse
project che turns out it's sort of
unfortunately named if you're Mexican
but are Cuban oh my gosh oh my gosh I'm
so sorry I hope that wasn't offensive
Cuban anyway it's not named after a
Cuban revolutionary it's named after the
city where the where the where most of
the development occurs Jay is a entirely
new Java IDE
in fact it's bigger than just a Java 80
it's an entirely new IDE and I've
started off with how do you make a run
how you make chain as you configure
docker on your workstation who has
docker configured on their workstation
already so if you have docker 1.8
installed and running and doing what
it's supposed to do on your workstation
if you type this one line you run your
you can it will download everything that
you need and make chain I've included
all the there's there's more stuff than
you need just the highlighted bit that's
the command if you go to eclipse org
slash che it'll give you all this
information once you have that you can
then go to your browser and point your
browser at localhost 8080 and use your
new che Eclipse che IDE so this is new
technology it does use some Eclipse Java
development tools JDT code under the
covers there is some other existing
eclipse code in here but mostly it is
entirely new code and I wanted to do
just a quick demo of it and let's see
how that works and apparently you need
to escape
okay so this is Eclipse Shea running in
my browser you notice my screenshot was
all white this one's all black I guess
you can if you like black screens and we
have black if you like light screens we
have white there's a concept of a work
stay a workspace one of the things
that's let me show you the IDE first
actually and then I'll talk about the
other thing I've just sort of done a you
know there's sort of this the typical
the typical bank account example like if
there for some reason that's my go-to
example when I'm writing Java code but
you can do sort of the things that you
expect content assist works I can do
kinds of things
so I can do the sort of things content
assist there's also different different
helpers it does the you know the the
same kind of underlining problems and
marking problems that you come to expect
in Eclipse
some of the key equivalents or a little
are key codes are a little bit different
you can ask it for proposals to fix
problems create new methods you access
existing ones so it does all sorts of
IDE stuff that you've come to know and
love it's still a relatively new bit of
software so if you're you know if you're
expecting all of the bells and whistles
that you currently have in your Eclipse
IDE desktop IDE you might be a little
disappointed but there's a there's a lot
there's a lot here and one of the cooler
things of course is you can install this
on a server and then use it from your
tablet or your desktop or your phone and
you can do your java your well do your
development anywhere you want so we have
all you know kind of the kind of
features that you've come to expect full
maven integration the ability to I can
tell I want to do a build but I actually
want to do my run do my run and what's
happening is this is actually building
it with maven and then I just told it to
print out just the number okay
apparently I've actually got the
employee actually have it implemented
which is awesome but it will do all the
wonderful things that you expect it to
do go to maven central pull down the the
things that you need and and do your
build what's more interesting where this
gets really interesting is you configure
J to run on your server and it exploits
docker like you wouldn't believe
you can configure and I'm gonna try to
avoid getting to this because this will
depend on this will depend on having the
functioning internet yeah but I can say
I want to make a new workspace we have
this concept of workspaces no workspaces
contain more than code a workspace can
contain a runtime
definition I need in my I'm building an
application that runs on Tomcat so I
need Tomcat so I can go and I can say
make me a new workspace with this
template like a template there that's
Java JD T a JDK maven Tomcat subversion
Ubuntu running git so these are all the
things that I need and it will build a
workspace that has all of those things
including runtime components it will
configure it with you configure your
runtime so will actually pull docker
containers containing Tomcat and help
you configure your runtime environment
so imagine being able to take one of
these workspace definitions that
contains all of the information you need
to get a runtime up and running and
actually test your things and hand it to
an employee and it takes them as much
time to realize their development
environment as it does to download
everything from docker hub that's
basically what we have here now question
absolutely I've not done that so I can't
tell you how hard it is I've been
relying very heavily on the che team at
this point for providing at providing me
these templates however the che team is
at our booth like almost every day in
the exhibit hall I'll play almost every
session that we're there so if you come
by the exhibit hall they will be more
than happy to give you a demo they have
t-shirts too which are really cool if
you get there early but they've the real
experts are there they'll be able to
tell you everything you need to know
about che including future plans
question so they leverage the JDT so
they're using the Eclipse compiler for
Java in particular I think and I want to
be careful here I think they're actually
using Orion which is our Jetta new
JavaScript you know editor is JavaScript
based editor has anyone heard of Orion
the Eclipse Orion is another new IDE but
it's really focused around JavaScript
development but they have a I think the
editor that they're using in che is the
Orion editor
Ryan cameos as an editor yeah for TDT
they use the core parts what's missing
what they actually have to implement
from scratches all the support for that
extended refactoring and stuff so so
we're factoring is not as good as in a
desktop idea yet but the team is very
busy and they're working on this as well
also the there's a little bit unrelated
but one thing I want to make mention if
you like working with docker the darker
tooling in Eclipse on the decimal IDE
itself also got improved in neon so
search on the marketplace for darker
there's a project called taco tooling
for Eclipse it comes right from Eclipse
org and the Red Hat team is working on
it and that makes also working with
docker much more easy so if you look if
you do install chain you start poking
through some of these workspace
configuration templates they have some
of them are really interesting I've
started tinkering with the Android one
but I got hung up on some docker issue
with the emulator so I'm still tinkering
with that one there's still some there's
still some challenges certainly but if
you know there's some there's options to
do C++ and and an Android and some
dotnet development I honestly have not
personally had a chance to explore all
of these but there's certainly some some
early work in some operas and some great
potential in these development areas
there's some very interesting work
coming out in in October in the next
major release which is integration of
the language integration with language
servers I don't know who's reading the
news but today I think what's today or
this morning I saw a post on Twitter
that finally there's now support for
Java development in Visual Studio code
interesting enough that language that
technology is called language service
where you have the infrastructure
running in a separate process and that
is entirely also based on the Eclipse
Java development tools and that same
technology is also used or currently
being implemented in Eclipse chain to
integrate support for different language
like typescript javascript and all the
other interchain
so yeah so seriously go talk to the the
che guys at the Eclipse booth if you go
into the exhibit hall we're on the on
the left side at the back in the back
corner they you know anyway we're a big
draw so if they put us in the back
corner everyone would have to pass
everybody else to get to us sort figure
you know that drives more business to
everybody right
but once Java one is over and you're
still want to get more help or need more
information about the Eclipse go to the
go to the forums there's a couple of
year-olds but basically the forum's is a
great place for a lot of active
discussions and there's also tanks on
there's a tag called Eclipse on Stack
Overflow that you can use that a lot of
people are following and really good
answers to questions there and I think
the support landing page is not like
it's more like a landing page that gives
an overview more about the documentation
all the options that are available right
yeah if you're looking for help that's a
that's a that's your starting point
it'll actually point you to the forums
it's worth actually noting the Stack
Overflow I think is a thing of beauty in
terms of our community there's lots and
lots of eclipse-based questions there
and usually by the time I go to answer
them somebody else has already answered
them and I don't usually recognize the
person's name it's amazing how the
community is rallied around that
resource I think that's awesome if you
leave here with no other nothing nothing
else no other takeaway then please don't
ask - pork questions on Facebook or
Twitter Twitter that would be awesome
those forums are just really hard to
provide any real assistance on well
especially if it's not just as a poor
question but more about the buck report
or do not report bugs on Twitter to
anybody that just mean if you're
interested more in specific more
specific information about any of the
neon Eclipse desktop IDE things that we
talked about today they are all
available on the slash neon slash
noteworthy
Paige go take a look there I think
despite the idea this this website is
one of the one of the most beautiful
things I've seen on the Eclipse the
Laura structure well thank you it fits
the theme the unreal well so I would we
would like to kind of wrap up with
please not quite the right word but just
an offer we have been making putting a
lot of effort into making it easier to
contribute to eclipse contributing
itself is actually relatively
straightforward traditionally getting
your Eclipse development environment
configured to develop Eclipse has been
hard but it's much much easier now so I
invite you to please consider that also
consider that we have more than 300
different open-source projects at
Eclipse not all of them have to do with
the IDE we have a lot of interesting
things going on Apache has a lot of very
interesting things going on there are
lots of different projects out there
that could benefit from feedback and an
input from from you one of the things
that we've found is organizations and
individuals kind of grow through a
process of becoming involved in open
source a lot of organizations to say no
we we never use open source you know we
just don't use it there's lots of
problems with it those organizations of
course are kidding themselves because of
course they're using open source at some
level over time developers start just
grabbing open source packages and using
them make sure you understand licensing
that's something that most of us
developers aren't particularly good at
after using a library for a little while
a lot of most libraries have problems
it's just the way of the world you know
you say you find yourself actually
pulling the code and making a couple of
changes in doing your own local builds
and using those local builds in your
product or in your own development over
time that stops making sense supporting
Forks is is a challenge so you take that
code that you've forked and you actually
give it back to the to the open source
project so it can be maintained by the
community
that's when beautiful things start to
happen right there's a shared burden
you're sharing in the burden
and you're letting your you're letting
your burden be shared it's it's it's
awesome and and it's sort of how how the
open-source software world works at some
point the open-source software starts to
become more strategic and getting more
heavily involved becomes important
perhaps leading new projects or starting
new projects are joining existing
projects and contributing development
resources the final step in something
that we find this kind of had people ask
us how does the fountain Eclipse
Foundation function it's this next step
at some point that contribution model
stops being an individual developers
pushing things and driven by developers
driven by technical requirements and it
becomes business at some point your
business starts to become dependent open
source becomes a strategic investment at
that point then we start talking about
joining federations and contributing and
in other ways but anyway it all starts
with the technical people the technical
people solving problems using
open-source and and working together the
number of times I've been sitting at a
conference talking to people at a table
that that work for different
organizations that actually compete in
the marketplace working together on
open-source technology that both of
their companies require and depend on
it's a beautiful thing anyway and and
and you want to be part of it I have a
one last question who is using or who
actually ever tried to build eclipse
from Soros was it successful okay
right so cuz like they're especially
lost Fogle and the team around him
they're doing an really awesome job to
make sure it is actually possible and
also as easy as it can get
I do understand it's not that easy but
there is some really good documentation
about it it should be in theory just the
maven build that downloads stuff and
then you get your own Eclipse running
yeah
maybe an interesting exercise yeah thank
you now you can go go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
