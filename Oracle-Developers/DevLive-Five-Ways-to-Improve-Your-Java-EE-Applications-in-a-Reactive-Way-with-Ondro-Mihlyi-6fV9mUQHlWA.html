my name is Jen employee of Oracle
technology Network and my guest is Andre
Andre Andre me - feira nice to see you
so Andre you have a session about Java
EE and reactive programming right yes
and in the session you actually explain
how you don't need to rewrite everything
but you actually you can take like a
current application that you wrote and
and turn it into a reactive or make it
more reactive so yes also actually the
point of my story is pretty well
like you summarized it pretty well there
are a lot of there is a lot of
information how to do reactive
applications and a lot of frameworks are
supported but the problem is that if you
already have an application and you need
to optimize it a bit why not to take
advantage of this reactive approach and
that's it's very hard to find some more
information about about Java EE and
about standard frameworks and about the
things that you do normally with your
application how to improve it in a
reactive way seamlessly without any real
pain so I explored it a bit and I had an
idea to create it to create a talk to
summarize what I've found and to provide
a guide to other people how they can
already improve their existing
applications without rewriting
everything from scratch because it's
costly and nono manager would approve
that obviously
so so how do you go about it so what are
those you don't have to describe all the
the steps but what are the the steps are
the high-level
essentially what would I try to do with
in the presentation I'll try to first
explain what is this reactive thing
about what is this creative approach
about because I when I ask people I
found out that not so many people
understand the concept then there are
still quite many people who would like
to get the idea of without what what I'm
talking to about and what I want to
achieve with reactive programming and
what they could achieve with it
so what is it then I mean I thought it
was straightforward effective yeah it's
an alternative way of writing an
application or alternative behavior of
the application
I mean reactive behavior is that
applications behave differently to
traditional obligations in a way that
they respond fast to feedback they
inform users what's going on instead of
waiting until everything happens and
then sends a response and they try to
react to any feedback or any even or
even a failure as far as possible so
even failing classes is good for users
or for the clients to find out some
something is going on in to so that I
can react on to this and the application
can react also because it can either
retry immediately or I'll just do some
reconciliation based on the only failure
okay so the he said five you have five
steps so what are the this stuff yeah so
the steps are go from the easiest to the
hardest thing to do and I try to create
or to explain these steps as a guide on
what you could look into what we can
find in your application how to improve
it one step at a time obviously it's a
good to apply all the steps to to have
everything you would expect from your
applications from from simple things
like speeding of the obligations to much
harder things like keep everything in
the same context because with reactive
style you react to messages to either
event and they don't have they are
typically aren't processing the same
threat while traditionally we process
everything in one thread and wait until
something happens
some I or call is is finished so it's
important to understand this and to
apply all things but first we can we can
try to turn our calls into a synchronous
calls so that we can respond only after
a call through to a slow resource it's
finished we don't need to block the
thread of execution or we can reuse the
same thread to respond to other events
or inform back the client that something
has been started and winner he needs to
wait until until some another step is it
can continue to do to a request on the
slow resource so it's like loading in a
game when when computer game is loading
it shows that there is a world being
prepared that modules are generated so
in this way it's it's important to be
responsive in some systems in some
situations and I try to explain how to
do it on how to change the traditional
way of writing apps and even existing
apps how to turn them into more
responsive and reactive 2/3 even ok oh
I'm sorry I
I had a something bothering me my growth
so um so what do you recommend that oh
you have also a quick demo that you
wanted to show right yeah I can I can
show it it's it's enough
a quick demo that you could understand
without going into much details and I
used the Flex famous demo obligation
cargo tracker created by Oracle
advocates to show how Java EE concepts
can be applied in a geometry and design
and I use it in my presentation to
demonstrate how these existing
applications which is not the hello
world application is quite a big
application a one part specific part if
we can if we choose to its due to
optimizing in a reactive way how we can
do it in in the codebase already so what
I try to achieve is to have the
application behaves responsively to to
show what's going on and to react to to
react to the data that it can process
and sent to the user so the user after I
will now press the the button to to get
the response to get a new page and what
I focus here is that the response is not
doesn't take time to get to finish and
to get some feedback to the user so what
the application of effectively after
these modifications these reactive
modifications does it shows what's going
on let me show you again I press it and
it will immediately get feedback and
immediately after some commutation is
done I get the piece by piece by piece
until everything is done the progress
bar is gone so in some situations this
improves the the feeling from the
application it it also improves the
speed of the application because
everything is done many messages in the
background and you can scale your
application it process messages faster
on different nodes because so they can
be paralyzed and the computation can be
straight across 12 the nodes in the
cluster and they can
that it can be done in peril and much
faster and also in the code try to keep
the business logic untouched so it's
almost as readable as the original code
and here is the demo the only the the
infrastructure code changes the
boilerplate code changes but the
business logic stays the same
okay so any recommendation or resources
or do you write a blog or anything that
could help hold the first of all I all
the code I was showing and even all the
code I didn't have time to show in my
presentation is on my github which is a
link from other slides so we can go
there and find out more information
studies of codes so the changes I did in
the original application to get things
done but on reactive programming there
is lot of info resources as I said there
are lots of frameworks that are geared
specifically to reactive programming so
I recommend to have a look at them
namely its vertex framework or akka play
lagoon which most of them based on our
vectors these are more for scarlet
programmers but in teller you can use
you use them in the same similar way and
study their documentation because they
concept of the framework each of these
framework is heavily geared toward
reactive programming so even from all
these frameworks work you can understand
what's going on because there they are
built in this way on purpose to meet the
needs of reactive applications so this
is this is my main source I learned
about reactive programming and then
there are likely many good books since
reactive concept and reactive manifesto
which describes our applications should
work to meet these requirements
responsibility and reactive to changes
it's been here for a couple of years
already so there are quite many books
but they also have a look at reactive
manifesto org
it's a page where you can read the
basics and Java EE is going eight is
going to be released over the summer so
any any thoughts on which library people
could actually test yeah actually
Java EE already will have some more
support for for reactive programming it
already has quite nice quite quite a lot
of a synchronous API which you which is
essential in reactive programming but it
specifically jax-rs will have dedicated
support support for reactive API and
this API would make it a lot a lot a lot
more easy to bind your codes to
third-party libraries like rx Java which
make it much easier to write the code
I'm in my presentations I'm relying on
completable future which is already in
Java 8 butts libraries like Java are
again more talos to reactive programming
and processing multiple messages so our
jobs RS in divine 8 will make this mail
this integration between Java EE and
rxjava a lot of lot easier okay so test
Jack sighs then and it's available
online I forgot the number for this the
jsr is the 370 I think I mean I just had
any idea never remember the JSON as much
but be careful because there are the
different versions of the certifications
and different number days or numbers of
they they always change Jack's rs.20 is
different
rather than just one thank you
Andre I mean thank you so much for
stopping by and talking to us about the
reactive programming thank you and thank
you
damn thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
