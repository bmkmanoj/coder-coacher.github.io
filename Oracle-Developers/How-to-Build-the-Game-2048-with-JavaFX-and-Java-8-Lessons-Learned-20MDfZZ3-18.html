14 13 and he's counting down okay
now I'm able to talk okay allowed to
talk good morning why you guys aren't
here so early
I hate early sessions but I'm really
glad you guys are here so how many of
you played 2048 how many of you are
addicted to it all right there is this
way to get out of there you know just
you can you can try if you want okay so
uh under the Borgias this is a separator
and we came up with the session because
we are addicted to it kind of now let me
so what do you see it just by the way
this is like these lights were obvious
like that you're gonna see in this
session were built using a java fact
slide machine that Jose did
so if you want to learn about how to do
his lights that use Java and jump
effects talk to this guy
so this one here is actually really
playing a game that has a plate so he
embedded Java the game inside the
machine and he's replaying the games
there that's not a video that's actually
the java application running on load
inside the JavaFX a sliding machine it's
pretty awesome and he is very addicted
you see that he already got it 2048
but he's too plain I don't know how how
far did you go so already fair enough
for now okay so lessons learned
just to give you a so let's let's
introduce ourselves a little bit so yeah
we're gonna talk about the game the gel
effect version playing the game and some
conclusions we have something cool to
ask you guys at the end of this session
if you don't know about the game go
google organize cuz something we have
some t-shirts from the Java hub that I
stole yesterday and we have the guy from
PI dome that will do a demo then if you
win the game it will turn on lights at
his house in Netherlands yes if you lose
it it will explode the house no I'm
kidding it will turn on a red light so
there is a green light in a red light at
his house in Netherlands so if you're a
good at the game if we can finish the
game you also get a t-shirt if you don't
you may also get a t-shirt because it
would be nice to have our red light at
his house and his wife going crazy
what's going on okay so I'm gorgeous I
work at Oracle Latin America as a
product manager so I quite sometimes I
have to go to stupid meetings with
customers but I also work as a
journalist so I can balance that and you
can check me on Twitter if you want and
this is what I did
thank you don't know yes you can see I'm
a startled engineer so nothing to do
with this
so I can have two lives my day job is at
a university and also my day job and my
night job is playing with your affects
all the time so for instance I
co-authored Apple device x8 introduction
- by example with other guys which are
around the conference you can beat em -
and I used to vlog when the time permits
and this is my twitter handle where you
can talk to me at any time because I'm
addicted to the game
between all hind all the time working on
the tiny jaw effects and so so we are
going to first of all take or give
credit to the original author of the
again which is you can see there cannot
see very well my my laptop sorry
so is this guy a Gabrielle silly his I
think he's Italian and he made this or
something it's online it's in a confined
Hills he said other projects here and
well actually we can start by playing I
think most of you have tried this game
at the very first time of his website so
just sorry ok the third little grid for
him we are pretty knocks it off his
website html5 JavaScript and so on so
for those of you who don't know forget
him please
the first stop is here so the problem
with this session is most of the times
that we start demoing the game we start
playing it and we forget about a session
yeah right so then if you notice this
please stand up and say stop playing
okay
 it well we can do both yeah you can
just I have plenty of friends here yeah
okay okay I guess you know I'm a really
of you knows how to play the game so the
idea is just to do have only four
possible movements right left top bottom
and every time you move a new tile
appears on the grid there is a four by
four grid and you have to join equal
tiles to add them to use 2 plus 2 4 plus
4 and so on till you get to this magical
number which is 2048 but there are no
limits so you can still keep going and
you can make it till you completely a
fully the grid with around 131,000 tile
something like that yeah there is there
is a theoretical mathematical limit on
how far you can go based on the grid
size so each based on grid size of
because it's RPG right certain RPG which
is this term in in Portuguese I don't
know it's in at the progressive dramatic
whatever yes now the funny thing is that
there was a lot of Forks of this game
already using other stuff for example
chemical can chemical elements you know
you go moving that like put some
hydrogen plus hydrogen and you get
another element and then input that
element with something else you get the
third element and so on and so on so
it's really funny and how people started
building different things based on the
concept that you need to mash up stuff
and going growing up the the elements
inside but I prefer to play this on only
this one
some guy data
number version firsts crazy don't don't
try that right yeah but actually I have
to say that a the way we did it we can
play any grid any grid size you want so
yes the java fact if you go and get help
you get the project the project is built
in a way that you can customize easily
customize it so you can do your job FX
version based on chemical elements based
on planets based on and Mo's whatever
you want I don't know what what would
come if you put a giraffe ax in the
jirafa
if I have the portables but you can
customize the JavaFX version and you can
customize the grid size whatever they
want okay so we've seen the html5
version we will show the giraffe expert
and you can plug in any device you want
there are this this guy also may is iOS
iOS and Android versions and we can play
also in in in embedded devices
for instance we can play nourish Mary pi
because you just put the code is the
very same code there use JDK 8 for a erm
devices and you are good to go so there
is no limit we are also working with a
with a guy with your hand boss maybe you
know him to ported to Android straight
from Java FX and also we can make the
port front channel effects to otherwise
one of these cool things about Java
facts for this game is in less than 20
minutes or even less than that we were
able to add the necessary code to
support touch screen Jam effect has the
swipe
events built-in and when you run on a
platform like saying a raspberry pi
connected to a touchscreen there you go
now you can just swipe your finger on
screen and and you can play the game
well another quiz the example of the
the platform in this game was I need
talk I took the perceptual perceptual
perceptual something it's a device from
Intel pretty much like Kinect Microsoft
Kinect right and here he was able to in
less than a day implement the gestures
so the camera is looking at his hand and
he's playing the game 2048 like this now
that sucks right because if you are
addicted to it like two hours doing this
yeah not cool but it was funny because
it really implemented there really fast
the Java the Java platform Java fax
platform really easy just a little bit
of Java code and he were he was able to
plug the listeners in Java francs left
right up and down to the library that is
connected to the perceptual device from
Intel so really cool things you can play
with the game and in a funny and
interesting way to learn about the
platform learn about drug effects learn
about Java 8 which is by the way it was
the the main goal of this project I
wanted to learn Java 8 lambdas and said
run I wanted to learn Java FEX
when I saw the JavaScript version I
decided well let me do the JavaFX
version of this game so that's why in
this screen you can see the very first
version and you can see how good I am
with designing the interface and but
well it got worked working just a little
bit of about for Java classes was enough
to do this no effects in mail no CSS
just pure Java code on it
and like I saw that I saw that so I said
okay this is not good yeah so no sale
take a look he was addicted that's fine
his too is but he saw that and said oh I
can do better
in terms of the why and he jumped into
this boat and provided some poor
requests with lots of improvements in
terms of UI features and etc I mean
doing the fork from JavaScript to Java 8
it was really easy I mean when you have
a function where the JavaScript version
has this method that receives a function
when you convert that to Java 8 it's
just along the expression that you get
so it was actually pretty easy to do the
the my creation there the the fork to
Java and in about two three days again I
guess I had this version and I published
tweeted and Jose went crazy with the oh
my god Java Federation of just 48 so we
we started playing together with his
very first person we start and making
improvements in CSS at the beginning and
a lot of features came in and actually
were around 100 commits from that time
and every time I mixed up I start
playing with the game with this person I
find something to us so it is
never-ending so it's addicted we are
addicted to the game but also we are
addicted to improving the JFX version of
the game so everybody is for sure very
welcome to join us at the repo and let's
pull request or ask for features you
want because it's really a funny be
project but first of all all we need is
just for the repository and start
playing for the first time and then go
in deeper into the classes which is what
we are going to do now in the session so
sorry for the code power but we have to
we have to talk about what we have
learned here so we need to just have a
quick view of the classes we are using
as Bruno said we started with four pads
for more usability or a
and reading the code and put in the code
in more in in a molarity way we get to
this number of classes which are all of
them there is no no more missing so just
the application class and then we have
this game manager which is kind of the
engine of the government well again it
just load the board which is another
class which is all the UI it's on the
board pass the create the labels there
in the record which are labels the time
the all the tiles so the main or the
item class here is a tile this to trial
there is just a label nothing more a
label we CSS so the label is just a
number we put it as a string and then we
add some location to know where we put
the label so we have this location class
also here we use the relation to move
the tiles and we have this grid operator
will come later to this because this is
the way we deal with a grid using a
functional programming and to play at
once with all the tiles so just a few a
few more classes just to save the game
or story game or whatever so we'll we
will just a little bit of cloth code in
any of these classes I've done I'm not
sure if you are a DNR are watching are
you can suppose you can read the code
from the for me hi okay anyway so
direction is just an enumeration do you
can just say that they just are the
names here up right dollar
but we have also added in the x and
y-coordinates we we know where we are
heading
we have this value for which is just a
static method we used to compare the key
the key press and check if it's valid
for our four directions so we have
location which is just an X on Y the
traditional limit here not just meeting
for will between 1 and 4 of it in Surat
0 1 3 so you can use whatever size lead
you want so we need some layout methods
so we can put this label style on the
grid and just check if we are going to
move one tile which is already at the
border of the grid just to check it
doesn't get out of the border and this
is it so
those are four tiles four different
tiles as I say they are just the value
an allocation and we will add emerged a
boolean property feel just to check if
in the same play this style was merged
with other because otherwise we will be
merging a lot more than one scheme for
play so this is not in the game we could
do that but this is not the rules of the
original game
well the JavaScript version it had lots
of algorithms to check the tiles the
location etc but wasn't object oriented
now that's something that we changed in
the project since since the first
version there was a location class a
Direction class a tile class so we were
able to really develop this game object
oriented and each tile knows where it is
located and if it was merged to another
tile so two plus two becomes four and
the old 2 gets removed from the creed
the other guy the other tie becomes four
and then when it becomes four we turned
the merge boolean to false again because
it was already merged and now it's ready
to be merged with another 4 for example
so it was if you look at the classes and
the source code they are big I would I
want to be modest really awesome design
right this yeah the fact that we are CSS
it's is because because of that so I
just remove the CSS styling of the tiles
and it is just you just see that they
are just numbers string in numbers
so CSS that does the trick here so we
have in csfi you have a class four name
the name of the class for two four four
four eight you if you want to customize
would have to have your own classes CSS
classes for let's say hydrogen oxygen or
jirafa forever so we have the best he
says we have and the CSS for every
really tile available if we have a tile
which is not in a game we have known
know a stallion for that but this one
that won't happen on a plane so it's
it's from law firm for developing java
facts applications this is a good lesson
because you learned instead of spending
Java code to style stuff based on their
attributes
it could have classes for those objects
that you are aware that will be existing
in your application so to make the color
like that we would have to add at least
two maybe there are maybe two lines of
code we just say the class and that's it
so it's pretty much easier to not only
define but maintain if you we want to
support more we would just go to the
client the CSS file and customize it so
if you are building some Java FX
application not game-related
that's a good lesson to take from it and
then really work on CSS I mean which we
went from shitty UI for something cool
just by applying CSS so we were able to
have the Java Federation really exactly
looking the same as the original version
JavaScript just by applying the CSS okay
so we are going to get now into the port
so we have this create this for by above
by four grid
and we will take our time here I just -
okay so first version it was indeed that
loop because it just took the JavaScript
code copy pasted into Java
luckily JavaScript is similar to Java
can sometimes just copy and paste
according does work so here one of the
lessons is it can create something like
that with Java and some game developers
would say why are you doing that why
don't you use just image as a background
now the reason for that is we wanted we
have always thought in having the
application dynamic to define your own
grid size now you didn't want to have to
view the image in the background to you
know draw the image using Java so we
just thought it's just beaut
point of reaching go objects from Java
flags and give them some border and
that's it so it's that's that's why we
did that way so we have this
old-fashioned normal nested for loop but
we are going to show in just a few
changes how we can add up this
old-fashioned way to the new styling
which right so we can use arise and then
we can use this enhances for its loops
this is not a still deride which was
here since Java 5 I guess yeah so we
have a for loop here and we we are
always using this method to create one
cell one cell you know it's one of the
positions of the grid and we are this
cell which is just a rectangle to our
grid group which is a group so we can
embed this group on the
on the board so we can improve that
course and now we are going to see some
Java 8 and ah I have to say I'm not very
I'm not I said before I was to try
engineer are not in the computer science
so I think the right guy to talk is
Bruno bad for my point of view I have to
say there are a lot of ways you can do
divide streams
Landis and you have to have to find the
right the right one for you we have
found here around three or four
different persons if you want to talk
about an apron or maybe yeah so again
like the first version was already good
enough but like I said I wanted to learn
Java 8 lambdas and that's why changed to
this method of building it so I learned
about the inch stream class where you
can have you can say the range and it
will give you a stream not a list not a
collection it's already a stream that
can go through it using the streams API
now from that that in-stream I'll map it
to for each of those numbers which will
be I I will create another range that
will go again from 0 to 4 then will
become J and for each J process for each
J call I will then how to create cell I
and J so then I'm creating the grid
using using the streams so in this case
here you can see that there is a J in
stream one J in stream being created for
each I not that's not very optimized if
you compare with the previous version
where we had two array lists of integers
now here I'm creating five objects just
to do one simple create a matrix now if
you are doing that this is
something to take a lesson today from
here if you are considering to do this
with large objects don't do that if you
need to do go on made do matrix
processing really try to have the in
stream 4 J be reused instead of creating
for each I so here as soon as you see
with this double in strain we are again
ending with a strain of extremes so
that's why we have to use flood map
which is as it says something that
floods and setting that maps so we flood
the stream of air streams so we just get
an a stream and we don't need to map it
at the rectangle to anything different
that it at itself so we just use forest
on this method to say okay give me the
different product angles I have there
unease all of Terra are already
different so that we don't need to add
anything especially here so we are we
have here at the end this strain of 16
rectangles so we just added to the group
ok so this is one version we move to
another possibility which is instead of
using streams we use box which is
different because we have now the stream
and we can just use a for it so we have
here 2 4 it's for any of this string of
integers and we just call create sell
create rectangle for its of this inj and
we just add it to the group as we did
before
ok so it's just kind of the same but
it's not the same at the end you are
using just a primitive interest instead
of using a string with
in terms so the last version here and we
tried to split this double for this loop
using list so you remember from the
lipid that we use in the stream range
box okay so we take it take this out
collect it so we collect this what we
have is as I said a list of integers so
we call this traveler X and Red Sox
trestle Y so these are kind of the
intersection of the rows or columns rows
for X and terms for a while so now we
can let me just put some space there we
have this double for it's just iterate
in this list so this for it is not the
same we have found streams this forest
is using iterable okay so we are
iterating this two lists in a nested way
at the end we just create itself another
to them so the result in all of these
steps is the same okay so it's that's
the thing we are reusing the objects
instead of creating each y /j in stream
for each X so we're just going through
the traversal y again for each X and
that's I mean if you're thinking about
big structures that's something to
consider if you're at some point
thinking about doing this kind of stuff
so that's what just the final version we
ended yes splitting this into
a method so we call this method Traverse
or a grid and now as we are using a
method we can try to use a functional
here so when we call this method we just
send the the function we want to perform
in any of these cells of the grid so you
can see that as a functional RI method
which is from a point of view if you
have play with mathematics or arise in
some other languages a really cool to
have this functional array method
because you just put the function you
want and you get additional so if you
want for instance to say okay I want to
add the indices I have in all the
earlier I on the grid you just put
something like this just one question
how many of you have ever copy pasted
for loops to go through a matrix lots of
times right so now here what we are
doing is we we have a matrix and we want
to go through it but doing something
different every time we want to go
through it and that's why we turned the
for loop into a method that takes a
lambda expression of function that will
be applied to each of the elements of
that matrix now that's I mean this for
me was one of the best findings into and
when doing this project you know to have
a matrix and not having to copy paste
before look there the two for loops for
every time I want you go through the
matrix I just go and apply the whatever
function I want to have in this case we
these int binary operator interface
apply as I'm sorry
interface is from Java 8 we didnít write
that code so there are some interfaces
in the java.lang package in Java 8 that
you can use already
to take advantage for example here we
want to have binary operator that takes
two arguments so that's why we get the x
and y but we also want to have a return
and that interface in Java has the
method has a return text 2-inch
arguments and class return so in this
case here we were able to do some cool
things with the with this little method
to say for example is there any merger
vailable in the grid so I was trying
here to make some change but they are
not working so nevermind just to point
out what we are doing here we have a
functional way of making operations in
any of the cells at a time so we just
add the function here so maybe this also
add a reference to a method to put this
but just you can you can see how things
look at they can be done in Java it you
can play with this and you'll have all
in the repository so this is the first
the best one of the most interesting
discoveries in in this project so ok so
we are going to move to deeper here with
maybe some some of you are asking ok you
are using a grid maybe why not using
parallel streams here we have a really
hard time with this because we tried we
try to use progress streams that's
I'm maybe you don't you haven't realized
that we have no greed there because this
code is not compiling we cannot use
parallel stream here because in this
functional we are adding a reference to
a global group here which needs some
power in the way the cells are added so
it will use parallel stream you cannot
see the error I have the error on that
base if you want to see it we just go
for it right now
so just yeah that's when we were doing
with parallel streams we noticed that I
learned the hard way I hate reading
documentation so I learned about
compiler errors and I saw that hey you
know there are lots of issues when you
do parallel stream you really need to
know what's going on because 80 you can
definitely screw up your project with
just by changing two parallel streams
now just to give you a hand if you want
really want to change an object outside
the streaming processing you need to use
something like atomic integers atomic
the atomic classes to have a reference
to have developing updated inside this
frame processing and then you get the
result outside of it because if user
needs a primitive int or an integer is
on it cannot have that value later so
for instance here we are saying that a
recently the code is not compile image
because we are there having this
exception which you can read their
duplicate children added to the group so
sure
yeah yes yes sir yeah yeah exactly
no definitely not
yes or no no but just we just wanted to
stop it here see we take your correct
with there's a logical problem that is
stated in the documentation then I
checked it is there so now I take the
take out the parallel stream compile
again and we have the grid now yes in
this in this case here particularly in
this example years it didn't compile
because be using an interview I mean but
if we use an atomic integer it compiles
now there's two issues a year we that we
looked at one is the parallel stream
messing up with objects being created in
parallel the second problem was the int
being used that defined outside this
training process and be used inside the
streaming process
exactly exactly
remember remember when you used to pass
an int array to have a ain't object yes
exactly
so that's but now stop doing that use
atomic integer right okay so so i guess
this parallel string is really for
debate but we are just going to keep
going with a with the rest of the code
so just keep in mind is that parallel
it's very powerful but we you know
essentially what you have to do without
because otherwise you will get a
unexpected results we were like why do
we when we change from stream to
parallel stream and then we started
playing the game and somebody the merges
started like going crazy the two and two
are not merging what's going on
sometimes it merged sometimes it didn't
sometimes if the game said oh there's no
more moves available or even though
there were tiles available and so that's
that's why we learned that parallel
streams are awesome but at same time
period if you really have to be careful
on how and when to use them so we are
just going to the game manager which is
the engine of how we move everything
here so first of all we just add the
board which already has these great of
rectangles and we can start adding a
mystery method we just add new tiles so
we have a new random tile which which
means random value we are using the same
probabilities 90% probability of having
added to a value or 10% or four and we
had here just to show we just add a
location
encode hard-coded the rabbit this will
be also a do it randomly as you sorry
here and we are going to try to move the
tiles let me see if it works
okay it works we are moving the tiles
listening to the keyboard arrows and we
can move one one step one cell at a time
so the way we started doing this is
recreate in all over the game all the
time so we just copy the actual list of
Colet of tiles then remove all the tiles
and then add it all over again just with
an offset in their location so this is
not a way to do it but we started there
okay so how about how we did it okay
this is the way we star I won't stop
here just a if if I play this again we
shall have different render locations so
every time likely here that we should
have brand new locations okay
and on the values so we just suffered
the collection of possible locations of
the tiles and get two of them or one of
them and a random value just at a point
so all of this is Java delayed so I'm
not stopping a lot here because we have
many lines to tell about we could talk
about animations and other things but we
want to keep it simple so here we are
going to see another way of moving the
tiles so one thing we learn here is you
cannot do you cannot do always the same
approach if you are going from the grid
from left to right from top to bottom
all the time some cells will move
sandals
or move because the orderly are starting
to detect for possible movements and you
need to reverse the order depending on
the movement so we have this sort grid
method and we'll reverse that the list
the Exley's and the Wiley's accordingly
so we check all the possible movement
did do you remember this trash breeze
method we use which is the functional
alright kind of thing we have done here
and so we did struggle with that with
this functional alright we just need to
take care of its fell at a time so we
just take a lotof let me get the cell in
the ions a positive position if it's not
null okay find a place suitable for that
tile for instance if I move here those
two tiles should move let me check okay
dusty the style should move to the
farthest position available on the grid
okay so instead of moving one by one
they move to the very end until they
stop to the border or to another tile we
don't check for mats here still so if I
keep moving new tiles are appearing and
I will block the game okay
so I cannot move any so at some point we
need to check for possible matching
between tiles which are the same number
at a closed position
so we are not going to read all of this
but mainly we have a method to check if
two to one tile is merciful with other
and in that case we just perform
animation which are by the way it really
cool you just out of the box get a way
to see how cells
let's if you want we can just step for a
few seconds and chain this so you can a
good idea how the animation works
yeah it just pops out and it was really
nice again first version didn't have any
of that and ourselves saw it improving
it so we just add one line of code
called the JavaFX animation there are
lots of animations that you can use and
are really like out of the box you can
of course customize prom toys etc but
they are really good if you want to make
something nice we just take a look at
the animations packaged in Java bags and
and make use of them I strongly advise
you to create a project to try them and
then when you find something that you
like and then you go to your actual
project and add that animation to your
code so here you can play with time and
see how it goes okay so I just added
longest time to see how the animation
can perform you can appreciate for
instance when I when I met at two tiles
I make kind of pop up which is just
scaling you can see here a code so this
is for merging and I said to 120 percent
the size of the rectangle
actually make it make them different put
1.7 and 1.3 and as you can see a bigger
scale there in Google like different
sizes for each it got squeezed or
something like that you can you can play
with it and using longest times for
animations you see how it goes and then
when you are good to go you just put it
but I don't think I don't think there is
any showcase of jump effects animations
anywhere there will be something coach
have if you have time you know create a
Java fax application to showcase all the
animations available in java fax so we
are just at the end of the code here
again we have parallel so we we have one
we have parallel to check the level it's
a little easier if at the end of the
game when all the older grid is full of
tiles we had Google this method to check
if there are some pair of tiles we can
be melted and otherwise we just pop up a
game over now but this in this case here
it's like we are traversing the grid for
each direction and each direction will
be checked in parallel so you're gonna
check if there is merges available from
left to right or and up and down and
you're gonna produce that processing in
parallel but again we are not changing
any objects inside the grid we are not
doing any data processing we're just
checking the status if the objects are
there if there is anything available so
and in the end just yeah you see that
return zero so the atomic integer to see
if there is how many merges are
available
and since its atomic integer we can do
the parallel processing and they value
will be added to atomic integer sorry
that problem that's a new feature we
could add a hint for the user okay you
have three possible for particle
movements to possible that a pair of
tiles will be merged so it's not only
for the end of the game but also in
throughout the game you can use it and
pop up some hint for that you said if
you want rate them like move to the left
you idiot right sorry like that okay so
there are you did the user now yeah now
you come we can play you can talk and I
can play
okay no problem no keep going or what
just because I want to play no please
I mean my time of playing enough okay I
don't know it just what else to say but
we have a few more minutes left you guys
it's called the high dome guy very whoo
they take it they want to ask a question
yeah yeah and any questions for now and
you know so far yes that's the so that's
the JavaFX sliding machine
I don't know how do you call you do you
call like that sliding machine sir yes
so it's a JavaFX live machine JavaFX
application to these lights and you can
bomb the actual Java code decided so
yeah so that's another session are we
done with that topic no okay thank you
can you can you come to do the demo and
shall we ask them before yeah let's do
one question right now so who has
everyone to talk for it predefined okay
and focus on a while you know you know
have scores right the game has scores on
how many moves and merges you did so
what is the correct answer
yes so will you treat us which is the
right answer of this just
puts one two three or the number of
points and we discussed that and it will
be shown here the tweet and whoever
tweets gets a
how many teachers one we have two
t-shirts to this or okay so on the count
of three
neo to it welcome three go
go ahead now people are going crazy with
Wi-Fi yes please
yeah you have to add that hashtag if
it's featuring based on the hashtag we
have a winner
sorry
those like it was
yeah only one really wants to use you
those so we have two tweets only okay so
um main Fred who's me okay
more are coming what's their right
answer I don't know the right answer
I'm not that addicted to the right the
right answer is two so I think the right
right answer it's not your record okay
so that's bad you make it too loose at
the function I got a lot here over one
yeah we we can give this to guys which
is Alexander okay and Manfred sure
congratulations sure madam doesn't feed
stop by Java hub and never ask for
another sighs yeah I love her but I
think that it's it's full already
it's it's full my time I'm not sure so
maybe you do go there and see if there
is a queue lines no the hands-on lab yes
yeah sorry
yes it's for but maybe so what are you
gonna do is the project is on github on
a secret repository now what we gonna do
is publish that link Twitter after the
hands-on and then you can know that's
the game there is a repository of the
hands-on lab that Jose did awesome hands
on every day we're gonna tweet that link
after the hands-on so it will be
something around 5 p.m. I guess and you
can check there and then you can do at
your home and get even more addicted
that's it
I don't think so but do you do you want
to stop by at the hot garden cheese
maybe we have the time that's yeah I
mean tweet for us maybe now if you if
you are if you have a time right now I
will go to the hackathon place right now
so maybe we can talk about that they a
hacker garden a Java hop there are
tables they're used ok so then to play
one out when I showed your who wants to
play and try to explode his house in
Netherlands just come here and whoever
wants to play and if you get in less
then you have two minutes to make either
of the lights to be turned on so you can
do either 2048 in two minutes which is
really hard
no it's not possible yeah you try it
right or you can turn on the red light
by messing up with the game if you do
that in less than 2 minutes you get a
t-shirt as well anybody wants to come
here and all right awesome
so you play it and I will I will keep
playing here sure nevermind let's see
let's see how far you go house there
yeah can you can you make 2048 all that
great often up forever yeah I don't
think so you're busted now already
no no so if you want to play so who
hasn't played yet ok there is a tape you
only go to two directions always down
and left down and left though and left
if there is no move then you go up or
right right you can you can play with
left and right it's fine
but try to always put the higher numbers
on your bottom left or bottom right if
your right hand or left hand I don't
know you lost and the lights on awesome
all right cool did you give you a teaser
there hair teeth list yes ok you can we
stop by the Java hub and see if they
have your size in your exchange or you
sell this one and get a free one up to
you so and if you are if you want to
have any if you have an idea to improve
the project maybe do a we don't know
something that we have thought already
was to two people playing at the same
time at one locally the other one
remotely and using maybe WebSockets for
example and you're gonna see the other
guy plane and whoever gets first its
total 48 wings I mean I haven't seen any
any version of this product of this game
to play against another player that'll
be something nice to have yes I'm sorry
undo button so yes so he said he was
playing so much and he didn't want to
lose so he added a feature to save the
state of the game to restore if he
messes up so oh I got it wrong to
restore and go back goes back with the
sheeter let me tell you I did that so
you can safe at any time
like the in the old games you just make
a good movement and your I want to save
this in case it when I continue to go
wrong so just to save and restore
nothing else but you can do undo
whatever you want but at the end if you
are a true player when they have this
game you don't need that anymore because
it's it feels like cheating yes
so uh are you ready done yet just mess
it up man make it read explode the house
and that's it and and you you got a dude
shirt so just to wrap up and you are
either really good or you're even is so
bad that you can even lose the game
yeah you're trying for forty to forty
thousand or something so uh what other
thing is that we were like thinking
about for example the flat bird game
that went crazy on Android like I
haven't seen any Jam effects version but
would be nice if you some of you want to
learn gel effects and Java ch I strongly
advise you to do something funny with
those technologies to learn and I think
building those stupid but funny games is
like the best way to learn the new API
is the new technology instead of doing
those form
stupid applications right nobody wants
to do forms anymore so the whole flappy
bird do a Angry Bird whatever you do you
think you like to play on your phone
make a jump effects version of it
publish it and maybe you have Xhosa
giving you some CSS to make it 3d and
you learned John effects you learn Java
8 you learn game development you learn
tricky mathematical stuff I don't know
it's I think it honestly I think it's
the best way to learn new stuff doing
something cool and that's what I did
here so uh appreciate it thanks for your
time and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
