planets to learn more about ourselves
we're working to unlock the mysteries of
human movement we exist to be able to
make access to safe water available to
people that are in desperate situations
Java is there what my team does we work
on software that plans trajectories to
not only the moon that's in our
neighborhood but also the moons of
planets all through the solar system
many of the moons surrounding these
planets have liquid water underneath the
surface and where there's liquid water
there's typically life java and java FX
allow me to build visual interfaces
where the data itself is the interface
for the scientists this allows the
scientist to to work directly with the
data of the problem and therefore the
problem and the data space become a
natural extension of how the scientist
thinks that makes their life better and
it makes my life as a software engineer
from raiding their about a billion
people that lack access to safe water
it's a big need and it's just something
that we have a passion for and we've
been working at for the last 15 years to
try and resolve we look at essentially
kind of turnkey design and customized
solutions in the communities and places
that we work but we have over 250 staff
in 10 different countries that's 10
different currencies would have to be
accounted for we use Java to customize
our ERP system before we had Java there
are things that might have taken a week
to pull together that now we have
available at the click of a button Java
has been a real game changer for us and
it allows the people who are in the
field are implementers to be able to be
more effective more efficient to spend
more time on the things that they're
really meant to be doing and that's
implementing projects and touching
people's lives
as we've seen with the recent Olympics
the human body is capable of amazing
things and we're always pushing to find
new ways to run faster jump farther but
diseases that affect our muscles and
bones like cerebral palsy or stroke or
osteoarthritis can make movement
difficult or impossible Java has enabled
us to create a user interface for
opensim that allows anyone to explore
and understand how we move from middle
school students bio engineering
researchers to a clinician in a hospital
a clinician or researcher can simulate a
patient's ate and then use the
visualization and analysis tools in the
java application to identify which
muscle is tight or overactive and use
that information to provide feedback on
how to change movement and reduce pain
our team is incredibly excited and
energized by the fact that our software
is helping improve the lives of people
around the world someday soon a
spacecraft will begin recording back
data that tells us we're not alone in
sourced and I'll know that my software
helped if there's one takeaway from
people seeing this message I hope
they're inspired to go and make a
difference in this world
