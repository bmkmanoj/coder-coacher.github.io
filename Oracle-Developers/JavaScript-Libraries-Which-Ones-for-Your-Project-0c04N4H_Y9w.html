the session javascript libraries which
ones for your project and the subtitle
here probably summarizes the feeling
that many sensible developers out there
must have had at some point about the
very innovative very exciting yet very
unstable JavaScript ecosystem and this
is the abstract this is what you're in
for
JavaScript ecosystem is characterized by
innovation and change new libraries
appear all the time how do you choose is
it always the best thing to do to choose
the latest and greatest things in
especially in the context of enterprise
applications and in this session we're
going to try and make sense of that
ecosystem the libraries and frameworks
and we're going to look at some specific
choices made in the context of the free
and open source toolkit code Oracle jet
we're going to look at a few of the
other options out there as well but you
see quite some demos and code this is
really a code driven session but I want
to provide some context first so first
of all very briefly Who am I so here's
my Twitter handle when I miss here Leon
will incur probably one of the most
unpronounceable names for anyone who's
not Dutch and I used to work at Sun and
then obviously there was this point
where a Sun became part of Oracle or was
taken over by Oracle and I've been
working in Oracle on JavaScript for the
last few years
increasingly on the front end and I want
to talk a bit about that and about the
related solutions and as well so and
also actually my work before javascript
was a lot on the on the desktop I really
liked Java swing and maybe the last
remaining Java swing advocates around a
Java swing and the Java desktop are
wonderful places for a software to be
I've always been really involved on the
on the UI side so that's definitely a
connection with what I'm still doing now
in in JavaScript and and the main part
of the story of this presentation is
really about front-end JavaScript
development where the assumption is the
and could be Java typically via rest
endpoints WebSockets and so on but
really the focus of this talk is about
the relevance of JavaScript as a UI
layer in in applications I'm also
involved with another interesting
project code NetBeans which has been
around for quite some years it was the
very first development environment in
Java corrected in 95 96 right around the
time that job itself came about and and
currently we're in the process of moving
it to Apache so like there is Apache
maven Apache groovy and so on there's
also going to be Apache NetBeans which
will be the one and only development
tool in Apache and it's a long process
and I can spend days telling you about
it but that's not really the focus of
this talk it would be wonderful if a lot
of people would contribute to this
project so there's actually a github
repository already containing the the
core of the NetBeans code Moore is going
to be transferred there if anyone's to
chat about that it's great afterwards
also we're having a session in the in
hacker garden from 2:00 to 3:00 where
people are going to be working on
getting NetBeans ready for the release
are working on the Apache licenses a lot
of fun to do together so see the main
theme of this talk business applications
nowadays tend to look a lot like this
and so here you see a a dashboard for
for Tesco for time management you see a
health care application you see an
application by contribute
dot B e in Belgium Philip Iseman sitting
right here from that organization for
for handling truck drivers and you know
giving them a customer number and
enabling them to deliver the goods in in
the right location some math oriented
application and in the final picture you
see a internationalized application so
you can see some common concerns that
you have when you're doing an enterprise
development with these new materials
with creating these mobile apps and so
on in the enterprise space you typically
want to have graphs and charts you
typically at some point might want map
and another concern you have in the
enterprise is for internationalized
localized applications so these these
are kinds of the the topics that I would
like to take a look at here are some
more examples you want in the JavaScript
space to have mobile applications
typically or browser oriented
applications that are very much like
dashboards and these are typical use
cases for for JavaScript and in the
enterprise and then the question is how
do you create those and how do you
choose the the libraries that make up
user applications in the context of
Oracle if anyone here with a particular
Oracle background for these kinds of
applications typically for the front end
of these kinds of applications there's a
range of different choices by default on
this oracle ADF is Oracle apex as Oracle
forums definitely abstraction layers on
top of JavaScript and HTML not working
directly with with JavaScript or HTML
but some layers above that outside of
Oracle technologies there's really a
massive range of choices which is on the
one hand the wonderful thing about this
ecosystem that it is so innovative and
on the other hand it's also a problem
because first for example you hear about
grunt and you spend a couple of weeks
learning about the grunt build system
and you're very happy and proud with
your new knowledge and then everyone
tells it yes but
grunts is so last week everyone's doing
gulp now and then you spend time
learning gulp and you're very
comfortable with Gope and then it turns
out branch is the new gulp so this is
the ecosystem it's it's you know that's
the price you pay for for being bleeding
edge and large enterprises like Oracle
IBM PayPal etc etc all we have to deal
with this with this reality and how to
do what that reality is it's the
question in the case of PayPal is very
interesting there's a project called
Kraken Kraken Jay is calm so if you're
doing node based development if you're
doing note on the backend with Express
on the front end what has happened that
pay fo is that they have had that stack
for some years and they have added
components to that that they're used
internally and then that open-sourced
that so you can see in the top right
there it says paper open source and it's
really great because now the vp of paper
can go to developer conferences and can
address a developer's about what cool
things are happening a typo and of
course these large organizations are all
competing for developers so it becomes
increasingly important to be offering an
open source stack in order to attract
developers as well because it's a form
of convincing story to say to to a
developer hey come and work for our on
our open source project pick up skills
that you can continue to use after you
leave our project versus come and work
for our proprietary internal stuff that
there one outside is using and no one
nowadays works not 30 years in the same
company people tend to move every two or
three years or so to a different
organization so in fact when a developer
comes for an interview in an
organization it's the eurozone are
reversed and it's more that the
developer is interviewing the the
company to see where that can best fit
and having an open-source story makes
all the difference so in the case of
paper
there's crackin I also recently am on
Twitter asana so a announcement from
from the Walmart development team and
apparently there's also an open stack
that they are working on the TAFE that
they've released into the open source so
a lot of larger enterprises and
unexpected enterprises and have various
stacks of various toolkits various
attempts to standardize around this very
innovative ecosystem so in the case of
Oracle that is the case as well and so I
want to address the way Oracle has
approached this and show you some
demonstrations as well all these larger
enterprises what they have in common is
that they want to standardize on an
architecture in this very innovative
ecosystem and have a number of
requirements that are not what every
organization out there requires but what
but but what larger enterprises need so
these are the typical list of items in
their stable proven tool sets responsive
design so that if you create your
enterprise application when the
resolution changes to your mobile size
because a mobile app or a mobile device
is accessing the the app everything
refits itself automatically a big
concern for enterprises is accessibility
and internationalization and so you want
to have your application translated into
different languages you want to have a
standard way to do that you want your
components and the content of your
application to be accessible by means of
screen readers and external devices you
need to visualize the data in
interesting ways so you want to create
typically dashboard type applications so
you want graphs and charts security is
always a big concern of course in
enterprise apps you want to be able to
have performant applications you want to
be able to tweak the performance aspects
of an application and where standards
exist
you want to try and conform to them also
a common requirements in enterprise
applications in general another aspect
is that you want to focus on business
users and empower them to do their to do
their work so not only you focus on code
developers but also on citizen
developers and a another point here is
you want to have good documentation and
support which is also something often
lacking in the JavaScript ecosystem so
here are some of the hundreds of
libraries out there these are quite
common quite standard in many ways and
you have jQuery common library probably
everyone doing JavaScript make use of
jQuery for rest codes and Ajax and so on
secondly how you see jQuery UI so this
is a common basis for widgets in the
JavaScript ecosystem you want to have
some kind of data binding solution some
way to connect business logic to HTML
views and knock out as one of several
data binding solutions
what is nice about it is that it is
stable it wasn't created yesterday and
at the same time this is often the cause
of concern and this is something that
you really need to weigh up in
enterprise do you choose the latest
greatest thing react of you for example
or do you choose something that has been
around the world that is stable and that
can be used in the enterprise context
without being concerned where it will be
tomorrow
requirejs in a similar vein a module
system in JavaScript so javascript for a
very long time hasn't had its own module
system it does in the in the latest
release of acting script but there are a
number of libraries out there that you
could choose as if you want to do
modularity this is something you
typically do you want to do in the
larger application and enterprise
applications tend to be larger more
complex they tend to be the kinds of
applications that should exist for a
number of years so modularity definitely
helps and then if you're going to choose
javascript as your as your language and
as your ecosystem you probably also want
to get it onto a device and maybe not
only as a web app in the browser but you
also maybe want to get the app into the
App Store and the way to do that with
JavaScript is a means of attaching
cordova also known as a previously
PhoneGap so by this tool on the command
line you can generate an APK file or an
iOS file and so on from your javascript
so these are some typical libraries out
there that one might be interested in
so does happen to be the libraries that
have been chosen in Oracle and as the
basis of the Oracle jet architecture so
you can see here a kind of schematic
diagram of how the Oracle solution works
so there is there's the the backend
layer by a rest and web socket so what
that is could be anything
Oracle DB or any other DB on top of that
you have a you either have jQuery and to
access those back-end services or you
have something that is from that
particular toolkit itself a common model
based on backbone so if you familiar
with the backbone
model collection concept it's very
similar to that then there is knock out
for the data binding between that layer
and the view and then there are view
components different graphs and charts
on that on the highest level
there's also routing included and there
is required is for modularity so the
solution at Oracle is taken the path it
has taken is to say let's take these
libraries that are already out there and
bundle them together which is a very uh
norica way of doing things a standard
Oracle way of doing things is to say
let's pretend nothing in the world
exists and create everything from
scratch the the but in this case with
this with this Oracle Jett solution the
approach is hey there's so much
open-source libraries out there already
let's take a few of the of the relevant
libraries that fit our requirements that
are not the newest things but the
stablest things
let's bundle them together and add a
layer of graphs and charts on top and so
these would be the key ideas behind this
approach the first first of all very
important adaptable to change
if there's one thing that is true about
the JavaScript ecosystem is that it's
constantly changing so the most
important thing you can have and in an
application is a solid architecture one
where everything is cleanly separated
one where you can take out pieces and
replace it with other pieces that that
the newest things coming out next week
that you can play with them in the
context of your application and maybe
once it's more stable actually use it in
production you need to have a very
flexible architecture to be able to
leverage everything that the JavaScript
ecosystem provides the other important
aspect is browser based so and very
interesting thing about the browser is
it's everywhere every device has a
browser right your your mobile your
tablet your your your you know your your
desktop your laptop all have browsers
and what is built into the browser is
JavaScript so on the front end I'm not
talking about the back end the little
back end can be Java you know could be
Java EE as spring boots it could be
anything PHP node
on the front end it makes sense to ask
yourself or maybe especially for
customer facing applications especially
for customer facing applications
let's use JavaScript there and so this
is really a response to that
so browser-based adaptable to change
modern enterprise ready so when you're
creating enterprise applications you
don't simply want a loose collection of
libraries you want those libraries to be
there but you also want to have a layer
of internationalization solutions
accessibility solutions data
visualization solutions on top of those
libraries that everyone knows about so
that is part of the story very focused
on JavaScript and as I said you know
JavaScript is on the browser developers
new developers people coming out of
colleges and schools and so on come with
with kind of an innate built in
JavaScript knowledge versus the
proprietary tools and technologies that
an organization might provide so rather
than giving them a steep learning curve
into the proprietary technologies you
can say look you already know JavaScript
just join the team and work on a
particular module within the within the
application so that's the nice thing
about modularity you could say well this
is your isolated part of the application
where you can experiment and get started
with the with the the main problems of
the of the application open source so
Oracle has a range of open source
technologies github.com slash Oracle you
find find them listed there including
this particular solution it's also a
sales enabler so when when Oracle goes
to two customers or prospects and talks
about the Oracle cloud there's heaps of
different Oracle cloud services if
there's one thing that's true about the
Oracle cloud is that there's there are
many different services and what helps
is to have a coherent UI layer on top of
that that kind of hides the complexity
and that works with the rest endpoints
and the soap coming out of those
different services and creates a nice UI
on top of that so that's what this is
used for and it is used throughout
Oracle Oracle is increasingly moving its
front-end layer to this technology so
it's called Oracle jet and Oracle jet
stands for Java Script
extension toolkit it is our ACLU's own
internal set of solutions for doing
JavaScript on the front end it's been
open sourced so it github becomes - or
across - Oracle jet you'll find all the
components that are part of this and it
is all based on top of standard existing
libraries so jQuery jQuery UI knockout
require Cordova it's modular so you can
take out the pieces that you want adding
your own libraries adding your own
components it's very flexible and I'm
going to show you how to get started
with it so that's basically a small
starting point and I'm gonna watch your
way we are in terms of time but let's do
a quick demo so I'm just gonna open up
the command line here and create a new
folder make your Java one powder Java
one and hopefully this is somehow
visible I'll just call out what I'm
typing and I'll go into that folder and
then I'll say a jet so there's a tool
for Oracle javascript extension toolkit
you install it via in TM a jet create my
app and pass it a template so here is an
argument for a template and I say nerve
drawers as one of the templates and
press ENTER and now the NPM is done
unfortunately I'm not on the Wi-Fi among
hard line here and NPM cause done yeoman
co is done under the hood sets up my
application and so it's going really
fast and here you can see the result
long list of libraries from thanks do
node so now we've got into that and into
that folder and I type yet serve and it
opens the browser and what I see in the
browser is the starting point of my
application let's see if I can make it a
bit smaller so we can see everything
you can see here that I have a starting
point and with some tabs along the top
here and when I change the resolution to
something smaller I automatically have
this little responsive design mobile
menu with this hamburger icon that you
would expect on web hour devices without
doing any coding I have a basic
application setup so let's take a look
at what this looks like in terms of its
structure so I'm going to open it now
open the project go up here into that
folder because there's a package.json
file in there NetBeans knows this is a
project so I can open it here it is and
we can see let's make the visits I'll
move it a little bit so you can see it
more central on the left hand side here
you can see here a nice sauce structure
and what is nice about it is that there
is a concept of convention at the
configuration so looking back in the
browser you can see here that there is
dashboard incidence customers and about
and on the top here and that is
reflected in the structure of the
application so we have dashboard and a
dashboard JavaScript file so this is the
business logic and you can see how I
define block this is a require module
and a dashboard HTML file for the view
so that's all so when we build so I
didn't add yet serve what is done is
this Web folder is created which is
essentially your staging server or your
staging location and in that staging
location we have also our libraries so
here is a list of libraries so that you
can see included there is required for
example and jQuery required jQuery so
here all the libraries if you wanted to
add your own libraries into that you
would go into the main file this is
simply a required for figuration file
and add in your own your own libraries
references to the location of your
libraries and then you would load them
into the application in what is
essentially the public static void main
so from the Java world public static
void main in the
is world require block so this there is
one of these in the application just
like there is one public static void
main in a java application on the
desktop them so this is your entry point
and here you load whatever modules you
want to load at startup and then inside
of each of the modules you specify which
of the different components and
libraries and so on you want to refer to
here so it's really a modular system
it's it's a lazy loading eager loading
type ecosystem so we have our
application it's not exciting yet it's
running in the browser and so this is
dashboard content area so look what
happens when I type something different
here so a tank I change this to hello
Java one and I do save and I look in the
browser and automatically it's changed
that's because that command-line tool
has a watcher and you can see that I've
made a change in the HTML file that
command-line tool automatically picked
up the change and reload it into the
browser so this the workflow is really
fast and the next step is I have my
application up and running so now some
what I've done here actually is
described in the get started section you
can install via npm Oracle jet onto your
system and then run as I did I just
create with a template you can also run
that with hybrid which will add a
Cordova folder into your application so
you have Cordova support built-in so the
next step is okay let's add some content
so I go into the cookbook and here are
all the components is all free
open-source components but you can use
in your application including some
really cool ones which are graphs and
charts at the end here so one of those
charts is this one so here you can see
that and we have chart but we also have
code so I'm just gonna make this a
little bit larger so everything fits in
so you can see here a chart and here's
code JavaScript and HTML you can see
there's a toolbar along the bottom here
and you might think well this is
interesting for my application but I
don't think I want this toolbar
so let's tweak this directly inside the
this little editor here you can see here
that you can see a something here it
says urge a toolbar so I'm just gonna
select that house section a toolbar
it's going to select that here and then
with my delete key deletes it and then
in the top right you see my mouse is now
on apply so I click apply toolbar is
gone so you can tweak these components
live in the browser and then you can
take what you like so here's what I want
a jet chart then I got into my
application I paste it there there you
go
and it's gonna format it for a second
and maybe we don't need error checking
and you can see that we have a range of
our properties here so keys and values
so the assumption is in the Aquajet
that the view isn't in the HTML file and
the JavaScript file of the same name
contains the business logic so here's a
starting point of that so we go back
into the browser here is damage is here
is the JavaScript copy this and then I
go back in here and I paste this into my
JavaScript file format as well to make
it look nice I've just simply got now a
series of properties which are
referenced in my HTML and you can see
there's a hard-coded content here for
this data but I could use jQuery or some
other technique for querying a rest
endpoint to replace that with whatever I
get from my for my data back end so I've
copied in the properties so now that
I've been here and I can see that here
is a section this requires section
provides references to all the pieces
needed for this particular component and
we're using just the charts so I'm just
going to copy the reference to the idea
chart and included here so this is
essentially my import statements from
the from the Java world in the in
JavaScript I save this and I save that
of the note coding and oh and in my
browser I see my charts and it's got
some very nice fine-grained behavior
here as you can see so no coding so far
so now let's add a
select item in here so a drop-down and
the reason for that is that we want to
let the user change from a bar chart to
a pie chart for example so now we doom
it in the code so I can see it's a pie
chart or we can have a line you save
this and now it's a line chart but you
want to let the user make that choice so
we can go in here and take from here our
our drop-down so you can see it over
here on the left hand side you can see
it in action and probably what we want
we don't want to have these these
different explorers you want to have
like pie and bar and this will be pie
and this will be bar these are two
different types of charts so then I say
apply and now you can see we have pie
and bar okay looks good
so now copy it and I paste it and let's
format this a little bit so now we have
a drop-down here and a chart so you can
see these are custom elements so this is
hiding not outdated bindings beneath it
so actually underneath we have knockout
data bindings but there are custom
elements above them enabling us to
potentially in the future rules knock
out and put in a different data binding
solution so now I go back in there and
there's a reference here to a property
called Val so that property is defined
in the JavaScript soak up the JavaScript
go back here and I stick it in there
hair right there or anywhere and I save
it and now when I look in the browser
you can see that we can select oh wait
we need to do one more thing we need to
include a reference to the Select
component because we haven't loaded it
yet so again this is this is exactly
like import statements in in Java
now we're back into the browser and
though we can select something different
you can see that nothing is updated
because there's no connection between
these two components so where is that
defined so you can see here that we have
this Val here and over here we have this
hard-coded line so let's replace that
with well and let's get into - Modi is
and we say that the the default value
should be PI so we have we have two
values PI and bar the default will be PI
so we go in here now we have PI and now
we've bar and we got in here now and
let's say ok let's add some some more
content we have pi on bar but you also
have line so let's add line and there's
about 10 other ones that we could have
instead as well so now we have PI bar in
line so PI bar and line so this is
basically the the programming model you
set up your application via the command
line use the cookbook you copy and paste
code and you connect the different
pieces together and in your in your
application adding new so each of these
are actually modules adding new modules
is really trivial if you take a look so
actually we can do that so I'll take my
about GIS and I'll place it here and
I'll call it let's call it we rename it
to Java 1 so here we have Java Wan Jia's
and yeah are copied about HTML and our
name I'll rename this to receptor rename
this to to jabber 1 HTML ok so in a
ninja on HTML we'll have Java on rocks
ok so now how do you hook this into the
application or there is a central
controller JavaScript file here so you
can see here that there's a navigation
section and this there as a routing
section here so I'm just going to copy
this customers here copy this and paste
this there and I'll say this is so Java
1 so it's this convention of a
configuration the name of the file
determines the name of the
of the reference here so we're live Java
one and here let's take this guy and you
know we have Java one and here we have
one and go back into the page
automatically reloaded and here we have
well we have to actually restart because
when you add new files we need to start
up the server again that's the one place
where the odd yet serve has to rerun so
here you can see Java one rocks and
adding new modules from reading modules
it's just removing a reference from that
central controller file now what more
can you deal with this so we're talking
about business solutions so let's run
this other little example here so this
is just combining jQuery with require
and knock out into us into a single
application here you can see that I have
this very cool widget and so I'm sharing
this widget to to the colleague and my
colleague is creating another
application with some other business
objects where that's where they say to
me well I want to render my business
objects in the same way as you were
doing here so how is this done so you
can see here that there's this reference
to library j/s so we take a look here at
in public HTML this is we are in 21 so
we looked at library Jas and library
HTML so you can see here that there is
library HTML and there is a reference
here to something called demo card
now of course demo card doesn't exist in
the HTML specification this must be
something I've created myself so let me
see here a reference to demo card and
looking in library is something is being
loaded here and you can see here there's
a loader and what you can also see here
is that for that there are two that are
these two customers that we have that we
are showing here so if I change Susan to
John for example I save that you
automatically see now it says John so
here is the data it could count
from a real rest endpoint right now it's
just hard coded so here is a reference
to something called loader so we look
inside jet composites and there is
something here called demo card now what
this is is the implementation of the web
components standard the web component
standard widely accepted standard for
defining widgets such as these the nice
thing about the Oracle implementation of
these components is that you can see
that you can load them into your module
as as I've done here enabling you to use
that custom element so here is the the
custom elements which is the reason why
I'm able to say demo card here is
because I've registered that demo card
and it consists of these particular
files and they're all in the same folder
enabling me to zip up that folder and
send it to my colleague you can unzip it
into their application and also this is
how Oracle Applications the sales cloud
HCM cloud all these front-end products
are going to be extensible so this demo
card you're also able to load into the
sales cloud or into HCM cloud or into a
variety of other Oracle products over
time as they transfer to taking the jet
approach to to the front-end that will
also all be extensible in the same way
so you could imagine creating a task
list component once in jet and then
being able to install the task list
component into a range of different
Oracle Applications or your own
application or any application that's
created on top of the jet architecture
and a final quick demo to show you
something interesting about this
enterprise aspect so here we have a
clearly a greeting in English so now I
move to French so no big surprise there
but there is a standard structure to
internationalizing applications and also
the components so this is actually a
date and time picker from a Roku jet and
you can see here that now it says now
it's an English here and now it's in
French so now the this calendar
component in French and now it's in
check so oh so all the components are a
part of this oracle jet-propelled
library have all been translated already
this is like a 190 different log cows or
something that is supported and that can
all be extended as well
so now if I switch to Arabic you would
expect not only that the calendar
content changes the Arabic characters
but also that there's a right-to-left
support wouldn't that be great so this
is literally two lines of JavaScript in
the application to change the it's
basically changing the HTML tag RTL
support from from right to left and it's
it's already trivial to do and now we
have an Arabic component here
well it's move enough Arabic in there so
this is these are typical requirements
that you have when you're creating
enterprise applications you want to have
a standard way of internationalizing you
want to have data visualization
components you want to have support for
the web component standard and all of
this is provided here out-of-the-box for
free and open source and there is a tab
here that you will see on the page so if
you go to our approach at dot-org you
will see that there is a link here to
success stories and here you can see
what people are doing with it for real
outside oracle as well so these are
organizations using jQuery require
knockout in the context of Jetts
together with the data visualization
components and you know more and more
can be added here and you can see along
the bottom you can see some of the
Oracle Applications increasingly more
and more will be added to this page so
this is where we can promote any work
that you're doing with jet using these
libraries and using the the toolkit as a
whole so that is the way that Oracle is
approaching the problem of JavaScript
and solving it by at least internally
standardizing around a common set of
libraries this was a project started
about four years ago and inside Oracle
we didn't talk to anybody about what we
were doing
we were just we were at a point where
there were different organizations doing
things with JavaScript someone using
angular some were doing sin chess and
we're doing this someone doing that and
at some point in a large enterprise you
need to standardize and so jet is the
common architecture throughout Oracle
for doing JavaScript then after about
three years three four years of internal
having proven it
and we open sourced it and we've started
talking about it's about a year ago I
talked to started talking about it at
open world last year and it's it's all
up a source it's not just available for
customers or partners it's for anyone to
use and there's a very the most lenient
license there's no money you need to pay
anybody no permission you need to ask
you can just use it and literally
getting started is as simple as
installing that cut that command-line
interface via NPM NPM - gee install
Oracle Oracle Oracle jet fly and then
you can do a jet create and but the
command-line interface that you do a lot
more as well so if I can switch to a
different so here if I do a jet help you
will see a range of other commands that
there are so you can you know you can
clean you can build you can add
platforms you can add hybrid support
afterwards so you could correct your
whole application for the web and as a
browser app for the for the desktop
browser and then later think oh hey I
want this to be in the App Store as well
and you can say oh jet add hybrid and it
will add a Cordova folder to your
existing application and then you can
run a jet build and it will
automatically under the hood do the
commands for building that application
for hybrid hybrid usage so it's all
about being productive and and trying to
solve the problem of this innovative
ecosystem so the Arabic cloud that you
hear about all the time and almost
unavoidably at its open world in Java
one at every keynote and whatever you go
to is is a layer inside Oracle beneath a
thin UI layer and that is actually jet
and and you sometimes you might hear
that word yet but often it's you just
there's just sessions and talks and and
so on about these different cloud
services and what they can do for you
but that common layer is on top of it
this jet we really see this as as
something that we can use to talk about
the cloud so when we go to different
organizations and it's a very easy way
to introduce the
because it ties the different services
together it's focused on the browser
it's focused on letting you create your
application very quickly set up very
quickly be very productive with it and
it provides a range of into business
services on top of that very focused on
JavaScript that's really the B language
to use in this context but the backend
could completely be Java could be
completely be anything anything you like
modern there's also the outer UI style
sheets that you can get so you can go to
outer you viacom so in addition to the
to the architecture of the oracle cloud
which is jet you also get can get the
style sheets of the Oracle cloud which
are also available so if you go to outer
eurocom you'll get all the style sheets
that are used for all the Oracle cloud
products its focus on being open so this
is really the key difference between
this and angular in particular angular
is really a framework and in the Oracle
context EDF is a framework but this is
really a collection of libraries so it's
really it's really a toolbox so
theoretically what you could do is you
could just take the components and put
them into a different application you
don't necessarily have to adopt the
entire architecture you could say well I
like the graphs and charts I want to use
the graphs and charts in my angular
application whatever other application
there's a few tricks to that it's not
really made for that but those things
are conceivable definitely conceivable
to take out the data binding knockout
and put in something different I've
experimented with view as an alternative
to knockout for for data binding I have
a project it's not officially supported
it's you know if you ask questions on
the forum people will not be able to
help you speaking of which there is also
so I've mentioned the cookbook how to
get started there's a learning section
and there's a MOOC you can take in three
weeks you learn everything and we've run
the first MOOC end of last year
beginning of this year we're working on
the second version of the MOOC with with
the new updates to the latest releases
for example the command-line interfaces
new there is
a Support Forums I have any questions
there's a forum where the Oracle jet
team itself helps you to answer
questions that you might have and
supports you there's a blog there's all
kinds of resources actual espresso
developer guide and lots of videos on
YouTube so we're really building a
community around this so data
visualization all kinds of data
visualization components to that hope to
change open-source enterprise ready you
throughout Oracle and here are some
examples if you walk around the demo
grams area you'll see you might see
Solaris dashboard if you see graphs and
charts and you see it being really
responsive and fast the chances are
there is actually a jet application on
the front end data visualization cloud
service I really want to leave one or
two minutes over for questions so just
to quickly run through this I've
actually mentioned the key differences
between jets and and other options
already but just to point them out again
this is not a framework this is a loose
collection of of libraries which is the
right way to approach the innovative
JavaScript ecosystem you don't want to
be locked into a framework you want to
be flexible and the other thing is it
has its own data visualizations and if
you compared for example to angular you
have angular and you also need to have
ionic next to it and you if you're doing
mobile development with jet you correct
your application once you have your you
have your graphs and charts once and you
can run those graphs and charts and
everything I'm worried about as well as
on the desktop browser you don't have to
add anything to make it a mobile thing
and of course the difference is the spec
is really strongly backed by Oracle so I
should leave it here thank you very much
for coming and for sticking through this
whole story it's a it's a really
exciting new development and thank you
very much for coming
other other any questions for anybody
yes question there but also if anyone
wants this to be presented in your
organization please let me know we're
happy to come over we have to describe
close with you WebEx
free sessions on this topic may be best
to come here if you have questions yeah
