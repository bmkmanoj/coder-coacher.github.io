New York City,
I'm Bob Rhubart with the Oracle Developer Community
and my guest for this segment is Brendan Tierney.
Brendan, how are you doing today?
I'm doing good.
Tell me a little bit about what you do.
I'm a independent consultant based out of Dublin, Ireland,
doing everything from data architecture to
machine learning to just working with
data to make more sense out of it.
What are you talking about in today's event?
Today's presentation is kind of a fun one
that I've tried to put together over the last few years.
It comes from &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot;  many, many years ago.
It's about the One Ring that governs all of these other rings,
and is able to control lots of different
busy people and groups.
In a way this relates a lot to SQL, which is kind of like the one language
to rule all your data.
It's not just about being able to process data and analyze data,
but it's about being able to access lots of different types of data.
Well, if we start off with the analytic side of things,
most people don't realize their
analytic capabilities that are
there by default in the SQL language.
If you take their Oracle database as an example,
there are nearly 400 different statistical functions within the database.
And if you actually ask most people, they can probably count the
number of SQL functions they use on their fingers, on their two hands.
But there's so much more there.
But we keep on hearing lots about other languages and other
products and tools to go off and use for analytics and statistics.
But maybe we need a stick closer to home and reuse that the skills
and build upon the skills that we already have.
So that's the first part of the presentation,
being able to look at all of those kind of capabilities.
Now, I'm not going to go into lots and lots of detail about them,
it's more of &quot;here's a pointer, go have a look.&quot;
And then the second bit of the presentation looks at...
Well, if we go back to our database tier
we have the three schema architecture.
So we have the external schema, the conceptual schema,
and the physical schema.
And in a way, you know, relational databases
are no longer relational databases.
They're like kind of a multi-modal polyglot storage engine, really.
And when we go looking at the data,
we can store data in tables, in XML format, in JSON format,
we can access data in external files in a variety of different formats,
we can do spatial data and geographic data,
we can go out to data on Hadoop, we can go out to data in lots of other
No-SQL type database environments.
And yes, organizations have lots of different products to facilitate that.
The last part of the presentation talks a bit about security,
because if we have lots of different
products doing all these different
things,
how can I ensure that the data that Brendan
is allowed to access in one particular system follows
true into all of these other systems ?
So if we can use SQL on the database as our data access point,
we can have greater access and control and security and protection
of our data through the database using the one language,
rather than fifteen different varieties of the same languages,
or a variety of different tools, which then brings us back to
the one language that we can use to query all of this data.
So I can write one query and that can access all of those different data types.
You've written four books on various aspects of
business intelligence and data analysis.
The latest of those, if my information
is correct, comes out in April.
Yeah.
What's that book about?
It's called &quot;The Essentials of Data Science,&quot;
which comes out as part of the MIT Press Essentials book series.
If you're a business person who wants to come along
and kind of find out about this kind of technology,
or this new concept that's out there in the industry,
this is something you can pick up as a quick guide
that will get you through the introductions and aspects of it
so you can understand it, as well as some of the
slightly more advanced features.
It's about data science, but we've tried
to take all technical and statistics and
the whole maths out of it.
So it's hopefully a more plain-English kind of version
of what data science is all about.
You're very much engaged in community activities.
Obviously you're speaking here at Oracle Code,
you do other events on the other side of the Atlantic.
Thinking on all of those different appearances you've made
and different presentations you've done,
what's the most common question you're asked?
The most common question I think I get is,
&quot;Can I do that in SQL?&quot;
Which is part of this presentation as well.
Because I've given this at some of the other Oracle Code events,
and at one in particular I had some people
come up tome afterwards and ask,
&quot;Does it have this statistical function,
and does it have this statistical
function,
and this statistical function?&quot;
and so they listed about five, and I went,
&quot;Yes, yeah, we have that in the database.&quot;
&quot;We can use that.&quot;
And then they came up with about three more,
and I was not sure.
So what's the one thing that we never do anymore?
We never RTFM!
So read the fabulous manual!
I've heard that!
So we got out the manuals.
We looked it up, and were able to find out
that for those three statistical functions,
hey, they were there in the database.
One of the people said, &quot;thank you very much,
you've just saved me $300,000.&quot;
Because his stats team were using the database,
but they said, &quot;We also need to do these other statistical tests,
but database doesn't allow us to do it,
so we have to use this other product.&quot;
And the problem was that they didn't read the fabulous manuals.
Well,  those functions actually do exist.
And he emailed me afterwards and said,
&quot;Yeah, I went back to them, showed them
the functions, and they were happy
to go with using SQL Developer
as their interface to the database.
and they no longer needed that other product.
So you saved them 300 large.
Did they come across with a little taste for you?
That's alright!
Unfortunately not.
If you could take today's session and
squeeze it down into one sentence,
what would that sentence be?
RTFM.
Fair enough, fair enough.
Brendan, thanks for stopping by and  talking to me.
It's always fun.
If you'd like more information on any of the upcoming Oracle Code events
you can visit developer.oracle.com.
Look for the events link.
You'll also find plenty of articles and other content
by developers, for developers.
Thanks for watching.
For the Oracle Developer Community,
I'm Bob Rhubart.
Stay tuned!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
