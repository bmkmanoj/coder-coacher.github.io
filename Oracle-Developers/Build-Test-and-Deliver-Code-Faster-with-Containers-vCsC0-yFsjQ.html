this room full of everyone wake up early
no people who went to the party one last
night oh not a lot of people interest
party one right so that yeah those those
are still sleeping right you know but
thanks very much for everyone to be here
we realize that there's a whole lot of
things going on at JavaOne and we really
appreciate the fact that you guys are
here early in the morning with us so
let's go and and actually today's also
the Oracle code event right so who's
here for the Oracle code events not here
for Java one everyone is here for both
good there's a couple of people good yes
because that was an experiment that we
did to open up for for this day for
Oracle code guys okay so thanks thanks
for the ones that come here all right so
let me start by asking you a few things
about you guys so we're gonna talk here
about containers and I was talking
watching him land for so nice to meet
you or just talking here before ready
all right sir blend for support thanks
man for so it's all gonna blend for here
and so let me ask you one thing here
who's here have a a full pipeline for
automated pipeline for deployments okay
a couple of people a few people right
thank you so and every time we talk
about containers is very very important
that we have the full pipeline right so
so that's so that's we're gonna talk
about here today so who here already how
who he is already using containers in
your in your own machine experiment with
containers make them into darker okay
cool lots of people's can experiment
with docker
that's that's cool so who here is
already running darker on your pipe on
on on your you know QA testing
environment for example okay a few
people who's running darker on
production alright okay cool and there's
a few okay so don't forget any question
it's okay no okay get this good all
right so we're going to talk here about
today now so first things first
this elder Morais it's a Oracle Angeles
for Oracle clouds
my name is Bruno Sousa and I'm known as
the Brazilian Java man I'm the guy the
flag right so if you want me to see that
that flag gonna fly going around that's
me and we have this this presentation is
based on a series of articles so if you
guys are gonna go deeper on this
discussion and actually see all the
source code and all the steps and
everything instead of taking pictures of
this of the slides you can just go to el
de mirage : / articles and you have this
series of articles you have all the
source code everything's there okay
alright so so let's get started in our
objective here is help you guys it's you
know lots of you or not is not even
start with containers yet so let's let's
kind of take a brief overview what what
why it is important and how we can use
this for a Subedar pipeline so first of
all we all know about containers right
you know who here's using Java EE or
ever to use the Java at some point in
your life right yeah okay so everyone
use a Java you so so we've heard this
whole thing about containers in the past
right you know you get the whole idea of
containers is well you know what what is
the whole idea of containers why do we
why do we do containers on Java EE right
so let's let's ask an even basic
question right so who here has you know
those little plastic box that you put in
your freezer how they call Tupperware
who your notes or the topo areas right
okay so everyone knows the purple areas
right so that is the container so why do
we have tapa we're in our in our
refrigerator safe keep things safe what
else why do we have top where no
refrigerator organized excellent what
else what else
come on what for to check what to check
what inside don't you protect try to
protect what inside it there's something
well he said it keeps seeing things safe
right to protect what's inside what else
mmm yep separation right keeping from
things messing up was
Oh guys are so put labels on it right
yeah categorizes things right so make it
hmm easy to move very good right so I
know it can take from the refrigerator
put in the freezer you know take out of
the freezer put in the microwave take
out a microwave put it on the table
right so it's very easy what else hmm
thanks fresh right okay so you know what
you guys just know everything about
containers right you know that is
exactly the reason why we use containers
for software it's the same thing right
we want to we want to categorize things
we want to keep seeing safe when I keep
seeing things separated there's one
reason what one you know when I keep
seeing separate from each other so they
don't mess up with each other right we
want things you know uh you know
together with the things you said we
want things to not smell outside of
their area all right so if something
goes goes bad it doesn't it doesn't make
the whole thing bad right in the whole
refrigerator right it's very easy to
move things around it's so so that's the
whole object of containers and and then
there's one last thing one that's it's
kind of information bye bye you guys bye
or getting things organizing but let me
say your thing if you if you put a lot
of things in your refrigerator it out
put inside this plastic box can you put
more things or last thing in the
refrigerator less things right so when
you put things inside containers you can
stack them up you know in a nicer way so
in this in the in the software industry
we call this density right so increase
the density of things in the
refrigerator right so all of it so
that's why containers are for right so
the softer contains the same thing and
we all know about containers for a long
time so this is the Java EE architecture
right you know oracles architectures
like a four of little box Suns ones are
round and things your course here in the
Sun time you remember the round the
round boxes right so it's but I know all
of all of the square boxes there
we do this in Java EE right so you bet
you get a java application you package
inside an ER or a war right and then
that is your packaging that's your box
right there
your plastic box and then you are able
to put in different application servers
so you're able to move them easily
you're able to install in different
servers in an easy way you're able to do
all the things right so so the fact that
you are able to package your application
side of container was extremely
important for us in the Java EE you were
right so it knows that remember how we
did those things before Java EE before
Java it was very complex right track and
and still I know there are some
languages out there that you don't
package anyway so it's you know so when
you deploy things like I'm big massive
lots of files around and and you know
well I'm working if with some accustomed
doing PHP application there you know the
hardest probably we do having doing
their pipeline is actually merging
everything that's on their production
server with the other things on key a
server we have seen them development
server because everything is mastered up
right because they don't they don't
deploy application I did just kind of go
on the production server and change
codes right there right so you know we
we fix it those those whole things with
with Java EE by packaging things inside
a container right that allowed us to do
a lot of a different application servers
right so no oh man this is late this is
lights already outdated right yeah it
should be e EE 40 now right okay so you
know so we have all this kind of this
this server it allows us to move very
easily our application among all those
servers that's very very important ok
but what happens if you know this is the
application server layer right so our
application goes on top of the
application server what happens if we
need to you know how do we do this right
we go to up to our development
environments our laptop for example and
we stall this application server so we
can solve application on top of it
that's how we do right or and then we
have installed the the database so we
can make make some some test and
application and then when you go to QA
all you have to do have to reinstall the
application server
reinstall the database reinstall the
libraries you saw everything again and
then we go to production we have to do
this again right and what happens when
we do all these right then you know the
developer is easy
using GlassFish the latest version of
GlassFish on his laptop and when he's
ready to put in production he founds
that well and then he passes on the
keyway server that is running an older
version of glasses so that's okay right
so Alan had to do things and when he
goes in production he finds out their
production is running WebSphere and oh
that doesn't work you know like it's and
then that's why we we hear that famous
phrase right how come is not working a
production it works perfectly on my
machine that is the biggest problem that
we have we solve the development is our
pipelines is that we have different
environments everywhere and so nothing
can really work right so how do we
package not only our application it's
very good to package our package there's
a very good step but how do we package
not only our application but how do we
package the whole thing in a way that we
can reuse everything so we have a more
homogeneous environment everywhere
that's how we come up with big
containers right you've got seen those
big BOTS around right hey you know
instead of buying a little Tupperware
that you put like choo choo strawberries
inside and that's full we created those
huge boxes that carry everything around
those oh man those boxes kind of changed
the word seriously you know when they
created this big big boxes it really
changed the way we'd shift things around
the world right it's so efficient to put
things inside the box that today it's
cheaper for you to fish cards in Norway
ship the car to China to be shopping
into pieces and bring back to be sold in
a restaurant in Norway then it is free
to pay someone in Norway to shop the
cart because containers completely
change the way we ship things and they
are completely changed the way we ship
software right because in the past how
did you ship things in the past you all
know this I bet you all know this
because you all saw Titanic the movie
and you remember that seeing of Rose and
Jack Ronnie in the in the in the hardy
colleges like that the bottom of the
ship where all the things are stacking
up right so they're running there and
you remember their little hand on the
car right you remember how that the
thing you don't remember is all the
things on the background right all the
boxes stack it up with with ropes and
gnats and everything that's how we ship
with things in the past right everything
you had to ship you would get that thing
and put inside I know you have to like a
bicycle and put the by screen siding
type the bikes go up and you had to do
you know some box and you get one box
and put the time tied the box up right
very manual process very hard to do very
complicated tricks Cakes to replicate
and then someone came out well why don't
we put a like a really really big box
and then we put everything inside to
really bought the big box and then now
we have these cranes that get the box
out of the truck put the box and customs
take out the Box out of customs put on
the ship take out of the ship put on the
train very easy and then we completely
change the way how we do things and how
we do the software today right you know
you want to you want to get your your
java application right so you say to the
production guys woman I'm gonna run my
job application so you know how do I run
this well you know we have this this
java vm thing you have to install the
java vm and we just can put application
on top of it okay that's I know I
understand that just kind of I know how
to stop start the Java VM that's fine
that's okay oh and then now we have this
new cool thing right it's called EE 4j
stuff right there you have an
application server can we run that into
production well what is this well it's
kind of Java right but you know you have
a application server on top of it but
you always starts in stop it's like with
JVM in the back right that's okay well
okay so I can I can handle that because
I'm already know how to manage the JVM I
can do that well you know we also
wouldn't want to run this new
application we do here we have here with
this cool language called PHP hello.php
come on man what is a PHP is Apache
right I know how to run Apache so I can
just put a PHP in Apache that's okay I
know
stop and start a potty that's fine oh
you know what we now have this cool um
Easter tracker software here that's
that's dawning and it's gone already
mine is running Ruby no no we're not
gonna run Ruby disking oh we don't want
to run Ruby here right I've had two
large Java I had to learn Java EE I had
to learn PHP I'm not gonna learn
everything that you guys you crazy
developers do right we're gonna
standardize everything here now we're
gonna run WebSphere version 1.0 on
production and you guys gonna have to
live with it
right you know that's how we do today
right it's a pain right it's a pain for
everyone because it's true the
productions guys they don't have they
cannot manage everything that we create
for now right so now how do we ship
containers today well you want to sell
bicycle you put buy some inside a
container and you put the container in
the trip you want to sell bananas right
you put inside a refrigerated container
with the exact temperature and you put
inside the ship or you want to sell
frozen meats right you're gonna put a
refrigerated container and take this it
the guys in the in the in their in their
dogs they don't care what you put inside
the container they just move things
around very fast very efficiently what
this has to do software or you want to
run Java in your production environment
you put job inside a container and ship
the container to production guys you
want to run PHP or Java EE you put the
Java EE application of server-side the
container you ship to the production
guys or you want to run PHP or Ruby you
put those guys that a container of
sensitive to the production guys they
know how to stop a container starter
containing a backup of container and
move our container from your laptop to
the clouds from the culture on premise
from which prevents they know all of
that because they have the cranes to
move things around right that's why it's
so important to the whole thing about
orchestration of containers because
there's another there's a twist to this
what happens if you show up with a
container like this big in a dark that
does not have cranes that is a pain
isn't it you know you have like a
hundred people you can be one of those
right it's not gonna work
okay so that's why we need to have the
tool should do all of that right okay so
docker is our container so the cool
thing about docker there's a lot of a
lot of interesting but the cool thing
that we have to realize is that there
are lots of soft big boxes that they
create in the past but some point we
decide to standardize in one size of box
once we did this we can use the same
cranes to do to move things around
docker is this size of box right there's
a lot of painful things in darker but
the fact that darker standardize on the
size of the box that's amazing because
now everyone supports it so if you do
your things in docker you can you can
move things around very easily right so
how are you going to do this you know we
can do that's our pipeline right you
have to development and Bute as deploy
make your infrastructure work and so if
if we use containers everywhere right if
we use docker is everywhere we can do
lots of cool things right so we can we
can actually on our development even our
development machine right so do you need
do you need a Java EE application server
to run your development machine Don you
run a container that's that's like
they're in your laptop right doesn't
mess up with all your files in your
laptop it doesn't you know it doesn't
have to create all just crazy ports or
security stuff and everything you know
how do you do this right because you
kind of open up everything in your
laptop so you can run the freaking
applicational server right so you don't
need to do all this anymore you just
packages in run a contain inside your
laptop right and and you know you can
use docker to build your stuff you know
who use Jenkins here okay lots of people
using you know how you use Dinkins today
right you get what you do you get you
know oh you need to build a java
application right so you can stall all
the jobs or thing on your Jenkins
machine right you know you just saw all
those stuff in your Jenkins machine and
then you know the things kind of mess up
each other right you want to do this
right way you have your Jenkins server
right and all your slaves are actually
darker slaves
so when Jenkins needs to build a Java 8
applications run it spins up a docker
container of Java 8 and B
there oh now he needs to build a Java 9
application spins the docker container
of Java 9 in Beauty replication there
right so you can you know you keep
things separated you have exactly the
build process that you need you have all
the library you need to build
applications so you can use docker for
everything for testing same thing right
your honor start testing the environment
you can create as many doctor containers
you want you start all those things you
test your application any way you want
you just try all those things and then
go away right oh you need a database for
testing well you spin up a docker
container with a pre-populated database
you test it around then you just throw
it away right so that's that's no
containers are very good for this same
thing for deploy and infrastructure
right so we know this makes stopping
tops you're talking too much already
so let me just go let me let's just show
this whole thing working right so how we
can actually do this and show all the
code that you guys need to do this right
because now oh one more thing right
you're right so one cool thing is that
usually that's how we do right we do
development and then your beauty and
then we do all the tests and everything
and then eventually we're gonna get your
production and now we're gonna have to
do everything again in production to
make it work but you know what if you're
doing containers you can actually start
from here you can just start with
infrastructure guys say look guys we're
gonna run this thing sometime in the
future I want your help to define what's
gonna be the final infrastructure right
so we decide where's the version of
things we decide how things gonna run we
you know we have to get the help of the
the production guys to build our
containers and now we can actually go
backwards because now we get the
containers gonna use for infrastructure
and use them everywhere else and now we
really have a very very homogeneous
environment that we can use for
everything right so you know let's let's
see this working so I already talked
about elder elder so elder not only is a
under version is for Oracle he was uh he
just started right okay so let's you
know let's welcome him right
he just started him he started he start
one week convention for Oracle but
before he's been an evangelist for
Oracle he's been a speaker in all Thor
he's writing a book about Java EE
and more important than that when Oracle
created the Oracle champions program he
was invited to be a founding member
right so put your hands together to
Alder more I was gonna do it some demos
nice for us thank you thank you brother
so guys what are we gonna gonna do right
now
it's true to have an application simple
application just start step by step that
getting this application and putting on
the locker and then have our
environments automated for with
containers okay so let me get so the
final the final result of this demo is
right this architecture so aleejack is
load balancer running three hoses
running Tommy all then with docker
and our application inside of it okay so
let me get
bigger yeah yeah in the back is okay
thank you thank you so what we have here
is a very simple plication here that we
called where's my javelin war okay can
be your application okay whatever web
application I have a jar file or ever
but here we have a war file then we're
gonna have this war fire that is my
application in put inside a docker
container okay so for doing that I would
like to show you my machine is okay a
what we call a docker file for those who
not from familiar with with docker still
we have the docker file that is a file
and my machine is okay so what the
docker file this is tell docker
enjoying engine what how do you
construct a docker image okay for those
we still not using docker darker and
darker following containers think about
docker in containers like a kind of
Verta machine is not able to machine
okay but just to have a picture so this
file will tell doctor how you you how
doctor will construct our container okay
so basically he's asking for docker hub
that is a service running cloud from
docker that have many pre boot images
from many vendors here we are using
Tommy so we will build our container
here base it on a tummy container to me
image okay so then we add some files for
configurations and clustering in
whatever and here we are using where we
our core file will be deployed okay so
when we construct our our container and
then we
oh man it's very slow so basically we
have here one single line of command to
build our container here and before this
line just removing if we have some
previous is previous image running okay
so let's run it so I can show you okay
so our docker image is done so if you if
you look here I am adding my my war file
inside my tummy web server so we can run
our container with that okay so in then
just for that not using it I will here
run my three hostess using Tommy and in
front of them load balancer load image
action on the balancer for keeping the
the clustering run in case so that's
okay and then we run it slow dem emoji
but okay okay
there you go so we remove the previous
refills hose is just to make sure that
we not mess up the sings and then they
create a fork for containers here if
when we have the dr. PS we have the
first one is our load balancer and then
three holes running our application
inside tommy server and let's check it
out if it's running so we have here and
there you go you're running so basically
we have three holes running the same
application and if you pay attention
when i refresh we are changing the hosts
we are changing the IP but the session
is the same because they are running in
now Roger groping load-balancing okay so
a simple example of what application
that I had before and they this it's
application is now containerized and and
that's the cool thing is that hello the
cool things that's running on on the on
his laptop right so no it's we have all
those dis load-balanced environments
usually when you're doing developments
you don't have the whole infrastructure
running I just kind of have one
application server and everything else
is kind of mess it up so now we have the
whole infrastructure running in your
laptop to imagine if you if you need as
one server for each of this node you
need to set up the server and install
Java and install to me and whatever and
then another one every 30 and then
imagine how many wants so here if three
lines of code we have this whole
architecture when okay and since
containers are lightweights
virtualization it's you know it's not
you have you can run you know a few
thousands containers in your laptop so
so that should work fine yeah so then
our point here is well our our
applications already running inside
containers so let's go a step further so
let's try to let's run now let's do to
build here CI environment okay to get
our the
in Q&amp;amp;A in production environment
automated okay so you can use many many
many applications many tools to do that
in sei we choose here some kind of gate
implementation a maven and Sona type in
axis who doesn't know well it's a new
type in axis it's a solution for binary
it's a it's a binary plus story right so
you can you can you can save you can
store your your versions are your binary
versions your free application so
instead if you you keep building
application every time you can store
there and then just a point in the
environments that you need okay and then
mean if you'd know already the
drinking's okay so you we are using this
environment to automate our our
environments of starting by development
and then whatever and the cool thing
we're going to do is that we're gonna
use containers to do all of that right
so even if you don't know a lot of you
guys don't have a pipeline yet so you
can have all the all the pipeline tools
running as containers it could be in
your laptop and then you eventually move
up to your to your production and
environment in your company but you can
you can have the whole pipeline running
inside containers so that's what we're
going to show here we gonna have we're
gonna build the CI environments ask
containers and from the CI environments
we're gonna build the containers for for
for development production and queuing
well actually the development varmint
already did right because it's his
laptop right so we're gonna do the rest
in the cloud
yeah so something's going on for laptop
so and so basically uh you know although
everything we're gonna show you're gonna
show live everything here right so since
some of those those environments take a
few minutes to start we already have
like pre running things so you can so
you can see the end results but you're
just gonna start everything and we're
gonna start from scratch right so so we
don't have right now everything other we
have right now is is the docker
containers running the application on
his machine that's all we have and then
what we're going to do next is we're
gonna create the CI environment from
pre-existing docker containers we're
gonna use a set of containers from from
tooth cloud they have all this we have
they're all the containers properly done
okay you ready now yeah like I was I was
doing in your other machine so okay so
for my local for my development
environment okay I will use the vagrant
to provision a machine to provision my
CI environment okay so we have here a
vagrant file just to show you how do you
okay so very good it's a automation
solution for to create development
environments right so you can use
vagrant tribute development in your
laptop or or outs in the cloud but we
are using vagrant here to create either
local environments or or the local CI
environments or use the same gregandfi
to create this DCI environments in the
cloud yeah in the cool thing is that
once we build this wave anguish FRA here
we can use it in every environment that
we are building so I can use it for
testing my local and then we can build
our QA environment as the same the same
configurations the same setup the same
containers okay so basically just to not
take so much time here here
it's defining which containers we are
using our CI environment okay so
basically which way we are
focuses Jenkins
and here gets bleeped and we are
applications using maven okay so well
they are it will download or install
darker and we're on all the containers
here okay not take too much time here
yes oh no notice that that we're just
kind of using the same commands and he
was using before I just kind of like
comment line kind of things that run
each one of the doctor commands today
you have when you have orchestration
tools you have things like doctor
composer and other things actually to
automate all this creation but we wanted
to have like a very close to what you
type on your command line so you can see
the whole process but you know if you if
you're actually doing this for
production you would use something like
doctor composer something like this but
you know at least this this one you can
see cuz that what's going on yeah and
here it will use a toe box engine choo
choo to create a new machine and then
start the environment yeah so one cool
thing here that you can see in the top
over there you see Vito box and on the
same configuration you see AWS in the
barn right so you can run the same
configuration in a butyl box in your
local machine or one in the cloud like
an AWS or something else and we have
also this provider here's manager is a
plug-in for vagrant that you can have an
SSH connection with forever call that
you want and also provide your your
machine yes so yeah so so there's so in
the same file we can we're provisioning
vagrant locally AWS or SSH just connect
your server and provide anywhere you
want like on-premise or or nickel yeah
so you use a very good and the good
thing about vagrants that you have one
command to run everything so vagrant up
will pass if you have a development
environment up and if you not just to
spin everything up yeah and just take a
while because it will create machine
will download the docker will download
all the images from the containers it
will set up the containers so we not let
you wait here okay so you are moving to
another another environment that we
already have it done on the cloud okay
so let's
just have my note here so there you go
he's a machine running on the Oracle
cloud okay and where we already have our
CR environment already up and running
okay so we are ready on the cloud or
ready to automate an environment that we
want beyond the our local one okay yeah
so base one command we have a CI
environment that we can now use to
automate the rest yeah well we had our
application running can you show the CI
environment okay is that easy right
there yeah right so just that's that's a
machine so that's the things that's you
know so we have all those yes we have
all those all those those those
containers running as the CI environment
so you can actually just start using
whatever you're doing yeah okay well we
have already our CI environment set up
and running in the cloud so let's take
our application and move it to the cloud
so we can automate it okay so let's get
here another note okay it's another
machine
it's our Q&amp;amp;A machine running in the
cloud so we have here okay so they are
the same files exactly semi files that
we were in in our local machine so just
we just download the gate right yeah we
just check out the gates we push up on
the gates okay
so the same build file the same build
images
yeah around the containers yeah so
basically what he's doing is run by
hands this the same container he running
his laptop but now in a cloud machine
yeah so as we are on the cloud take a
little delay okay it's ready so let's
check it out
this one okay so our replication is now
in the cloud running this is actually
the same application doing the exactly
the same behavior okay you notice that
IP IP s can change because now we run in
a different machine but that's at the
same exactly same contain the same
application running and and we're doing
here with a normal you know dot War II
our Java EE application right so
actually if you download the source code
from the article and you just put your
er application on on the place of ours
you know you have this whole thing the
same way yeah and if you have some
connection database connection you just
put your JDBC file in the docker file
and then you're good to go
okay well so our application is now on
the cloud and we have our CI set set so
we can now automate it so basically we
have here's two jobs set up on the the
Jenkins our first one is for our DNA so
I'll just show a little needle
configurations here
are you on the Wi-Fi no okay
yeah so that sure sure yeah yeah it's
it's uh any junks web server running in
front of the the parsha Tommy sure it it
has a link with the other containers and
there's the Darrell robbing okay yeah so
in our case here we were running all the
containers in a single machine but of
course you know as containers you could
run the containers in a cluster right
we're not we're not running the cluster
here but yeah and so in a cluster for
example or if you're a reason
orchestration tool you would have the
load balancer and the machines and and
the server's running different machine
we were out running everything one
machine here but it's very very easy to
put in multiple machines yeah so here we
have our our github repository were
France it and then here a connection
with our application server that we
previous set up here configurated and
well and here we just transfer the files
to the server that we want to deploy and
run our same comments here okay so let's
try it and then we have here butanol and
let's see the logs so there you go
success there's actually the same
comments was running here okay so we
start one step true and then our our our
architecture is running let's check it
if we didn't a mess it okay it's really
still running
and well so our application is in the
cloud it's automated for Q&amp;amp;A and what do
you need to do to automated for
production is just have another job
point you to your production environment
okay so what we did here when you're
okay
I'm sorry so in the CI environment you
create everything yeah and post pop
deploy tool nak says ya then in
production you download the whole thing
not attribute oh yeah but once for
example if you have the Nexus or not
type in axis that we told before you can
just store your binaries on the
repository and then we have when you
have all the environments set that you
just pulled it the binary and deploy in
the environments okay so you don't need
to to download all the source code again
i buda again i do we all again you just
take from the nexus and and deploy in
the environments okay so so usually the
the pipeline is you know in development
and testing you reviewed everything
right but after you goes from test for
to QA and production the correct way of
doing is that you run the the final
container already pre buttes right so
you don't you don't recreate the
containers on QA in production because
you're just using and actually you can
you can explore the final binary
containers inside nexus so you can
actually just deploy to QA and
production the binary results so you
don't have to reboot anything right
question why can't we use a darker
repository instead of the you nexus one
tool to pull the stuff from deposit i
supposed to yeah so he's asking about
you know docker repository and so yes so
Naxos is a docker repository right so
you could use you could store your your
images on on the public docker
repository like docker hub right but you
know if you're doing this inside your
company you're not gonna do this right
not gonna store your production images
on docker hub right you're gonna store
your production me images internally so
you know you can choose whatever you
want but you know we nexus does two
ports you maxi's a docker repository
among other things but so you can store
you can store your images inside an axis
and then kubernetes or or jelastic or
anyone which would get from that dark
repository that is an axis so that's
your internal dr. repository
okay okay heavy a local register for for
all your images and this local registry
is also container so you can use a
container for everything so your
anything is lemon right okay so why are
you doing questions here how long we
have like we have two minutes right so
let me just kind of tell you guys here
you know if you wanna if you wanna
we have two projects here one it's code
for life so code for life is a project
where we are we interview the top Java
experts in the industry on on tips and
ideas for each improve your career and
elder has a interesting project here
that he interviews all the Java EE
experts so actually I me tell you one
thing I'd like to thank you for being
here because right now was going on the
presentation from Adam being so if you
miss the present in front I mean you can
come to elder's project actually see the
interview with Adam being right because
for being here so you get both at the
same time right so any more questions
here guys before we finish like have
like one time for one question there's a
question oh I would get back to you
there's a question I'll do it to the end
yeah is helping to set up your
infrastructure - right and one problem
that we often encounter is issues with
firewall rules so from a QA to prod that
probably wouldn't be something that you
could do in docker
right with to help ease some of the move
to prod with firewalls yes there's no so
so there's a lot of things that changes
from development
choo-choo-choo QA testing in production
right and so basically the advantage of
using containers is that you know the
the orchestration tools we reconfigure
anything you need between those
environments right so you can run the
exact same containers in all those
environments but then for production you
have different settings for the
containers so it's so they're gonna run
in different machines for example they
will open up different firewall rules
you know you can do all those kind of
things the orchestration tools would do
the configuration all those environments
all right so you can and actually you
can have you can even have those same
environments on the same infrastructure
and have them segregated right so you
know you say your developers are running
on the same servers your your everything
but you know your developers can only
run certain certain times of containers
there so the orchestration tools who are
gonna help you follow those things
that's one of the greatest advantage of
off containers that it separates this
concern right so developers who created
containers and the guys from
infrastructure they're the ones gonna
decide how the containers actually run
okay question the data layer sequel no
sequel do not deal with that inside the
container the container should not
create or try to manage these
environments I'm asking no no you can
yes yes you can you can't run you can't
run your database you can run your no
sequel inside containers what we do what
you have to do have to think one thing
you have to understand that containers
are the image rights and they are they
are stateless so basically if you have
any data that you want to save you have
to save outside of the container right
but yes but you can run your database
you can run your no sequel and
everything as there s containers and
that and that works very well and it's
it's it's um it's it's amazing because
you know you can we can we can create
very very complex environments so
actually or I travel here we created a
environments with with for a customer
that had several application servers no
has wide fly had Tomcats you know for
front and back ends they had a
elasticsearch server they had a
Cassandra server they have a Oracle
database you know they have all this
environment and everything else put
inside containers and run s containers
okay so if you guys restaurant of those
here you immediately get an email from
us so if you have any more questions let
us know thank you very much guys
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
