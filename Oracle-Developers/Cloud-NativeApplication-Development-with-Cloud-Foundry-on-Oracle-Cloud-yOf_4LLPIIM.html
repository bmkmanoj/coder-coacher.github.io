very much for coming to this session I'm
super excited to be here talking about
cloud native application developments
with cloud foundry on the Oracle cloud
my name is Mike Lehmann I run product
management for application development
at Oracle obviously we have a very rich
path ecosystem for building applications
and obviously there's a ton of people
probably folks like yourself that are
interested in running cloud foundry and
integrating running cloud foundry on the
Oracle cloud as well as integrating with
our past services I'm joined with an
all-star cast here today I have Prasad
Bob Parker from the pivotal Solutions
Architect team who have helped us with
this work domain druids who's from the
pivotal marketing team Anan Kothari
who's from the engineering team at
Oracle we worked on this and dorama
traiga who's also from the engineering
team here at Oracle that worked on this
this has been a interesting journey my
eye can see a few familiar faces in the
audience who have probably heard me talk
about the work that we were planning to
do with pivotal and cloud foundry today
it all comes to fruition actually in
fact on Monday we announced this 3a
press release as well as a number of
blog postings what we're gonna do is
give you first a little bit of context
setting how many people here are Cloud
Foundry pivotal customers that's what I
was expecting you know a good number of
hands going up there and I expect a few
of you are also evaluating and looking
at it and perhaps even looking at
running it on the Oracle cloud so we'll
give you a bit of context around Cloud
Foundry and pivotal tell you about the
Oracle cloud sort of the context of how
you can actually run products on Oracle
cloud not only pivotal Cloud Foundry but
our overall paths and infrastructure as
a service story and then we'll get into
the details so Prasad will talk about
the cloud provider interface for Oracle
cloud you'll see a demonstration of it
so you know it's not just slides today
you'll see something real then we'll
drill into the service brokers the
integration that we've done with the
Oracle paths across the Oracle cloud and
then finally to kind of wrap it up and
give you a sense of what this looks like
in real life we'll talk about deployment
topologies so I'm going to turn it over
to domain so over to you and I'll let
you take us into it
thank you Mike I wasn't quite prepared
for the mood lighting in the room but
I'm gonna just go with it because I
think it really adds a nice touch
so before just diving in to what pivotal
Cloud Foundry or even just called Cloud
Foundry in general general it's all
about I think it's helpful to have a
little bit of context because I find it
really disorienting to sometimes dive
into the details of technology it's like
what problem are we even solving here so
to touch on that this is sort of the the
problem that's been emerging in the
marketplace over the last decade or so
probably longer but sort of come to a
real head in the last five or so years
where a lot of a lot of enterprises in
particular kind of have been struggling
with getting code into production and
that's really inhibited their ability to
make changes and adapt their businesses
while the entire marketplace around them
is adapting faster and faster with a
very software centric approach and so
this is kind of one of those classic
examples of the between a waterfall
development methodology and very siloed
approach to all the handoffs that have
to occur in order to get code developed
tested integrated etc etc etc etc and
then finally into production this is
where a lot of customers we're coming to
us saying it's taking us six to nine
months to get our code into production
taking eighteen months to develop a new
mobile app for example so just to paint
a picture in the context of a specific
organization this was t-mobile who got
up at the Cloud Foundry summit a couple
of months ago and articulated how it was
taking them seven months in 72 steps to
update one of their pieces of software
and so this was really struggling with a
lot of challenges being able to make
changes being able to scale the
infrastructure to support this
application so this was the real problem
that existed and then meanwhile there's
just a lot of other changes going on in
the industry and in in software in
particular and so whether it's
approaches like DevOps or kind of the
methodologies around 12 factor
applications or just pieces of software
like you
containerization or a lot of the the
code developed an open-source by Netflix
that a lot of enterprises are wanting to
be able to embrace a lot of this new
software and approaches like micro
services and DevOps
but they're struggling to do so so
there's there's a lot of connections
between a lot of these core trends that
are all contributing to what we refer to
as cloud native application and cloud
native application development so one is
the DevOps practices and so instead of
having this sort of siloed approach
having shared responsibility for code
but that's really difficult when you
don't have automation in place and so
continuous delivery being a
complementary approach and set of
technologies to support DevOps we're you
know doing DevOps is going to be a lot
easier if you're building all of your
automation tests and using that to
continuously deliver your code well that
can still be difficult if you are
dealing with one large monolithic
application that has a lot of different
individuals who are all trying to
contribute to one giant codebase that is
very difficult to make changes to and no
one really understands the entire
software in their head and so decoupling
that decomposing it into smaller chunks
of software that are more loosely
coupled then feeds back into the rest of
this virtuous cycle of being able to
continuously deliver those smaller
chunks and having the teams responsible
for them have responsibility for the
whole lifecycle so if we kind of fast
forward and come back to our example of
our friends over at t-mobile
you know where did this story go after
they were adopted cloud foundry well
they they also had to go through some
work of refactoring that application so
it's a large java application with
thousand functions or so so they did
some refactoring using spring and within
three months they had this application
running completely on Cloud Foundry
taking a hundred percent of the
production traffic and this is an
application with 12 million calls a day
hence the title of their presentation
zero to 12 million so they went from
that seven months and 72 steps to make a
change to being able to do same-day bug
fixes with zero downtime so just a
tremendous amount of freedom in terms of
their ability to actually make changes
to their software so we've been picking
on t-mobile and their their particular
benefits around clout using Cloud
Foundry for being able to make those
changes to their software you can see
how it's also tied to the architecture
of their software and some of the
practices around it but the platform is
tremendously beneficial on that as well
so other other customers who've been
using this see similar types of benefits
but just to articulate those Garman went
to being able to have you know 1,100
releases deploys per month right and so
that's approximately 50 deploys per day
and so that that was a huge acceleration
for them and this is not deploying one
giant monolith 50 times a day it's
because they're decoupling and they're
able to continuously deploy lots of
small chunks companies like Comcast then
sort of taking that to the next degree
or seeing a 50% reduction in time to
market with trying to build new features
and new new services and entire new
offerings to their customers and then
folks like Liberty Mutual are then able
to combine this with agile methodologies
to be able to have you know an MVP in in
four months and bring an entirely new
mobile app to market in six months
instead of 18 months so a lot of large
enterprises have been seeing a lot of
great benefits working with Cloud
Foundry so let's let's now dive into a
little bit about what it is I've kind of
talked about the problem that it's
solved but it's a it's an application
platform that at the foundation provides
an abstraction layer above a cloud
infrastructure
Pat like layer right so on the bottom
there you see let me see if this laser
pointer ooh there goes see I've got the
little red dot down here we have a
number of different
Aya's vendors providing that that raw
infrastructure abstraction so with
today's or yesterday's announcement
we're able to start
see the Oracle cloud is another option
for one of these ayahs vendors that you
can then run Cloud Foundry on top of so
Cloud Foundry is then providing the the
container orchestration on top of it but
if you're you're using the elastic
runtime which is the another component
of pivotal Cloud Foundry what that
enables a developer to experience is
they just push their code to the
platform it's literally called the CF
push command and from there we actually
containerize it attach all the the
dependencies and networking components
so that that application instance can
now run and easily scale on the platform
and that's what basically allows
developers to kind of take a lot of the
concerns around the underlying
infrastructure and further remove those
from the concerns that they may get to
focus on their code so this is the kind
of platform that you know going back to
an example like Comcast they've got
1,500 developers pushing applications
about a thousand applications onto Cloud
Foundry they have four operators running
the platform so tremendous operational
advantage coming from the platform now
what we're going to talk about for the
rest of today there's a lot of opinions
built into cloud foundry which is why
it's able to provide so much automation
but very importantly there are a couple
of extensibility points which allows the
whole platform to then offer a lot of
options and choice to those users and so
the first one is this this cloud
orchestration layer which as we refer to
the cloud provider interface down to
those underlying eise's provides a lot
of choice to to enterprises actually a
survey that just came out today from the
Cloud Foundry Foundation found that 53%
of surveyed users are using more than
one cloud provider in their Cloud
Foundry environment and then another
important extensibility point is this
service broker my little pointers not
really sharp there but there's a nice
big red box around it so hopefully
between the two red boxes you guys will
be able to figure out which one I'm
talking about
but that service broker API which is
actually an abstraction point that we
donated
to a broader set of ecosystems that
includes kubernetes and OpenShift and
that abstraction is what allows
applications running on the platform to
bind to external services so they could
be databases they could be monitoring
systems they could be a security service
like a web app firewall so all these
different types of external services
that you want to be able to bind to an
application and that allows that an
application instance whether they're
scaling or moving around in the
environment to continue to maintain this
connection to that additional service so
that's the second part that we're going
to go through today and with that I'm
gonna hand it back to Mike thank you so
if you're here at Oracle OpenWorld you
are seeing a lot about cloud and so one
of the key parts that is talked about
and Larry talked about it on Sunday and
just before this you talked about
database in the cloud you've seen our
SAS applications in the cloud so
obviously Oracle cloud is a major
investment focus and engineering focus
at Oracle we literally have the entire
engineering org
building out cloud services and moving
our our product portfolio into the cloud
it really started frankly as
software-as-a-service we were rebuilding
our fusion applications and built out a
whole set of software as a service
offerings we then started bringing our
middleware and database work clothes
into the cloud as a set of cloud
services and then over the last two
years we've been building out a very
rich ecosystem around infrastructure as
a service you may hear it referred to as
the bare metal cloud or the the new
branding that came out recently Oracle
cloud infrastructure and then on top of
that is a data as a service layer for
doing analytics and so forth if you peel
back the onion what's quite interesting
I think people are often quite surprised
to see in in the Oracle cloud is it's a
very rich ecosystem around the pass area
we have obviously services for
application development clearly data
management identity and security data
integration business analytics you can
read them it's in the order of about 35
to 40 path services that make up the the
platform itself running on top of a
infrastructure as a service
quite cool about it that is also not
well understood is that it not only runs
in the public cloud so you can deploy to
data centers around the world there's 28
plus data centers around the world where
you can run these services there's also
a local variant of it called Oracle
cloud at customer where you can actually
have these path services including
things like the exadata cloud service in
your data center and that actually plays
really well with the Cloud Foundry story
here an important part as well is that
you know domain mentioned a few
customers she mentioned Comcast t mobile
etc almost inevitably cloud foundry or
pivotal customers are Oracle customers
and so that's part of the story that
we're trying to do here is bring
together that customer base to give them
the choice of where they want to run
their Cloud Foundry workloads a big part
of our story that sort of makes this
very interesting when Prasad shows you
the demo will be running Cloud Foundry
on our Oracle cloud infrastructure this
is a next generation infrastructure
often as I as I mentioned earlier on
referred to as bare metal cloud
efficiently Oracle cloud infrastructure
what's cool about is you can literally
get a bare-metal server and you can run
containers on it virtualization on it
when you run something like Cloud
Foundry on it and a remarkably small
footprint you don't have to use a lot of
virtual machines where you're literally
running on bare metal so there's some
very cool stuff that we can do in that
space has a very rich story around high
availability across multiple
availability domains the performance and
cost benefits are very powerful so we're
obviously leveraging and building on top
of that infrastructure with the Cloud
Foundry work that we're doing here now
you might say well why are customers
coming and asking us about Cloud Foundry
on an Oracle cloud well the obvious one
is customer demand I know a few people
in the audience here who have been
asking me about this there's a lot of
people out there that are using Cloud
Foundry to do custom bespoke application
development they often are doing that
side by side with Oracle database
workloads Oracle middleware workloads or
our SAS applications or even our pass
applications we literally are growing as
I said a very large number of house
infrastructures the cool thing that
we've done here is that not only of you
we've given you access via the service
broker API that we'll talk about to our
path services
we've also done some really nice
integration with Oracle workloads so if
you're using Exadata you're using Oracle
database you're gonna see in this talk
today what we've done in that space so
it makes customers that are building
custom more clothes on pivotal very
easily able to integrate into those
environments and then the final kicker
if you will a lot of our customers are
interested in running public cloud
capabilities in their data centers so
the Oracle cloud at customer capability
that I mentioned sort of gives you a new
dimension imagine running Cloud Foundry
in your data center on your VMware farms
side-by-side with a set of cloud
services like exadata or database cloud
service or even WebLogic server for
those of you use WebLogic server in that
environment so it's a very unique value
proposition that we're trying to bring
to bear here so it's touch a little bit
about cloud provider interface so let's
get to the meat and potatoes of it so
I'm gonna turn it over to Prasad and
talk about what we're doing there thank
you Mike so let's talk about the boss
cloud provider interface for the Oracle
cloud right so before I talk about this
let's get a good understanding of you
know what how Cloud Foundry supports all
the major public clouds so as doorman
clearly explained that Cloud Foundry has
support for all the major public clouds
out there right and the way we deploy a
cloud on any of these clouds I mean the
way we deploy cloud foundry on any of
these cloud platforms is using boss now
what's boss so boss is an open source
project
it's an orchestration tool chain for
release engineering and what it does is
that it deploys very complex large-scale
distributed services on any cloud
platform of your choice and boss does
not just deploy these services but it
also continues to manage and monitor the
life cycle of your deployment right now
what enables bosh to be able to
communicate and work with all the cloud
platforms and the answer to that is the
cloud provider interface
so our CPI as we call it so what the CPI
does is essentially it takes all the
bosch commands when it tries to
communicate with an underlying cloud
infrastructure and it translates it all
those commands into what the cloud API
can understand so these are some of the
boss commands if you will you know so
bosses view of the world is basically
creating and deleting virtual machines
and stem cells which are basically the
operating system images and also
creating and deleting disks and also
attaching and detaching these disks to
your virtual machines so it's a set of
about 14 or 15 API calls and the cloud
provider interface so the CPI is what
takes all these boss commands and
translates them into the API for the
cloud infrastructure and what we have
here is the CPI boss CPI that is written
for Oracle cloud infrastructure by the
Oracle team and which actually gives us
or enables us to do any barge deployment
on Oracle cloud infrastructure and this
deployment doesn't just have to be Cloud
Foundry
but it can be any other deployment also
now before we talk a little bit more
about the CPI let's try to quickly
understand the boss architecture so this
is a very high level diagram of you know
boss and its components so the way Bosch
works is that it lives in a VM of its
own so when you start working with boss
you actually install boss in a virtual
machine and these are various different
components of boss that also run inside
that VM so as you see that we are we
have a lot of components here we just
talked about the CPI there are other
components like there is a database
where boss stores all the deployment
configuration information then there is
a registry then there is a blob store
where blah the boss stores all the
artifacts like the stem cells and the
boss releases and the likes and then
lastly we have a component called the
health monitor and what that health
monitor does is that it continuously
monitors the current state of any
deployment boss has done and it compares
that with the desired state of the
system and if it finds any issues
it will go ahead and take in you know
any necessary corrective actions to fix
if anything has gone wrong right and all
these components they talk they
communicate with each other in an
asynchronous fashion we are the Nats
message bus on the right hand side if
you look we see VMs with agent written
on them so that's outside of bars but
that's part of the deployment that wash
will do for you so when it creates or
deploys any virtual machine it injects
that wash agent on this VM and this is
the agent that actually reports back to
the barge director the state of that
particular VM and you know any any
metrics or any important information
that needs to be communicated back to
the boss director based on which it does
the monitoring right so that's the boss
architecture in a nutshell for you
so moving on so going back to the cloud
provider interface for Oracle cloud at
this point what we have is a pretty
stable CPI which has enabled us to
deploy Cloud Foundry on the Oracle cloud
and so we are going to take a look at
the demo pretty quick here and then the
other important thing is that the CPI is
open sourced and the CPI will be
maintained on the Cloud Foundry website
cloud foundry orj in the standard
repository just like you know on par
with any other boss CPI for all the
other public clouds out there so that's
pretty much it about the CPI and then
let's dive into a quick demonstration
because we just talked about the CPI you
want to take a make sure that it's so
I'm gonna switch you over the other
thing I'll mention on the mention about
the CPI is there's also a terraform set
of installers so we've open-sourced
terraform installers to lay down Cloud
Foundry with the CPI oh can we could we
have a mic turned on on the table here
if it looks I thought we had that mic on
there we go alright so thank you very
much so here I am I am SSH into my jump
box here which is on the
Oracle cloud and if you take a look you
know let me increase this now so I'm
gonna draw in just a few bosch commands
over here just to illustrate that you
know how we have the Cloud Foundry
deployment over here so the first
command I'm gonna do here is gosh
deployments and what the boss
deployments command does is that it
lists out all your distributed services
of the deployments that wash has done so
okay this particular instance of boss
that I am logged into right so if you
look at it it is right now showing one
deployment named CF which stands for
Cloud Foundry and if you see it as a
bunch of releases because it's a pretty
complex deployment and an important
thing that I would like for you all to
pay attention to is that this light
Oracle Ubuntu stem cell so this is the
base OS operating system image that boss
uses when it deploys any virtual machine
okay so we talked about the CPI but CPI
is not the only component that was built
by the you know the Oracle team but they
also bailed the stem cell because the
stem cell is always very specific to the
cloud infrastructure so we have the stem
cell for Oracle cloud eventually there
will be a window stem cell for Oracle
cloud also so this is this proves that
you know we have a deployment running
with this Oracle open to stem cell so
the other thing I'm gonna show here is
boss CPI if I could spell this correctly
all right so this if you take a look at
here so this shows that we are working
with the Oracle CPI and I'm gonna run
one more command here these VMs so this
command shows all the sixteen virtual
machines and actually make up the Cloud
Foundry deployment that is running here
and if I go back into this web console
view this is my Oracle web console view
and your Oracle cloud view and these are
all the same exact virtual machines that
we were looking at from the term
so this is the Cloud Foundry deployment
that we did with Bosch on Oracle cloud
now let's go ahead and deploy an app
right I mean at the end of the day
there's highly automated platform that
we are built is eventually made to serve
the developers to deploy their
applications right in the end so I'm
gonna take off my ops head and wear my
developer site here so if I'm a
developer I want to deploy my app so how
do I do it so domain talked about the
magic command in Cloud Foundry CF push
so let's look at C of portion action
here okay
it's gonna have to do yeah so all right
so let me do an LS here so what so as a
developer I am inside this folder this
is where I have my application binaries
okay so I have my application a groovy
app which is over here and then just to
let you know that I do not have anything
Cloud Foundry specific on my terminal
here okay all I have installed is a
Cloud Foundry CLI and then I have my
code and this is a groovy app as you
look at and then I have my applications
deployment descriptor which is this
manifest dot llamo and if I do a cat on
this all this is doing is that it's
telling Cloud Foundry that hey my
application name is so-and-so CF -
spring and allocating about 768
megabytes of memory to my app instance
and then I want to spin up ten instances
of this application right so I'm gonna
go ahead and run the CF push command and
I just started a CF push now while it is
doing CFO's let's try to understand what
CF which does then I do a CF push my app
binaries get uploaded onto the Cloud
Foundry platform right and then Cloud
Foundry is a truly polyglot platform
that means it can run your applications
written in any language
it has out of the box it has support for
about seven or eight language right so
it your app could be written in Ruby go
PHP Python whatever Cloud Foundry will
detect which is one time environment is
needed for your app so in this case it's
a groovy app it will it will pick and
choose it will pick up the glue you know
the appropriate build pack the JVM for
my groovy application it will take the
build pack and the application combined
together it creates something that we
call as a droplet which is a single
deplorable unit for my application and
then Cloud Foundry will spin up a
container for my app if you put the
droplet in it and then it will start the
application in case of this particular
demo I told Cloud Foundry to start ten
instances of my app so it will spin up
ten containers and after all these
application instances are up and running
it will also go ahead and configure the
routing for this application meaning any
request that is coming
for my app the routing tier will know
that I have ten instances for this app
so it will in a round robin fashion it
will you know route all these requests
to any of those instances of that
application and right as I finished my
description of C approach my app is up
and running here so I have ten instances
if I just run a CF apps I see ten
instances of the CF spring app in a
running and before I show you this app
in the web console think about this that
all these steps that CF push did if you
are trying to do all of this in a very
traditional environment this requires a
lot of efforts with multiple teams
having to work together and that takes a
lot of time so you are talking about a
very high operational efficiency and
developer productivity which the
platform actually brings to you okay so
here's my app it's up and running so I'm
gonna copy the route for this app and
then I'm gonna go to my web browser and
so here I am and my app is running and
if I keep refreshing this if you and if
I keep refreshing this web browser and
if you pay attention to the instance
index it will keep changing because
there are ten instances of this app
warning and then the routing component
actually is routing request to any of
the instances of the app yeah so very
cool
now you notice that he had full access
to the Oracle cloud infrastructure so
awesome thanks very much for doing that
what that what I reason I want to
mention that is it is actually an
engineering partnership so obviously
we've been working really tightly with
the pivotal team to do this and then
they have direct access into our cloud
to do all the testing as well so this is
meant as a real collaboration bringing
the two teams together um what I wanted
to do now is take you into the other
side of the story so now we've got Cloud
Foundry running the cloud is awesome I
can deploy my spring apps like an
employment go apps etc this is great but
now I want to plug into the ecosystem
within the Oracle cloud and the way
that's done as domaine talked about is
through a service broker a little bit of
a refresher for those of you who may not
be familiar with the concept of a
service broker it basically lets you tie
into external services or internal
services that you built she gave a
doorman gave examples of databases and
monitoring systems if you bring that
into an Oracle context it might be that
you're running some WebLogic workloads
and you'd like to tie into WebLogic
server or you might want to access an
Oracle database I would like a service
broker for an Oracle database or if
you're using some of our new path
services like our Kafka service or
Cassandra service or my sequel service
wouldn't be nice if I could have a
natural way of using those as tiles
within a cloud foundry and environment
for provisioning on provisioning and
seeing them and so forth that's what the
service broker does for you so what do
we do here this is the high level or you
we're gonna dig down into the details
but the idea is that we've got Cloud
Foundry running either on-premise or in
our cloud actually maybe on a third
party cloud we built a series of service
brokers that plugs into about seven or
eight six or seven different path
services that we have and the idea is to
bring Oracle work
integration into Cloud Foundry and
conversely actually let you extend Cloud
Foundry with a number of the path
services that we have the way we did it
is through two different types of
service brokers one is what we call a
service broker for Oracle paths you
remember when I opened up I said you
know Oracle has around 30 to 40
different path services we actually
built a virtual service broker if you
will that you can register within Cloud
Foundry and get access to those services
so it lets you actually tie into 4 or 5
services I'll let them nan talk about
the details behind it and actually it's
a it's a first step for us we actually
are looking for a market demand customer
demand for a number of the other
services because we have a very rich
portfolio amount space and that's
actually available now so you'll be able
to try that out the other piece that's
interesting about it is actually works
with our Oracle cloud machine so we have
path services that are running our cloud
Oracle cloud machine is an identical
capability on-premise those path
services are accessible via that service
broker then for our Oracle cloud
infrastructure the bare metal piece we
have a number of native services running
on that environment Oracle database
Exadata objects store so we built a set
of service brokers that actually expose
that and what I'd like to do is actually
turn it over to nan to sort of take us
through the path side of the house thank
you Mike
you guys can hear me right so this is
the first slide on the service broker
around path as you know we've been
talking about it this service brokers
allows us to extend the ecosystem and
what we have done is if you maybe not
understand but we have all the past
services that we have in our Oracle
cloud infrastructure cloud customer
there is a common control plane that
control plane a controls all and creates
all the services and manages all the
services we have implemented the service
broker api's on that has infrastructure
so there is a single endpoint single
service broker endpoint that you just go
and register and all the past services
are now available this is essentially
how you would do that you first step you
would go and register the broker you
just say create sir
broker give the credentials and give the
single endpoint that is managing that
one control plane for all pass services
today we expose the four five services
that Mike talked about but as if that
this customer demand will expose all of
our past services once you are there if
you just go and do CF service brokers
you'll see list of service broker you
should see one that he just registered
from Oracle and then if from then on you
can start creating services deleting
services you can create a database
service you can clear my sequel service
event hubs or is any of the services you
can create that that's the next set of
slides so if you did see if marketplace
you will see list of all the service
types that are available through all
these brokers once you have that start
creating them once the services are
created remember the services are not
actually getting created in the service
in the cloud foundry environment through
the service broker the call goes back to
the Oracle cloud infrastructure or to
cloud platform where these services are
being created there outside of cloud
foundry but cloud foundry is now aware
of that service so if you need CF
services you will list all the services
that you just created once you do that
your application developers can start
binding these services CF bind service
with your application name and the
service name and now that application is
aware and can't start using that pass
services is running somewhere else but
it becomes transparent for the developer
to use that so that essentially how all
external services work and that's
exactly how Oracle cloud services would
work that you want to talk about the
bare metal service so the other other
example that we built out here was
service broker for Oracle cloud
infrastructure so we have new set of
database capabilities on on bare metal
super high performance it's not only
Oracle database but EXO data as well as
our object store capability now this
service broker is done in a slightly
different way it's one that you actually
install inside of the cloud foundry
environment and it gives you the ability
to access these environments the next
thing is quite cool about this so the
the team has been working not only on
just traditional you know Stan
Oracle database but also with Oracle RAC
so we've been doing a lot of testing of
like what does it mean to hook up Cloud
Foundry to an Oracle rack back end and
then Exadata in the cloud as well as
exadata on-premise so it's quite a rich
operational capability that we're
bringing through this service broker API
now to sort of bring this to sort of
fruition and sort of imagine what this
would look like in your particular case
what I'd like to do is have an on talk
through the different types of topology
so sort of see what this looks like in
action thank you Mike so we talked about
to essentially ways of and it's true for
everything that you do right there is
one way you have everything on premise
you're running all your applications all
your backing systems etc everything on
premise and then of course there is
another way of running everything in the
cloud well that applies same here right
you could have your Cloud Foundry and
that's exactly a lot of our customer
does you talked about t-mobile t-mobile
is running Cloud Foundry on from Ice
right that's an example of a customers
running Cloud Foundry it can run on any
infrastructure on-premise it can run on
VMware it can run on OpenStack it can
run on HP Dell it can run on many places
but then those same customers may have
cloud services on-premise through our
cloud at customer so that's one model
where everything is running on premise
the other one which we talked about
today is you run a Cloud Foundry on
Oracle cloud infrastructure in our
public cloud and you are using public
cloud services from us so those are the
two and then of course there is a
combination of the DOS let me go into
details of each one of them and when you
combine them there is a third
combination I'll talk about that in a
hybrid model so if you are running
everything on-premise your Cloud Foundry
is running on your on-premise
infrastructure of choice and then within
that environment you can bring in our
cloud machines where whether it's X data
cloud machine or whether it's our Oracle
cloud machine for past services we
combine together we call clouded
customer between those all these
engineered system all these cloud
machines there is a single control plane
that the one that I was talking about
that exposes that service broker API so
the on premise Cloud Foundry environment
can simply run that create service
broker command give the on-premise
service broker endpoint and you can do
CF Marketplace and you'll see all the
services listed there to start creating
it essentially they'll get created on
the cloud machine so that's the first
one it will work for both pass services
running on cloud machine as well as the
exact data cloud machine which is a
separate cloud machine on itself for
Exadata workloads and then second one is
all of this thing works in the cloud
right you you have people Cloud Foundry
running on the way he just showed up
result on OCI and rest of our cloud
services on the public cloud well you
can combine them together right you
could still have a scenario where you
have either Cloud Foundry running
on-premise and want to talk to services
on the cloud yeah that's possible
because it's very easy to take a public
endpoint of your service broker give it
to your Cloud Foundry running on-premise
and it'll it'll see all the services
that are on the public cloud well you
have to be careful about you need to
make sure that there is enough bandwidth
between the two environment and there is
security and all of that but it is
possible that applications are running
on premise in the Cloud Foundry
environment to be able to talk to
services there in the cloud
especially for services that are not
that chatty they are designed to be
distributed like Kafka like Big Data
those spot services you can definitely
run in the cloud you don't have to bring
them on premise that allows you to
combine those scenarios so where are we
this is where we're at it's actually
more than imminent I think it's now it
happened yesterday in fact the CPI was
open sourced on Cloud Foundry network so
it's all out there right now you can go
to the github location I'll give you the
URLs the past service broker that andand
who's rushing out because he has a
presentation literally at 3:45 his team
put that out our next major steps are to
actually release the service broker for
the Oracle cloud infrastructure so that
one's just in the in the oven if you
will just about done and then also for
the object store so that's the next
major step and then over the next three
months we're kind of aim
for a particular conference that pivotal
runs in December that we will have sort
of general availability of a much fully
fleshed out story around it we're also
looking by the way for some early
adopters that we would like to share
their experiences with it perhaps at
that December conference so we're
looking for early adopters we also will
be taking feedback in terms of other
path services that we'd like to make
available through the service broker
stuff that you've seen already so why
run Oracle one run Cloud Foundry on
Oracle cloud you know basically it's a
real engineering collaboration pivotal
is here with Oracle Oracle's here with
pivotal we've done some really cool
stuff here I think it's one of the the
cooler ones in terms of really plugging
into that Oracle ecosystem really deep
integration with our paths whether
you're running WebLogic server whether
you're running our database if you're
looking at some other path services like
Kafka and cassandra and my sequel really
nice integration with that the flexible
topologies that Arnon took you through
is actually pretty interesting there
really isn't any other cloud provider
that's doing that kind of mix-and-match
a little bit on-premise a little bit
perhaps with cloud on-premise and also
mixing it in with a public cloud and
then of course that lets you plug into
the Oracle ecosystem the Oracle
workloads middleware workloads database
workloads application workloads as well
obviously we have a large SAS portfolio
then finally if you haven't looked at
Oracle cloud infrastructure it's
actually pretty interesting it's a
next-generation infrastructure as a
service so there's a number of blogs
that came out on Monday sort of
detailing this there was a press release
where it was highlighted and then we
drilled down a blog from an Oracle
perspective really taking you through
this presentation you saw today a deep
dive into the CPI and the service broker
piece from Devon one of the engineering
leads their door main and team put
together a nice overview from the
pivotal perspective and then we've also
given you links into the CPI code on
github as well as a terraform installer
so you can actually go try this out
today so I really like to say is thank
you to the team this has actually been
an incredible collaboration it's been a
lot of fun a little bit of an unexpected
partnership but as we sort of
to note and it's actually been really
exciting to bring it together so I
really want to thank the team and thank
you guys for coming today to see this
session thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
