in San Diego I work for a company called
Qualcomm Qualcomm basically makes the
chips 3G 4G CDMA 5g chips for most of
the smart phones out there pretty much
all the smart phones out there use our
technology okay the topic of today's
talk for me is how we use Oracle
application Express to build a project
and a portfolio management tool okay can
you hear me all right though all right
so with a show of hands how many people
here are familiar with Oracle
application Express okay okay so that
will give you an idea how deep I want to
go how much I want to introduce that
particular toolset all right so the
agenda for today's talk I'm going to
start with an introduction about myself
my career and now I got into the Oracle
space an overview of the solution a demo
of the solution and then also goes to go
through some if time permits some code
walkthrough and then have questions and
answers in the in the in the end so
something about me my role is I kind of
do many things at Qualcomm but primarily
driving the digital strategy at Qualcomm
build solutions that help us automate
things and on board customers and make
things self-service I'm involved in
pretty much every aspects of the
application right from CSS to sea level
presentation what that means is you got
to be a full-stack developer nowadays
and you have to be involved in every
aspect of the project to be successful
so that's kind of my role I've worked
for Oracle in the past and I've been
with Qualcomm for the past ten years and
some of the solutions that we deployed
at Qualcomm have one Innovation Awards
we won an Oracle Innovation Award for
the e-commerce solution that we deployed
and then Innovation Award for
sustainability for us application that
we build that helps us track conflict
mineral in our supply chain all right so
let me talk about what the problem
statement is one of my primary focus at
Qualcomm today is running our e-commerce
platform the e-commerce platform has
eight different groups that are owners
of that platform so every group has
different requests coming at us and we
have a really small team that's trying
to
kind of run that platform and add
enhancements and bug fixes and whatnot
so we have sales finance logistics
product management program management
engineering all the different groups
coming at us saying hey we need to add
this new product on the platform we need
to figure out a way how we are going to
do licensing how we are going to sell
software so what happens is I started
getting requests from many different
groups and it was becoming really hard
to track the requests and maintain a
roadmap track the budget and all that
kind thing in addition to that Qualcomm
being a big organization has many
different tools that do similar things
so we have HP's ppm if you are familiar
with that it got bought over by
microfocus I believe it's a it's a
change management tool set that's used
by one of the groups that I work with
then we have service now we have JIRA
for Incident tracking and also for
sprint management in addition to that we
have multiple e-business suites two
different instances of Warfel e-business
suite running and then a litany of other
tools and communication that happen over
email and SharePoint and whatnot so what
was needed was a centralized place to
manage our products to manage the
requests and have like a product
management solution in place so that's
that's what the use case was I wanted a
place where I could have roadmaps
releases resources change management and
reports and everything tracked in one
place with that in mind what we came up
with it eventually looked like this this
is what we call of the sales and their
platform dashboard this is the dashboard
that we used to track the changes and
the lifecycle of changes in the platform
it starts from a very high level where
you get a roadmap of your projects all
the various different projects that you
are working on they go to the next level
where you have a Kanban board go to the
next level where you can see which
resources allocated to what and track
all the way to support requests and see
how well we are responding to support
requests that are coming to us from
various different channels okay so what
did we build this in for those who are
not familiar we used a toolset called
Oracle application Express
it's free I will not say free they call
it a No
addition to Oracle database it ships
with Oracle database since 2004 and I
think then late the latest version that
they have is Oracle five point one point
four and that's what we are on in terms
of the database the solution was
originally built in Oracle X e 11g so we
didn't even go to the enterprise
installation the reason being if you
work for a big company you know how
complicated it is to procure servers
install software and all that you could
just download it from Oracle comm and
start using it right away so that's what
prompted this downloaded from Oracle and
started building the application over a
period of time now it's mature so we are
going to kind of put it in a more robust
environment so what are the advantages
of using Oracle application Express it's
one platform for the whole life cycle of
the project it's ad if you want to do
agile project management or product
development application Express is a
really good fit for that it helps you
with the user focused design its
database centric but you can do user
focused design so instead of waiting for
two weeks or a month before the user can
actually see the layouts you can start
with a user layout in mind okay it's a
browser-based development framework so
you're not leaving your browser to
develop you don't need to download
complicated JDeveloper and all those
tools you can just do it all over the
browser it comes up with an excellent
design library especially with after 5.0
the material the design that come come
out in the latest version it pretty much
have every component that you need to
build a robust web based either mobile
or desktop application and it's a
one-click deploy so once you're done
with it you just save it and it's ready
to go
okay so easy to hydrate easy to add more
functionality to it or app in a time
what kind of skill set do you need to be
able to use this platform foundational
HTML some knowledge of HTML CSS
JavaScript s sequel again it's a
database centric platform so whatever
you do in the database can be exposed
through a web layer which can be
accessed either through a browser or
through a mobile
advanced if you want to do some fancy
stuff then you get into things like
jQuery and JSON and rest that's when you
are integrating with other JavaScript
libraries in my case I wanted to use the
Oracle jet visualization components so I
had to like dig in a little bit and then
integrate that and Nan little bit of
knockout and other stuff to be able to
integrate that with this in terms of a
skill set from the left to the right
it's declarative and low code so to the
left is I would say a little bit more
complicated and to the right as you go
it's less complicated in terms of how
much code you need to write so App X
kind of is a good fit for somebody who's
got a PL sequel background and Oracle
forms background and then the previous
session they demoed the Oracle what they
call it business services visual Builder
services again that's pretty much
similar to Oracle epics I think in a lot
of ways but I think it has a lot of
integration built into it so what what
was the functionality that we had
eventually so this platform has a way
for us to track plan and track the
demand that's coming in so we have a
roadmap management in terms of Gantt
charts and track percentages of
completion where the demand is coming
from who the sponsors are we have a
Kanban board and much detail way to
manage the releases now the thing is
it's not working in isolation this tool
itself integrates with BPM the HP is BPM
so if I'm looking at the status of a
particular request I'm also able to get
the status of the Association change
request that's been created in ppm
traditionally what used to happen was we
used to look at the request here then
log in to ppm and see and make sure the
case is in the correct status so that it
can be released in the next release
cycle the advantage now is everything is
in one place and I can know okay this
release has been QA tested and it's
ready for development it's ready for
production and it has gone through all
the approvals so I don't need to jump
across multiple applications App X comes
with really excellent dashboarding
capabilities so that's been built in so
you get reports like what is the
resource allocation looking like how
many requests did we actually fulfill
for a particular business group
and in addition to that we have some
level of integration into our CLE
business suite because we want to do
some of our support out of this tool now
like if a user is not on board and
there's some issue with the user
onboarding you can query that out of
this tool and you don't have to log into
multiple e-business suite to figure out
what's going on in the user lifecycle in
addition to that what we have is also
integration with JIRA so we use JIRA for
email integration for support tracking
so any support request that comes into
the queue actually comes through an
email that goes to a mail list and
automatically creates a genetic JIRA
incident ticket now that's integrated
into this tool so what happens is now we
have all the support requests available
within this tool so we can report on it
we can see what the performance is in
terms of the response time and how
quickly we are able to resolve it in
addition to that we are also building a
knowledge base so somebody new who joins
the team can go through these old
support requests and resolve future
issues quickly in addition to that
frequently happening support requests
become enhancements requests and bug
fixes and that get resolved in the
future so we have metrics to able to be
able to look at that kind of information
any questions at this point ok so let's
take a look at how the configure the
architecture are very high-level ah very
good
no there is no plugin so JIRA comes with
the REST API depending on how the JIRA
is configured in your environment so
normally it's behind an SSL but what we
have done at Qualcomm is opened up one
particular instance of JIRA just for
rest which is not behind an SSL so it's
easier for us to do rest calls and pull
the data from zero ok so in terms of an
architecture what did we go with so we
have the Oracle XE database that's the
the core where all the business logic
resides we have a Apache Tomcat with RDS
running in front of it and then an
engine X reverse proxy so that's what we
we give out to the rest of the world
because the the instances in the back
might change so we want like a static
URL and be able to like redirect it to a
different instance at a later point in
time
all right so let's talk about it what
does it do I know very high level it
talks to multiple ERP systems we start
from the bottom talks to two different
ERP systems talks to HP's ppm talks to
JIRA and it's used by both management
and development and IT team and we call
it the sales in the platform dashboard
gives multi ERP view interfaces with the
other program management tools has a
Kanban board and executive reporting and
support and knowledge base in terms of
how did we pull the data out so the good
thing is if it is Oracle the best way to
get data out is created be billing right
why do anything fancy it's like speaking
to yourself using your interpreter just
go pull something from Oracle and do it
so with with the two oracle instances we
use the DB link HP's ppm to luckily was
also running on Oracle so we just opened
up a DB link from that into this system
for JIRA we had to use basically REST
API is to pull the information in
addition to that since the some of the
visualization components like the Oracle
jet required us to publish the data as
JSON stood up already as instance to
publish some of this information out as
a JSON and then consume it in the Oracle
jet visualization component and I'll
show a quick demo of that any any
questions all right so let's take a look
at this application correct that's right
and I'll walk you through that the
process the workflow that I normally
used to build it
all right so this is basically your
homepage this is where you come in and
you get a list of your projects the
moment you arrive so this is more like
an executive level and gives you like
what are the projects we are working on
how much they are completed and I have
multiple such Gantt charts I just picked
this up for the demo today I didn't use
the visualization components from Jett
iwas what is called as Google's timeline
if you looked at Google's charting
capability so they have a Gantt chart
and a timeline I didn't want anything on
the left hand side that shows me the the
project name I wanted the project name
to be a label so I went with this
particular layout and there is so what I
did was I picked up the Google's
timeline and then consumed that data as
consume that data in epics and then
rendered the thing for this I didn't
have to actually create a rest data
service so what I did was on the page if
you go into the declaration I have an
object and he a hidden field that
basically pulls the club from the
database and then on page load I pass
that to the JavaScript component for the
Google timeline and that renders that
timeline at that point in time so the
event is at the time of page load
basically go get the data
get the app x4 I use the plug-in to get
the club data out of the database and
then basically attach it to the
JavaScript component at that point in
time okay
yes yes so let me really quickly go to
that so at the core Oracle itself comes
with really good visualization so I'm
using pretty much a lot of the Oracle
core components in addition to that
there are plugins if you're familiar
with Oracle apex community there are a
lot of plugins out there if you go to
app X dot world there are tons of
plugins there so I'm using some of those
plugins wherever the plugins were
inadequate then that's where I'm like
going and writing on the writing our own
JavaScript and embedding it into the
into the page in line in line yeah
everything is in line but it's not
declarative because you're actually
writing JavaScript code okay so ideally
you want it to be declarative because in
the long run you hand it off to somebody
if it is declarative it's much easier to
manage and the other thing is it will
sustain upgrades and other things if it
is not declarative it's normally a
little bit unstable so you want to go
with declarative as much as possible but
when it cannot be done you want to go
with one of these libraries in addition
to that the good thing is jet also has a
CDN library so you don't have to really
import all the JavaScript libraries into
your into your program you reference the
CDN the content delivery network and
just load whatever components you want
using require so it uses a framework or
require.js
through which you can load the
components that you want so I use the
combination of that to load the
components so let's take a look at this
application again let me go through one
by one any feel free to ask me any
questions at this point in time
go back here okay all right so this is
kind of the high level project Gantt
chart this is the project list so again
not a lot of coding out of the box
apex comes with a component which is
like percentage if you convert a number
field into percent it automatically
draws a graph for you which will kind of
automatically adjust if you 100 it will
fill the whole thing ever it is 50 it
will just fill half of it so that's the
functionality here built a Kanban board
here the idea was to have a section
where you see all the open requests in
progress and closed very simple and
should be able to drag and drop right
and the status changes so again this can
be done out of the box using the not the
dragon table part but the the building
of the Kanban in a pecs
let me quickly walk you through how that
is done so assuming that you have the
data structure defined where you have
all your requests stored in the database
all you need to do is go add a region
and add three sub regions one open in
progress and closed based on statuses
and then you basically have a list with
something called as a card type so by
default there are many layouts what I
used is a cards layout in app X so that
makes it really easy to render that
particular page in a card layout which
is what normally if you see other Kanban
boards use so that is a Kanban board
there again declarative not a lot of
coding here
okay so let's take a look at
announcements in addition to that what I
have is a release calendar so this is
again based on the standard
out-of-the-box calendar feature again I
went through many different products I
looked at asana I looked at JIRA zone
Kanban board I looked at many different
things the most important thing for me
was being able to pull data from many
different systems and they are on the
cloud it's not possible right and there
were like little things I wanted to be
changed they're going to be asana is not
going to support me right away it's
going to be like a six month before my
change request maybe gets through their
product management so this is easier to
build so ended up rolling our own so
this is the calendar the default
interactive report has a lot of filters
so if you just want to see what your
next release is going to be hit that and
then you get all your releases and you
can do your release planning now the
interesting thing here is this view that
you're looking at the data is coming
from two different systems this is
coming from the XE and this data is
actually coming from HP's BPM normally
we will have an Excel spreadsheet and
we'll be jumping back and forth trying
to figure out what the status is now I'm
like hey what's the status why haven't
you progress to stick it I can just
manage everything from this particular
section and the developers love it it's
easier for them to manage as well now
the next section is owners this tells
you who's assigned what requests so they
can know what their priority is in
addition to that relief stats so again
don't need to do anything special or a
period of time it will tell you which
group you are releasing for how many
requests and who's been working on those
yeah sorry
correct I haven't built out the
drill-down but there are events where
you can definitely do drill downs and
it's pretty straightforward I didn't
have a need because this is more for the
management to look at easy for me to
report saying hey we've been working on
so many different things kind of thing
the other thing I was talking about is a
support request so let me go click on
that again it gives you a graphical
representation of where the support is
coming from so this is integrated with
our JIRA tool and it pulls the
department information so it gives you
an infirm gives you an idea of all the
various different groups that are
requesting support and you can break
them down and give a stat of that the
last time we ran this was 2012
yeah 2012 have to update this the other
thing we measure ourselves is by
response time I think this is not a
native chart this is one of the plugins
I believe I don't remember now but this
tells you how quickly we are able to
respond to support requests I think so I
don't remember now it's been a few
months since I built it the pie chart is
left polar chart polo shirt so it gives
you an idea like we respond within one
minute for a lot of the requests pretty
much all that is all the requests are is
replied and at least the first contact
is made within the first 10 minutes so
that's kind of what we want to report
and we see over a period of time how we
are doing and we as a team are pretty
tenacious about getting to the customers
right away the other things are like
this is the knowledge base that keeps a
track of all the requests and then this
is the weekly trend again a good way to
visualize how busy we are as a team is
to look at every weekly trend so let me
quickly log in here and pull the weekly
trend so this gives you idea of what a
day looks like for somebody who's
working on this platform so these are
basically events each and every droplet
that you see is an event basically it's
a support request or some kind of a call
or something happening in the system or
automated alerts coming saying the
pricing is not their customer order is
not being shipped so we capture that and
throw it on building to what is called
as a timeline this is the Oracle jet
component
and Iowa a rest api that a rest service
that publishes this data and consume
this and I put it in a model window
because I wanted it to take up the whole
screen so that you see that you can just
go through and get an idea of how busy
or how less busy you are or appear time
okay in addition to that what we have we
have like other kind of charting like
the photo notification a bunch of
stacked charts and graphs and whatnot
and then a way for us to manage
resources so pretty much does everything
that we want out of a product management
tool and if there is a need if we need
to add more functionality it's it's not
complicated because its roll low code
and declarative we just go and add new
functionality so let me go through any
questions at this point
all right so let me go through the
workflow of how how how I go about
getting the development done right for
how do you like if you have a jet
component that you want to incorporate
into your Oracle application Express
what's the workflow the first thing is
style obviously your life starts at
Oracle jet demo ground which is
basically the cookbook so go into the
cookbook and then if the visualization
components that I used so I'll go pretty
much at the bottom here and the Gantt
chart let's take a look at this and if I
like something that I want to use in the
previous demo they were saying that
there the whole code is here so what I
do is I open a J Friedel instance and
set that up there was a CDN that setup
for Oracle jet so just go ahead and set
the CDN and then
there you go
now you also want to test dynamic data
here you have to somehow publish your
rest api is into the fiddle so that you
can actually see with real data so what
you have is a really good service called
my Jason comm there you can just fake
your data and it will give you an URL
that you can reference in this
particular jsfiddle and you can play
with it so if you go here this is the
json that's coming out of my json the
way it works is you go into my json comm
wrong you are
so prepare your JSON in whatever system
you like paste it here save it it will
give you a permanent URL go plug that
URL in jsfiddle and then go make the
changes once all of this is done and I'm
happy with the way it is looking I'm now
ready to build some dynamic
functionality into it so I'll go into
Oracle APICS at that point in time and
what I do in APICS is basically there's
a page load component so let's go take a
look at one of those let me pick up the
timeline one because I know it uses so
what I have is on page load first we
have to have required here so I
reference the required J's here that's
the primary so that's at the page level
you can do it on a global page if you're
going to be using it across the whole
application I am NOT so I do it at the
page level and then you go into one of
the applications one of the JavaScript
events and on load of the page what you
do is you reference the libraries that
you're going to use in that particular
page and then require you in require
just mention the components that you're
going to use and then the rest of the
code goes at the bottom basically and
then you make your JSON calls from there
and put your put your logic in there for
the visualization any any questions
yes yes so jQuery to parse it but I
don't like to pass if it is PL sequel I
have complete control son
corrector do that too as well yeah I've
done that
I put an event handlers at page-load
which are not like native to APICS and
then written code to actually go deal
with those events handle those events
not not something I want to do because
the thing is the productivity of this
platform is being trying to be low code
when you start writing a lot of code
then you're moving away from the basic
premise of using this platform okay
what's incredible about App X for me is
the productivity so this is not like
done by two or three developers just by
me in my free time so this is not my day
job and over a period of time was able
to build this rapidly scale it and this
has spawned other products now so we
have a totally different product
management project management tool
that's been used internally by our
project managers that came out of this
and somehow people in engineering and
other groups caught a whiff of this and
they're like can you release the code we
want to use this for our own product
management we don't want to use
confluence or JIRA or whatnot because
it's not integrated and we want
something really simple kind of thing so
this is a platform I encourage if you
have Oracle license then it's it's it's
worth giving a try ok
yes yeah I'll walk you to that so here's
a good example let's go into the SQL
workshop and going to the restful client
so for the list of projects I have
written a API which basically gives you
a list of project all it's doing is it's
calling a function in the in the
database and it returns an application
or a JSON format as the response and it
gives you a JSON document with all the
project lists so if I go here I already
have the URL because I knew this will
come up so what you do is you basically
call this URL from JavaScript and it
breaks it down and gives you a JSON
document with the rest with the ORD s
installed and publishing a restful api
from from oracle is really easy there
are times where you cannot just use a
query to do it there are times where you
would like to use what what they are
called as I don't remember the term
their sub queries but they won't be like
encapsulated in objects the way you want
it
because the JavaScript library would be
expecting objects to be the JSON to be
in a certain format so that's where you
are not writing queries anymore you are
writing functions that return globs and
then basically publish those out to the
JavaScript to consume
all right and that's all I had any other
questions at this point I went to a lot
of it
not using swagger I'm not even familiar
with it I'm trying to get up to speed
and it's a moving target I don't think
it's matured yet so yeah not right yeah
no none of that this is just like a how
would I put it it's not being used
across the department so this is not a
really need to create that level of
documentation abstraction at this point
in time if it becomes like an enterprise
app where multiple teams start using it
then we'll start using all those tool
sets not at this point in time yes
this is five point one point four and I
think it's four point one for article
jet the the previous version not the
latest yeah so no so the funny thing is
that I said this is running on an honor
on an Oracle database that has less
memory than this it's unbelievable and
it's quick it's incredible performance
it's like I I'm amazed and the reason is
I didn't have to go procure a hardware I
didn't have to go after somebody to get
a pool I could just spin this up because
the whole idea was to quickly prototype
something and over a period of time see
if there is a valid ID and a business
case and then we have enough Oracle
service to move this into so that will
eventually happen but as of now it's
just running on a virtual machine and
what one 1gb of SGA that's pretty much
it and I haven't had a performance issue
with it even though it's talking to
multiple systems in the back end
extremely ugly yeah
correctly correct and the reason I put
the nginx in the front was it's going to
move so I didn't want the URLs and the
bookmarks and all that kind of move so
I'll point the reverse proxy to
something else
once the move actually happens
all right
the plugins okay so let me walk you
through most all the other plugins are
free I have seen only one paid plug-in
from Oracle apex pretty much all of them
are free so if you go to appids dot
world and click on plugins you have a
whole library of plugins ok plugins you
can write your own as well ok the other
thing is if you are familiar with
JavaScript you don't have to use the
plug-in but then plugin is a declarative
way to do it and it does some of the
heavy lifting for you
so we can get away with it so I first
look for the plug-in if I don't find
what I'm looking for
then I'll go do my hack my own basically
that's
good
correct correct correct yeah and the
community is really helpful
for the whole oracle jet and APICS
really good combination and the
community is really helpful say if you
get stuck you put something you
definitely get a response real quick
yes/no Arkell jet you it's it's a free
download from Arco it's open source you
don't need an account or anything it
just go download and start using it
right away what I highly encourage is go
to the Oracle jet cookbook page so they
have a cookbook with really good
examples and it gives you a flavor of
what jet is capable of so you go here
you are all the different applications
right and then let me open up one of
them so we go into the diagram what they
have here is not just a working
application also the code the source
code that works with it so right here so
this is the kind of the application
let's say the UI layer and here's the
HTML and this is the Java Script so all
of this is kind of available for
everybody to play with and they have
really good samples for pretty much all
the use cases that you want they have
samples in there and you can leverage
those to build your application and I
didn't have to really go through the
documentation too much I just went
through this and figured out how it's
working
I'm not using that so I have not started
using
okay god I haven't played with that
enough one of the reasons is I'm running
XC and some of our services are running
SSL XC doesn't have all its support so
I'm not able to reach the rest endpoints
at all so till I get it into a 12c or
somewhere where a water can be stored
and then I can have the ACL configured
I'm going to be limited and that okay
the other thing
oh there's one other thing I wanted to
cover is this epics underscore JSON
function or is a package so if you want
to create JSON objects from Oracle
database this is what you will use it's
much easier I tried using the regular
way where I hand coded it and then
eventually I found a blog post that said
this is the right way to do it and I
kind of ended up using that it's very
helpful to generate JSON documents
basically using cursors and whatnot it
opens the braces for you closes the
braces adds the commas and all that kind
of thing you say open object and close
object at the very bottom it will do the
rest of the things for you so go check
it out and then I think a couple really
good blog post on that topic which you
can kind of look at and get an idea of
how to go about using it all right
no not yet no a vacation okay
mother
okay
there's
people generally
are you Oracle a lot of knowledge
worried sir yeah quick cigarette
got it everything fit alright any any
other questions otherwise I think we're
you're going to finish a little early
all right yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's
pretty straightforward it has an export
functionality you just go export it it
comes out as a sequel just sequel dump
and then you may also need to have all
the dependent objects available in the
destination database right if you have
tables and whatnot it is reffering so
you they need to be there in the
dependent data in the target database as
well and in addition to that APIs also
has a dependency report the first thing
you will do is run our dependency report
and see what are the objects that that
particular application is dependent on
which objects you need yeah it will tell
you which objects you need yes I did I
answer your come again plugins okay I do
not know I think I do not know about
that whether the plugins come out it
does come okay I am Not sure but seems
like the plugins also gone and then you
won't that
oh really
with the five version right it's it's
leaping bounds ahead of what it was I've
been in the I've been using epic since
2004 the first time I was exposed to
epics was when I was at Oracle I was
working at Oracle and it was called
Project Marvel I believe internally yeah
and then it was HTML DB and I was amazed
because I was a j2ee developer and this
seemed so easy coming from a Java
background where you're writing JSP so
I've been seeing the progress and with
the JavaScript framework there is
actually no limitation anymore because
if there's something that Apple's
doesn't do you just write JavaScript to
do it and with the rest there's no
limitation on just getting data out of
Oracle as long as it's available as a
rest endpoint you can get pretty much
get the data from anywhere and so the
limitations which were there have kind
of kind of receded in a lot of ways no
sequel exactly yeah
all right absolutely
I will I think there's a way they're
going to publish the slides out yeah so
I will give it to them and I don't think
they're going to put it on the portal or
something so I will make sure it's
available out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
