lot of the day guests after lunch and I
guess they put us in the hardest slots
early morning after lunch because we are
so awesome doesn't make sense it makes
sense to me alright so we will try to
wake you up after lunch with the
research into Devils levelness yay yay
this is marketing solution architect AJ
frog at Miguel pin on Twitter and this
is Baruch he is the frog with a hat I am
and he's at Jay Baruch on Twitter so I'm
a developer advocate with Jeff rocks so
basically I speak about what he does and
also I would prepare the special page
for this talk at different comes to my
show notes and you should go there for
the slides the video that will be posted
there by tomorrow all the notes about
the stuff that we are talking about and
smaller ruffle to thank you for being
here
well well this call is talks like it's
called a research and why is that well
it's called research because we
interviewed people and we interviewed
actually quite a few people starting a
course at home best research starts at
home with the VP of R&amp;amp;D at a start-up of
200 people called TJ frog which we had
good connections with yeah we know the
guy that knows the guy that knows the VP
of R&amp;amp;D in Jeffro alright and we spoke
with the CTO Boxey which is a very young
startup that just went to market and
they do very cool stuff if they do they
see bugs bugs see see bugs and in mobile
development so they help in us mobile as
developers for model mobile platforms to
find back basically right they just got
started and they are very interested for
our perspective because of that so a lot
of the companies we talk to you they
were perfectly happy to talk to us but
not on the record
so you're going to see a couple of these
so one was the CTO at a top finance firm
in Israel there are a lot of finance in
Israel a couple of really big ones
that's one of them yeah that's their big
of course by Israeli a by Israeli
measures right yeah this is eight
million people but still as if they were
engineering as a departure is mr. Leone
the garlic thank you very much
he's ready and he promised to throw us
badly if we somehow represent him wrong
that's not good
exactly check on us CTO at Sanford so
sent bird is a Russian startup another
Russian New York I want close enough
that does a perfume by subscription yes
if you like this subscription things
there is one for perfume as well another
secret one are detected top fortune rate
it privately health that firm we try to
make it as anonymous as possible
basically a very important guy huge huge
huge firm and the appliance engineering
manager at a fortune 500 software
company that's also like basically the
same yes companies you would recognize
if we were allowed to use her name which
says they were not yeah so and this is
the people we spoke with and they gave
us answers to the questions that were
presented and this talk is basically
their answers in our slide in
interpretation right and so the other
side of it was we said bottlenecks and
DevOps
so what's DevOps broke and I guess we
already answered this question this
morning how many of you attended the
keynote okay not all of you so for the
rest of you
this is delp's the marriage between
development operations and QA is called
DevOps then the QA didn't make it to the
name because they recognized quality is
important much later when the name of it
already coined and also it does
that's fun like what dev QA o this Q ups
so you know Baruch I've seen your
keynote it's a great talk and I'm sure
everybody loved it
but I really actually hate this diagram
I don't really think that it correctly
represents the Venn diagram that is
DevOps I actually think it should look a
little bit more like this this is a very
ugly diagram just saying it is a very
ugly diagram but it's much closer
representation of what DevOps is you
take most of everything in DevOps in
development operations QA you blend them
together kind of chunky and there's some
stuff that stays outside but for the
most part they're all together you know
the idea of a Venn diagram where it's
just a small circle in the middle that's
not really what DevOps is it's it's
basically everything together all
starting to overlap and as time goes on
they get closer and closer together and
start merging more and more this is kind
of an important conception as we're
going to go through today's talk about
you know because a lot of the things
we're going to talk about are really
that process of making them come closer
together so another interesting question
is the relationship between delts and
continuum and delivery especially
continuous delivery because there are
different things obviously but they are
very close tight together
no one does DevOps just wish for for the
fun of them well some people are but
they do it because it's a trend but
those who actually do it for a good
reason delivery is the reason right
because that's that's what the social
company is about getting this software
out there getting the software released
that's kind of continues I would say
they do it to make money but well they
different every day right so this is
like the continuous delivery cycle which
is also very close to the DevOps
infinite loop and because they are kind
of related together so we're going to
talk about delivery a lot and one of the
really interesting things
is we talked to all these different
firms and we asked them what is your
delivery cycle and it was all over the
map I think set bird one with the
shortest cycle at two hours and it went
all the way up I'm using this company
yes told us by a very big secret that
their lead cycle is six months they
released two versions of you and Mark
here has been more a horrible story yeah
so I was spent before I joined I frog I
spent eight years at RV accusation our
release cycle was three years to 18
months so we can add that yes and and my
question is how I mean why very such a
cute gear and I would say my theory was
when I asked the next question who are
going to present you is that okay there
is longer recycle that people hate and
there is short people cycle that people
love right and everybody want to go from
the long one to the short one so the
next question we asked are they happy
with it and now with your turn to wake
up a little bit and vote who things that
no one was happy with their release
cycle couple of hands thank you who
things that 20% of the people that we
spoke with we were happy with their
cycle no one saw 20 percent all right
how about 50/50 there's this faith best
statistically it should be that so thank
you and how about 80 percent satisfied
right 80 percent those probably over
there six months were satisfied as much
how about everybody were satisfied no
hands
good because that's the correct answer
everybody all that interview where
quaint resistor that it's wider is there
any cycle well and let's caveat that
side
all of them claimed that they were
satisfied with their release cycle most
of the time which you know is a site
refinement there are some times when
they weren't happy but it you know for
the most part they were satisfied and
that brought up the question how they
know how can you be satisfied I'll do
measure whether it's good or bad that
was kind of our next question and we got
some great quotes for this one I don't
manage because I didn't have any
complaints right and then they're
satisfied because why not
when the bucket is empty we're good or
when I feel fewer tickets on the process
gonna get fewer tickets on the process
when people complain less probably means
that I do everything good automation of
every single piece when everything was
automated clearly my release cycle is
correct and that they definitely not the
guys with the 6-month release cycle yes
so and we heard other measures as well
that people think about they might want
implement someday yeah so version
adoption how often do people adopt the
versions of the software they put out
we're going to talk about that that's
very important but burndown diagrams
when I was with the army we used to
obsess over our bug burned down diagrams
that's why you really is they were
saying use productivity gains this is
actually so one thing I should note by
the way is a number of people we talked
to actually ran tools teams inside these
large organizations especially as we get
to larger ones there are customers sorry
about that and the large customers are
our customers so they're they're running
tools teams basically because that's
what we provide and so from their
perspective if something that used to
take two days is now taking two minutes
there are very happy campers quality yep
well again this kind of going back to
the background
diagram right so once you can guarantee
the quality it's probably good good base
and mg/dl and finally business metrics
this is actually one of the most logical
ones though it wasn't one of the ones I
expected to show up which is simply that
if you're making your annual numbers on
upsells and new sales then your product
is probably doing well and if your
product is doing well um presumably your
release cycle is doing well
but it really brought up a very
interesting point none of these metrics
none of these metrics except maybe the
last one would really tell you if you
weren't releasing fast enough
some of them would tell you if you were
releasing you know too fast but not fast
enough hard to say so the real question
is what is the release release cycle and
and I guess so we have two Muppets here
which a accidentally it brings us to
speak about two different types of
software and part of all of the people
that we spoke with we're doing a service
for example a standard and but Jeff
running part of it that we were for for
Bentley and our Factory in the cloud and
others our product things that people
download and then manually upgrade so
for example x-factor and pram and and a
couple of others and their release cycle
is completely different and that's
because on Prem software requires the
user to be motivated to upgrade and that
basically means and those my Russian
roots are speaking all over the slides
that you have to have enough food in the
meal so people who operate right and
learning is very hit because it was his
boat and my illustration do is great
cool right so you need to have an
incentive to upgrade because it will
take time it will take money and then it
reduces great risk
in order to do that and that's not the
case with service which just get
operated behind the scenes and next time
you use it you get a new version and if
we will separate those answers on the
release cycle we will get two very
distinct groups the month and the weeks
are for software for downloadable
software and the hours and the days are
for service right yeah I think the
longest fast time line we had was one
week and the shortest on-prem time line
we had was two weeks so I actually got
you and I don't touch each other but
this is where this is where they are
separated right yeah okay so that was
like an introduction to set the stage a
little bit about the release process and
then we're people happy or not and now
let's take about bottlenecks for just
like spear I don't know it's just an
illustration for bottlenecks no I hate
bottleneck hello beautiful
now figure it out alright so again bass
or all our interviews we managed to
identify those big three the interesting
part about education automation and
trust as bottlenecks is the same they
apply to all three aspects of Devils
there are problem with education
automation and trust in tools there is
problem with education automation in
trust in processes and there is the same
bottlenecks with educational dimensional
trust in people it's hard to automate in
the school so it does okay but also an
interesting point is that we show these
kind of it's layers because they're also
a little bit of an order as well um you
know typically first you educate then
you automate then you trust all three
things kind of has to happen a little
bit simultaneously
but you know to some extent they happen
in this order and so we're going to talk
about them winning in that order
we need a 3d diagram here to express all
these complicated things and beep yes
yeah okay
education education and this more or
less sums up everything we have to say
on education right there is nothing as
good to educate people as thing and you
know this is true and we're not saying
throw into we're not saying throw them
over the you know we're not saying throw
people into the pool and watch them
drown some of us do but if people are
drowning they'll typically wonder why I
sign so this is a great quote you need
to know you need to believe you need to
give a and so what do we mean by
this so first of all you need to know
about it you need to know about the
sorts of tools that make software
possible but then you need to believe it
can be done so I as I said before I work
for Jay Fogg I worked as a defense
contractor for army acquisition I'm not
going to say which program because I'm
about to say something awful about them
and you know we were a pretty sharp team
of engineers you know I worked with that
team for for you know five five to eight
years depending on how you counted and I
would stand them up against pretty much
any other time these engineers in the
company in the country but at the end of
the day we didn't believe that you know
automation would work for us you know we
knew about it we needed that people out
in the industry were doing it but we
thought that they just had life easier
than we did in that you know all the
various things that the government was
putting in our way would have prevented
us from doing automation successfully so
you stopped writing we stopped right
there and then I know other teams that
we interviewed by the way that knew damn
well that automation was possible um and
they just didn't do it
um in fact in one case they were going
out and telling people how wonderful
automation was and still weren't doing
it themselves not in fact quite so much
because they didn't care but because
part of caring is investing resources
and resources are hard to come by
whether you're a small company or a
large one there's always some obstacle
to investing resources in something and
to and to them the biggest ones are of
course that right it requires a lot of
money and activation energy right and
and here we are talking about the change
that we we mentioned couple times and in
case you didn't get it that people
pushing the airplane on the runway no no
it's not a joke they explain the picture
the joke is in flight No okay we're good
all right so yeah sorry about that
activation energy for a change is is
hard and and we spoke about DevOps and
the Delft sarva is about change and
getting people to start making this
change is very hard and then we kind of
start rolling and then usually the
organization does some organizational
change new teams new managers and we are
back to square one another very
important aspect of its not exactly not
giving a sheet but that I'm willing to
go through this change is of course the
fear for for job security and the good
news about it is that I have never seen
that headline never and in fact we
talked specifically to the people we
interviewed about this issue if North
the large companies I mean the small
startups it's just isn't our problem
they've got working at a start-up if
you're being at all successful usually
the problem is you can't hire fast
enough not that people are worried about
losing their jobs so even
the larger companies the the job that is
in jeopardy at least perceptional II the
most is of course the QA right when we
go on this automation journey and DevOps
is done as an automation journey the the
people that fear for their job will be
the manual to engineers and so first of
all manual QA doesn't completely
disappear as we named two extra math or
QE yes and so and importantly it moves
earlier in the process you know you need
to automate the later stage tests rather
than having the manual QA be at the end
you could do the manual QA up front as
part of your exploratory test process
and your real regression tests are all
automated but the other thing is that if
you're used to thinking about test
design for manual that is a portable
skill you know it's not the easiest
thing to port from you know a manual QA
to an automated QA mindset that I know
plenty of people that have made that
jump and we're going to talk about
Jeffro we can talk about our QA and
release again that that went away and by
then I don't mean they went home right
they were hired as manual Kay engineers
many years ago and now there are not
many okiya engineers anymore but they're
all still with us and actually we
desperate for more like them yeah and
that was something everybody said is it
in reality this buildup of automation
whether it's the ops team the QA team on
the dev side for almost every good
person we interviewed and we interviewed
some very high up managers in many cases
what actually ended up happening they
weren't letting people go they were
hiring more because they found that as
they were more productive they could do
more they were giving better ROI to the
company they were being invested in by
the company and their teams were
actually growing not shrinking even
though they were gaining huge boost in
productivity or actually not even though
because they were gaining huge boost in
productivity so I just summarized a
little bit of what we spoke about the
first push is hard that that's one of
the things and that's on top of knowing
and believe
and giving you that's like real
obstacles that are having front-right it
for that to pass this first push keeping
an eye on the prizes is critical right
knowing what you are about to gain from
this process is what actually makes it
impossible and I'm not saying it's easy
you know for some of these large
companies we talked about with large
legacy code bases the transformation
process took more than a year in some
cases was still ongoing and we talk to
them more than a year in but I didn't
need a single person not a single person
who had even the slightest regret for
the effort and resources they invested
in it we spoke with one of our engineers
that we didn't put on this list because
he he is not very well to stuff because
they don't do that ops they don't do
DevOps because they're not there yet did
they want to do it right but when we
speak about people that care about it
and this is going back to knowing
believing and and actually care to do it
those guys that didn't care to do it
they were in this old world with slow
releases they believe that everything is
fine they go to see loads of development
and three she was the development QA and
end operations works for them as exactly
the work for them or didn't work for
them ten years ago they were in the
industry not very competitive industry
they just didn't want to do it and they
didn't but whoever believes that it's a
good thing no one regrets the process
although it is very painful right and
and that brings us to the next topic
which is the automation challenge and
automation challenge is solved by two
tools need to be immutable you need to
they have immutable you need to have an
immutable infrastructure you know the
current common trend today is
immutable servers you build the server
once and throw it away when you're ready
to build the next one you make no
changes to the server which is a very
different thing than it was just a
couple years ago everything needs to be
scriptable infrastructure is code needs
to be universal whatever you're doing
you want to be able to do it everywhere
throughout your environment and you
bring those things together what you
have is repeatable infrastructure and
this is really cool I ran into it
recently once with something as simple
as a Jenkins server switching over to
Jenkins pipelines you know the Jenkins
server went down while I was in the
middle of an experiment and I realized I
was using Jenkins pipelines and I
brought it back up in five seconds you
know this sort of thing this
repeatability the infrastructure
disappears or a server goes down hard
and you don't care because everything is
just immediately repeatable and brings
spins itself back up again it's amazing
it's really hard to describe how
different it makes you feel about
operations until you've actually tried
it and that's another very big enabler
of Devils because one of the one of the
reasons why developers are not running
to implement DevOps is because they
don't want to mess with off they don't
want setup servers they don't want to
maintain servers they don't need all
this they ride their beautiful code and
whatever happens after it's ready no
they don't care anymore but here we have
the ability to make ops very
approachable make it very developer
friendly and those three are our daqui
right if a developer knows how to spin
an immutable and repeatable data center
out of their machine I'm not talking
about the server I'm talking about the
whole data center why not
it's cool let's do it now here is
another something as we learn from the
successful implementation of those tools
and I'm talking about guide don't
State and we saw two types of
approaching the problem of how we
introduce new tools or organization it
comes from the tools teams in bigger
organizations there is no issue in small
ones there are three developers that
decide what they use them to start using
it when there are 12,000 developers it's
a challenge of how you aim how you
introduce new tools and and and one of
the most important outcomes is guide
don't dictate because when in companies
when that try to suddenly switch what
their developers and iteration themes
are used to it creates resistance
naturally because people don't use those
tools people are not ready to lose souls
and for a lot of project those tools
aren't a good fit so instead we so
couple of companies that do really cool
stuff and that's one of the examples
yeah this was a really interesting guy
we spoke to so he was one of the higher
up people spoke to and he built out sort
of this investment matrix of he would
take a given tool and say okay this is
something the tools team is going to
invest in and we recommend other people
invest in because we're basically giving
you resources for free or this is
something we're researching for a next
round if you're an early adopter maybe
you want to try it and give us some
feedback or this is something that you
know we're using we're maintaining we're
not really looking to push it but we
certainly think you can continue using
it or this is something you know we're
just sick of dealing with and we want to
stop using it and we would like you to
stop using it this was kind of the way
he built it out but what I thought was
really important about the way he did
his matrix is he talked to the
developers every time he unboard 'add a
new team or he um boarded a new stack he
would build a slack channel and invite
all of the developers on that on that
stack to join the slack channel for
about a week and just start throwing out
questions and asking people to answer to
discuss among themselves what
they thought of the stack what was their
actual experiences you know this tool
that everybody uses do you actually like
it what are the 80% solution for Jenkins
servers that will cover 80% of the teams
if I get this set of plugins 80% of the
teams and the company will be covered
and then I can put out Jenkins servers
for that 80% and then for that 20% that
isn't covered then I'll talk to them
about you know spinning up Jenkins
servers with custom plugins he had a
real research-based approach to it and
what was amazing to me was sort of the
high success rate he had at a very large
company in getting people to use the
stack on because of that research-based
approach to building it out and another
example of aim for the 80% might be a
little bit more in hands-off it is just
providing a stack for the company and
letting the teams that don't want the
stock fire their own bells right and it
of course brings back pain is
instructional because without the
support they will probably pick wrong
tools and fail and then come back and
say ok teach us what tools we need to we
need to use but but this a concept of we
want dictate this is what we support
this is what you can get for free in
terms of money and resources and
education we will do all that for you if
you don't want it just fine take your
budget of your team splendid and
licenses spend it on education spend it
on implementing this tool stack is
eventually there was the right decision
great otherwise pain is instructional
welcome back we told you to take that
right so that that that works for for a
lot of conflicts let's talk about trust
there is like snacks right here you know
trust is is really the thing that came
up again and again and again and again
throughout the questions that we asked
it comes back to that so this is of
course a very nice imaginary cycle in
which every commit and ends up in
production it is so awesome that it
passes all the automated tests the zest
are so awesome that they cover 100% of
the use cases and eventually we produce
a box bug free and ideal software when
in real life some commits should
actually fail right and and this is
important you know people always think
about you know this continuous
integration process they're like oh my
god a test failed the build broke you
know this is a crisis and I mean sure
you should fix it right away and you do
need to take it very seriously but if
your tests are never failing that's the
one worse yes I've been there I've done
it I've seen it you know um and usually
what that means is that if your
automated tests aren't the things that
are failing then your users get to find
the bugs and that's never fun so we're
talking to you lets you write bug-free
code which we do at least that i don't
work you and so and this is about and
how that is related to trust the QA
process both manual or automatic is
about is about trust is about building
the system that you know that will fail
whatever should fail and Trust isn't
something that only happens in software
development and by the way interesting
fact of all the people we interviewed
while several of them want to get to a
point where a commit will go automated
straight into production not a single
one of them is there yet for a whole
variety of reasons that really all
down to trust and this is a standard
management thanks the five dysfunctions
of a team and notice the trust is at the
date of the period pyramid and you can
actually walk up this pyramid of you
know we're going to Isis also testing
right now yes so option to trust our
test that you can rely on right
fear of conflicts they actually fail but
we don't talk about that instead we'll
maybe comment them out lack of
commitment we don't know whether it's
the test fail or it's our fail we don't
know exactly how to fix it avoidance of
accountability we will just push it to
production right because we are not sure
about our QA process and learning
attention to results okay the customers
are screwed by who cares here we go yeah
you know what we can apply to whatever
just give me a three minute walk line
here it works for everything so yeah and
amazingly we hear that all over again
companies that have great culture
otherwise have issues with trust in
their quality of the code so quality is
the bottleneck automatic testing is not
enough and this is really interesting
now there is this concept of green big
bar which sometimes described as the
difference between continuous delivery
and continuous deployment where
continuous deployment means that the
code that is committed to a source
control from developer machines after
series of automatic test and up in
production there are very small amount
of companies in the world that actually
allow themselves to do that and both of
them don't care about code be broken and
you can think about huge blue social
network that is broken most of the times
in different places just because they
couldn't care less right they do
continuous deployment but others do
continuous delivery which means they
have big green box
somewhere in the process that someone
should push in order to get the code in
production and that's because they don't
trust their tests for very good reasons
robots are awesome but they don't screw
up enough anyways as humans do exactly
now the companies that do do it and they
are mostly the largest companies in the
world to do this and they use a very
simple process and that is they do in
fact to use their customers as tests
with a canary release cycle and these
companies you know Google Netflix they
do this now part of the reason they do
this is if you are Netflix or Google you
can't actually build a staging
environment that successfully mimics
production you know Google measures
compute resources in data centers the
way most companies measure racks they
measure users you know the way most
companies measure you know operations
executed and so they just broke
something out I have a friend who works
for Google Ads and he wears G shirt
I don't always test my code when I do
tests it's in production and in terms of
me actually is the users yeah its users
they roll it out to 0.1% of production
and see what happens and then you know
slowly roll it out to more and more and
then eventually they get to a stage
where they commit it out to the entire
thing or I was talking to Hoshi Corp
they had the most interesting automated
canary test I ever heard they rolled it
out to 20% of production and then they
had a Twitter Twitter sentiment analysis
spot and if nobody tweeted at them to
complain after two hours they rolled it
out to the rest of to the rest of
product so this is actually a very
viable approach it is actually a best
practices approach in the industry not
everybody can do canary testing and even
the people that can you know if you're
going to roll out to you
or production customers you have to have
really good measures of what you do if
you screwed up and you know a lot of the
companies we interviewed that's really
what they're working on to get to the
point you know some of them those fast
companies they are planning to go to
this model but they're still working on
what do I do when the canary goes wrong
to make sure that the impact of my
customers is minimum and the risk to my
reputation is as small as possible right
and then there is this problem the
program of reputation exists to some
companies more than the others right so
for example Google can hold themselves
do color releases not only because they
cannot test their call otherwise but
because most of us will forgive
something if something goes wrong for
for Google and when the same people go
and start up a small startup company and
apply the same practices that might very
well be the end of their startup at some
point and it's also because in some
cases you don't know you know one of the
things that Google and Netflix rely on
is that you know they they respond fast
enough to these Canaries that okay you
loaded a page and none of the ads loaded
you don't know why right maybe your ads
Locker finally work today
maybe um you know that network
connection had a glitch it could be any
number of things and when you refresh
the page everything is there you know
same with epics you don't know whether
it was something with your cable
provider or them as long as it doesn't
last very long
yep so back to this wonderful dyno where
a beautiful one and then more and the
more ugly version of we will get to
yours and so you remember that we take
this Venn diagram and all different
forms and shapes during the keynote as
well so here's another one DevOps is
solving the problem so with automation
craft and education right and here we
will blend them again but make it a
little bit chunky up you do explain
because it's way over my head so the
idea here is you know as they talked
about in the keynote the role
or the expertise I should say rather
doesn't go away
you're going to have nobody can be
expert in everything so you're going to
have people that are expert Java
programmers you're going to have people
that are expert people at system
administration and understanding how to
tune a system up you're going to have
people that you know know how to really
beat up a system for a performance test
and they're going to have their
different specialties and you don't want
to make that go away you don't want to
build some puree where every developer
is the same and you know every person in
DevOps you know is the same and they're
you know interchangeable that's not
going to work
so you want China as they say a chunky
soup right you want to be able to see
the different pieces but you want to
have them all blended together and
that's going to be a very successful
DevOps process and in this case the same
thing is going to be your education in
your tests and your yeah your trust and
your automation all blended together so
you can see what happened how did you
get here but they're all working
together to reinforce each other so with
that we have my five minutes to four
questions before that just to remind you
that I'm J bar over Twitter Marky's ma
gallon on Twitter Oracle cloud business
tag and that will be appropriate time to
put it to good use and tweet how awesome
this session work and show notes a for
you the video will be there by tomorrow
the slides are already there all the
links that we spoke about are there and
the feedback form to tell us how also we
were in and the raffle if you come early
a to this raffle and fill out the short
form you can double or triple your
chances to win something nice um
questions sure yeah he talked about
short release cycles versus long release
cycles did you see any correlation
companies that provide a safe hold
service support
sort of support you can call and you can
email in the traditional type of support
and they tend to have longer really
cycles cuz I'm thinking for our support
people it'll be a bit of a nightmare to
release off for every two hours they
wouldn't understand what they did wasn't
supposed to do so no it is a great
question and it's actually something we
specifically asked our own VP of Rd
whether this was a concern when she was
deciding a release cycle and she said no
um I mean there is that whole on-prem
versus ask so support first a service is
different from support for non prim by
the way J frog offers traditional phone
email support just like you described
for both and sure when you've got the
product updating on a regular basis you
know every day or whatever which we do
for one of our products support does
need to stay on its toes but usually
actually support prefers that because
what it usually tends to mean is that
you only get one support ticket on each
bug is that it gets fixed exactly and so
from that perspective it's that it comes
more to the question of when is a
customer going to take an update and
from there the support teams start to
care a lot because what really kills the
support team and what sometimes even
kills our support team is how many
different versions you have to support
so the nice thing about a fast service
is that sure I'm updating every two
hours
but there's only ever one version in
product so be released for years right
yes exactly and the real the real
differentiator here is sattva versus
on-prem when on-prem actually dictated
that the pace of on-prem release
actually dictated by product and
marketing more than anything else
because they are the two groups that
besides when the customer is ready to
get the new version and that goes back
to a word Marja said if it actually if
you're update with
Septimus ratio is very high it's easier
in the support because there are less
versions of support from the other
perspective the longer you have between
the releases the harder it is for the
support to support the upgrade process
itself because the versions become
different in the migrations between them
become harder yes right exactly
so I know is the short answer
and I do suspect the Canary releases in
those environments would be a challenge
which isn't to say that they don't
actually do it I happen to know that I
don't speak about well it's not that um
so for example if you talk about some of
the large trading trading floors that
they do in fact a lot of large
electronic trading tours do in fact
update their software fairly regularly
these days and they do use a canary
process to do it but it is one where you
know I mean first of all the test
process before they get to the canary
stage is quite lengthy they view the
canary stage less as you know kind of
the pure canary you know if you're
talking Google Ads
you know at some level saying they don't
care would be a bit extreme but you know
if they break as I said their customers
don't even know that they were the
reason why it was broken and so they're
willing to take a lot of risks if you're
talking about a regulated industry sure
they're going to roll something out
slowly
in some cases so that they can you know
watch and make sure so they don't have a
complete catastrophe on their hand but
they are paying you know dead attention
and it's an all-hands-on-deck evolution
while they do it through the course of
the day or through you know through the
course of a week usually you know ok on
the first day we're going to see how it
goes for a day of trading and if
anything goes wrong
the entire team is here right away to
address it it's much more of a better
release than actually color across yeah
I think that's a fair fair way to say it
yeah because first it's tested like a
review and and second date is like it's
a perception is those are the people
that we tried to work with the better
worries that we do in them will give
them feedback and go from there
cannery it's a little bit different just
you know here are the wrong people that
this time will suffer from our under
tested for airsoft a little bit yeah we
did mention the tops
yep that's ops was there ever any
resistance or if you'll be so in your
night of that learning so the
traditional approach is like traditional
big organization this guy's entire
mission of life is to maintain stability
they should get paid when everything
works right and the product teams
typically motivated by profit velocity
right to respond to customer needs a
natural your visual things like time and
process etcetera etc so the only way I
have seen to change that
I guess approach is to change the
incentives for their key organization
right stability is no longer the
incentive right in the actual accept and
if it goes back to accepting the right
risks for the right reasons and it goes
back to what Mark and Mark talked about
here it's all about trust
what happened I've had some of the
largest SAS products in the world back
into Maryland Oracle days what I've seen
in collaborating was a traditional IT
organizations is the absence of trust
between the he came of their product
rodney was a big ol obstacle to that
velocity so if you're able to create
that trust that's a very simple with you
you can do that or they number one
demonstrating today people if you
understand them and understand their
needs so on my team today i have folks
that are traditional operations
background we understand what those guys
need so we don't have to release a piece
of software and then think about how
we're going to want it or it yep it
comes with monitoring folks again so
demonstrating to that organization if
you understand their life and small
slowly evolving that their charter and
their their what want to make them needs
that i've seen successful and moving
that you I didn't give a shorter answer
yup one other thing that emerges and
organization okay we we got the
genealogy free bottle okay we're we can
only leave by one why'd you just get all
part of and I'm going to try to write
there are a lot of organizations
adopting a bimodal IP approach where
there's as part of the business where
the risk is cannot be tolerated the
plenty of parts of the business and
banks large corporations where a lot of
risk category is so they started to
split their organizations in nineteen
run a development rightful ports that
have to move slow because the risk is
high and parts that can move much faster
than to take high risks and that's
another approach that we can walk so one
of the things I will add to that is you
know when it comes to bringing an ops
team on board or traditional IT you need
team on board I will say that pretty
much
every traditional IT or ops guy I've
spoken to if I can actually make him
believe that he can hold a developer
accountable for breaking his
infrastructure he will buy on real fast
and that's really what it comes down to
and that is one of the key things in
DevOps is that the developer is
genuinely accountable you build it your
honor
exactly and going back to to our
shameless plug of our show notes here in
the links section and insurance you'll
find a link to an amazing book which
called the Phoenix project put forward
the Phoenix project not enough you all
should it's one of the best books about
Devils at all and you actually talk from
the perspective of an ops guys so that's
that's very very powerful in this regard
and how they're a mind shift from a
traditional IT to to develop and another
very nice educational resource is a
series of conferences that's called the
DevOps days heard about demo plays Wow
okay guys so here is something amazing
for you every year there there are I
think like 50 and small community events
going through all the world and most of
them of course are here in in North
America and they call the devil's days
decided elf days org if they are very
affordable and and those events about
150 200 people each is a conference
about the hub's
mainly from the ops perspective they are
awesome I really recommend you to go
send your teammates it's great
yep-yep encourages most people think
they are dead and they are off they've
been doing that for years and neither
require no absolutely yes and not that
they need to change
that's not no no before you if you say
DevOps they're gonna make that yeah I
think I think I serve a 10 people 100
people 85 people to think that not this
so they will think that DevOps is like
an old-school bull let you say you can
do development and you do operations or
get off which is yeah I see is that off
oh yeah yeah yeah it's a certain extent
yes sir extent that's where it started
my buttocks it's so that the rice and
share is this thing is like you know
DevOps is a job new fancy name for IT
right I guess that's that's what you
want to be thing right and and that for
some organizations of course it's true
DevOps is a very hot topic those days
everyone wants to do DevOps and the
easier way to do it is just rename the
IT departments to DevOps and but that's
of course you know that that's really
goes we are talking about a completely
different culture completely different
process completely different set of
skills that can be of course learns both
by developers and by the IT guys but but
definitely just renaming all traditional
IT to DevOps one do the trick okay guys
we're out of time thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
