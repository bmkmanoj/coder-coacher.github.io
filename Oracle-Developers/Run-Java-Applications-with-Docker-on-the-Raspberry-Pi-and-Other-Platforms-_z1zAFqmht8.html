late moment in the conference it's still
nice to see so many of you show up I'm
going to tell today about using the
Raspberry Pi together with docker and of
course java although I won't show you
much java code because that you already
know i mainly focus on the other part my
name is joy nyanza i work for a company
called in for sport and not related to
dr at all despite the t-shirt i just
happened to come across a couple of
months ago i really liked it and then I
started to look around if we could use
it and wherefore we could use it and one
of the things I liked was using it on
the Raspberry Pi when I start looking at
it I thought ah let's google it and see
if somebody else has done it and at the
time it was so manual with about 150
steps or something like that to get dr.
running on a Raspberry Pi and I was like
why it can be dead hard so you're lucky
I'm not going to show you 150 steps it's
only about three slides and then doctor
is running on a raspberry pi so it's
it's quite easy so what are we going to
tell or what I'm going to tell about is
the Internet of Things why this is an
opportunity for you as well as Java
developers are we can run da current job
on a Raspberry Pi and now we can use
Jenkins to update it and manage our
Raspberry Pi because I've got only one
over here but the Internet of Things of
course you have a lot of raspberries and
you probably don't want to manage them
all by hand and update them by hand
install new versions of your software by
and you just want to automate that and
there Jenkins can be a great help and if
you have any questions just ask come in
between no need to wait until the end
the session so the Internet of Things
it's more or less everything nowadays
and it's a really good potential market
it's huge still growing it's interesting
it's new it's cool new technologies so
it's really cool for developers as well
to work on some
thing I knew instead of office
applications that are a bit boring and
it's perfectly suitable for Java so we
can easily use our knowledge that we
already have about Java on the internet
of things without having to learn a lot
of new stuff some examples where we
could use this forest for instance water
stations drones wave gliders wearables
robots and the Raspberry Pi thank you
also the easy examples are ready before
on the session or at the exhibitors also
I think you guys already know what it
the Internet of Things can can be useful
but outside of the Internet of Things in
the last couple of years we had some
developments for instance here contains
delivery of virtual machines isolation
infrastructure as code those kind of
things they're really popular at the
moment but can be a bit more challenging
to do that on a bit of lower hardware
because the Raspberry Pi it it doesn't
have a lot of computing power the
network connectivity may be quite slow
or maybe not always online a memory and
our desk space were also limited
compared to the clouds that we are used
to nowadays but still we can manage it
even with those lower resources it's
still possible to achieve the things
that I said before like containers
delivery process isolation
infrastructure as code on these hardware
but what do you exactly want to achieve
with continuous delivery what I saw on a
lot of companies when they started
continuous delivery they started to
deliver applications continuously so
they had a standard hardware stack or
cloud and they would deploy the
application over and over again but
everything underneath the application
installed it manually or maybe
automatically with just once my belief
is that you just you should should just
have sort of a barebone machine or just
the OS and you should deliver everything
on top of it so application servers
applications everything
because that way you can easily migrate
as well if you have another cloud vendor
or another raspberry form you can just
migrate with the click of a button
instead of installing the stuff
underneath the application by hand or by
some other manual process and air comes
darker which can be of great help to
achieve that a bit of a background these
are sheets commonly used when explaining
docker a couple of years ago there was
the transportation issue where we had
lots of different stuff that we wanted
to transport for instance oil barrels
but also by an pianos and stuff like
that I don't want to just throw them on
top of each other because then
unfortunately the piano probably will
break or luckily depends on how you look
at it so they invented containers so you
could just put all the oil barrels in
one container the piano and another
container and just stack them on top of
each other you could use them on all
kinds of transportation mechanisms such
as trains cars everything so that's
really useful for the software industry
we have more or less the same problem we
have all kinds of different stuff we
have databases we have front-end
applications back-end application
services everything and we want to
deploy it almost everywhere maybe one
day you want to deploy it on your
desktop and the next day you want to
deploy the same thing on a production
environment because that's also a
challenge that mostly what you have when
your development machine is different
from the stuff you have on production
well it would be better if it's the same
or at least mostly the same because then
you can reproduce issues a lot easier so
there we can use containers for so we
can use containers put a website in one
container database in another container
and just use them we can deploy the same
container on our desktop and in a
production environment or in raspberry
pi and keep one thing in mind containers
you cannot transport them over different
architectures so if you create a
meaner for a RM processor you cannot run
the same container in the cloud because
they're the architecture is different
but if you have something on your laptop
you can use that same container I run it
in the cloud but that's one thing to
keep in mind it's not completely
transportable or I already mentioned
much these things I think it's
compatible with almost anything that
runs on linux because it uses linux
kernel features which you can also run
it on top of windows or OSX a couple of
reasons why this is really good to use I
also saw one interesting thing about
security people that don't trust
applications like Dropbox they just run
them in a container so the dropbox
client cannot get out of that container
and access maybe private stuff you have
running on your laptop so that's another
use case for it and it's easy to
provision environments cause you just
you describe what you want for
environment that you can quickly start
it up as we will see later it can be
used as an alternative for virtual
machines or you can use it on top of
virtual machines depending on your needs
and on what you want if you want to run
a lot of torture containers on one
machine you have to take into account
that you have to limit resources because
else the containers will get in each
other's way so that's something you have
to keep in mind may if you do it on
separate virtual machines then you don't
have those issues now what's the
advantage from darker compared to
virtual machines especially in Internet
of Things where resources are limited
it's almost impossible to use Virtual
Machine so that's already a big
advantage so it's much more efficient
and it's a lot easier to version it
virtual machines are mostly big
gigabytes and if you have docker images
you can store them they're quite small
and then you can version the complete
environment instead of only version your
java application and nexus or some other
artifact repository in that way you have
to complete infrastructure
that you can reproduce if you have
issues you can just download it again I
wyd darker for instance instead of tools
like chef for puppet I mean those tools
are quite nice once you know how to work
with them but you first have to learn
them for only setting up an environment
once so the investment there is quite a
lot you have to learn a specific domain
specific language it's not something I
really like if I'm short on time with
darker the commands are much easier it's
more based on the standard Linux
operating system commands so if you can
use Linux then you can also use docker
more or less we will see that later um
how active is it it's it's really new
mean they started the last year and
became quickly really popular just
recently they got a new investment round
and collected 40 million dollars they
have the backing from almost all big
companies even Microsoft supporting it
and as you see I've had some old numbers
and some new numbers that's there's
month two months in between so within
one or two months the numbers go up
really hard so it's really popular at
the moment and the expectation is that
it will only grow further it's already
also used by bigger companies like
Spotify and companies like that to
maintain their infrastructure so lost
June was a big day for dr. Deo before
that they all set don't use docker on a
production environment because it's not
completely stable were already some
people running it on production
environment with shouldn't really do it
at the moment but 1.0 came out and then
it was official you could use it on
production should be stable should be
backwards compatible because the
versions before that I had some issues
when i upgraded a version that my
container suddenly stopped working so it
wasn't really stable at that moment but
now it's really running good even if
your update the darker version it's
still everything is running
and now it's the ecosystem I mean if you
just have nice to by itself it's okay
but it's even better if you have the
other tools that you like to support it
then you can easily use it and that's
already the case there are lots of
standard docker images available
supported there are Java docker
containers available big vendors like
Google they're building tools for docker
Microsoft is building tools for darker
so it's really a big community you're
ready how hard is it to start with dr.
it's really easy and you won't do it's
the standard package so the only thing
you have to do is install package keep
in mind that was already a darker
package with in ubuntu so they named it
dr dot io so all the commands you have
to use dot io or make some alias or
something like that and then you can
easily run it which you can see here as
i want to run it interactively with the
terminal i want to use a base image in
this case went to saucy and i want to
run the best shell what this does is it
starts a container and you're in the
best shell of that container and then
you have your first simple docker
container and the same you can do in a
raspberry pi but then you have to use
some base image which is compatible to
the a.m architecture such as resume so
right raspbian that's a difficult word
so what's the technology behind docker
it's really not new i mean the stuff
doctor is using is quite all already
companies like Google they're using
these technologies already for years
it's just the linux kernel and things
like see groups and docker just made a
small extra part on top of it so that
it's easy to maintain and use so it's
quite proven technology you're ready and
that's why it's now quickly being picked
up by the big companies and even now
Google is still improving the linux
kernel to make these things even better
I've included a couple of steps you see
be online later as well to show you what
steps are necessary to deploy it on a
raspberry which is a really easy I use
our clinics for it so i installed our
clinics on SD card you put the SD card
and a raspberry and you're up and
running then you can update the
repository so maybe update all the
packages if you want to and just install
docker you can start doctor and bestest
to out to start it on boots so if you
reboot your Raspberry you don't have to
execute the command at the top again and
then you're done you can stop us or add
a question back I don't know if go ahead
it does score us run on a run processor
then you can run it on a raspberry but I
don't know one thing that's at least if
you're playing with it it might be handy
to use a static IP address else you have
to continuously change your IP address
if it's getting a new one so this is a
bit of configuration to get a static IP
address and to enable it for some
strange reason I had some problems with
our clinics if i use disable static
didn't work still state static my dhcp
wasn't picked up again so i had to move
the configuration to get back to my DCP
configuration for some strange reason
and then if we have dr. running of
course that's nice and you know you saw
the example at the beginning we can
start docker have a bash shell but then
you have to do everything manually you
can type in commands install stuff there
but then you have to do it over and over
again or use that container so a better
way is to use a docker file which is
just a plain text file called dockerfile
really easy and in that file you can
configure how you want your container to
look like so this is a lot of stuff I
think on the next sheet it's a bit
bigger for you to read such really quite
simple commands
just specifies which base image we want
to use so in this case the raspbian
image we have a run command which we can
use to execute all kinds of commands in
Linux so it's just are not commands up
get install and stuff like that we can
set environment variables and we do here
as we expose a port so we say to the
container okay open up this port to your
host and lost the most important part
the command so this command is run in
your container and it starts up Tom cut
and then you're up and running the nice
thing about docker containers is that
you can stack them on top of each other
it's a bit like inheritance you can make
a base image so this is more or less of
base image it includes java Tom code but
it doesn't include my application so I
just create a container without my
application so it's still useless but I
build a container on top of that I say
they're from Tom cotton we will later
see how that relates to the previous
docker file but this is an extra docker
file and here I say add my war file
which is located next to my daugher file
and add that and the tomcat web apps
directory so don't get automatically
pick that up and start your application
and how does that look like you're the
structure in the directory is quite
simple you can make a build script or
you can just do it by the command line
with two directories because the
dockerfile really has to have the name
docker file so there for I use two
directories so this is the base image
and this is the image or container which
contains my application so that's really
easy we can then build first our base
tomcod image we gave it the name Tom
code so that's used later with the from
here that relates to each other and
after that's done we can build tomcod
extra which is based on the container we
built at the top so it's really easy to
do
and now we have an open running
container with our application you
already see here i added optional if I
make a new version of my application so
a new war file I don't have to execute
the steps at the top again because the
container is already on my machine I
only have to execute the commands at the
bottom to make sure that my new war file
is being included in a new container
which is still based on a container I've
built at the top so we can reuse those
containers that's really comfortable so
you can make a base with Java and eight
and stuff like that if you want to
update you only have to update them it
in one container and all the containers
that extend from that container are
getting the new Java version
automatically that's a lot different
from from virtual machines where you
have to include everything in every
virtual machine then we start the
container it's really easy we run it we
say which port mapping the rest so we
have port 8080 inside the container and
we move map it to port 8080 inside the
host say I have a lot of containers may
be our new tomcat instances I can use
the same docker file and when i start
the container i can just change these
numbers so make it 80 81 and then the
mapping from inside the container to
outside the container is made by dr. so
that's really nice feature Mindy that
means it's running the background so
it's just running on it and the name of
the the container so what can we do with
these kinds of stuff I mean a couple of
years this was an April Fool's prank
that we have the architects coffeepot
control protocol I mean it's then it was
a nice joke but how long will it take us
to get there and really have a raspberry
insider teapot but then we have to make
sure in the teapot doctor is running and
we use Java on it because that's a great
opportunity we can get lots of Java
applications running around the world in
tea pots or other stuff and as I already
said you don't have to learn so
domain-specific language which you have
to learn or use a couple of darker
specific commands but they're all really
easy if you want to stop and restart a
container it's just docker restart
container if you want to see the locks
that are in the container so the tomcod
locks the stash system out system error
of Tom card you can see that without
logging into the container you can just
type the command in the host and it will
show you the system out of the system
error from the container you can see the
running processes in a container you can
even see what files that are changed
inside the container so if somebody adds
files to that container you can see our
dead files being added and sometimes
especially if you're toying around with
it you get lots of containers lots of
images and it can become quite messy so
then it's a good idea to remove them
once in a while but keep in mind if you
remove them you have to build everything
new again and it will download
everything that you need from the
internet again if it's already there it
just uses caching mechanisms that are
quite efficient to reduce all the
downloading of stuff and improve the
build process so show you small demo
is it big enough to see ya it back
alright so this is my raspberry no
darker image is running at the moment so
I want to start a darker image for
instance the Tomcat image mmm I have to
use the correct one
annoying
so here we see that the image is being
built only the tomcat extra I can show
you the commands that are used exactly
so what I do is I just built the tomcod
extra I'm not interested in building
everything again because then I would
need an internet connection from our
raspberry because it doesn't update of
the operating system so I only add the
new top layer the tomcat extra layer and
here you can also see it it's just using
cash because it can already see oh you
use a darker by example that's already
included in a container so i don't have
to build again i just use caching so
it's really a fashion really fast so if
we now do docker PS we can see which
containers are running you concede it it
is running the port mapping is shown
here when it is created so everything
that's necessary you can see with this
but we also want to see how far it is so
so I can just use container and then see
the log files that is written inside my
tomcat container i can easily see it
with this when you're starting with
darker a lot of people the install ssh
server inside the docker container to
access it you can do it but it's not
really nice because if you use that on
production or something you're exposing
access to your container and you really
shouldn't do it this will take quite a
while because raspberries not really
quick so starting tom cat on it that
takes about two minutes so i'll come
back to this in a moment
so how does this work you create a
docker file which is shown over here and
the ideas you build an image of it and
then you push that image is it's more
like a git repository where you push
your images and those images can then be
used on all places that you want so if
you have 100 raspberries you can
download the image on every raspberry
and that image is stored in the docker
container image registry so that's
really easy you have a standard docker
image registry there are images with
tomcat and all different kinds of things
it's a public repository you can use
that as a basis for your own containers
but probably when you're in a private
company you have your own docker
containers that include your own
applications you don't want to include
them in the public registry so we show
you in a minute how you can create your
own registry to do this independent and
without the need of the public registry
because we want one ring to rule them
all or one image to rule them all and
why is that if you create images on
every raspberry and say you started the
first one you create an image you do an
ab get update or AB get install you get
the packages of that moment if you do on
the rest the lost raspberry you do the
same stuff a day later maybe you get new
versions of the different packages you
have you don't want that then the
different machines you're running have a
different configuration so really use
those images oh I have a look at my
Asbury is already up and running a beer
so
or you already see some logging I forgot
to put the screen as well over here so
just a simple application that that
caused my raspberry just to demo that
the java application is actually
actually running it can also see that
it's locked here that it's running so
it's quite easy to get started if you
have a war file that's running on tomcat
you can easily also run that on a
raspberry and get this one out of the
way so starting a registry it's it's
really simple it's it's just another
docker container so there is a standard
container for it for registry if you
don't have specific needs for security
or other stuff you can just use the
standard registry and start running it
and how does it work how can we use that
registry and what advantages does it
have for instance we change a container
we add a file in it or add an
application server or whatever we can
then commit it it really looks like
using it we can give it a name this is
by the way the server where the registry
is running so you have to supply that so
the doctor knows where he has to push
the doctor and container or later we get
a new idea this will come back in the
next slides and we can push it really
just like get on the other machine so
this is one virtual machine for instance
and this is another virtual machine or
another raspberry just what you want we
can answer I pull it from the registry
and I want this version then we can
start it and we can already see here
it's the same number as what is shown
here so you have the same container
structure on the first machine and on
the second machine by using the registry
and this is really helpful because this
allows you
to download diffs everything you push
through the registry as a diff you don't
push complete images like virtual
machines you move complete virtual
machines around with docker you only
move changes around so the chains are
really small and that's really helpful
and if you pull you only pull the
changes on bandwidth is not so much
necessary and also hard disk space is
much less necessary than for virtual
machines and here we can see how it
works this is the second clients or not
the client where I did the changes to
the container but the client where I put
the changes from the registry in the
beginning I only have this image I do a
pool of this version I can see this is
the new one and if I do a new mg street
I can see these are the changes and you
can see here it changed a really minimal
it's only a megabyte or less so that's
really helpful on low resource devices
and Internet of Things another way to
move around your containers is to export
them that's also a possibility but
that's not really nice I won't go into
the details which you have to do a lot
more work to get it working so i would
really advise to use the registry
instead of exporting everything why
should you use the registry and not
build it over and over again I already
said it if you build it over and over
again you don't really know what's
inside it because it changes over time
and it requires extra resources you have
to download everything over and over
again but the disadvantages you don't
have to lay the security patches I mean
if you make an image you put it in the
registry and you use it six months
afterwards it doesn't have to lay the
security patches so that's something to
keep in mind maybe then you should
create a new image with the latest
security patches included how does it
look like I mean with virtual machines
have a hypervisor
all the commands have to be translated
so it's a bit slow it requires extra
memory computing power it's quite some
overhead in it with docker it just runs
straight on the Linux kernel so you have
almost bare metal metal performance if
you really want to see the numbers on
the dr cohn in America there was a
presentation by IBM where they did a
complete comparison comparing bare metal
with kvm and docker and with docker you
almost got the bare metal performance so
that's really nice you can reduce the
cost of your infrastructure because you
need less resources for it so it's
really helpful we used it not only for a
Raspberry Pi but also for a project to
make a build environment and a d-type
environment so we needed a lot of
containers and we inherited them so what
like the Tomcat and the Tomcat extra
they were stacked on top of each other
here we use a general base which
included Java and then we included the
or put Jenkins owner and all other stuff
that needs Yahveh on top of that and we
also had an application server and on
top of that we again had a lot of
containers you see one different thing
over here that's a Jenkins data
container you might wonder why do we
need two containers for Jenkins and
that's why it's isolation data shouldn't
be in your application it should be in a
separate container so that if your
application container is broken or you
want to update it or whatever you can
just throw away that container build a
new one with a new version of your
software and use the data in the data
container that's separated from your
application or whatever you're running
in your other docker container and
that's quite easy to achieve what we
only did it for the Jenkins data data
container with Jenkins because it's a
bit more work and we were too lazy to do
it for everything but if you do it in
production it would be good to do this
for instance also on application servers
make an extra data
diner for your log files so if you
update your or remove your container
with your application server and start a
new one you still have the log files in
your data container because data
container should be used for persistent
stuff and normal containers should be
able to be thrown away and just start a
new one we never really updated
containers we just throw them away and
start new ones and what this shows is
for instance out disk space and other
resources and benefits of docker can be
used I mean if you do this with virtual
machines build a complete build
environment and the d-type environment
you probably are talking about gigabytes
of disk space probably even a lot more
now we're talking about less than 1
gigabyte for all of this I have to admit
it's not fully configured to be later
added to plugins to Jenkins so it became
a bit more but this gives a good
indication that's it's really a fashion
on disk space because as we can see it's
all inherited this is inherited and all
the other ones this is inherited in
these ones so it's really good and it's
really fast I did it on my laptop only
created the docker file so everything
has to be downloaded so I had to
download the java images a Jenkins sonar
get nexus everything on a not a really
fast connection I think 830 megabit
connection and downloading all of that
building all the containers and really
starting the container so that it was up
and running took me four minutes and 11
seconds I don't think you can achieve
that with virtual machines it's nearly
impossible and if you have faster
internet connection you can even do it
faster than this is this so this really
shows some of the advantages that doctor
has above virtual machines why would I
use it with Jenkins I mean who uses
Jenkins
that was the main reason everybody knows
it you didn't have to learn in you too
it's just what you already have it's
really easy to use and even if you have
never used it it's still really easy to
start working with it am and a lot of
support lots of plugins really helpful
so to show you what I did is just I've
got a simple application I think you can
see it here and now I can see it myself
but there is something from the
Netherlands here and we can change that
to San Francisco so that's now changed I
don't have get in this project it's just
really simple one and I can go to
Jenkins where I have a quite a simple
job which I will first start because it
will take a minute
is this still readable from the back
sort off I make it a bit bigger better
so just a simple job think most of you
will already know how much of it works I
just built a new war file copy some
stuff over there and then I can just
select which server i won't in this case
the raspberry I can copy the files over
to my raspberry and down below I can
start some commands on the raspberry so
this plugin to publish a over ssh plugin
it's really helpful you can just
configure centrally which service you
have for which raspberries you have and
then in your job so you can just use
those servers and you can quickly change
them because if you have like a cloud on
azure you have configured all those IP
addresses and you use them in 100 jobs
and jenkins it's a lot of work to change
100 jobs but those are Pee addresses
they were configured in one space and
the configuration so you only have to
change them in one place that's really
working very well so that's about it for
the entire job now we can have a look if
if it's already up and running up about
a minute so we are about a minute away
from getting this to work we can already
see it deploying the new war file so
what I've done now is I created the new
tomcat extra container and started that
one and it's really a matter of
milliseconds their container starts but
on a raspberry it's a bit slower and
starting tom cat it's also taking a
minute or almost two minutes so it's
it's not dr. that slow here it's mainly
Tomcat docker images they started up
with an melissa
that's really quick so I think we're
almost there
Oh
now come back to it in a minute it's
taking a bit longer than expected I saw
some some tips when you were starting to
use docker means quite easy but were
some things that we came across that in
the beginning we didn't really do well
for instance when we started building it
we build the images from scratch every
time later we started using a registry
that is really helpful to really use
that and what could be an advantage for
Internet of Things and raspberries that
are deployed somewhere on the ocean or
wherever I still install the first
docker image on it before you ship them
so that you only have to do the small
updates remotely that saves a lot of
bandwidth I use the private doctor
registry it's really easy to set up and
make sure that you keep your environment
settings separate maybe you have
environment settings for instance a
d-type environment you probably have a
connection to a database which is
different for every environment take
into account it you have to put that
somewhere and you can put the settings
in the same container so you have one
container with all the configuration in
it for the entire environment probably
you want to separate it and make a base
container and put the environment
specific containers on top of it so
again I just inherited I really want to
say that just start playing with it it's
really easy you can use boot to dokur a
few on linux linux a Windows user or mac
OS x user or you can just run it
directly on linux let's see for a minute
we're done now
so now we should get some other output
first request that takes a bit longer
than that rest
I hope this is not the demo effect that
it's broken let's first see if the
container is still running because if
it's the container isn't started
properly it just shuts down so you can
easily see if it's still up and running
and it's still up and running for four
minutes so probably we're just a bit too
impatient and raspberries just too slow
and that's correct because we cannot see
from San Francisco just simple example
mean thank you so the summary adds a big
potential not only for docker but also
for java if we can get java running on
all those Internet of Things devices on
top of darker and darker is really
taking off Internet of Things is taking
off it's a really huge market for us and
it's really easy to use and really
flexible we did it with an application
server for instance Tomcat and then a
colleague decided ah I want to use jboss
and he changed it and I think half an
hour to an hour while he never had
worked with docker before so it's really
easy to use and keep in mind it's all
about isolation in the beginning if you
have shared resources will be okay after
a while they will start fighting for any
resources you have to isolate them on
time because else they will end up here
so are there any questions okay so the
question is the question is if it will
work on Android probably not because
this uses colonel features specific and
Linux OC groups so then you should run
linux on an Android device I don't know
if that's possible and that way maybe
but I assume that these kinds of things
will be integrating and other OSS within
the coming years I mean Mike's office
it is supporting docker but it's not
running in windows because you need the
Linux kernel features but probably they
will make something like that themselves
because if they don't do it you already
see that there is a big shift going to
linux now because doctor is running
better on Linux so Microsoft will really
feel that if they don't support it
themselves yeah okay yeah so so the
question is if it runs all so well on
clouds you're correct i used it on
amazon ec2 cloud i got it up and running
and i think 10 minutes i never used an
ec2 cloud i had to make an account and
everything and i was done in about 10
minutes running perfectly we did a
project which is running on production
as we speak on docker and Azure cloud
and it's running perfectly i was a bit
assistant about it it's from microsoft
but the azure cloud you can just deploy
a boon to images to it and then it's
it's perfect for for these kinds of
things it really works well so the
question is if there is a bamboo plugin
I don't know that I know that there are
plugins for instance for Jenkins so that
you can run Jenkins slaves in a docker
container does I know probably if it's
not there yet it will come there in a
couple months at the back okay
so the question is a few inherit
containers and you change the base
container the one at the top how does
that affect the containers depending on
that container you don't get those
changes automatically you have to build
the containers that are using it so
until you build it it's just it keeps on
running it isn't using those things
automatically so that's I think really
comfortable because else you would
potentially break the containers
depending on it but you can build them
quite easily it's quickly done so you're
wondering about if it's really necessary
to update security or update the
container for security risks yeah you're
correct if you the container is just
exposing port 8080 or something like
that you don't expose SSH it's not such
a big risk depends a bit on the company
you're working for and how strict they
are and else you could just keep that
container up and running but even if you
have to change it and update it it's a
matter of seconds and its upper running
again I mean if you download the new
image and you stop the old container
start a new container there is only
seconds in between it so even if you
haven't got a load balancer your
customers yeah I only have a slight
chance that they notice it
disk quotas not directly I believe
through do curso with dr. normally you
can limit memory CPU cycles but I heard
another talk from Apache message that
they're also having disk space
limitations and you can use that with
docker so there are a lot of tools
evolving now around that and it's really
a whole topic because the resources yeah
you have to limit them and then it's
easy to replace the virtual machine so
that's a bit of the next challenge I
think any more questions yeah okay yeah
wait so what you're saying if you have a
base image you build a new one you get a
new ID for it it will get a new number
but the thing is I now use the numbers a
bit but you can just name your
containers so you just name it a base
image and then in the container
depending on it you just say I want to
use the base image so you don't have to
change those IDs it just here are cuckoo
okay any more okay then thank you all
