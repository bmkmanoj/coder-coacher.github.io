I'm your host Javed Mohammad here at
another dev live session and we have as
our guest Dave Leroy who's the director
of product management they welcome
welcome
so first time in Moscow and it's my
first time in know he's probably haven't
had a chance to look around yet with any
gut feel of I've seen some pretty
amazing things from the taxi is a
beautiful architecture in a beautiful
city it is a lot of history and I think
I hope you get a chance to walk around a
little bit and I try it's Alesi dead
square if nothing else yes so it's a so
David you have a presentation later on
what's it about
so I have a presentation that's going to
talk about the need to increase the
speed of operations within DevOps uh-huh
and the purpose of this presentation is
you know applications have made a modern
shift and we have development pushes for
continuous integration and continuous
development happening very fast and so
it could be coming at you know daily
weekly monthly compared to traditional
applications which may have been revved
you know once a year or every year and a
half so this puts a lot of pressure on
operations or on the op side of the
house and so what we're looking at is
using machine learning within the system
management space to be able to take and
remove the human factor out of that to
be able to increase the speed of how
things are done yeah actually I was
contemplating a little bit about my my
old days of being a developer at I used
with the hardware space and this is the
days of dinosaurs and maintain computers
the product life cycle each computer
came out every four years yeah it was a
huge development effort and now with you
know the likes of any of the companies
Netflix and Facebook and Etsy is like
multiple releases you know during a week
or even during within a day it
so everything that the the lifecycle of
a product and just the the new features
coming out is just being compressed so
much yeah we see you know a lot of our
customers are living in a bimodal
environment now so they have their
traditional applications that are on
Prem that are this traditional model of
once a year and that's okay for human
operators to pull the data together from
lots of different monitoring tools and
be able to correlate the data apply
thresholds and to be able to understand
what's happening in that environment but
the same business may also have a DevOps
organization and be putting out an
application to go get new business get
millennial business on you know on
mobile devices moving very fast and so
you have you have this structure you
have two different structures and so
we're offering a new type of management
tool Oracle management cloud which has
lots of lots of different cloud services
to help you achieve that
okay so Oracle has the Oracle cloud
developers service which kind of helps
to manage some of this process for
DevOps but you're talking about
specifically a focus on system
management so you want to talk a little
bit more about that sure so what we look
at within systems management right we
can we can draw a box around and then by
the when you say systems management that
means monitoring and performance or so
so so right let's define systems
management systems management is looking
at everything in the starting with your
application down the entire stack
understanding what's happening at the
network understanding what's happening
and storage the database the mid-to your
applications and even down to the
bleeding edge of the application and the
end user so understand how all of that
is behaving and being able to pull and
correlate the data between all those
different layers so so the range of
systems management so now we take we
take we look at the systems management
and we take machine learning and apply
to it because when you look at the type
of data in systems management we have
time series data and we also have
unstructured data and typically
unstructured
data has been done by you know
completely different tools right looking
at like log files and so what we've done
is we've put together a unified data
platform that collects data from all
these different sources puts it in one
place and then we can run machine
learning against all of that data so we
have time series data which we can draw
a box around and we know what it looks
like it's bounded and we have
unstructured data and pulling this
together and then using different
machine learning capabilities such as
clustering such as correlations such as
anomaly detection we're able to get to
the core of issues like root cause
analysis when you're looking at an end
user and finding some deep underlying
issue in the stack underneath it wow
that's a huge thing there's a lot of
that's that is big data both structured
unstructured and to be able to take take
it synthesize it so what's the name of
the article the services are offered
this it's a it's a family of products
the the product name is Oracle
management cloud other core management
clothes Oracle management cloud in there
has a series of cloud services so we
have we have seven cloud services so of
course now I'm on tape we'll do
application performance monitoring which
looks at the end user and follows that
transactional data all the way in
through the stack okay we have
infrastructure monitoring which looks at
all the traditional kind of systems
monitoring availability performance of
all the components of your
infrastructure we have log analytics
which is the piece that looks at logs
every at every layer of the stack
immeuble and pulls those log files in
and correlates those log files with the
application data we have IT analytics
which takes all of this data since we're
unifying the data we take this data and
now we can look at it over a long period
of time we can take a 13-month view of
it to see to find systemic issues to
find problems in that data the normal
operators wouldn't see as well as to do
very accurate capacity planning with the
machine learning
building and then we have a few new
services that are coming out we have
orchestration which allows you to kind
of take action on all of these across
both in the cloud and on-premise okay we
have and then we also have a set of
security services that we're rolling out
which are the security monitoring and
analytics and the configuration and
compliance and if you think about it in
the security space they're struggling a
lot with a lot of the same challenges
that we are in the system management
space which is too much data coming too
fast and so we need to be able to look
at it with machine learning algorithms
to be able to get very useful insight
into that data so really you are looking
at the folks with article management
cloud you know looking at the
application the infrastructure the logs
you really are looking at the whole
stack exactly so that's really good so
any parting thoughts you'd like to share
with any of the views that are out there
or will see this well you know I
encourage people to come to Oracle code
and take a look at these events we love
talking to this audience because again
the challenge from a developer
perspective is you know operations can
be that challenge right speed gating
their ability to get application new
changes out there and so this is this is
the opportunity to speed up the system
management piece to enable them to kind
of open that gate and let the developers
develop and get code out there quickly
so I encourage people to come learn
about it machine learnings capabilities
within the products only getting more
exciting and we're soon you know we get
into predictive analytics and so we're
just starting to get into some of these
really cool capabilities and hopefully
does the people check out check out some
of our cloud services can do it through
the sea trial clout yes so we do have
trials so you can try you can get a
trial talk to your Oracle account
contact and or contact any of us and
we're happy to do a free trial account
too well Dave thank goddess thank you so
much for coming by and Bocchetti with us
and all the rest of the presentation hey
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
