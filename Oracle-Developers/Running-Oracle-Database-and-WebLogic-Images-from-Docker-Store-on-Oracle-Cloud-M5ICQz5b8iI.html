gee I'm going to do more another use
case of database image from the pastor
on on also container cloud service I'm
going to connect WebLogic and database
together under an application both
WebLogic and database images are from
the data store these are some of the
links that are useful for today's youth
kids demo the first one will help you
download database image from the docket
show to work with container child
service the second link will help you
download WebLogic image from the dollar
store to work with containers on some
the third link because the food image
does not come with a HR schema will help
you upload using SQL Developer into the
database the last one is an app itself
that why good demo so that a transaction
is shown if you are Oracle cloud
customer or trying our free trial you
are familiar with this dashboard you may
have fun up already' container cloud
service I'm going to use what I already
have I have two containers running here
I'm going to use the top one use the
container credential here I have already
downloaded database and WebLogic images
these are running here you can see the
main deployments both of them are
running and healthy I'm going to connect
using the WebLogic datasource option so
let me go grab a couple things here one
is the IP address and WebLogic password
go to the containers tab and you can get
the IP address from either of this
hostname you see this is the public IP
address and I would also want to get the
WebLogic class person here so click on
the name
new log10 this is the past let's talk
about the logic I'm going to head to the
WebLogic server before that I mentioned
this image does not have a charge Pima
operative
so the second third link that what you
saw on the PowerPoint lines will lead
you to this one if will help you awkward
I just came up through your SQL
Developer this is my SQL Developer
instance I went to the steps
I skipped actually one last analyte but
you can see I already created a
connection for system with HR and grand
fleet populate indexing and cook you can
see those videos here if you go to
system a username is system and the
password is default one that I used Oh
doc underscore DB month and then I use
the connection type by v DB 8 and then
this is the container IB edges what I
showed you before and then service name
is Oracle PDB one data local dimming
using this one I ran a code to create a
char and here is the HR connection video
the password I gave is a welcome one and
I use the connection type of the Depot
and it's the same service name after
running those both scripts that are
found github you can see those tables
are up
you can go to connection area char table
and then go to any employee you can see
here so this is the tip right so you
have gone through these steps one to
eight - I skipped running the my script
now that you are HL schema is up and
your database and web magic images are
running on the container I'm going to
take you to grab logic server since the
IP address what we saw : seven thousand
one that is the port number / console /
sent in there will lead you to the
screen give your WebLogic ID and
password
that's what is what is copied from there
sure you want to paint an entry under
the services in data source so I'm going
to create the data source so I'm gonna
turn that I'm creating one you need to
do lock and edit foot and then create a
new gendering data source here you can
give any name I'm just going to fetch
all tips again with something and then
I'll remember we already created a just
came with restore so I'm going to say
JDBC / Bashar and then next I'm going to
leave most of them to default
here are the database main is local PD
v1 dot local domain most name is right
here just what we saw port number is
1521 database and reattaching today
chart and then password reuse can be
done from one so once this is here we
can test this configuration is working
out not the actual sex in it that means
we establish a connection from WebLogic
to the database you can go there and see
this is running and
I also uploaded a small war file to
demonstrate that we can see the
transactions modality if you like you
can create your own war file or you
could ask me so once if your demo is up
and running you can see
to go to the same ip address container
IP ages 7001 is to access bed of logic
and then demo is a file that we have
loaded so you can see which will bring
information from the database this
concludes our demo if you have any
questions you can leave them below thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
