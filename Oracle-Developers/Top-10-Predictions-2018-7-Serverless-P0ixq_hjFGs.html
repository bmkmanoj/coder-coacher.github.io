serverless applications are going to
become the norm they're going to go into
production the appeal for server less is
very clear today I have instantiated
even in the cloud my app server my
database server my web server etc and
they're constantly running but now it's
server less based upon me needing a
certain function to be executed my code
is instantiated that very moment in time
the code gets executed and then the cell
at the servers or the infrastructure
upon which it is running goes away so I
only pay for when my code is actually
executing so that has significant
benefits but along with this comes
challenges too because now developers
have to think about how do I manage
these multiple functions how do i chain
together these functions how do i D bug
these distributed transactions and these
are things that they weren't necessarily
thinking of before so then now that we
will have new paradigms come out where
there'll be open source frameworks like
the FN project that enable you to write
functions to be able to do debugging on
those functions to be able to write
compensating transactions when something
goes wrong with one of the functions etc
and that will give you a lot of
portability where you can run these
functions either on your laptop or in
the cloud so serverless is going to be
very exciting set of applications built
this year in 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
