Washington DC I'm Bob Rupert with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
one more this series of injuries some of
the people associated with this event
and my guest for this segment is Shawn
Phillips Shawn till the folks at home
what you do and how you keep busy
they're really glad to be here
so I work for NASA and Air Force space
mission contractor called AI solutions
we provide services across the country
right here in DC at both the
headquarters and at the Goddard Space
Flight Center that's where I'm stationed
doing a lot of my work and we also have
services down at Johnson Kennedy
Vandenberg you name it and what I do is
I am a principal software engineer I'm
especially as data visualization data
analysis but specifically through java
and java based technologies so your
specialty at least one of them is JavaFX
you've written a book on JavaFX
you are presenting a session at an
upcoming oracle code event on job
effects talk about some of the workings
on which of effects and especially how
it relates to your work with NASA all
right
one quick caveat that book introduction
to Java ethics 8 is I was a co-writer
there was a several other gentleman Carl
Diaz actually the main author on that a
great bunch of guys so if you check that
out give up the credit where credit's
due but so what we're doing in terms of
Java effects in terms of advancing the
state of the art while using these
technologies and applying it to these
conference types both here with Oracle
code and also with places like Java 1
and The Associated venues is we're
utilizing these programming platforms
and of course all the other services
that that provides access to to
implement mission services mission
production quality services for NASA ok
so one so for example with the Atlanta
with the Atlanta version
this war in DC now so land is coming up
I'll be giving a presentation of that
software actually and we can we can talk
about that more and more detail like
what this what is this software what
does it do what why Java versus
something else you know if you like to
go there does that answer your question
yeah okay not now we're talking earlier
and you mentioned that you've got a
couple of videos on YouTube can you
describe one or two of those videos sure
so we use we created a specific tool
called the deep space trajectory
Explorer using Java a and Java FX 8 and
we're using that tool to do trajectory
design for deep space missions and
currently we're supporting the Johnson
Space Center down in Texas and we're
supporting the Goddard Space Flight
Center right here in Maryland so down at
Johnson and here's one of the one of the
videos that you can look up on it's on
YouTube now it demonstrates doing dense
data analysis within a what's called
assist lunar environment or regime so
essentially you've got all these
multiple bodies all circling each other
the earth the moon the Sun and that
become when you start planning
trajectories to these locations it
becomes much more complex than just
going around in a circle around around
the earth in like low-earth orbit so
essentially what happens as you go from
having simply six circles to very
chaotic regimes of trajectories and just
extremely dense virtually unmanageable
possibilities so that's what our tool
does is that actually takes all those
possibilities essentially parameterize
the entire effect of it and then
presents that to the user as an actual
interface so when the user says I want
the parameters be in this range in the
star in this range it generates that
data and plots that data not as a as a
graph like you would look with a
scientific graphing tool but actually
that is the interface the tool itself
presents the data as the interface
itself in other words we follow this
philosophical design of letting the data
be the interface and you'll see that in
in our lunar data analysis video where
not only is it generating and plotting
all these points hundreds of thousands
of points
famously but as the user moves through
the space it reacts to the mouse
movements it reacts to filtration tools
dynamically instantaneously showing
hiding colorizing removing points that
do not meet your mission criteria so you
can see the obvious benefit to one of
our potential customers ie a NASA
mission going to the moon and for
example we support missions this is
Donna Johnson where we're planning the
trajectories and doing some preliminary
trajectory design for the planned lunar
excursions that are going to go from the
plan deep-space human habitat to the
lunar surface Wow you know so as as one
of the people are responsible for
getting a multi gazillion dollar vehicle
from point A to point B do you self
medicate a lot well now that you've said
that I'm probably going to have to try I
don't mean to bring up a sore point the
good news is as far in the future well
in terms of software development
anything over six months is not even on
the horizon or I true but these these
these trajectories they're targeting
between 2018 and 2020 one as to being
deployed and what we're doing is we're
actually producing these trajectories as
first guesses that then get fed into a
much more dynamic higher fidelity tools
that require much more specific input
before they can be be effectively
utilized but once they have that that
input our computers very computationally
precise and specific results which
essentially guarantee a high likelihood
of mission success tools what tools like
what we produce that are another tool we
produce called free flyer actually some
some works well trying to do is build an
ecosystem of software and that's one of
the reasons why we chose JavaFX as an
implementation vector
aside from fact that I wanted to learn
JavaFX on that came out it also provided
me with a really really robust rich
platform to do parallelization because
it's a very data-intensive the more
the more ways I can spread my workload
across the available course the better
it has hardware accelerated graphics
built-in and there's an API flexibility
that makes it easy to just tap into
other systems like our free flawed
product but other products too that NASA
or the Air Force produces via DLL that
sort of thing Wow so it in these videos
that that you have available on youtube
does that you know what you're
describing is pretty heady even for for
a developer crowd does this sort of give
us a visual sense of what's happening so
the videos are certainly made to promote
the capability of the tool and the
potential if you had a problem in that
realm of that looks and feels like a
trajectory design problem to a
deep-space target like the moon we also
target places like Enceladus and Europa
moons around Saturn and Jupiter places
where there's huge gravitational bodies
and small gravitational bodies and
they're just tugging to each other and
it's almost impossible to just go in a
nice even little circle because
everything's out of whack and out of
bounds but it's our tool handles that
without a problem
and so we have those those those videos
as well but they tend to bring the scope
up a little bit so if you're a developer
do check out the videos look to see the
techniques that we're using yes it's in
Java effects but the design techniques
can be applied to a multitude of
implementation patterns I think the most
important thing that a developer can
take away from that is that we follow a
design philosophy which I've coined I
call letting the data be the interface
so you utilizing that approach to all
things when the users in interfacing
with the tool creates a very very fluid
highly responsive visceral experience
the user is not using a tool anymore
they're manipulating the data as they
understand it now the catch is this
takes a lot of development effort to
make these tools special and that again
is why we chose JavaFX is because we get
the performance we get the robust api's
it makes that job that much
well so just to remind folks watching
this you're going to present this
information at the Oracle code event in
Atlanta that's correct
currently slated to be the keynote
opening library and that's coming up I
believe on June 22nd this year so again
if you go to developer oracle.com slash
code you'll find a complete list of all
the upcoming events and links where you
can find more information on what's
happening at those events Shana thanks
for taking this time to explain this
complicated stuff it's already giving me
a headache oh come on you're just
talking shop on me before this don't be
so modest I'm not too much I appreciate
the time man thanks thanks for watching
stay tuned for more coming up some
