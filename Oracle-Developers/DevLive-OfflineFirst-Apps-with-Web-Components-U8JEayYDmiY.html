your employee from Oracle technology
Network
and my guest is Maddie hi Maddie hi
so Maddie you had a session today about
offline functionality for mobile
applications web applications in general
oh yeah yeah so tell us a little bit
more when I clean what was the session
about so I just said it's mobile mainly
but my multivision
is based on statistics that shows that
the number of people accessing web
applications from mobile devices is
overtaking those accessing from desktop
and we need to access those users better
user experience and one of the user
experience is guaranteeing always-on
user interaction this can happen when we
have offline functionality of that so my
user is using his mobile device and then
he's walking away from network or Wi-Fi
or maybe he's going in a subway flying
or something like that and we want to
guarantee that the application will
still work so this is the whole thing
behind my motivation in the decision
okay so so what kind of functional is
are we where are you thinking about or
were you describing in his session so in
the session I showed the available
solutions for implementing offline or of
making a fly design of your application
I discussed two things whether if it's
starting from scratches or if it's
migrating an existing application to
support offline functionality there is a
wide range of options and a lot of
architecture design that is needed but
the top highlight is sometimes we can
just do that with caching but most of
dynamic application requires some kind
of storage so I also discussed the
available solution for storing the data
inside the browser and one of the most
favorite libraries that I liked and I
presented today was supposed to be
because it's open source Apache 2.0
license and it's quite easy to use it's
like just
two lines of code to get everything
working cool so you want to show us a
demo so what is the demo about so this
is my github project it's under my
handle you're going to find offline
first up it's kind of an application
that I'm demonstrating the situation
where someone starts to have an app with
a lot of data then he wants to migrate
this app to support offline
functionalities this is the final app
screenshot from the final app and the
interesting part in my github project
here is that I invested all the steps
from step zero to step nine like the
steps showing how it started and then
step by step migration to make it
support offline functionality so here as
you can see in Step three for example
load data from local storage so I switch
it up from loading the data from cloud
to load from offline storage so that
this chart of the app will be like that
instead of your mobile application or
our mobile app instead of be connected
to the cloud directly it's going to be
connected to a no-fly storage and then
this offline storage going to sync the
beta synchronize the data between the
offline storage and the cloud so that
your app will work whether you are
connected or not right
and then here Ares for example as when I
started synchronization synchronization
in step number six and I also
demonstrated from usage of external
plugins which polish to be like the fine
plugin how to query the offline data and
I can demonstrate also here here in the
final app maybe I increase the font a
bit so here this is the data
it's lazily loaded from the offline
storage I maybe I can turn off CouchDB
to demonstrate this wives how it's
working live so here is the data working
live I can select an item then pop it in
my editor here and then change for
example the first link - let's call it
Oracle code and then update and then
this is step number one modifying also
the data
flying and then also I can interact or
query the data so here for example if I
search all the people with first name
Oracle code then the search result going
to appear here so I have maybe now I
decreased the front of it to make them
appear so I have here all the people in
my flying storage that have the first
name Oracle code I updated bunch of them
today in my presentation like this one
and that one and so on
and now I have a fourth item as well so
a complete interaction with the data
completely offline and then once I go
back online data will be automatically
synchronized to the cloud Wow okay so is
that also like an example of the volume
of data that that you are talking about
in new session and you and how to yeah
use offline functionalities for that
yeah so this is a very important point
because at the first glance you might
think that it's very easy to do it and I
will just synchronize all my data base
to the local storage right but we know
that in enterprises database can be gigs
of data can be 500 GB or one terabyte of
data you cannot just make the user wait
two years to download the one terabyte
supposing that you have one terabyte of
storage available in the device and then
start to use application so this is also
a fundamental part of implementing of
line functionalities to to know exactly
what kind of data that need to be
synchronized offline and how to how to
short out only the data you don't want
to download all your database with a
sensitive data and relational data just
need to select a specific part of the
data in my dream demo here I'm selecting
a part of the data that is related to
this grid and it allows me to load it
lazily so whenever I scroll if I'm
online it tries to see if there is more
data available in the cloud and download
it and automatically it's also not
automatically of course with code I'm
also trying to get rid of unneeded
storage from the other side so to keep
only a small portion of the data not
always
download a lot of data and make the
storage big for things especially on
mobile devices okay so any any advice
otherwise I mean aside from everything
you you explained on how to like your
pitfalls that you came across or things
that you had a hard time with and you
wish you knew you wish you knew before
actually uh all the time I'm doing these
purely in JavaScript but I would provide
and basically and in Vardhan we have
this love for for Java thank you so we
also trihard so this is basically my own
research project it doesn't have to do
anything with Radha and in my research
I'm trying to make this work hard
percent with Java as well so even though
I'm using here web components all the
time
and we have in rather nowadays ability
to not rely on GWT but rely on web
components like those actually what you
see here is a Varden grip it's a hundred
percent with component based on polymer
and in other session maybe I can show
how to use it in run an application or
in java application in general but what
I'm doing now is to continue my research
is that migrating this from being
written in JavaScript to be written in
Java so as I said this is my data
project if you want to follow it you're
going to get to update about my progress
in the research how I'm migrating this
slowly to be hundred-percent Java I've
done already some work related to
progress with apps over here so this is
a second project that I have it's called
Java pwe so making a project web app
100% in Java and I have some comparison
between for example the app before being
P EE and up after P EE and some of the
features at the end and so on like being
available in the app drawer and so on so
I in the near future I'm going to merge
between them having this grid that is
written in Java to work offline and rely
on pouch DB and so on excellent
thank you so much thank you okay coming
and showing us all this
stuff so good job very good thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
