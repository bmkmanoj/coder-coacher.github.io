so thank you for coming so just before
we start how many of you are involved in
with Apex as a developer or as a manager
okay pretty much everyone here today
we're going to talk about managing
javascript in CSS in the context of an
apex application and the goal is to show
you how you can benefit from Apex nitro
so let's jump into it my name is Vincent
I have been working with in sum for the
past eight years I started as a
developer and as years went by I thought
I should the logical path forward was to
become an analyst but but I realized
that what I really enjoy what I Drive on
was coding so I discovered JavaScript
CSS and all the front-end technology so
I kind of went back being a developer
and I know this is what I want to be
doing from from now on so I speak at a
few events I blog a little but I'm
mostly involved in open source projects
like the one we're showing off today so
recently Joe Coleman the director of
software development at Oracle for apex
we did about an article on on Foss bites
and said it's not a coincidence that you
can flourish with the top four languages
in Oracle apex and I've been really
saying this for years now by definition
every apex developer is a very versatile
web developer and also a very efficient
full stack developer too and that is
because in apex you essentially do
JavaScript HTML CSS and
well at the same time so today we'll
look at some of the front-end problems
that you probably didn't know you had in
Apex and then when you're aware of that
we'll look at how apex nitro solves
these problems
after you've seen Apex nitro we'll look
at how it how you can install it and set
it up for your project
we'll talk about basic usage and then
we'll explore a few advanced features to
get the overall picture of Apex nitro so
in in all my years of Apex developments
I can say that apex is best used when
the least amount of code is stored in
the application itself
so I see it as as the middle middleware
between the front end and the back end
so let's let's think about that for a
second it's common practice to wrap your
PL sequel in two packages in your sequel
in two views and once you have all that
business logic in database apex can
simply reference those objects that's a
very important concept for building a
large-scale application that's
maintainable for for everyone because
these packages in these views are done
are built independently from the
application what what's funny to me is
when we move over to the front and side
of things when a developer has to write
a little bit of JavaScript or CSS all
these great package and pinches are just
gone and people write JavaScript and CSS
all over the place
javascript functions are scattered
everywhere in pages and templates CSS
rules are hard-coded and they're often
used to override another rule as well
and also some of them are copied from
one page to another so even if you know
that your
creating this technical debt it's still
one of the most effective way to get
your code across to an apex application
your front-end code I mean so one one
alternative here is to store your code
in files so for a very long time apexis
has allowed you to upload static files
to the shared components these files
once they're in the shared components
they're bundled with your applications
so if you if you export your application
the files come with it I think that's a
better approach than that then the
previous one as it takes the code away
from the pages but the only thing and
the only thing a developer has to do is
to reference these static uploaded files
now you might think that this is great
but if you put yourself in the driver's
seat for a second you make dozens of
changes to these files on a daily basis
so you have to upload over and over
again these files the destroyed
components that's a huge waste of time
so I want to take a moment to clarify
this reference thing simply uploading
files in the shared components does not
automatically inject the code on unto
the pages the application has to
reference these files there are many
places where you can reference files in
Apex so should should the file be
available to the whole application for
instance a good reference point would be
under the user interface attributes of
the shared components that way that file
would be available to the whole
application
so hopefully you get the picture of the
inefficiency here and today I present
you a tool that aims to solve these
problems and improve the front-end
development in Oracle apex okay
so apex Nitro is a tool that runs in the
background of your system it runs as a
service and it it what it watches for
static file changes on your system and
the idea is that we would synchronize
these files to your application in real
time so I'll try to demonstrate that
using this application and this
application on the right and the these
files on the left so I've configured
this to work properly but I'll show
everything how to install and configure
it later but right now I just want to
show you the effect on the application
so I've got a CSS file actually I'll
start with the JavaScript file
oh I have a JavaScript file on the left
and let's say that my business
requirement is to send an alert message
to my application on page roll very
simple requirement so I could be doing
something like an alert message hello
world and I want you to notice what
happens when I save that file so I'm
saving now and my application on the
right reloads automatically and I get to
see my my alert message so apex nitro
that runs as a service was able to
detect the change and push it to the
browser now let's do something else
I'll create a second javascript file so
what I'm doing now is duplicating this
one I'll call it whatever app - okay now
I got two messages but what I wanted to
show here is that regardless of which
file you're modifying these changes are
all wrapped together and synchronized to
the application so the goal here was to
change the alert message which is
something else and if I save again I've
got the world and - now what if I make a
javascript error I'll just remove these
closure and save again
okay so what apex NATO is doing is
actually it's it's a command-line
utility I'll show that later but it the
changes then to refresh on the page and
the reason is because I had errors on my
file and apex Nitro is able to identify
these errors and show them to you on the
command line so let's fix that error now
actually let's remove it
okay now going to a CSS file which is
much more visual the business
requirement now is to change the color
of this region right here and you're
gonna have to trust me here I set the ID
of that region to nitro one two three
and what I want to do is change the
background color of that region so I'll
save the files were compiled and sent
back to the apex application in real
time now say the next business
requirement is to change the font size
of that particular region a bigger font
size so you see the the approach here
and the efficiency of coding like that
the next thing I want to show is I
actually need a volunteer here here to
connect to my to my apex server so is
anyone on the Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi from the
conference on their phone anyone has the
Wi-Fi
okay so what I'd like someone to do is
to go to this address which is an
external server that apex Nitro has
opened for you
let me know when you're in
oh good
so if anyone has connected to that
server I want you to scroll the page
down to the bottom and you'll see that
it has an effect on my browser as well
apex Nitro is synchronizing all devices
together and not just the scrolling the
typing as well so if you go up and type
something in here if someone could type
in hello world in the first field of TV
shows it simulates that too so if you
think of it from a responsive
development QA perspective as a
developer you're now able to see if your
application works on a desktop on a
mobile on the tablet at the same time
you're not trapping these errors when
your QA team has found them so it's very
efficient in that regards all right
so now how do you get that running on
your environment there's a few concepts
that I have to introduce but I'll try to
make that as simple as possible Epic's
nitro is entirely built on nodejs
customarily JavaScript was more for
client-side technology for the browser
but what nodejs is doing is it took the
JavaScript engine from chrome and took
it to the server so you can develop
application with the same language on
the client and on the server which is
very powerful also apex nitro requires
sequel CL because this is the
command-line tool we're using to push
the changes the files to the apex
environment and I'll show that later so
when these two prerequisites are
installed all you have to do is open a
command line and with no js' install you
have access to a tool called NPM which
stands for node package manager and what
you want to do is installed install Apex
nitro through and p.m. so this command
NPM install - G Apex nitro takes Apex
nitro from the online registry and
downloads it on your system this process
takes a few minutes but you only have to
do it once and when you have it
installed notify your utility will
notify you for any new version that
comes out in the future so you don't
really have to remember this
installation process once it's it once
it's installed you can validate the
installation process by typing Apex
- nitro on your command line and this is
where you see all the available options
that Apex nitro offers you the three
main options are
config' launch and publish and we'll
explain that in a second so let's look
at the setup the first thing you want to
do is configure a project for Apex nitro
so we'll open the command line again and
we'll use one of the but available Apex
nitro commands which is apex nitro
config and then you give it the name of
the of your choice for your project this
will open a browser tab automatically
and you will see a form with a few
categories to fill a little later I'll
explain all the available options but
right now I want to focus on two things
the first one is pretty obvious it is
the URL of your application this is
needed because the apex nitro needs to
know where to connect the application to
and then it needs the path a local path
to your files so basically you decide
where you want to code your files on
your system and you provide the location
of these files to Apex nitro I suggest
that you do this on a version control
system because but that's entirely up to
appeal and that is a very basic
configuration for your project but
that's enough to benefit from the life
changes we've seen earlier so we need to
do one more thing and that's to open the
door to Apex nitro from your apex
application in Apex we have there's a
concept called
application processes and which are
blocks of PL sequel code that executes
more or less on page load of your
application so essentially we're
creating application process which fires
on page load
and that replaces the apex default file
path with the one from Apex nitro for
security purposes this will only trigger
when the apex nitro HTTP variable the
thing on the right contains a value and
we're also using a build option to
constrain Apex nitro to the development
environment so let's take a moment to
understand what this is doing
apex underscore application dot G flow
images is a package variable that holds
the value to the default image path and
when referencing files in Apex you would
use a substitution string called app
images so what this is doing is
overriding that package variable with
the path from apex Nitro and apex Nitro
is in an HTTP variable and it holds a
value like localhost with an available
port this is how we make the connection
again you only have to do this once on
your application after after your first
setup you don't need to worry about it
and your day-to-day development will be
much simpler so let's let's have a look
at basic usage
so you you open a command line again and
you type in Apex - Nitro launch and the
name of your project which you have
previously configured and that's it
your application opens automatically a
browser tab opens and the file
synchronization takes over what's also
nice about launching an apex Nitro
project is that it also opens the apex
builder at the same time
so essentially you you get in the office
in the morning and all you do is open
your command line type apex night will
launch something and you're good to go
so when you execute the launch command
you will see something similar to this
which is apex Nitro that it's compiling
your files it's compiling your files it
tells you your source folder where the
files are coming from and it also tells
you the URL to access your application
and it opens the URL automatically so
what now when you're working with the
team of developers you often need to
push your code to others so they can
benefit from your changes right and you
might think it doesn't make sense to
keep your code locally on your system
for sharing purposes but as we've
discussed earlier one very very
efficient way is to upload manually your
file over and over again in the shared
components so apex Nitro offers a way to
do that automatically with every file in
your source folder so when you feel
you're done with some part of your
JavaScript or CSS you might want to
execute the following
which is apex nitrile publish and then
the name of your project and this is
what you're going to see on the command
line but I actually want to demo this to
you so my application is here
I'll go through the shared components
where the files should be and I see all
my files here right I'll delete them all
so my my application has no files right
now what I'll do is go to my command
line and execute Apex nitro publish in
the name of my project so apex nitro
compiles the files and then uploads them
to the application so it has uploaded
nine files here if we go back to the
application refresh
I'll see that all my files are there so
at the end of your day this is all you
have to do
um so I feel very strongly about the
efficiency gain of a basic Apex Nitro
project but in fact you can get much
more out of it by enabling a few opt-in
features so remember the configuration
page we had the basic options we can get
a little more out of that so if we
change the mode from basic to advanced a
new field will appear called
distributable folder the distributor
bowl folder is a path to an empty folder
on your computer and it but it must be
different from the source folder picture
it this way you have a bunch of
JavaScript CSS files on your system and
this is where you do the coding right
manual manual coding of front-end
technology and you can add other kind of
files libraries or images or fonts this
is your source folder and according to
your configuration your Apex nitro
configuration we will compile these
files into another folder called the
distributable folder and in a scenario
like that only the distributable folder
is exposed to Apex the source folder is
never exposed to Apex and that's that's
a very important distinction between the
two
so the first feature here is file
minification and it is performed
automatically when running apex nitro
file minification consists of removing
all necessary unnecessary spaces in a
file in order to put the whole code in a
single line
this saved between 30 to 40% in some
cases of the file size which is very
interesting by looking at the
distributable folder apex Nitro actually
produces two files and the first one is
a copy of the source app jas and the
second one is minified app dot Minjae s
which is which contains all the code in
a single line with no spaces in your
application you would reference that
file using this syntax and the min
substitution string is has a very
particular purpose here when you're
logged in as a developer the application
would load a PP dot j s when you're not
logged in as a developer when you're a
regular user the app would load a PP
that min J S which is the faster version
the smaller file
so there's there's a performance gain
also on the file minification which is
very important another important feature
is file concatenation and this allows to
bundle multiple files together in order
to expose a single file to Apex so that
that makes it very maintainable for a
developer because think of that a good
pattern would be to to split your files
according to your apex pages you would
have p1 dot JSP to p3 and you could have
other generic files like util or you
name it by a name by enabling file
concatenation the distributable folder
would still produce only two files ap
PJs and a PP dot min j/s so you have a
single entry point here not five it's
much more maintainable in the app you
still only reference one file and think
of a large-scale application where you
could blow this up to dozens of small
files which are much more maintainable
so the turn feature I want to show is
source maps it in the past slides I've
shown how to files are generated a pjs
app dot Minjae s right but in reality
apex Nitro produces two more files which
are apt the J's dot map an app dot
min-jae's
dot map and these are called source maps
and they're really useful for for
debugging if you're if you're anything
like me you might write code that fails
sometimes if a javascript error happens
it shows up in the browser console like
this screenshot and you might have
encountered that before if the file has
been concatenated and minified all you
really see is a big pile of code and
there's no way to understand what's
going on here
with source map enables enabled the
browser Maps the error back to the
original source file so and this is
completely automatic by apex nitro you
get this out of the box so you you would
never have to debug a complex file again
the error would go directly to the
source file nan the final file
so we've seen this in the demo earlier
as opposed to PL sequel javascript is
not a compiled language it is parsed at
runtime so any syntax mistake you make
on your file would only be trapped at at
the moment you run your page with Apex
nitro you get to see the errors before
they even get to the browser so in it it
also offers a very comprehensive UI to
show you the errors and how to fix them
so it's it's kind of like compiling PL
sequel youyou see right away where's
your error and how to fix it that
applies for JavaScript CSS and other
languages as well in Apex nitro
so cross-device development this is what
we've seen in the demo earlier but I I
want to take a moment to explain the
physics around that thing so something
that should be clear by now is that apex
Nitro creates a little server on your
computer and that little server is what
exposes your files from your source
folder and that little server also has a
URL that you can access that you that
allows other devices to connect to using
WebSockets technology Apex nitro allows
for to listen for any scrolling typing
clicking on your page and it propagates
those changes to all devices and this is
really thanks to two WebSockets and
nodejs
Epic's nitro has many more features all
of which are documented on github by the
way we've seen cross device's
development but it also works on
cross-platform development if you will
because recently I was able to fix a
prompt a problem a bug on Internet
Explorer on my out of my Mac environment
I was I was coding on my files on Mac
and using a Windows Device I was up able
to replicate the error on an or dive
Explorer and fix it so that was really
really useful
apex nitro has autoprefixer again it's
it's all in the documentation
I just want to list out the the features
it can add comments blocks at the top of
your files for better versioning it ties
in with theme roller very efficiently it
helps your team productivity by
isolating front-end code during your
daily work and it also has support for
typescript
or web pack which are very powerful
JavaScript engines but that would
actually require a whole session on
these two features um so I'm very much
ahead of time here
I didn't expect to be this short but
thank you for coming I put the links
here so you can check out the
documentation as well as other or
open-source
open-source projects I do have stickers
in in the front if you're interested and
I hope you enjoyed and I'll be available
for questions yes
sure
okay so your question was if do you
provide app dot min da Jas to your
back-end developers or so there's
there's no reason to provide a Java
Script files to your back-end this is
really for your front-end so any
anything that had that happens on the
client side on your browser so the so to
answer your question no there there's no
reason to provide that file right
so so are you using apex to develop them
okay okay right yeah okay so if you're
not using apex then you would have to do
some some custom valid validation or
processing to to either use the minified
version or not by using apex this the
substitution showing I've shown earlier
does this automatically I try to come
back to that slide here by using that
substitution string it automatically
detects if you're a developer or not so
you you don't need to specify it
yourself
all right I forgot to mention apex Nitro
is totally free it's on get up
it it's it's it's been around for a
while so there is no strings with
strings attached it's completely open
source and free a very good question
right now we support apex 5o and 5:1
there are plans to support 18 one as
well but it's not out yet so it's hard
to tell yes oh well nice to hear then
but the plan is definitely to support 18
1 we haven't tried yet ourselves but but
thank you for confirming yes
so your question is does this tool
simplify your your development in Apex
yes
okay okay that that's a good question
apex nitro will not write code for you
it will help you manage it properly
within an apex application it's really
to to make your application more
maintainable for in the future
oh yes yes your question is it has air
alerts absolutely absolutely it does
have yes yes I understand what you're
saying but it still doesn't write code
for you it helps you fix it we ate ro
actively
so again if you're interested I have
stickers if not well thank you very much
and I'll stay around for a little while</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
