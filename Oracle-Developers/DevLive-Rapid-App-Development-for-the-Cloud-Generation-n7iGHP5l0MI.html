York City I'm Barbara Bart with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
another interview with one of the
presenters from today's event
my name is Max Yves I'm a senior
development minister and the Oracle
application Express team we are part of
the database group and yeah I manage a
team inside our group developing
features for work application Express
responsible for the release of apex by
one and now focus on apex 5.0 tell me a
bit about your session today what are
you gonna be talking about well today
we're going to talk about high
productivity application development
with Oracle application Express the test
is actually titled rats application
development for the cloud generation so
it's a two-part session the first
session is going to be my part we're
going to talk about application Express
local development and what that means to
what you can do and then there's a
second part to it it's the application
builder cloud service a BCS and you're
going to see that as well tell me about
quick sequel expect sequel is a new
sample or new creativity application
that we are shipping with Apex was
introduced in 8x5 1 and 6 sequel is a
very easy way for you to create your
database model we have a very easy to
learn markdown language we've just
started out with typing in employee and
then you move the next line and you kind
of indent a little bit by to two white
spaces and you type name city email
whatever attributes you want to collect
about that employee then you can go
further you can add relationships right
you can add like let's say a skill that
the employer you might have and then you
include information about what that
skill what kind of proficiency does the
employee have and it could be a one two
and relationship so you can build out an
entire database model using this very
simple language and then on the right
hand side you'll see how that actual
sequel ddd LVL code gets generated out
of your markdown language
we generate a complete psycho script
create able create vo creating a
constraint in it is everything you need
to have a complete database model and
once you're done you can save it and
then you can take this to the psycho
workshop and application Express run it
as a secret script and get all these
tables are generated for you if there's
one thing that the people attending your
session take away from from listening to
you speak what do you hope that is well
there are multiple parts to it I'm going
to show quick sequel but I think the
main part that I would like them to take
away from is our new create application
with it we're introducing this without
this year is there going to be a cloud
first feature it's going to be deployed
to our cloud services it's also going to
be available with our core product in
Apex 5.2 and what it does it takes our
declarative approach to development one
step further like in the past you would
create a support page a chart page maybe
a calendar whatever but with this
nuclear applications with that you can
actually create complete features like
your user management your access control
list maybe you want to allow your users
to change the UI pick a different theme
style or send emails collect feedback
all these features require more than
just one page right it's like a form
another page a dialog maybe some
processes an email API call all of this
you can create it one click give me
email it gives me feedback give me team
style changes and you make your choices
you pick your features and then you
generate a complete application that is
all the dysfunctionality built in for
you what's next for you are there any
other events or presentations on your
calendar you know the number of events
coming up not for me personally but
there's a big conference in the
Netherlands and what Adam end office
months its apex world ah it's a a
text-only conference it's actually on a
cruise ship they have to be honest
participants there it's a great
conference to learn more about apex and
then after that my next conference is
going to be the 8x connect conference in
Berlin similar-sized about four
participants three days
apex
called JavaScript so if anyone is
Germany or in Europe both conference of
elbrus attending if you'd like to attend
