Qualcomm I my area focus is on software
for the Internet of Things and so what
I'm going to spend some time talking
with you about today is this idea of how
we harness the Internet of Things near
me so the proximal cloud or the proximal
internet and Qualcomm spends a lot of
time thinking about proximity about how
devices that are physically close to one
another can interact differently and so
you know we sort of challenge this
notion that for the Internet of Things
if we have to you know two devices that
are a couple feet away from each other
those devices need to be intermediated
to the cloud to communicate with one
another so so that's what I'm going to
spend a lot of time talking about and
there's there are a lot of sort of
implications to this devices need to be
be able to heterogeneous devices rather
need to be able to communicate with one
another in a sort of a common language
and you know of course there with the
internet of things interesting internet
things introduces interesting cecee and
and security implications as well to how
how how we connect our devices and the
things around us so I'm going to spend a
lot of time talking about how how we
think proximity is interesting and how
there's this personal relationship
between the devices that are that are
that are near us and how we may want to
interact with those devices differently
and how Qualcomm is building software
open source software that can help
accelerate the pace of innovation for
the Internet of Things so that's the
discussion today we can fast forward
here there we go
so the Internet has gone through a
number of stages of evolution over the
years and it's currently going through
another one so in 80s of course we had
you know the internet which was
connected you know largely many
computers and and workstations that
where the where the traffic went through
you know central exchanges like Mae West
here in San Jose and very few number of
connected devices and that that was the
80s and that all changed in the 90s of
course when the internet evolved into
the number of devices connected to the
Internet skyrocketed we saw of course
you know pcs desktop PCs connecting
internet service our servers rather
connecting to the internet and this
obviously spurred the revolution that
became the internet and the web in the
90s and then in the 2000s you know we
saw mobile sort of take the stage and
the number of devices really begin to
quickly climb we saw tablets and smart
first feature phones connected to the
Internet and then we saw smartphones and
tablets and you know today we have about
6.7 billion connected mobile devices
which is almost one device for every
person on the planet and it's you know
really pretty staggering figure but
we're transitioning now we're in another
stage of evolution for the Internet
we're transitioning to the Internet of
Things and we this is a fundamental
shift in terms of the number of devices
and the amount of connectivity and the
new kinds of services that will see as
we tradition a transition to this in
this new space so what does that really
mean so we think the Internet of Things
and you're going to hear the Internet of
Things talk to a lot here at javaone but
it's really everyone is talking about
how this is a transformative technology
how it's going to change change the
world as much as connecting the pcs
servers and building the web changed the
internet and you know in a staggering
figure is that estimate conservative
estimate of the number of connected
things by the end of this decade is it
is you know 20 20 25 billion
will be connected this is a conservative
stat I've seen some up to 50 billion
connected things and you know when you
think about that you think about all
mobile devices today 6.7 billion and in
the next seven years we're going are
less than seven years we're going to
we're going to go we're going to add
three and a half times that number of
devices to to the internet or enable
connectivity on those devices it's
really a pretty staggering figure and
you know this is of course is going to
transform industries it's going to
change the way that that we work it's
going to change the way that we interact
with things in our lives it's going to
prove improve our lives through creating
new experiences and it's going to be as
transformational I think as the web was
and the growth of the Internet and the
90s and 2000's and so this is also going
to create a lot of opportunity for a lot
of companies for developers and for
hardware manufacturers that are looking
into this space to to create new
compelling products or extend their
products to be more connected and so the
cornerstone of this is really about
connectivity it's about how we create a
device that doesn't have connectivity
today and how we add connectivity and we
make it smart and it becomes smart not
just by having wireless or wired
connectivity it becomes smart by being
able to connect to smart networks smart
services for these devices to
collaborate together and create a
experience when when when sort of
conducted or orchestrated together
that's better than sort of the sum of
the individual parts so the kinds of
devices that will see what that will
connect to smart networks and services
obviously we're seeing consumer
electronics today in a big way doing
that you know tell televisions are now
becoming more connected we see other
things in the home we cease white goods
so appliances and those kinds of things
that are becoming more connected of
other things in the home like like
sensors see home security we're seeing
home automation type solutions you know
everything from from light bulbs to home
home home audio solutions to 20 just a
variety of new things if you look on
seems like every day on the crowdfunded
systems like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo
you're seeing new hardware Internet of
Things focused hardware that that are
appearing in the market solving really
interesting problems for consumers so
but it's not just it's not just the home
and consumers it's also the you know
sort of urban environment the industrial
Internet of Things the the how this will
change the enterprise etc but all these
these devices sort of need to need to
communicate in order to in order to
create the experiences I'm talking about
so you know I talked about how the cloud
impacts this we don't we don't see the
cloud is a bad thing we think the cloud
is extremely important and every device
will have that has connectivity will
will likely have some element of its
service that's provided through the
cloud it's how it connects to the cloud
we think that is an interesting topic of
discussion and when it connects to the
cloud so you know the devices need to be
connected and in order to communicate
but in many instances they can solve the
problems by communicating with each
other without necessarily committing
communicating the cloud and when they do
communicate to the cloud they can go
through perhaps a gateway in the home to
do that so you know this idea that every
single device I have you know my home
I've got about 35 connected
internet-connected devices that's
probably on the higher end of the scale
but as we get to the end of this decade
if these 25 billion 250 billion numbers
are correct it's going to be a lot more
than that you're talking about hundreds
of devices in the average home
ultimately perhaps thousands of devices
that will become connected and this idea
that you could expose all these devices
to the Internet in in in each individual
device connecting to the internet saw on
its own really I think introduces an
interesting problem from a security and
a privacy perspective you've got you've
got a lot much larger surface area if
you if all these devices are connected
directly on much larger surface area
which is a bad accurate actoress or you
could have security breaches or other
things we've seen this in the press
recently with internet you know cameras
being attacked and and you know people
taking control of these devices and home
and interacting with people in the home
in doing negative things so so it sort
of minimizing that surface area by
allowing the devices to connect but
allowing them to connect through a
gateway that can help maintain security
and privacy in the home we think is
another important thing I'll talk a
little bit more about how we're
attacking that problem so if we look at
some let's talk a little bit about some
of the use cases in the in the connected
home as an example for the Internet of
Things so we think that smartphones and
tablets are going to be sort of the
window into the experience they're going
to be the gate they get the anchor of
experience for interacting with devices
in the connected home so you know you
may have a device like a coffee pot or a
wall clock or oven that doesn't have a
sophisticated interface on it but that
advice can expose its capabilities
through to a to a smart tablet or
smartphone that can enable more
sophisticated control and so I may want
to set the coffee pot to brew at a
certain time or but but at the same time
the coffee pot needs to also be able to
interact with other this is sort of a
person to machine interaction coffee pot
also needs to be able to communicate
machine to machine within the home so I
may want to receive a notification on my
television that the coffeepot is is
ready and I don't necessarily the coffee
is ready I don't necessarily need that
transaction to go back through the
tablet the coffee pot should be able to
communicate directly with it but we
really see that the tablet and the pc is
sort of being the anchor of the control
for for the connected home devices will
also be able to expose sort of shared
capabilities in the home so you know you
have look at you if you take speakers
for example you know I've got speakers
on my tablet I've got speakers in my
television every television in my home I
have you know maybe wireless speakers or
wired speakers connected to a stereo
system and you know the the tablet or
the smartphone should be able to
discover those elements in the connected
home and sort of bring them together and
create a whole home audio a service for
example where I can stream audio to the
same audio perhaps to through my
speakers or my sound bar on my TV that
I'm streaming through a wireless speaker
in my in my
kitchen for example so they sort of this
ability for device to be able to export
their capabilities and be able to
control shared capabilities from Verret
devices in the home through the through
the tablet or smartphone is is part of
what the problem that we're looking to
solve and you know many of these devices
are very primitive in terms of their
user interfaces and in attaching them
are connecting them to a mobile device
that has a more sophisticated user
interface allows you to have a much
richer experience to communicate and
talk with those with those devices so
you take something like a thermostat for
example or a white good like a like a
refrigerator or a an oven something that
doesn't have a very sophisticated
display on it if I want to be able to
you know do more interesting things with
those devices perhaps around home
automation or other things I really need
a better user interface to manage that
so part of the problem we you know we're
looking at and what we're trying to
solve is is how these devices can expose
their capabilities to application
developers who can take advantage of
those and build applications to
communicate with them but can also you
know do that in a way that is not wed to
a specific device manufacturer or brand
and you know these devices think that
the mobile device in the home is also
the way to get these devices onto the
network if i purchase let's say a a
light bulb a connected light bulb and i
want to install that or a light switch i
recently installed some connected light
switches in my home um you know I bring
that device on to the network I the way
that I actually on board that device
into my connected home is through
through my mobile device so the mobile
device sort of becomes the thing that
can help me help me orchestrate the
devices in my home but also to actually
get them connected in a way that is sort
of easy to follow and low friction so
everything I've talked about here is it
is it's it's very interesting in that
devices
will be connected devices will be able
to communicate with one another to sort
of orchestrate our lives and but in
order for this to be achieved we really
need the devices to be able to speak a
common language and for the applications
that are running on these devices to be
able to communicate across heterogeneous
platform so different brands different
operating systems different
manufacturers know we all have different
things a constellation of devices around
us is although it's very heterogeneous
we have lots of different things that
it's it you know we're starting to see
things appear in the home solutions that
appear around verticals that are you
know perhaps tied to one manufacturer we
don't think this is the thing that will
help accelerate the pace of innovation
for the internet of things we think that
you really need horizontal connectivity
and you need devices you know
communicating with a common language so
the the reality as I mentioned today is
that you know we have we have people
building you know focused on on building
vertical solutions for the Internet of
Things or the internet of everything as
Qualcomm likes to call it the they're
doing this because it's easier to get to
market and if you have more control over
the experience in your own little
vertical world I think you can
ultimately you can ultimately get to
market faster but oh this isn't
necessarily better for the end consumer
because what the what what this creates
is an environment where I have 25 50
connected things all with their own apps
and they don't they don't talk to one
another so so it's less useful for me
from it's interesting for me from a from
a just a control perspective I have that
control and I have a nest thermostat on
the flight over I was I control the nest
thermostat from the flight and that's
interesting to me but it's it's own
vertical ecosystem it there's no way for
me to sort of bring that that device in
with my other devices and create an
experience that runs horizontal across
my my home to to enable new and
interesting thing so maybe I have a
security device that has
motion sensor on it and when the motion
sensor goes off i want the security
device to talk to the to the lights and
tell the lights to come on when the
security system is armed now I'm you
know if these are vertical solutions
they don't talk to one another that the
devices can't or can't enable that kind
of experience or maybe I want to you
know when the security trips I want to
also play the siren for the alarm
outside the home on my external you know
backyard speakers so you know those are
the kinds of things that the vertical
solutions that we see in the market
today are not going to not get enable
and it's so these are the kinds of
problems that we're looking at and as
these solutions evolve we're looking to
help you know enable the the
interoperability between these devices
and able enable the devices to
communicate in a common language I I
noted that you know all you know a few a
few people have the same manufacturer
device in in their home entirely in
their home or in their environment and
their work and their automobile where
have what have you you know that they're
often times you know we talked to folks
who are building these devices and it's
not that they they don't want their
systems to be open or that they they
only want their systems to work within
their own Island they really are
challenged with how they do that they
just don't they don't understand oh how
they don't have a technology with them
or the ability to enable those devices
to communicate in a way that doesn't
increase the cost of building their
product or increase their bomb costs etc
so you know we we spent a lot of time
thinking about how do we do this
connectivity in software versus in
hardware and how do we use the existing
radios that are in the device to enable
these devices to connect more more more
seamlessly without necessarily
increasing the cost for the manufacturer
so what we think is needed is a an open
a solution that can enable
interoperability across heterogeneous
devices and the kinds of things that we
would see that this solution needs needs
to accomplish are they
Billy for these devices to easily
discover one another interoperate with
one another communicate using a language
ability for devices to expose their
capabilities and the ability to
dynamically discover those capabilities
on the fly if I go into an environment a
new environment I should be able to
discover things that are within
proximity and to the extent the person
who owns them has granted me control I
should be able to inherit the the
control capabilities of those devices
interact with those devices and use
those devices to improve my life whether
I'm let's say I'm here in San Francisco
live in San Diego I'm staying with a
friend I should be able to control the
connected things in in my friends home
to the extent they are willing to
delegate that to me and so you know easy
discoverability easier interoperability
the ability to delegate security these
are all things that are very important
that are needed in a connectivity
framework to solve this problem in
addition the the solution has to be work
across platforms and devices so in in in
mobile and in the Internet of Things
there's this wide range of devices from
embedded devices running a
microcontroller all the way to you know
a television that might be running a 2
gigahertz processor so you need a
solution that can span the entire
breadth of devices that make up the
Internet of Things and this means it
needs to be highly portable run on lots
of different platforms and also be able
to fit in these tiny embedded
environments which sometimes are less
than you know 50 kilobytes so and then
the solution also needs to be forward
compatible so you get a lot of the
devices that are going into let's say a
connected home or a connected workplace
or an enterprise have a ten year
lifespan a 15 year lifespan just take a
fridge refrigerator for example I you
may only purchase refrigerator once
every 10 or 15 years and so that device
needs to be able to be durable in terms
of how it exposes its communication
capabilities so that as if that device
is capable of talking to let's say a
display like the like I use the example
before the coffeepot talking the
television
what is a television today is not going
to be a television it will evolve what
what we think of as a tablet television
will evolve so you know that that that
refrigerator or that coffee pot if it
community needs to be able to
communicate in a future-proof manner
such that if in 15 years from now we
have you know this this paint that you
can roll on a wall and that becomes your
display the TV needs to be able to
communicate with that paint and so we
spent a lot of time thinking about how
do we make these services durable so
that as the Internet of Things evolves
we can't possibly think of everything so
we get 225 billion connected devices the
end of this decade or potentially
hundreds of billions or even trillions
of devices over the next 20 30 50 years
we're not going to be able to think
about those all those devices today and
all those use cases so we need to sort
of build future-proof into we need a
future-proof the connectivity framework
so qualcomm has been thinking about this
problem for many years and have been
working on an open source project called
called all join to solve this problem
and so i'm going to just play a little
video here real quick that'll
okay so so as I mentioned all join is an
open source technology so we when we
started looking at this problem we said
obviously it needs to be heterogeneous
it needs to run across every device it
also needs to be open and and so the
problem we saw was was one of scale and
the the software that we ultimately are
the SDK and the the services solution
that we built ultimately needed to do to
be open and freely available so we went
the open-source approach with it it
enables you as a let's say a
manufacturer of a device or as a
developer of applications to be able to
build software that into your hardware
that can allow your device to be
interoperable and it allows software
developers to be able to interact with
your devices using this sort of common
language ap is and so all join enables
the the ability to discover to manage
the devices that are around me to
discover those done dynamically be able
to adapt to those devices when they come
and go there transient by nature many of
them and and then you know obviously
working across that I talked about the
smartphone or the tablet being sort of
the control device that we're
interfacing with many of these devices
with that's changing we see wearables
and now other things that I think are
going to be become control devices as
well but this idea that you know the
solution needs to span multiple
operating systems different languages
that developers build in you know
embedded platforms all the way to to
high-level operating systems so we we
built sort of all joint as a core engine
and then we built some services on top
of it the services are what drive many a
lot of this interoperability and so we
started with a few of which i'll talk a
little bit about one is onboarding i
talked about how to bring the device on
the network for the first time this is a
problem we see manufacturers
of devices be it a person building
something on Kickstarter or a you know
white good a multi-billion dollar white
goods company wanting to enable a
connected refrigerator they have
problems getting the device on the
network in a way that a consumer can it
can deal with and is low friction for
them so we built some services on top to
enable that notification is this idea
where devices can stand so you can think
of almost as text messages to each other
so this idea that like we talked about
the the coffee pot could produce a
notification that notification could say
that the coffee's ready and consumers of
that notification within the proxy we're
all talking about the proximal network
nothing's going to the cloud yet the
consumers of that notification could be
a television it could be a picture frame
it could be my tablet or my pc it could
be anything in my in my the Internet of
Things near me could receive those
notifications and alerts and display
them those notifications can encode
audio they can include they include a
link back sort of an action to take on
the event that sort of thing so this
idea that maybe you know there's lots of
use cases for this that we're seeing
manufacturers adopt and I think there's
also an interesting one for developers
to look at and how they build you know
build applications that can can interact
with these devices that will be coming
into the home over the next seven years
or in the environment over the next
seven years another is control so I
talked about the device being able to
export its capabilities so we believe
fundamentally that the that you don't
need to have the sort of this
specification of our profile so to speak
of a device that the controlling device
needs to know about in advance of
communicating with the the device is
trying to interact with our control so
with all join we've developed this
control panel service that allows the
device to dynamically expose its
capabilities and the application
controlling it to inherit and understand
those capabilities at runtime so this
makes the ability to you sort of
discover the interfaces that you're
controlling on this device at runtime
and the capabilities of that device are
exposed
you know dynamically sort of on the fly
and then we use you know we map those
back to UI widgets or element we sort of
provide you I hints that map back to
widgets in Android and iOS that allow
you to to paint paint a UI that can
render sort of the control panel as a
developer and then audio streaming is
another that were that were been focused
quite a bit on audio streaming from you
know one device to multiple speakers or
perhaps you have you want to have a you
know your whole home audio system play
an alert when I talked about the
security example where you know the the
security alarm system goes off and I
want to play some i wanta play the siren
to my whole home audio system that that
can be done with with the audio audio
service for all join so these services
are built on top of sort of the all join
core and they're really their intended
to be simple and design part of them are
those ideas that there again this it
needs to be future proof they're all
open source some of them have been
released so notification audio streaming
our open source there on all joined org
today you can go get the source and work
with them and then we have onboarding
and control panel that will be released
at the end of the end of next month so
if we sort of look at the layer cake
that is all join all join has what we
call the core here the all joint core
you can think of as the engine for all
join there's a there's we call there's
two different versions of the engine
there's sort of a standard version of
the engine which it needs about 600 k
kilobytes to run in and and so it's
fairly large by not large by today's
computing standards but it's very large
by today's embedded device standards so
all joined core at six you know four to
six hundred K is not going to fit in a
in a in a really embedded
microcontroller so we also have the all
join thin client which supports you know
ultra low memory footprints so this runs
in about 30k up to baby 50k where's you
layer on the services of memory so it's
um this is sort of the foundation and
what the ultimate core does is it
handles the discovery elements for the
for the devices so how do they just find
and I'm not discard I'm discovering the
devices but I'm also discovering the
services that those devices expose so
all joint is a message bus architecture
so it's a publish and subscribe model so
you as a as a as a developer of an
application or as a device would expose
the servicing capabilities that your
device can can enable and then other
devices can discover those services and
interact with them sitting on top of the
core are these service frameworks that I
talked about so we have onboarding
control panel notifications and audio
streaming today there's a whole pipeline
of other services that we're looking at
enabling one of which is a gateway
service that will allow you the devices
within the proximal network to securely
expose their capabilities out to the
cloud so this will enable you know
manufacturers who have existing cloud
solutions to get to access sort of the
all join devices in a way that maintains
privacy and security and then sitting on
top of the services we have the actual
applications this can be an embedded
application running on a on a light bulb
or it could be an application running on
a u.s. android desktop pc linux box
anything so and so the applications talk
to the service frameworks the service
frameworks communicate using the core
you can also develop our applications
directly to the core so if you want to
build your own service frameworks you
can do that if you want that obviously
those would not interoperate they would
interoperate perhaps within your own
devices and applications but they
wouldn't operate with with with each
other unless in unless you made those
you know publicly available but those
that that can be done as well so so you
can think of the core is the fundamental
sort of building blocks the server
service frameworks added
interoperability and the applications
are what do the connect connectivity all
join can also be used I'll just make it
aside that all join can also be used for
more than the Internet of Things if you
want to connect if you just want to
connect five or six tablets together and
you want to maybe have a file that
you've moved from one to five tablets
simultaneously because all join you know
was developed as a
a publish and subscribe model for four
it's really a protocol you can enable
lots of interesting user experiences
with it we see many developers are using
it to do those kinds of things we worked
with sesame workshop and NASCAR to do
some interesting things with multi
screen between the television and tablet
or the sesame in this case the sesame
character fly is in the TV and then it's
Abby Cadabby she flies out of the TV
into the tablet and interacts with a
child to the tablet and flies back in
the TV so blending the screen experience
was done using all joint as well and
sort of a non Internet of Things use
case so it can be it can be used outside
of the scope of IOT platforms today so
we have mobile on the mobile side we
have android windows windows 8 and
windows RT we have OSS excuse me iOS and
then we have a linux and then on the on
the sort of desktop and then Pete you
know mobile side we have windows 7
windows 8 we have a unity extension then
we support a bunch of our tosses open
open wrt as a platform used pretty
commonly in routers today internet
routers for the home it's works there
from from a Java perspective we work on
so we have different language bindings
on top of these operating systems and we
support java java on windows 7 windows
XP Windows 8 Windows RT and Linux so
that's another environment so many times
we have on a platform we may have
multiple language bindings that you can
use to build your applications for for
the whole joint so for instance on
Android you can build kind of in dalvik
you can build in C or C++ or you can
build in unity so you have your your
choice of how you build build an
application there so from a from a
benefits perspective just to summarize
kind of what we're doing here that we
think that all joint is a solution to
that's going to help accelerate the pace
of innovation for the Internet of Things
it's going to help people build devices
that can interact and communicate with
each other in new ways and sort of break
down these vertical barriers by enabling
horizontal interoperability this is
going to reduce the time to market for
getting new products in in out that use
the Internet of Things and and get the
Internet of Things moving more quickly
we think all join is really important
for in improving the user experience so
bringing you know taking a device that
doesn't have a beautiful user experience
today our ability to control it in a way
that is consumer friendly and enabling
that through with the technology and you
know all join of course is is enabling
you know the ability for these devices
and the apps to interoperate and
communicate across across various
platforms and and device device
capabilities so again open sort the
product is open source and this opens
but by being open source in nature I
think that that allows it to be
contributed by more than just Qualcomm
you know we have lots of companies that
are that are looking working with all
join and are looking to contribute to it
we are looking for you as if your
application developers to not only use
it your applications but consider
evolving what it is and what it becomes
it's open its cross-platform and we
think it's going to solve many of the
problems for the internet of everything
more information on all join can be
found at all join org so this is the
open source site there's a github
repository where you can go get access
to all the source that's linked to from
here there are you can down the SDKs for
all the various platforms you can get
access to the service frameworks which
are also the links to the source for
those are published there there are you
know video tutorials on how to get
started with the SDK there are a use
case examples sort of case studies of
how the various organizations have used
all joined to build lots of interesting
user experience experiences and and so
this is great resource for you for you
guys to to get started with it that's
all I have so we can maybe spend a
little bit of time on questions if you
guys have any
yeah I'm going to repeat the question
just because they're recording it so the
question is will Java ME embedded and
all join work together on the same
device so we haven't implemented the the
bindings and the port of Jaffa all join
to Java ME embedded depending upon the
platform that it's running on you know
the that it that may be an easy task
it's not something that that we've done
a lot of what will work with yet but
it's something that we've have been have
been looking at and talking to Oracle
about so it is something that is on the
horizon
yeah so the question is on the for the
all join thin client what is the what is
the hardware what's a footprint of
hardware is needed to support it and
what kind of hardware so we're we're
working on it so it's around 30
kilobytes of for the all joined thin
client to run and then if you layer on
the services on top of that that may add
10 20 k depending upon the services so
it's under 50 kilobytes total for
embedded the you know we're running in a
bunch of different microcontrollers
today different different you know
operating systems embedded operating
systems but I don't have any any
specifics I can share on on the more you
know there's there's definitely a
evolution of fast evolution moving to
Linux so embedded embedded linux on many
of these devices so you know we we do
run on embedded Linux today as well so
depending on the class of device I mean
that's that's going to be the standard
client which is between four and six
hundred K depending upon how its
configured so there's some stuff that
can be included or not included so you
know even the standard client is
relatively relatively small yes
okay it's a great question yeah so how
do we see the role of a central server
vs contrast that with how device is
communicating directly with one another
so I think the server is going to be in
most architectures like I said we don't
think the cloud is going away we think
that that devices will just be will
choose what they perhaps have the
ability to choose more judicious
judiciously about what they expose to
the cloud and only use the cloud when
they need to to communicate with it so I
think a server is important in most
architectures and we certainly will see
manufacturers who choose to build their
own vertical solutions because they want
to do analytics they want to do you know
they want to enable the ability for you
to control your devices when you're
outside of the proximal environment so
part of what we've done with this
gateway you know looking at this gateway
architecture and that's a new service by
the way that will be coming as a sort of
a gateway agent that will allow you to
as if you have a server to extend your
you're all join proximal devices out to
the cloud or the server using the
Gateway in a secure in sort of safe
manner from a privacy perspective and
that will allow you to to build
applications that essentially discover
and communicate with the alternate
applications is if you were proximal to
them so think the server is the or the
cloud isn't extremely important in in
this we we do when we talk to
manufacturers and app developers that
sort of thing they think about you know
obviously they want to be sending lots
of data the cloud they want to be
interacting through the cloud but also
there are certain use cases that are
where latency is important so if I'm
streaming audio or if I want to
communicate you know if I open up a door
and the door sensor needs to play a
chime on the whole home audio system for
example I need that time to happen
instantly I can't have that be a 500
millisecond or a second delay the time
it would take maybe to go to the cloud
the sensor to communicate to the cloud
and then the cloud to tell the home home
audio to stream the audio perhaps to
those those speakers or I want to turn
light bulbs on let's say I want to you
know enable the lighting to come on when
I when I when I
example might be at my freely my
refrigerator door open and I want to
strobe the lighting in the house just to
let me know that there's a refrigerator
doors left open silly use case but if I
wanted to do that you know I want that
too you know interactivity to happen
perhaps with low latency right I want to
know right away that that's happened so
so there's not there oh there are
instances where you know we wear the
cloud is definitely important to
communicate with and their interest is
where perhaps we don't you know we may
just not want to send the data to the
cloud because for privacy or security
reasons I may not I talked about surface
area of sort of at area of I'm exposing
to like a bad actor to be able to attack
devices in my home or the issues that
have happened recently where webcams
have been hijacked and that sort of
thing the more I expose the cloud if I
don't do that in the security secure
manner i'm creating this opportunity for
you know increasingly more personal
information and data about me to be
available to to whomever is you know
going to access that attack attack those
services and things in my home things
like my door locks or my security system
or you know either you could start to
imagine the kinds of things that you're
that you're connected home or you're
connected environment in your enterprise
or your car they are going to start to
learn about you and know about you and
do you really want that information to
that that information to be exposed from
a privacy perspective and so all join
gives you gives you the ability to
connect that to the cloud but it also
gives you the ability to sort of keep it
proximal if you wish it was it was there
a question over here as well or is it
okay okay yes sir
yeah yeah yeah so that core the the all
join core the the thin client or the
standard client they discover in a
little bit different way so start with a
standard client so the standard client
it's a message bus architecture so these
days applications use multicast DNS to
advertise their services and then you
know you can other devices within the
proximal network can discover those
services there's service discovery layer
that happens there once the services are
discovered then you can set up a a
session with those devices either a
multi-point I want a single point
session or a multi-point session so you
can communicate sort of one to one or
one too many with those devices so you
know if I want to if I wanted to use
that example of notifications earlier
where notifications would say the the
coffee is ready and I want to tell every
display in the house to display a
message saying the coffee's ready that
kind of a use case is a multi-point so
the basically the coffeepot advertises
through that notification service that I
am I've got I've got a message sort of
think of it like an SMS with maybe a an
image attached to it in an action in the
action might be turn the coffee pot off
or something I can send that out to any
any device that's listening those
devices that listen can then capture
that and display it in a sort of
decentralized way it's and so it's a
service discovery model where the
services advertise themselves the
applications that sit on top of the
services can can get callbacks that
there's a service there or that there's
a message there waiting for them they
then process that message and do
whatever the act is that they're looking
to do let me just add one other points
so that with the thin client the thin
client part of all join I'll join also
handles message routing so so when a
message goes out the standard client
actually figures out how to route it and
it'll route it over the
different bearers so I might write it
out at over wireline I might write it
over Wi-Fi and with IP or I might let's
say there's a Bluetooth connection and
Bluetooth has a different protocol for
routing so all join sort of abstracts
the developer have from having to think
about the physical layer so in the case
of the thin client the thin clients
actually too small to maintain routing
tables and do this complex routing so
what happens with a thin client is the
thin client when it comes up it it looks
for a standard client on the network
that standard client could be the depart
phone it could be a gateway in the home
like a cable gate modem gateway or it
could be at a pc or television it finds
a standard client somewhere and then it
exposes its capabilities and uses the
routing capabilities that standard
client to be able to just do service
discovery find it so the application
talking to the thin client doesn't know
that it's a thin client it looks like a
standard client because it's interfaces
are exposed in a way that that is sort
of standard client compliant but but
it's actually a real low memory memory
footprint devices now we think that the
thin client is going to Moore's law is
going to kill the thin client over time
it's it's a transitional thing as we're
in bed embedded right now but when we
get to you know certainly to Linux
running on on more more embedded devices
or other embedded operating systems
running on these devices then we'll be
able to we'll be able to put a the
standard client in there and have the
full routing node be in place
one standard client that standard client
could be the controlling device so it
could be if I've got a knife on iOS
device and I want to control I want to
control the light bulb the light bulb
can expose its control panel interface
for here are the controls here the
widgets I need to map back to an iOS to
be able to control me and and so that
that we bundle your app controlling
device application with the standard
client and deliver it through the iOS
App Store so it'll be a standard client
so when I launched the control or to
launch the light bulb now the thin
client finds it and can communicate
through it and it can communicate
through it to talk to the light bulb or
it can communicate through it to talk to
other things that may we need to
communicate to the light bulb yeah
right so they're hot there hasn't been
to date so we we what we did what we've
done with notifications hasn't needed
that control panel again you know I'm
discovering interfaces I'm not and those
interfaces are being the capabilities as
interfaces are being kind of dynamically
consumed at runtime so I don't need to
know necessarily that I'm controlling
temperature on a coffee pot or I'm
controlling temperature on a thermostat
or I'm controlling temperature on a wine
refrigerator I just need to know I'm
controlling temperature and render
temperature now I will know because
they're in all join there's an ability
to query the there's an interface called
about and the about interface sort of
tells me what the what the device is
there's also another basic interface
called config which allow you to set
sort of parameters that you want to
store within the devices and
manufacturer and so it build time they
would you know set these configure
parameters up those config parameters we
queryable will be about so i can find
out what kind of device like to make and
the model of the device but what we
tried to avoid is kind of taking the
zigbee approach of here's here's what a
classification of lighting looks like
today and here's a taxonomy or really
the relationship between those that
those devices in a profile because we
think that that ultimately that's
changing its the vault it's constantly
evolving and being having sort of this
rigid structure is is more difficult now
that said for m2m to work using all join
we're certainly doing quite a bit of m2m
today with things like notifications
control panel is more of a person to
machine type user experience for
machine-to-machine to work very well we
think there will be an evolution of of
these sort of service frameworks beyond
notifications control to include other
service frameworks for different
categories of device or types of user
experiences whether that'll have to
evolve to like a full semantics you know
profile type ability is is is TBD I mean
we're really trying to avoid that or let
what we're really looking how can we
certainly could build a custom you know
service framework
and it's you know you could even be open
for your device this is how you
communicate with my device but that
requires sort of both devices to
understand the semantics on both ends
which makes it which makes it more
challenging to do this sort of discover
things on the fly that I've never seen
before you know if I'm in a room here I
think you know this thing is not on the
Internet of Things yet it hasn't got
heartless yet but um but if I should be
able to and you know probably four or
five years you discover all the wireless
to communicate the speaker's wirelessly
communicate maybe I run this
presentation from my phone and you know
I use the microphones wireless and my I
can just discover that there's a
microphone here there's pc here there's
these speakers here other sensors in the
room that i want to interact with our
control that should all happen
dynamically and and so we don't know the
environment that you're going to be in
so it's really hard to sort of baked in
the profile that you're going to need to
connect to everything around you so it's
a it's definitely there's evolutionary
thinking things so we're we've been
spending a lot of time over the last
couple years thinking about that problem
and and where you know we take it
because all joint is open we are also we
also have an alliance that is being you
know formed in the process being formed
around it that will be driving a lot of
those things so well it's not just
Qualcomm that is is driving you know the
shaping the future of all join it's all
the companies that will contribute to it
yes sir
we haven't announced any devices yet
there are some devices out that they
haven't been announced um I think you'll
see devices announced at CES timeframe
so a few months see the first generation
of them it takes a little bit of time
for you know obviously for the pipeline
of devices to get out there when device
manufacturers typically think especially
for embedded well you look at the white
good space they think it may be a year
in advance what a minute and then they
have cycles on which they get technology
out so well we're what we're doing can
innovate really rapidly and very quick
and you can bring these stuff you can
embed you get all join up and running
and get these services running and get
your devices interoperability and are
operating with other devices really
rapidly just the process of getting it
to market can sometimes take like you
know six to twelve months depending on
where you are in the cycle sir yeah
certainly we've looked at that as well
so you know there's a standard in
there's a standard in japan called echo
net light and it's a machine to machine
standard for you know really focused on
you know conserving conserving elected
energy and that sort of thing so it's a
standard around its enabling consumer
electronics devices also lots of devices
in the in the home and it's it's own
protocol it's it's own starter so
standard way of communicating with
things so we've spent a lot of time
thinking about how do we interact with
with you know an island of devices that
are perhaps are not all joined whether
it's you know we're unless those
protocols typically what we'll find is
that you know some of these protocols
are if you look at like back net or
something that is this protocol that's
been around forever for industrial
automation in in buildings and that sort
of thing these protocols are not there
they're they're very they're sort of
byte protocols that are very difficult
to understand they're not you know
mapping them is not necessarily
something that will allow you to
maintain
some of the fundamentals of all join
what all join can provide in terms of
service discovery and on-the-fly control
and that sort of thing so so we looked
at it but it's just something that is
you know we would probably see the you
know groups like the Alliance taking on
if there are interoperability things
that need to potentially happen yes sir
yeah the question is could we enable an
app like an app store or something where
where we could in it download it
application onto the all joined device
so when you think of all join all joint
is uh it's it's software that goes
inside an application at the application
layer so it's not a platform necessity
you're not running apps on top of all
join like it like you would on a
traditional operating system so it's
really sort of connectivity glue that
you insert inside an application so we
would leave the app stores up to the
embedded operating system so you know be
it or run time whatever runtime you
happen to be running like you know if
you're running if you're running unity
or you're running java we would leave it
up to those platforms to sort of figure
out how to get all joined to those
devices through the application like
today with iOS and with Android and with
Windows 8 or Windows RT we use those app
stores that are in those existing
platforms to deliver sort of the client
side of the all join the the experience
that goes in the tablet or the
smartphone or what have you we're not
you know same with you know in wearables
and that sort of thing we wouldn't we
wouldn't look to try and be the delivery
mechanism for the for the app we would
look to basically put our stuff in the
all joint stuff inside your application
and have your application go through
whatever mechanism exists today to
deliver content
Yeah right right that's a great question
yeah so the question is are there
simulation frameworks available to
simulate your app communicating with
devices that you may not have so there
are in the SDKs like if you look at if
you take a look at the notification SDK
their sample sample code in there that
can allow you to create there's a
notification producer and there's a
notification consumer the consumer is
sort of the thing that that listens for
notifications and can display them and
so there's sample applications to
basically build a producer and consumer
in your simulation environment so you
can send and receive notifications you
know to yourself in your own development
environment before you start
communicating with devices that are
going to be coming in the market you
know let's say first quarter next year
yeah the question is is the space
crowded and are there are lots of people
doing this kind of thing so there are
there are lots it is you know there are
lots of people building what's solid a
protocol for the Internet of Things
there's another same TGT that's out
there there's there's co-op the ITF
there's folks it like Technicolor who
are doing some interesting things here
there's a legacy protocols like our ways
of doing some of this kind of thing like
DLNA and and then you have you know
technologies like like 6lowpan running
over 80 to 15 for where you've got you
know zigbee and z-wave like capabilities
in a more open manner running on IP so
there's lots of different ways that
things are these kinds of things been
done typically they're being done with
like if in the case of them QT or co-op
it's um it's definitely a medium
intermediating everything through cloud
or something outside of the proximal
network and there's no real notion of
local service discovery or certain
discovery of things that are within my
immediate environment so so different
you know things like DLNA have service
discovery but they're more focused on
very specific use very narrow use cases
like I want to stream audio to one
device or I want to I want to stream a
picture to one device and we're doing a
lot with all joining with with media we
have that audio service i talked about
we're going to be evolving that audio
surface is available it's open source
today it allows you to you know stream
stream audio to to various devices
within audio alljoyn speaking devices
within within proximity I'll join audio
speaking devices so so there's lots of
things out there there's not really
anything at solving the problem in the
same way that we're solving I would say
there but there are other ways to solve
this problem lots of them more cloud
centric any other questions
great well thank you for your time today
really appreciate the discussion thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
