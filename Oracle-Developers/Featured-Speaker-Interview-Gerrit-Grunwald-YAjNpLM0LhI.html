one and i'm here today with garrett
gerloff who is among many things a
featured speaker and this year's javaone
conference a javafx expert a Java user
group leader and he runs a fantastic
blog which I'll link to in the
description here at the keep joining me
the morning for me yes as it even with
me so Garrett what you up to these days
but these days fortunately i'm working a
lot with javafx so it didn't look like
the last year's that it would take off
but after new we we really have a lot of
projects where we have javafx as the
main UI technology which is for me great
because i love it so most of the times
i'm really just working with creating
user interfaces or pimping user
interfaces when people switch from old
swing applications in javafx yes i'm
curious what drew you to java facts in
the first place so to be honest i wasn't
a really big fan of javafx in the
beginning and because i didn't like the
first approach and then a java 1 2011 i
think Jonathan Giles from Vince me that
I should give it a try and I thought ok
so I gave it a try directly after drama
1 at the airport and after that moment I
was totally into it so it's just you
come from swing and even other languages
then this is really a nice UI framework
or UI toolkit I should say so it's it's
so much easier to do nice-looking you I
syndrome affects them in swing more even
if you know Android it's not bad but
it's nothing compared to javafx and iOS
I tried but this is really they had nice
api's but the language is it's terrible
well if someone were to make that switch
over from say swing where would you
recommend they start that's a good
question because what we see is that
people make in the main
time it seems that on the web to find a
lot a lot of information so stack
overflow and these things so people
looks like they just start with whatever
so and this is the best thing you can do
you do if you have an idea just try to
use Java X to realize that and then you
will you would have questions definitely
but but you will find a lot of
information on the web in the meantime
so there's no really a good starting
point because it's you can use different
technologies within javafx like you can
coat everything you can use F XML which
is totally different approach and so
it's hard to say but i would say what a
good starting point is the Oracle
tutorials they are a little bit all
these days but they are still good now
on the Oregon CHP where you will find a
lot of basic stuff and you can follow
how they build a simple application so i
think that's the best starting point
should be the door referred for it okay
yeah i know uh languages like HTML 5
others are popular these days to use any
of these when you're building something
yeah i also use html5 and javascript in
canvas to do graphic stuff and I mean
it's attracting that you can write
yourself in html5 with javascript and
then you can use it on your phone and
that well and your wii u are on sony
playstation or what everything that
wants html5 but i am just not a big fan
of of JavaScript so it it's sometimes
I'm a little bit afraid what you can do
with it and it's blazingly fast these
days but I still think it's not the
right approach for everything so I'm I
believe in desktop applications still
well how do I else how do you manage
when to use languages other than Java
bags um yeah for example if there is no
other chance I also do start with our
meals and and IOT related things where
you mainly end up with see
which is fine it's a fun these devices I
don't need travel because I run most of
the times small amounts of code and then
see it's totally fine then when we go to
to Java then we we mainly talked about
big applications and that means it's a
huge code base and you have to have a
well-defined structure and this is easy
to do in Java and it's not to do in
javascript so this is the if I do little
towards then I also use JavaScript what
I prefer drama for most of the stuff
that I'm doing if I have the chance to
use it then never use it I love it yeah
so if you can speak to your process on
some of these bigger projects like let's
say you're doing a cross-platform deal
how do you start and what tools you use
a long way if I will cross platform
applications you mind you mean your UI
wise if i knew i was now that depends on
a little bit on the customer so in the
form of days you had a lot of customers
that would like to have the nature to
look and feel it was couple of years ago
that mostly discussion so Mac users
would like to have vacations look like
Mac Windows users would like to have it
look like Windows but in the meantime my
impressionist that changed a little bit
so it today it's totally fine if your
application looks different from the
native platform look and feel so this is
not the big point anymore and the former
times that was always a discussion
because then if you have makings us then
everything should not only look like but
also behave like on the net on the mac
which is not always easy and on windows
it should be windows and that kind of
stuff and that involves more thinking up
front how to build the UI because it
could be different on windows and on
deck
these days for example in the project
one moment it's that was there was no
discussion about that at all so that
means to just build the application and
it runs on Windows and on Mac because I
develop on Mac and the customers working
on windows so that was not me this in
principle there is no problem if you
create stuff for cross-platform if we
talk about desktop right you can also
run Java effects on mobile but this is a
different story okay so let's say that I
were to divide by our studio desktop and
nothing I do have a conservative guitar
or dr. sort of dive in the same
temperature but if you have this up in
Mobile oh and you can use if you use the
glue on stuff from you on HQ they did
the mobile support or javafx and so with
this you can do the desktop app and the
mobile app with one code base so that
means you don't have to you don't have
to have two projects it's not mean if
you can really build one application and
it can have a different look on on
desktop and on the mobile device so you
can define it in this one project you
can even define it for each platform if
you decide on Android it should look a
little bit different than our highways
you can also do that but you share most
of the let's say business logic of your
application is the same just the UI
these different could be different it's
not really needed but I think everybody
will agree that on the desktop and on a
mobile device the application has to
look different and so that means you
have to be good anyway a special UI for
more by no means but then you can focus
on just the UI is different and all the
rest is the same which makes developing
much faster and easier because you can
share and we use a lot of phone okay and
you have it maybe program you sketch
things out in or something that you
start with just basic you're hungry yeah
so yeah my maybe my approach is not that
common but erm
I like to do graphics so I also like to
do vector graphics and drawing so and I
know joint programs and this is the
typical approach that I so before I
start creating a control I draw it
completely and then when I have to
drawing ready and it looks like the
control that I would like to build then
I convert the drawing to cope that's my
approach which works quite good the
biggest problem is that develop has a
little bit afraid of drawing because
they always say I'm not an artist I
can't do that and but this is like
drawing with numbers and this is exactly
what every developer can do so it's not
that hard and I also give sessions about
that how to how to do that how to use
that approach and it works out so people
go to their controls by using a drawing
program first which is that's the only
way to go if you would like to create
really nice performance you have to draw
it first to see the resultant usually
program asli they start but I and always
say it's designed by keyboard so they
start coding and then they say okay
let's take this color for that in this
format and then they compile run take a
look I looks Agni then again cold and it
that really takes long if you take a
drawing program then you draw everything
really just the visuals and if you are
satisfied then you take the drawing and
put it into pool which is much easier so
that saves a lot of fun well and this is
the powerful question so I'm sorry to
have to ask but where do you think the
future of this annoying of javafx of
jonathan is so that's a good one you
know if you ask that the summer guys and
what guys then they say it's the head
right it's that already but like I said
we have a lot of projects running a non
job FX and I think it has a market it
might not be the biggest one like for
all desktop applications but I think
it's still very feeling to use job FX
because you can do
let's say twenty first century you is
based on Java running on the desktop
cross-platform so I think if it comes to
desktop applications cross-platform then
this is the only really good solution at
the moment there's the dotnet platform
and they claim to be cross-platform but
I tried it and it's not really you can't
really use it on windows it's fine but
if you ever tried mono on linux and you
know what i'm talking puppets it's
terrible so i think it and i hope it
will take off so it's it's just great
technology demise that's it is there any
way that a community members can get
involved and now you have some of those
KFX project changed all of that yeah
there's some destitute Jeff extras
project and there's which is which is
nice because it has gives you the
ability to to create your own controls
learn from from as I I've also put some
hope in there and there are other people
put a lot of hope in grave extras and
that's interesting because you also see
different approaches if you build
controls this is mainly all about
controls right the lip Express project
and then there's controls FX which is
also both in the same direction it's
also controls related project and there
are a lot of blocks you can check so
there's so much stuff out there at the
moment so it's really not that hard to
get involved and to start with java
games so it was harder a couple of years
ago but today you find a lot of things
and of course my blog also of course
you're going to war and your java one
session yes sure well thank you so much
for joining me I pretty my only will see
you at javaone absolutely thank you I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
