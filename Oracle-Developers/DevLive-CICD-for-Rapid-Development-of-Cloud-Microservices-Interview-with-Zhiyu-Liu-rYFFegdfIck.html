host Javed Muhammad with OTN and I have

but oh and I just want to say welcome
the you're a senior consultant
yeah self consultant with article yeah

little overview about your presentation

will show our past products to our
Chinese developers and letting me know
how easily can use it is our past for us
to do scarcity and and then I will to
live in demo wisdom and to to to do
explanation detail okay okay yes and
what are some of the challenges with
deploying CI CD so yeah yeah so
understated you'll notice is how to
topical and I just solve DevOps and yeah
yeah yeah hold up is a co pointer for
their work so I think the challenge is
how to offender the writer / - how to
the red to find the red solutions to -
simple and simple if I and is easier to
implement the CI CT so I think that this
is a full opportunity to show our
products with our customer and the
science can do you think ease of use is
something which is very important in
having some of these tools so can you
mention what Oracle offers
to the customer base in terms of CIT D
offerings like what kind of cloud
services this article author that which
developers can you--can can use and I
think the Oracle over the the first tag
of developer philosophy with our
developers and I think that the
developer cloud service and application
canonical of service and container
collado service and I think we make also
a lot of for pronouncing developer can
use so developer cloud service
application cloud services contain a
cloud service okay
and if customers want to try out some of
these services what's the best way for
them to go about doing that customer can
go to our office or web site and the
question request fell so off and we whip
off providers $300 experience for them
for free so we provided $300 credit
director so can you mention the name of
the URL the where they have to go I
think the past year thought pasta
oracle.com okay all right okay all right
how's the event going so far Beijing
yeah I think is a very very successful
and a very exciting event and in the
morning I also attended some
coordination and our customers are very
interesting with our products they have
lots of questions and we also we also
answer lots of questions water tea
customer our University it so isolation
success for you and yes I think I heard

people over here yeah a lot of people
and we're very excited to for this to be
a successful event yeah I believe in
that next next next to the Oracle human
that maybe next year I think it'll how
more people more people yeah yeah yeah I
