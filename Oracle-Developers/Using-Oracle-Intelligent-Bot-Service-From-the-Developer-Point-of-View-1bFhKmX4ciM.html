me here I also thank the Oracle aids
program and the developer champion
program which are two advocacy programs
that I'm going to talk about later on
but thank thank them for bringing me
here I work for SNP solutions in Mexico
is a consulting firm for modern
technology development or new wave
development if you will which includes
chatbots which is what we are going to
be talking in the next 50 minutes I also
run the Oracle user group in Mexico or
Amex I also I am thankful with them to
to allowing me to represent them here
and in the slide you are going to find
my twitter handler my blog website my
linkedin profile and my e-mail address
if you want to connect with me those are
the right channels to do it if you want
to send me an email or asking me about
this session or anything else just feel
free to do it and those are the right
channels to to do so this is the agenda
form for today's session we are going to
be talking about chatbots but from the
development developer perspective that's
my objective but before getting into the
code which I know you are eager to do
that and we are in Oracle codes of the
expectations of having line after line
of code is are very high and we are
going to get into that but before doing
that I really would like you to get into
the context about what is happening with
chatbots and why they are so appealing
to users and why users are feeling
comfortable to use a chat board and and
and what is the relevance of that after
we get into that which is gonna take me
like 20 minutes or so
then we are going to move into the
Oracle intelligent but which is part of
the Oracle mobile cloud services
offering from Oracle and I am going to
show you how to create a conversational
flow okay and for that regard we are
going to be using both ml which is the
way that we write the conversational
flow and I am just going to be focusing
on that we are not going to see anything
else but about ml thing which is like
kind of what the developer is going to
be feeling more comfortable
using it right so that's what we're
going to do before getting into that as
I already mentioned I come from Mexico
and believe me and hopefully you don't
call me a crazy person but we are we
have similar culture cultures if you
have never been in Mexico then this is
going to be something good for you
because first of all we share the the
same latitude we are in the same
latitude okay but exactly the same one
we share the the Tropic of Cancer to be
more specific
this thing right here this is a very
common meal in Mexico maybe you know
what it is who tell me what is that
tacos right
this is tacos and unfortunately the
resolution of the screen has not allowed
me to show you this but this is this is
you this is a common meal here and I
already try it in in the in launched a
few minutes ago so those are very
similar things also in Mexico we were
conquered by the Spaniards or by the
Spanish people and you were conquered by
the by the Britons
so those are two European nations and
and it kind of was the the similar thing
and the other thing is this this this
thing is this is in Belarus Mexico this
is a pyramid which is the the pyramid of
all those niches so la pila me develop
natures in Veracruz as I told you and
the other the other structure is
something here in India and they look
similar really they do look similar so I
hope these similarities can allow me to
to get your attention during the
upcoming 40-minute and I know I can get
in and engage with you with with our
topic so we are almost ready to go with
the presentation again this is your a
college program and the developer
champion program these are two oracle
advocacy programs that that Oracle has
it is globally
if you want to join the programs it is
you are you're free to do it you just go
to Oracle comm or go to google.com and
look for it and you can submit your your
summary and maybe you can you can get
part of the of the programs in a
specific the developer champion is focus
on developer obviously and this type of
events really helped us to get engaged
with a local developer community which
is our main objective and we are not
here just to show you code and that's it
now what we want to do is to make you
feel that this technology is good for
you for what you do and that you can
create applications with Oracle
technology that's our objective so the
fact that we are here people from all
over the world giving you this
presentation is because we want to get
engage with you we want to talk with you
with a local developer community that's
that's the main idea and again if you
want to be part of it just just google
it and and you will see how are the
requirements to be part of the program
so that's it let's let's move on so this
is the first slide of my presentation
and this is about digital transformation
has stolen my voice okay that's the idea
of Jesus life and you may be wondering
why well why is this guy saying that
digital transformation digital
transformation is told his voice well
this is part of my content of digital
transformation that I've been presenting
for the last two years now I think or so
and I am saying that because of two
reasons the first reason is because we
are living on an IT era where the
developer has at the reach of his
fingers or her fingers the ability or
the probability to change how we live in
the world globally and you may be
thinking well this is this is getting
very romantic and we have just five
minutes from the start of the session
but that is true just imagine if you
create a mobile application which has
the potential to be used for all over
the world so you are changing the way
all the people in the world is living so
that is true that is one thing the
second thing
is that as I already told you I came
from Mexico I took a flight on Saturday
night and I get to Bangalore yesterday
night so it took me like like one day
and I have to be here more in order to
be here I took an uber from my house to
the airport then I'm a check-in using my
mobile application with Aeromexico and
then I used the web application of the
hotel to make the chicken and and that's
it I did that without having the need to
speak with someone that is why I'm
saying that the digital transformation
has stolen my voice but far from
acknowledging that I do not speak French
because I made a stop in in in Paris I
also don't speak Indy I do a speak
English I do I speak Portuguese I do I
speak Spanish obviously and I am
learning Japanese so I speak four
languages but but far from acknowledging
that I do not speak French nor indeed
even if I know those languages I didn't
have the need to use them to make those
tasks right but I am coming very far
from here we have we do have some
similarities as I already mentioned but
it is very far from here Mexico is it is
at the other side of the world so the
fact to be here without the need of
having contact with someone speaking
speaking wise it is something to
highlight okay but let's move on from
that maybe you are saying well so what
we are in Oracle code and we want the
code so so what if the boys' is not
there well it happens that it does
matter because it has been given to the
robots so instead of having a
conversation with someone to call a
local cab and take me from my house to
the airport I use uber with my mobile
application instead of getting into a
counter to make the check-in in
Aeromexico I use the mobile application
instead of getting into the JW Marriott
here in Bangalore for making the
check-in I did it via the mobile
application so I am NOT talking with
someone I am talking with something
right
and I did it in the with a mobile
application and with the web application
but if I if I just take a minute and
think about it I could have done it
using Siri here in my iPhone or using
Alexa with Amazon right and then I'm
speaking and then you will be saying
well your voice has been a stolen yes or
no but the fact is yes but but in the
other hand I can still do those things
speaking wisely but with something not
with Apple not with a person but with
something okay
but this is not new I mean this is not
new at all please don't don't jump up
out of the wagon or don't jump the gun
this is not new at all this this has his
years we are very obsessed on trying to
imagine a world managed and controlled
by robots many movies has been talking
about it for many years I do it
constantly using Alexa for example I do
it constantly using Siri for example or
if you will how many of you play with
Tamagotchis no one really do you don't
know what is a tamagotchi no well that
that was my bad I I needed to make a
better research about well how was the
toys here in 20 years ago but now my
watch is was something was something
very popular was something from Japan
but was something very popular like 20
years ago and that was that thing that
that little leg had the right of the
screen and you will you was playing with
that you were playing with that and
eating or feeding that a small animal
within the within the device but let's
forget about it but what we are used to
it is talking with with recording for
example every time you call to your
telco company or to your airline or to a
bank what do you do you are speaking
with a recorder which is an idea so
that's been for years that that's not
new so again what is all that stuff if
we are here talking about chat BOTS well
chat BOTS the word chat bot has bought
in its
right so we are talking about robots
again but the relevance is this this is
the relevant thing about all the session
okay so how many of you please please
raise your hands how many of you have a
device or a mobile device with as many
application as this one don't be shy
just just raise your hand okay so most
of you have a similar device and this
one and I am not judging if you want to
use or you you have a lot of
applications or you have a few
application that's not the judgment I I
am NOT here for that but what does
matter is how how you use those
applications I mean if you want to do a
very simple thing if you want to cut and
paste maybe a text from an application
to another one how do you do it you move
from one application to another one
right in my case when I came from Mexico
to hit two from Mexico to here I used
three applications I move from one
application to another one right which
is okay it is not hard to do that but it
that is not natural okay remember
technology since they zeroes in day
since day one
technology is targeted to be used
naturally that's the intentional that's
the intention of technology to use it
naturally okay well the fact you have a
lot of application that is not natural
okay that's one thing the second thing
is that the IT nowadays is looking to
simplify the UI okay every time that we
use a UI we are trying to use a
simplified UI not only the webview is or
the mobile UI is about any type of UI
ATMs
a smart TVs we are looking to have a
simplified UI oracle has invested on
that for years and if you take a look to
their applications now they have a
better UI a simplified or a simpler UI
so that is true we are looking to have a
UI and everything has a UI as I
mentioned I took a stop in Paris two
days ago and I stay in and
tell by the name citizen name or
something like I think it was citizen
him and this picture right here and they
were not at the bottom of the slide it
is actually the iPad which is inside the
room so when I get into the room the
first thing that I saw was a manual it
was a real Manor we say it was a user
manual how to use this room so I was
like oh my goodness who so I need to
read a manual to sleep in the room and
the answer is yes because you had to do
everything with the iPad in order to
turn the lights off I needed to use the
iPads right I had to read the manual
okay but this is what really matters I
mean this is what we are here and this
is what I would like you to highlight so
this is my trip from Mexico to to
Bangalore okay I use uber I use the JW
Marriott application and I use the web
application from Mara Mexico and from
Air France who made the check-in and to
move between my house the airport the
airport hotel Hotel Airport and so on
okay but just please think about it
wouldn't have been better just to have
something just one UI and say tomorrow I
want an over at 4 a.m. in the morning
then play please make the check into
Aeromexico reservation code is 1 2 3 and
at the evening try to make a web check
in to the JW Marriott in Paris and the
day after tomorrow to try to make the
same thing in the JW Marriott in
Bangalore wouldn't that be better
do you think that is possible so this
will be even easier right just one
single UI where I can type this and
that's it
I don't want you to make you read
because that's not the intention but
what did you identified on this as light
someone who can answer me this was that
one is instruction that's correct
another thing one is text that's correct
information yes but what about context I
am saying I want a newer at 4:00 a.m. I
am NOT saying I am I want an uber in I
am Rolando Carrasco in my user is our
Carrasco at SP solution calm no I am
saying I want how do this you I know
that I this I is Rolando because of the
context every time that we have a
conversation with someone is about
context okay
I was sitting back there before the
session and someone of you just approach
to me and say eh you took a picture of
my back but he didn't say nothing but
you took a picture of my back and you
twit about it here in Twitter because
the context already told me everything I
was here in the event he was here in the
event I was using Twitter in Oracle code
so the photo of his back is where in
Twitter in Oracle code that is context
we didn't have to do something extra it
was just about context and our
conversations are about context or who
can raise his hand or her hand and and
tell me the following how many times
with your wife or with your husband you
need to introduce yourself and
authenticate yourself hey I am Rolando
Carrasco every time that you see your
wife know she already knows who I am and
I already know who she is or or if not
then there is a different story but but
the fact is that we know we know each
other we know about the context and and
and that's the power of this I just need
to say I want an
that's it who is I it is Rolando
Carrasco I am going to book an uber for
Orlando Carrasco there are other things
that are not part of the context because
I need to tell what it is the
reservation code for example no one
knows about the reservation code both me
and the airline so this is something
extra this is a third element on this
equation then I need to say it right
what I'm trying to say is that context
is relevant and that is the important
thing on a conversational UI that's the
relevant thing here okay we've been
moving and the evolution of the UI is
this we I have 38 years now maybe I
don't look that older but what I have 38
and I think I am part of the Generation
X okay so the generation the Generation
X is very familiar with all those new
eyes keyboard mouse mobile devices text
messages voice messages right but what
about Millennials Millennials are very
different
Millennials his voice in text all day
long they are texting Facebook Messenger
whatsapp telegram or you will boys
messages personally I don't like both
messages if you want to contact me via
whatsapp I don't like both messages
I like testing but that's me but the new
people the Millennials were the new
professionals they are very into the
voice messages and that is the evolution
of the of the UI okay that is the
relevance of the UI okay so let's let
let me give you two two definitions and
then we are going to jump into the code
the first one is a conversation our UI
gives a privilege of interacting with a
computer on human terms okay more than
highlighting that how cool is that I
mean how cool is to interact with a
computer on your own terms when your own
terms is whatever you do if you speak
English then that's your own term I
speak Spanish that's my
turn okay I am not engaged with
something it is my own turn but far from
highlighting that but I'm trying what I
am trying to highlight is on your own
terms mean that you don't mean you don't
need to think about it you don't need to
decipher something it is your own terms
okay so you we're building a
conversation on you I is because we
don't want the user to think okay we
don't want the user thing okay how many
of you have read this book that don't
baby think anyone try to google that
don't make me think that's the name of
the book it has a lot of years it
started when when the web or the dot-com
started so the relevancy is that if you
don't want the user think it is because
there is a lot of context within it
if there is no context then this is
going to happen take a look to the
picture every time that you are in front
of a web UI or any UI you need to think
about it maybe a couple of seconds maybe
more if it is very bad deployed if it is
not well designed then you are going to
take a lot of seconds to decipher how to
do it how many of us struggle using a
smart TV I think most of you because the
Smart TV is I don't know why but the UI
of an a Smart TV is very poor okay so
you need to think how to how to use it
but that is the same thing with web UIs
and mobile UI so let's try to make it
happen let's no don't make the user
think that's that's the message okay so
we are here in Oracle code so we want to
see code right what I am trying to do is
to to share with you something that you
can first understand and once it is
understood then we can move into the
code okay so I think that the concept is
very well or it is very clear
now it is very relevant to use a
conversational UI because of the context
okay so if we are already into that if
we have already got the message then we
can move on into one more definition and
then we just go to the code so take a
look at this unfortunately the
resolution is not helping me but let's
just read the first sentence so it says
that many researchers believe that
conversational AI will soon be
developers first priority okay and this
is a serious research but why do you
think this is happening anyone we are
living in an a an IT era where we are
talking about autonomous vehicles we are
talking about autonomous databases we
are talking about autonomous call center
centers and I think we are talking about
everything that we can automate and part
of that automation is because of the
artificial intelligence right how do you
think we can train that artificial
intelligence using our own conversation
because that's the way we learn that is
why it is a first priority for
developers to understand how to create a
conversational UI that's the relevance
of this okay the relevance is not just
to deploy a chatbot and that's it no the
relevance is how to understand the
conversation our UI so that's it let's
just get into what a developer must know
about chat bot and then we are going to
do the demo I am just going to ask you
three things the first one is do you
think you need to change something
regarding develop in a conversational UI
or a chat bot the second question is
what would be the right programming
language to do it and the third question
is which platform do I need to use in
order to do that for the first question
my analysis is that you do need to
change something
why because you need to change your
point of view on how you deploy your UIs
now we are having a
processional UI that's the relevant okay
so that is different I don't need to
authenticate the user in the way that I
did because there there is going to be a
context around it so we need to change
that about programming languages I will
suggest you to start with Python with go
or with no J yes obviously Java is still
there but try those three and finally
about a platform try to engage with a
platform that is not tied to on a
specific channel okay try to use up a
chatbot platform which is not tied to
Facebook Messenger or to telegram or
even to whatsapp try to engage with
something generic just are just as
Oracle intelligent but because we don't
know what is gonna happen tomorrow
what we do know is that conversational
you guys are going to be there and
artificial artificial intelligence is
going to be there but the channels we
don't know maybe tomorrow there is
something new but we still have the AI
and we have we still have the
conversation on UI so so do that so what
do it then I mean what do we need to
study what do we need to learn as a
developer where do we need to focus on
if we are not able open and we are on a
chatbot project I think these are the
elements try to focus on backend
integration okay because the back end is
going always be there there is no way
that we get rid of backends how we need
to communicate and integrate with a
back-end so that's one thing second
thing is try to to be more aggressive
with your API design principles learn
how to design a good API and learn how
to engage with a good API and third try
to learn about conversational UI okay
let's go to the demo we are going to use
the oracle intelligent but how many of
you is familiar with the oracle
intelligent but i think there is a
workshop just right after this session i
i invite you to join the workshop if
this is your first time having a
conversation with oracle intelligent but
i am going to show you
of the basics and then I'm going to show
you the conversational flow how to
create a conversational flow so the demo
is about a financial but that's what I'm
going to do I want to create a personal
financial interface where I can query my
bank accounts
I can query my balance I can make
transfers between accounts and I can
keep track of my movements okay that's
what I'm going to do in order to that I
am going to to use the oracle
intelligent but interface okay so this
is the home page of the oracle
intelligent but okay
this is UI where a chatbot architect a
chart chat bot engineer or a chat bot
developer is going to to log in so we
are going to create our first chat would
so this is being dangled or code for
okay hopefully I don't get any issue
with the network the first thing I'm
going to do is to make an import of the
intents intents are the way that I can
tell to the chat but this is probably
what the user is going to be telling you
okay for example give me my balance well
how much money do I have in my American
Express how much money I have in my
savings account what did I did yesterday
with my checking account I want to make
a transfer to my mom I want to make a
transfer for to my babysitter I want to
make a transfer from my checking account
to the to the college or whatever and
those are the intense I am going to
first of all I'm going to import them
okay now your I already messed that up
because I sorry
okay the first thing I'm going to import
the intense so I don't need to type them
so I already have three categories of
intense the first one is balances and
the balance this is by is created by how
do I owe in my credit cards how much
money did I save last year or if I'm
taking a look to the same money in
tenses I would like to send whatever 20
USD for lunch or I would like to paste
my insurance or whatever or track
spending how much did I spend in Apple
last year how much did I spend as we can
and so on
those are my intense Tercel the way is
that the user may be related with my bot
with my childhood sorry now entities I
am going to create three entities
the first one is account type which has
three values savings and it has a
synonym which is safe then I checking
and I have checked assassin on and then
I have credit card and I have Amex Visa
and card okay alright then I'm going to
create a second entity which is the two
account which I am going to use it to
represent the dest the the destination
account when I am transferring money and
here I have mom the account of my mom
Manuel
which is my brother
the babysitter okay chase insurance and
that's it okay and now I'm going to
create the third entity which is the
track spending category so I spend on
gas groceries college what else
clothing electricity okay we are almost
there and then I just need to link my
intense with my entities
so the first entities is balances so
this is related with the account type
send money is with account type with two
account and with currency and track
spending is with track spending date and
duration okay
and that's it now we are ready to go to
the conversational flow okay whenever
you create a bot in the oracle
intelligent but interface you get these
code with this which is a conversational
flow this is going to represent how do
you how would you light you like the
users to engage with your butt and how
is the conversational flow of your
interface so let's take a look to the
code which is part of the of the demo
the first thing is I would use a header
which is these elements this is the name
of my bot then I just declare some
variables in this case
the sample barrels greeting and a name
and then we have the estates of the but
this default conversational flow is
about just to make you a salute if you
say hello this is going to reply hello
and your name and that's it okay so we
have a first component which is a list
which is the list of elements in this
case is a list of the salutations hello
Ola namaste namaste then we have once
you reply how do you want to be salute
it is going to prompt you what is your
name and then with your name and with
the salute this is going to salute you
and that's it okay so let's let's run
this first version of our flow okay so
if I say hello this list was compiled
with these options okay so if I say all
this is going to be asking my name okay
what is your name and I want to say
Roland okay okay very straightforward
now let's move into my my but in order
for that I already have here some some
pieces of code that I prepare beforehand
okay so this is the financial
conversational flow I am going to paste
it and then I'm going to analyze it the
first thing I'm going to do is to
validate it so once I validated this is
going to be showing me some errors and I
can see those errors here so it is
telling me that this element intent none
does not exist and it is also telling me
that the confident threshold should be
included within a specific section so
what I'm going to do is to fix all those
errors the first one is here so I am
going to type it correctly which is
unresolved intent and then the confident
threshold
okay let's see if that make it okay so
now I don't have error so now let's take
a look to the code so we have the
following that we have the header as I
already mentioned and then we have a
first component which is the system
intent the system intent is what the
user type so if the user is gonna type
give me my balance it is going to get
here okay once I get the intent I need
to identify what is my next station if
you will so my next station is what if
the user is asking for his balance I
need to ask him from which account so
this is the the start balances state if
I already type the type of account which
I want the balance then this is not
going to prompt me about the weight from
which I come in case I do not say from
which account this is going to prompt me
and is a nice conic and this is going to
get the values from my account type
which I just created few steps ago once
I choose my balance then I am going to
print the balance for your specific
account is whatever okay so now let's
run it so let's see what is going to
happen if I just type in balance let's
see what happens
this is unable to resolve the intent
which is the end of this code let's
let's take a look if it does not resolve
anything this is going to go right here
but why anyone know let's take a look to
the intent the intents are all these
okay so if I do it again let's see what
happens if I type balance this is
resolving my intent of balances so we
actually made a hit but take a look to
the percentage it is just 15% if we get
back to the conversational flow I have
this confident threshold of 0.4 so point
our 50
is below point 4 so if I just do it
point one and retrain this thing and
reset it and now I type balanced okay
now he's telling me for which I come do
you want your balance so you got the
idea so the intent was balanced then it
apply a confident threshold a very low
one it identified that I'm talking about
my balance and now he's asking me from
which account from which account savings
okay
and now the balance is for savings and
now let's get into the conversational UI
I can do something like this
I want my balance on my visa
what is visa so the balance for credit
card is 500 okay I want balance on my
checking okay I didn't need to configure
like I specifically the user is going to
ask for his American Express or for his
visa no this is just the context i own a
credit card and I tell the credit card
Amex so the context is Amex is a credit
card so so this is the first try about
configuring the conversational flow now
let's move into to the next step let's
let's declare some variables right here
so we have account type now we are going
to declare to account and this is the
type is to account and this is the
payment amount which is currency I am
doing
because I am going to add a new estate
which is how I am going to add the
ability to transfer money from one
account to another so I am going to copy
this thing I already have the code right
here so I am just going to and then I'm
going to explain to you okay I am going
to place it right here
di Denton is very important right here
so let's be careful with that okay so
now I add I added these two states okay
start payments and resolve to account so
I need to declare as well my actions
right so I need to say send money and
this is a start payment okay
so this is how I called the
conversational flow so I already have
some intends to send money from one
account to another okay so if I put
something about I want to make a payment
from my American Express to the
babysitter something must happen right
what is gonna happen if you follow me
this thing this is going to try to
resolve the from account and the to
account but nothing else so something is
going to be wrong right here so let's
validate it let's train the bots and
then let's execute it something wrong is
going to happen so send a payment
why unable to resolve the intent because
I am not telling the conversational flow
to do anything I am just saying try to
get the account or try to get the to
account and that's it but I am not
telling
they bought anything else so now let's
let's tell the flow that we need to do
something with that we need to process
the payment so we need four more states
or four more transitions sorry and I
will explain it to you so I am going to
paste that right here
okay
so how can we read this flow as follows
so the first thing is I want to know
what is the account time from which I
want the money to be transferred
second thing I want to know what is the
to account to the money to which is the
account where I want to send the money
if I didn't type it I need to ask for it
so from which I come do you want to make
a payment then if I didn't include the
to account I need to ask what is it to
account then I need to specify what is
the amount how many how much money I am
sending okay and finally I want to print
it so let's let's do it validated train
the boat
does send a payment okay from which I
come do you want to make a payment
checking to which I come do you want to
make a payment to the babysitter what's
the payment amount okay why this because
it resolved the from account it resolved
the to account it asked me for the
amount I gave it the amount but I didn't
I didn't configure anything else so I
need to configure at least to print the
result of the transaction so that is
exactly where I'm going to do which is
the to payment transition okay
okay
it's validated retrain them and now
let's let's do something different let's
do this which is the power of this I
want to transfer I want to transfer 50
USD to manual what is going to happen
i specify the amount that i want to
transfer and i a spell and i specified
that to account but i did not specify
that from account so this is asking me
that from account
I need worked okay
or I can say from my Amex I want to
transfer 50 what happened here
let's see what happened here
it realized that it was the same money
intent the one that it needs to resolve
which is okay because I want to send
money but at the end it identified the
credit car and identified a currency
that identified it was dollar but it is
it is not well configured because hit
mas had asked has asked me to specify
the to account instead of giving me the
balance so that's something I will I
will need to fix but as you as you are
realizing I am just configuring the
entities I am just configuring the
intents which is the natural thing and
then everything happens this behind the
scenes well as a developer I need to
create this conversational flow which is
just to define which are the variables
that represent the information of the
user and how are the states and the
transitions of the flow okay what do I
need to ask if I already have this I
don't need to prompt for the account if
I already have the to account I don't
need to prompt it if I already specify
the amount I am NOT going to do it so I
think we will still have one more minute
and I am going to show you something
extra
he's asking me if there is like a
repository or something behind behind
the scenes about the natural language
right well that's that's the bot itself
that's the engine itself it contains an
NLP engine and it is resolving that
behind the scenes so one one extra thing
we are I have showed you how to program
the conversational flow which is
something that developer must know right
I mention it in my slides I also
mentioned that it was also important to
know about api's and how to connect to
api well that happens that this platform
is able to do that I can connect to a
back-end ok which is what I'm going to
do
okay I'm going to connect to this
back-end which is the mobile cloud
services back in in order to consume
some API
okay
so this is a URL and I am going to do
anonymously and I am going to use this
thing right here so with this I am
connecting to the back end if everything
goes well as it happened then I have all
these components which is which our API
is so I can connect my conversational
flow to those API so let me show you how
because as you have seen this
conversational flow has everything fixed
the amount right here the messages
itself okay but I can create and that
would be the final thing this is take a
look to the print balance I was using
something different it was just a text
thing the balance is 500 now I am using
a component which is the balance
retrieval which I use which I just
configured in a few seconds ago and now
I am just going to send it the account
type and that's it now let's see if it
works let's see what happened
okay whoops oh you know what happened
okay sorry about it
okay I want my balance okay checking and
now he's telling me something different
checking account Andy and the number of
the account and the amount in USD and
savings it says that something went
wrong right there and credit card oh
that's that's weird
well the idea is I'm sorry about it is
that I can connect those components and
use those components instead of having
the fixed code that I show you so that's
it that's pretty much what I had for my
presentation my objective was to show
you what is the relevance of the
conversational UI that was my main
objective and then how can I translate
it into this code and then the code is
what I share with you variables states
transitions and how to resolve the
intents the intents are being processed
behind the scenes with the NLP engine
that the mobile platform has it okay
okay he's saying that what happens if I
give the same account like I want to
transfer from my Amex to my Amex right
okay the account type and the to account
must be different because those are your
entities your entities represent
something and in this case the account
type represent the original count and
the to account represented to account so
they cannot be the same yeah it's going
to be if you don't manage is going to be
the young resolved intent but if you've
managed it you can say it to the user
you are using the same account to
transfer your phones you cannot do that
right yep if the confidence threshold is
is zero is going to mix the intent
because as you can see or as you saw it
every time that I did this there is a
confident threshold being been achieved
so this is this is not going to resolve
it is not going to know which one to
resolve
yes that's the idea or that's intention
the intention of this that is why I
connect to the back end because API is
must be in place and I must be able to
connect my bot to those API and that's
the idea if we get back to the to the
slide right here that would be the idea
that would be the idea yes well this is
just a demo but do you have the ability
to do it if you have the API in place
you can do it absolutely
okay so what he saying is I can write
this with Python and he is right he is
correct but what he cannot do is
obviously there is an NLP with Python
because there is something in place but
you need to code it I mean you need to
code everything the the interface if you
want to send the the UI to a facebook
messenger you need to identify if his
facebook which is calling you or if you
want to connect it with another channel
then you need to code it because because
you need to identify the channel in this
case and and I mention it in my slides
try to use a generic platform because
then you are not tied to anything if you
do it with Python which is okay then you
are going to be tied with your code and
with the channel because there is
something that linked your channel and
your code Python is going to say this
has been called by Facebook so so the
Facebook API is going to be used and you
need to know that API with a generic
platform you don't need to know that you
just configure it and create a
conversational flow and that's it all
these interface well every time I do
this and this is being printed this is
by itself this is not tied with the
channel
yes I am I am
definitely yes but by itself you are not
going to know how the Facebook API works
because the platform is going to provide
it to you
yeah automatically if not we can tell we
can talk offline because I think the
next one is coming yeah you could do it
because you can ask for the user to add
the account and then you need to use the
internal API is of the chat bot to
increase this you need to you want to
add one more element right here right to
the account type so you can expose the
account type as an API and I need to use
one more record yeah
yes correct correct no no this UI that I
show you he's asking me if the users are
going to be entering here to to interact
with the bot no the answer is no this is
just for testing purposes what is going
to be your channel it is your choice it
could be Facebook it would be telegram
it could be your website it could be
your mobile application is it is your
choice and that is why this platform is
powerful because it is generic it is not
going to be tied to one yep oh yes yeah
yes so he's asking me if the the
utterances and the intents can be
translated the answer is yes this can be
integrated with the google translator
that's the way that that Oracle is doing
it now so I can be typing it in Spanish
and at the back end is being translated
to English and the NLP is working with
English because it was translated from
Spanish yes you can do it and that is
from the device because I can do the
voice in the voice is going to be
translated in text and the text is going
to be input to the backend yeah
yes you can do it you can do it why
because Alexa is just going to be the
the the transport for the boys and at
the end is going to get here and it is a
boys to text translation and it's going
to get here as text well that's I think
then we need to talk about the use case
because I think in order to deploy this
on production in a real life if it could
be by boys definitely but before you get
into the boys thing you need to
authenticate somehow the user which was
something that I was talking with with
with a person a few minutes ago before
we get into the session about how to
authenticate a user there must be
something that the user must either type
or whatever in order to authenticate and
then everything can be by boys day yes
that that's correct
yeah with databases well this thing that
I did at the end of the demonstration
about connecting to the back end
it is connection to mobile cloud
services back-end which is mainly API so
if one of those API is is connected to
database via JDBC or whatever that's
fine it is all everything about the API
this is just going to connect to API
with nothing else just with API and your
API needs to connect to whatever in the
back end with JDBC or whatever or Mongo
or whatever yes because it is the API
itself yeah how's that
well this is actually well this is a
service a component the component is
something that you are you need to build
by a scratch okay and you need to to
build the code to in order to create a
component for example an authentication
a custom authentication component and
this is new that needs to be created
with the mobile cloud services API which
is based on nodejs
and then you create your component using
nodejs connected to whatever and then is
your own custom code okay I think we are
out of time I think we can continue with
the questions I am happy with that let's
just move because I think someone is
using the room for the next session so I
will be there outside if you want to ask
me something I will be there thank you
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
