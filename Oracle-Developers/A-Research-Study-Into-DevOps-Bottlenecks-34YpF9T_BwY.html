and welcome to the research into devil's
battle next talk thank you for being
here I think having is saying a session
during lunch it's kind of you know there
is a admission test built into it
whoever was smart enough to come here
with the lunch wins and that's you well
not a lot of people but all right we'll
make it work there is some polls in it
that should I hope to get some
representative sample well the queue is
representative sample my name is burrow
and developer advocate who is Jeff Rock
at J bar on Twitter and you all of
course should follow me because you are
here and I'm here and that's an intimate
group as we mentioned I prepared a
special page for you Jeff becomes their
show notes
if you go there you'll find an Oracle
code page there dedicated to this talk
with those slides being there already
all the links to all the companies and
all the materials that I'm going to
speak about are already there a the
video it is stream lived on YouTube so I
will make sure to link the video there
as well so we'll have one place to go
and as small and there is like ratings
comments and a small raffle to thank you
for being here so that's the only link
you should remember or take a picture
off of all the stock and it also appears
on the bottom of every slide so it's not
late all the way to the end of it so why
why this this talk is called a research
because we actually did our research so
Jeff raagh and we have around 5,000
customers big and small different
industries different verticals and so we
had a very good access to
a wide range of wide variety of
companies and people that we can spoke
with and this actually builds an
interesting story across the industry of
where the devoxx DevOps acceptance
stands and what are the bottlenecks
towards it so and first of all we
obviously interviewed our own our India
Jeff Rock to ask how we are doing in
regards with with a DevOps M CTO at
boxxy boxxy is a tiny tiny startup that
allows you to troubleshoot bugs in
production for mobile development and
they are just got started maybe a year
ago half a year ago something like that
so that was very interesting use case
what are people in Greenfield doing now
a CTO of one of them top Israeli finance
firms well Israel is a small market and
what it is like seven eight million
people general but even in this scale
they have pretty reasonable large
enterprises couple of top financial
firms we spoke with CTO with one of them
women of engineering at CA Technologies
back in the days when this this research
was conducted CTO its Sandberg that's
another interesting startup their
consumer oriented startup they do and
how do you call it one of those
subscription services they actually send
people a fragrance by subscription so
there is an NIT into it and the guided
we spoke is the city of their architect
of a top fortune rated privately held
tech firm we went and tried to obfuscate
as much as possible but it's it's a top
rated fortune 500 high tech firm and
that's an architect there
and applications engineering me a
manager and another very known a top
fortune 500 software company so and as
you can see we have a good mix here of
different people from different
industries different scale different
position in their lifecycle of their
company and this is from my perspective
what makes this research interesting
hopefully you'll find it interesting as
well right so the first question before
we start and it has everything to do
with the acceptance of DevOps is what is
there UPS how it is understood in by
different people in our industry and I
try to answer this question in various
different forms and Oracle called being
one of them
that's Oracle code last year in DevOps
at scale if any of you heard this talk
it's it's a nice one one of the
questions we wanted to answer is what is
DevOps and so they're diverse in what is
DevOps so a lot of people see DevOps as
something like that it's actually this
common area between different expertises
that meet so there are people who are
proficient in development and there are
people who are provisional in operations
and people who provision in QA but some
part of their job overlaps and this what
makes DevOps another view is actually no
this is we need to blimp blend them even
further it actually means that everybody
is doing everything and that's more like
of an approach um I would say canonical
DevOps right maybe Netflix
and others that I I guess the the
simplest example of that is given
developer successful production if you
do that you're probably doing these kind
of DevOps I don't think there is a right
and wrong answer here but we'll see how
different approaches effect differently
their adoption of of DevOps so DevOps is
a very very calmly tied to a to delivery
and especially to deliver it to
production and and this cycle of
delivery when you go from where is my
area when you go from development to
build and then you test it you deploy it
then you release it you actually wait
for you operate it and based on the
feedback that you get you go again right
so that's not a new cycle this is what
everybody do and the whole purpose of
DevOps is doing this cycle more smoothly
or or more productively and with less
disruptions and one of them one of the
symptoms of good DevOps adoption is
successful release think about it take a
company that releases twice a year and
take a company that releases twice a day
which one do you think successfully
adopted DevOps
right so this is this is not the curves
this is the symptom but it's a good
symptom that we started with asking
those people of what is your release
cycle and we got very very strange set
of answers it was all over the board two
hours one day two weeks a month six
months and actually we spoke one-on-one
of our engineers
the background in the US military and
and he mentioned a release cycle of two
years we didn't include him in his in
this study because he was out for a
couple of years already maybe things had
changed but none of us actually believe
that they have changed but two years
right so and this is kind of we went
like well what does it mean I mean how
does it possible or or what's going on
and and our first our first guess was
well okay that probably means that
people who release faster and that
probably means that they adapted DevOps
better they're more happy with their
release cycle and those who really
slower probably in the process of this
transformation and want to release
faster right so those who release every
half a year dream of releasing every two
hours it's just a matter of they're not
there yet so that was our our first
guess so our next question was okay so
are you happy with it and and left let's
play this game with you so and just
raise your hands who think that the
ratio that I that appears here is is the
correct one so who thinks that no one is
satisfied with their release pace well
no one thinks that apparently people who
release every two hours should be pretty
happy about them how about twenty
percent are satisfied with their release
the rest are one one to get better well
yeah a couple of hands well maybe maybe
that sounds possible how about 50
percent I would say like those who
deploy faster are generally more that
it's satisfied with those who deploy
slower my okay couple events again how
about eighty percent satisfied yeah more
more hands well that makes sense we have
couple of outliers to the worst
people who release really slow probably
are unsatisfied how about everybody are
satisfied one hand well yeah that's kind
of that would be strange because they're
people are obviously behind so how they
are happy well what are observe of
people that we spoke with are satisfied
or at least claimed so and this is very
weird because now we are really lost I
mean how can it be that people who
release one six months are satisfied
with their release as people who release
every two hours doesn't make any sense
or or or does it the question is I mean
why people are satisfied they are
satisfied because they think that what
they are doing is good enough so that
the next question to those people is
okay so you are satisfied with what why
do you think that your process being it
two hours or six months is good enough
and here there were some very very very
interesting answers so for example I
don't measure it because I have no
complaints well you can assume that that
was the answer of one of the start up
early start up guys well they are very
agile and kind of fixes that around and
break it around call it whatever you
like and they just build some process it
works for them no one complains so it's
good enough and when the back.you is
empty we are all good
that's that's a good measurement right
we we we need to release when we have
something to release we have a queue of
bugs and and features we keep releasing
as fast as they don't pile up that's a
good release pace regardless of what the
actual number is
when I get fewer tickets on the process
now that's probably from some of the
more enterprising guys they have tickets
or complaints on the release process
itself and if no one complaints that the
releases are too frequent or too sparse
probably their releases are about right
who can get to complain well everybody
can complain so for example or get to it
but sales can complain that their
releases are too frequent or their R&amp;amp;D
can complain that their releases are too
too rare and if no one complains
probably that means that that this is
good another very interesting comment
that we get that we got I want to
automate all the pieces and when
everything is automated I'm good
regardless of how long it will then take
me to ship something as long as I don't
need to go and and run some manual
script and do stuff I don't think I
don't care how long it takes as long as
the result is out there there are other
measures that we heard as well maybe
it's secondary or a version adoption
version adoption is critical right so
you're all here equal to z22 Oracle and
Oracle have interesting history in
adapting their release cycles to the
market and half of them are anecdotes
half of them are actually in fact that
Oracle representative admitted in in
this scenario or other but for example
the Java release process was adopted
multiple times based on the requirements
on the
right so at one time I remember the
early cycle was 12 months because this
is what Oracle believed it's enough time
for their enterprise customers to adapt
to release and then it went up to urine
1/2 because apparently or allegedly they
got complaints that the enterprise's
don't have enough time to roll out their
upgrades between the versions and now it
went down to six months right so the
official release schedule now of the
Java versions are six month between Java
nine in Java 10 but there are special
longtime support versions which actually
are every year in health and if you are
that Enterprise who do not expect to
adopt the versions fast enough you can
skip all those in-between and still go
by the year-and-a-half schedule so
virgin adoption is a big thing back
burndown diagram that's kind of how do
you measure that you don't have a box in
the queue so that's kind of what we
spoke about productivity gains that's
interesting that's kind of psychological
but but but also important so I had a
process a build process or a release
process it took me two days now we took
me it takes me two minutes and I'm good
I seen improvement and this is good
enough for me quality no regressions
meantime to to repair all those are good
as well my pipeline is solid so I don't
actually need to do anything more
business metrics these count backs to
the version adoption how fast your sales
team can actually sell what you release
and if you don't
managed to sell their upgrades maybe you
are upgrading too frequently so so what
is the right early cycle is there such a
thing as right release cycle at all one
of the answers is that's a very russian
joke one of the answer is well you're
eating so it's appropriate having enough
food on the table right the release
should have enough in it should have
enough features in it should have enough
bug fixes in it that people will go
through the effort of upgrading if
upgrading requires an effort and that's
an interesting question about should
upgrade even require an effort that we
are going to talk later because this is
critical for understanding the right
release cycle and before that let's
actually talk about bottlenecks and I
think that's my most successful slide it
actually incorporates beer into
something which is related to my talk
those are bottlenecks I mean how cool is
that and I can't get any better than
that let's talk about bottlenecks and
Bunnell let's we can again we
interviewed a lot of people we have our
own experience and and out of that you
can summarize or group sorry all the
bottlenecks into three main categories
education automation and trust I guess
the best motivator in the education area
is this simple sentence pain is
instructional now this goes directly
into the heart of DevOps
one of the main drivers of DevOps one of
the main reasons of involving dev into
ops and into QA and involving QA into
Devon ops and the other way around is
make them feel the pain of the other
groups in their organization and that's
not for a masochistic reasons although
that of course part of the game for a
big chunk of our industry but for the
rest of us it is for making sure that
the people who caused this pain for
other teams in the organization feel
this pain and have a good incentive to
fix it so this is a very very big part
of the picture and this solved by
putting developers on call and involving
ops into a you know working with other
organizations to feel their pain
etcetera etcetera and another very very
good a quote that we had from one of
their from one of the interviews that's
from Leone integral link then a VP of
engineering at CA Technologies it takes
three steps you need to know how you do
things better that's the easy part
right there there is tons of information
out there on how to implement DevOps
starting from the books the Phoenix
project DevOps handbook and tons of
other books releasing it and and
continuous delivery and and what's not
so the information is out there there
are articles there are conferences all
the world is speaking about how to cook
DevOps correctly so information is not a
problem the second one is you need to
believe that your organization is
capable of going
through this transformation and here
getting back to this unofficial
interviewee on our on our research as
well that the guy who served in a milder
in the IT he mentioned that they didn't
have that so then you exactly what to do
in order to implement the change but
none of them actually believed that in
an organization like an army change is
possible so they kind of stopped there
and the most common obstacle is the
third one you need to give a you
need to cure you need to drive this
change forward and not waiting for
someone else to pick up the challenge so
most of the obstacles in develops
adoption is exactly there think about it
right people know what to do people
think that in theory their organization
can change should we make this change we
have so much work to do we don't have
time for that right that that's that's
the most common problem is out there it
also takes investment
it also takes money because you need to
pull resources from doing whatever they
are doing into adapting this change you
need to pull people to get training you
need to retool the whole chain from
manual semi manual processes to
completely automate the processes you
need to put in place new practices and
then run people through pain of adopting
those practices it's it's a lot of money
to invest activation energy is something
that lacks in all those use cases when
we spoke about well yeah in theory we
know how to do it
but it's you know it's too big
it's not on my plate it requires such a
change that we won't do it right now
activation energy fueled by money this
is what lacks for the majority of the
organization who are hesitant on picking
up DevOps today it's not an adventure
anymore people know that it works you
early majority is already there
there are huge enterprise traditional
organizations that already past this
transition to DevOps so it's not
something that well those hipsters do it
in San Francisco we cannot allow
ourselves those crazy experiments it's
not that anymore so the only thing that
is missing now is activation energy
fueled by investment another interesting
aspect is job security this is
especially true for QA people and
especially for manual QA because we
speak about automation of everything but
the first clear victim of this
automation in theory at least should be
the manual QA we automate the whole
process tons of QA people go home well
we don't see that happening with all the
people that we spoke we asked this
question how about job security
did you lay off people because of that
did people were afraid because of that
and the answer of all of them starting
with what we see in Jeff rock and all
the way to all the organization that we
spoke is not only we didn't fire any
people we actually struggle to hire more
people because we started to release
faster and that means that we need a
continuous investment in our pipelines
in including the QA part
of the pipeline yeah but what about all
those people who only do manual QA and
are not capable of doing anything else
well there are almost none of those
people obviously there some folks who
say you know what if you want let me do
my manual queue anymore I go home well
and those people probably go home but
the majority like the vast majority of
the QA engineers we're more than happy
to evolve into DevOps part of the QA
doing the automation doing sophisticated
fun and interesting QA job and not just
clicking through screens on the UI so
job security is not an issue at all
so back to activation energy first push
is hard someone needs to stand up and
say yes we are doing it and this is what
it takes
keep an eye on the price the process is
long people are getting frustrated
people are getting extremely frustrated
because they're going through pain and
no one likes it and it's a long process
so for an older code base for an older
are in the organization it could take
more than a year to achieve it but it's
still worth it and there are a couple of
the other advices that we heard is start
with some senior group of folks because
they understand what need to be done and
they have the leadership to show
everybody of the success and and this
kind of stuff now
tools and and we speak about DevOps
as being a blend of three different
types of change people need to change
process need to change and
tools need to change and we kind of try
to do our best to not focus on the tools
because as technical people this is what
we do by default we are going to solve
everything with another slack
integration and some kind of a clever
chat bot that will do DevOps for us and
we kind of understand that that's a
wrong approach and we try the other
extreme of not thinking about the tools
but tools are important and we do need
to think about the tools and the three
key components of those tools whatever
tool you are talking about in your
pipeline those tools have to be
scriptable for automation have to be
immutable think about pets versus cattle
the DevOps idiom for having immutable
and disposable tools and they have to be
Universal and support all the
technologies that you think about and
you can take those three criterias and
go through all your pipeline and judge
your tools by whether you can get a
repeatable and automated life cycle out
of those tools so let's take an example
CI server Jenkins is it scriptable hell
yes right Jenkins too has this notion of
Jenkins pipelines
it's a groovy DSL script that you can
have on your github and then you can
script how your build is running no more
check boxes and dropdowns
for selecting different options is it
immutable of course you can kill your
Jenkins server and then in a common line
spin up a new one and it will be at
the same as the previous one you can
scale up skim down agents and they will
be exactly the same ones probably now
they will be created out of docker
images which are immutable and you will
create the same containers for engine
every one of them is it Universal yes
you can build your Java code who is it
you can build with your go code with it
you can build your docker images with it
and it works across the board same with
any other piece of your CI pipeline and
of course I mean being Jeff rock I can
speak about the part of your of your
artifact repository in exactly the same
terms and your component analysis tool
in exactly the same terms and your
distribution platform in the same terms
I won't do it now but if you are
interested just let's talk after to talk
about artifactory in x-ray and bean tray
etc corporate approach to tools is also
important if you want people to embrace
the tools that you think are right what
we see is that approach of guidance as
the opposite to dictate is being very
very useful and this table is an example
from a live system that one of the
corporate corporations that we
interviewed are using and it's extremely
successful the adoption of the tools
that they suggest is through the roof
and this is what they do so they are the
tools team for a very big enterprise and
we say and they say you can do to the
R&amp;amp;D teams you can do whatever you like
you can take whatever tools you like if
you feel that some tools are better for
you than others
do it but we are here to support the 80
percent of the organization and this is
those M terms are from the third works
tech rudder and they are talking about
the a what we suggest should be done
with tools right so if you look into
programming language and you need to
select one we suggest you do Java if you
want to do C++ and you have your own
reasons that's fine you might have your
own reasons but it but we suggest on
Java same with Bill tools right so if
you already use maven that's fine you we
will help you maintain it but if you
start a new project take a look at
Gradle because we believe it's better
for certain reasons for the majority of
project now if you still use and that's
about time you start phasing it out and
we will help you with replacing it with
Gradle that makes more sense in in
today's environment now they don't ban
any technology at all and if you if you
want now to start your project in go
because you actually do something which
is obsoleted and go is then you go to
language pun intended in the ops world
now you go and do again you go and do
that but if you are doing like the Deaf
part of the house maybe you should use
Java so that's that's concept that works
great for those folks and I know other
folks that kind of do the same and and
also are being very very successful now
let's talk about trust
cupcakes I wonder if it's staged
you need to watch like three times to
get it yeah so let's talk about trust
and and as you remember trust was there
one of the one of the bottlenecks so we
spoke about this is being the holy grail
of of Devils this is what you want to
achieve by implementing Devils faster
release but actually most of the time
you will get that most of the builds
actually will fail and that's fine you
know what people say about tests that
always pass there it's not your code is
being that good is the tests aren't good
enough because none of us is perfect
none of us writing perfect code and test
should fail and this is where trust
comes in if you are committing your code
now and you know that it goes to
production if all the tests are passed
successfully what is your confidence in
your tests this is what stands between
you and your broken product and this is
the known pyramid of seven seven team
malfunctions forgot the term of what
what can go wrong and it actually starts
with with options absence of trust so
this notion of trust is paramount for
everything and and we hear this one as a
huge bottleneck in the adoption of
interruption of of DevOps right quality
is the bottleneck period automatic
testing is not enough people have good
coverage good
maduk tests and they still don't trust
the software does goes out the big green
button concept the continuous delivery
when you have the pipeline but it not
quite goes to production there is an
approval stage is lack of trust in
quality the reason that we have this
additional step is that because we don't
really trust what goes to production and
in in the last years companies that do
continuous deployment that take their
code directly to production aren't
really a good example of quality broken
fake book feed anyone this is it right
they commit right to production and then
we have broken Facebook feed and they're
like but who cares it's Facebook if it's
down I get more done but what about
your bank how you will feed how you feel
with your bank doing automatic like
continuous delay delivery yeah right
that's that's another story so we can
use our customers as testers and that's
the Connery releases and that's what
most of their non-critical industry does
those days and again going back to
Brogan Facebook if people shouting to
their feet is broken probably there is a
back there that we need to go and fix so
that's kind of a good way to do it well
not good enough right so how do how do
we deal with that the questioning the
answer is well today it is actually hard
the QA is the last frontier that stands
between us and through automatic release
and through continuous deployment and
this problem hasn't been solved yet UI
tests are extremely hard some functional
tests
are extremely hard and people still
require to do that maybe now not in
every build like they used to
exploratory testing that kind of double
checks of what the automation does and
then tweaks it accordingly is a step in
the right direction and and of course
the future will bring more and more
tools that will solve this problem and
eventually very very soon it will go way
but but it's it's still there and and
then this brings me back to the
discussion that what I mentioned you
previously the cost of update right so
we spoke about you have to have enough
on the table so your customers will care
about the upgrade but the question is
should customers be really bothered with
upgrade what if any upgrade Java Virtual
Machine
up on your phone a website in the
browser or if you where in your home
automation smart bulb updated behind the
scenes automatically and all of the time
that's a concept that we call continuous
update and this concept takes away from
the table this discussion of should I
upgrade or not because your software is
updated automatically all the time and
this brings the question of trust as the
cornerstone of the DevOps adoption
because of course heaven continuous
update means putting an absolute trust
in your software provider and that
brings us back to the question of what
is DevOps
how it should be done right so this
blend that we saw does it promote trust
or not when I'm telling you now that
every software every R&amp;amp;D engineer has an
access to production how do you feel
about it
will you trust this company now to
upgrade your bank software or for this
matter a light bulb in your house
shouldn't they be more like a chunky
soup and do have those specialization
still or should they be blended together
those are open open questions for our
industry to answer and I'm out of time
and like I think three minutes so just
again I'm in J bark on Twitter feel free
to share with me your thoughts about
DevOps adoption continuous update and
trust and this is Oracle code when you
do that use this hashtag a general it
becomes the show notes just a reminder
the video will be there it's actually
streaming live so I'll just put the
YouTube embed there the slides are
already there the links are already
there feedback form and a raffle to
thank you for being here some nice
prizes there
so with that questions and thank you
very much
any questions
yes I'll repeat the question so go ahead
the question is about fest and that's
kind of some framework for user for UI
testing I
I believe I never heard about it sorry
about that
I'm not a QA person at all so yeah no I
didn't hear about it
yeah that's that's that's a great
question so then the question was okay
so you want to do this continuous update
in thing yeah right so so this
continuous update feature this great
dream sounds fun but what about cyber
security you are going to transfer those
updates over a wire and you say that
they're completely automated they are
not mobile supervised so things can go
wrong right so that's that's good that's
a good good concern but I would argue
the continuous abre update actually
makes softer more secure and that's
because you can correspond to the
threats much faster think about Equifax
those guys had this horrible breach for
two months because this is the release
cycle that they had they weren't
physically capable of closing the leak
sooner leak that they know about just
because they didn't have the right
release process to close it in two hours
two days two weeks or or something
reasonable well two weeks is also an
unreasonable so when you have this
pipeline of continuous update and some
security vulnerabilities are discovered
and they will be discovered forever the
response time is what keeps you safe not
the supervision of the process and now
especially with specter of Venerable 'ti
it actually means we don't have any
reasonable way to protect ourselves from
future vulnerabilities the nature of
Spectre is that it can only be
discovered
someone came up with a new vector of
attack and that means that only the
response time is what matters in this
game we can be proactive inspector we
can only be reactive but we need to be
as fast as possible so we need to have
continuous update here and ready for for
these kind of problems other
yeah so that's that's a great question I
mean okay so QA is obviously about on it
and you can automate so far and probably
there are things that cannot be
automated what they do next well I have
to quest to to answer to this question
first
are they really cannot be automated you
know what may be fast is the answer to
your problem I don't know about it you
don't know about it this nice gentleman
with an amazing hat can tell you about
fast and you go like hell yes bottleneck
is done there is a continuous
improvement in the industry of the
automatic tests new revolutionary
concept I don't know quantum computing
computing or phantom computing I have no
idea what that even means can come
tomorrow and solve the problem of manual
clear forever the only way to know it is
to keep researching and keep looking
forward for for for this kind of
solution and sometimes you deliberately
say you know what there is no solution
that I can trust at the moment I will
have to have this green button but I
know it's a bottleneck so I will keep
loop forward for a way to get rid of it
that would be my my take on it yeah
we're out of time and Shia gets his next
here on the stage so he's been very
polite sitting there instead of kicking
me on the stage physically thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
