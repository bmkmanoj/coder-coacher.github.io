onto public cloud first let me introduce
myself my name is Siri Locklear I work
for cloudbees where I am solution
architect I have a sales role and I also
work on the product I work on the java
application server as a service on our
platform which is a platform as a
service offering prior to a cloudbees I
work for GBA which is a French
consulting company where I was CTO for
15 years of consulting your most I am
involved in the open source community I
used to be a committer committer on the
Apache zxf project and now I am involved
on the gmx trans project which is a
monitoring project based on janux my
center of interest are develops
infrastructure as code on cloud
computing on Nigel cloudbees so first I
would like to ask you a few questions
about you when this room is dev lot of
the dev team most of the people with ups
also on with dev on oops okay thank you
very much and then who already deployed
application on the cloud okay so half of
us thank you so I will start this
presentation by a quick overview of what
cloud computing is some of you may
already be familiar with this concept
but I would like to review them to be
sure that everybody has the same
understanding i will use pretty common
terminology which is to differentiate
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service on software as a service some
people like amazon don't use this
differentiation but it's a very common
way to to differentiate this this
approach infrastructure-as-a-service so
we have already used amazon or microsoft
azure okay one twenty-five percent of
the people infrastructure-as-a-service
is a place where you have linux as a
service or windows if you want but most
commonly linux you have your storage as
a service so you can just with your
graphical user interface have almost
infinite storage star kind of storage
area network and you also have network
facilities so you can configure your
network define private networks and so
on so this is a place where you will
have to to manage your application you
will have to decide what you will use
the major vendors major actors here are
amazon AWS and which is the most biggest
one microsoft is your so it's a
microsoft azure is not very well known
from java developers but it is very
important in microsoft community on
usage is growing fast then another very
important player on the cloud is not a
company it's an open source project
which is OpenStack it has been initiated
by the NASA on rackspace few years ago
on now it is a kind of stone the open
sourced under to compete with Amazon on
we see more on more awesome providers
data center providers who jump into
OpenStack to compete in the cloud arena
on one last player of the cloud
infrastructure as a service is vmware a
few years ago we saw that vmware would
be important because they were very
strong in virtualization in the data
center so they were good at density of
applications in data center on
automation but finally vmware cloud
offering did not have a huge success yet
on its not there are no big vendor
offering a vmware cloud as a service so
when you are on infrastructure as a
service you continue to to do your
traditional system administration job
yourself such as choosing linux if you
want a fedora santo s4l debian whatever
applying security fixes choosing oh you
will mount file system defining security
firewalls all this it's your role to do
it managing this is your role so
infrastructure as a service will provide
you great elasticity on the hardware but
then a lot of admin works remains now
we'll move to software as a service this
is a place where you have your business
application hosted for you major players
are cells for so I guess many people in
the room I use Salesforce in their
company we also have Amazon I'm sorry
google with Google Apps male dogs
storage these are applications that are
run for you by a cloud provider you will
not have to set up anything in your own
infrastructure you just have to enter
your credit card number on you will have
limited availability to customize the
application for you if you use
Salesforce you can add or remove few
fields to your customer profile but you
will not be able to develop your own
application if we take a google calendar
it will be difficult to integrate the
room booking application for your
building so software the service is
completely managed for you you don't
have to take care about anything they do
security fixes maintain and so on
the constraint is that you are limited
in the number of features you can
implement and now platform as a service
platform as a service is a smallest
market share in the cloud arena it's
emerging it's it has a strong rose but
it is still much smaller than
infrastructure as a service only it's a
place where we will combine the
flexibility of infrastructure as a
service with the management manager
approach of software as a service so we
will run the middleware for you for
example for java applications we will
run tomcat for you dribbles for you we
will run the database for you but you
will come with your standard java code
so on the standard java application java
ee spring framework juice whatever and
we will provide you all the
infrastructure to run it and we will
manage at the middleworld level so we'll
be able to fix middle world issues but
then you will still have to deal with
your application and if we look at the
landscape of platform as a service of
course cloudbees i worked for this
company so let me mention it first then
a very famous one is a Roku Roku is a
primarily a platform as a service for
Ruby on Rails it has been acquired by
sales force they also add also languages
two days of a support for java google
appengine is very very important as
business application developers you may
not see it but google appengine for java
and for python is evilly used by the
gaming industry google mentioned that
they have customers that you pay more
than 1 million dollar per month on their
infrastructure because they provide a
completely scalable Java cloud with a
completely scalable database as long as
you follow their design patterns but the
drawback is that it will not be stoned
out Java it's not like developing on a
tomcat application with
I sequel database you have to use google
api's for your application web
application code as well as for your
database code also vendors amazon amazon
is very strong for infrastructure as a
service but it is also very strong on
platform as a service they offer more
than 30 services you will find database
as a service oracle DB my sequel DB
microsoft sequel server is they do all
the monitoring management for you have
just introduced that back on oracle this
week they really they can set up with a
very easy simple to use graphical user
interface with replicas cluster for you
they do all this so they provide a lot
of services like this which are more at
the platform level at the middle were
level in addition to their easy to i yes
services on on java application they
provide Beanstalk which is at
cloud-based would say more a deployment
automation tool as an complete pass java
pass but it's a debate but they are also
investing investigating in this area
other actors cloud foundry which was
vmware which is now spin off with
pivotal which initially targeted vmware
data centers and migrated to amazon AWS
when they move to pivotal they have an
open-source approach which is a
community approach IBM drawing cloud
foundry recently so you can run a
websphere liberty on Cloud Foundry if
you want on that plan to work both on
public clouds like Amazon Rackspace on
also in your private data center finally
read at openshift reddit openshift
offering is primarily targeted to run in
your private data center in your private
cloud is
have released at the beginning of the
summer on we will see how it will happen
so this was my sorry introduction and
what was cloud what types of clothes we
could use so now is the agenda of my
presentation first I will cover public
cloud on now we'll review what will be
the impact of software as a service
infrastructure as a service on platform
as a service for both operations team on
development team and then I will cover
private cloud and we will conclude so
roles of devs on ups when you move to
software as a service who has already
used Salesforce here okay yes who live
just a tour three of us who knows
Salesforce marketing world which is no
software 0 software so this is a
Salesforce event on what they say is
that they don't want software forest
they want to do it for us so for
developer development team on operations
team it will be very difficult to find a
way in software as a service I'm sorry
but it's not me it's them who says East
so if we look at his head minute we have
seaside mins in the room yeah one okay
thank you is plat software-as-a-service
on end of the road for seaside mins
Salesforce will manage the application
for you they will ensure high
availability securities they do
absolutely everything the manager
database or databases huge but there is
no DBA you your DBA will not work on it
so most of the work for operations team
disappear there are few remaining things
one important thing is integration I
remember use case of
a company were they started to use
Salesforce it was just a small marketing
team there were up he would sell first
and then they say we want to extend the
usage of Salesforce and we want to have
it in course hunters but in course
hunters if you have to wait five seconds
for a web page to display with your user
name then it's a really big pen and if
you go to sell force from your company's
network with the internet you have
latency issues like this and so you will
have your network on sysadmin teams who
will have to work on wire on renting
high-speed networks to connect to this
private to this cloud solutions and this
will be important then you will have to
deal with identity management when an
employee of your company quits the
company you must also remove him from
Salesforce you will have single sign-on
issues so there are remaining issues
subjects that remains for the operations
teams the seaside means on network guys
but the scope will be way more limited
when the company used dropbox to share
files there is really less work than
when you use a micro shell microsoft
shared folders let's look at the
development team who knows apex here
apex is a salesforce programming
language so it's a kind of 4th
generation language so it's something
which is not very funny for a
traditional developers when you are a
Java developer ruby developer using your
fourth generation language it's probably
not something you will like on you will
enjoy only here most of the work will
disappear because sales force
application has been developed by
Salesforce you will still have some
customizations to do with a pex
programming it will be the same with
google appengine google appengine your
rhetoric google apps for you domain you
also have the ecosystem of service
provider we will provide many extensions
but maybe you will need
more that you will develop yourself
however it may not be the same
development team if you have a low
latency development team and you ask
them to develop on tell force they will
not like it at all so if we summarize
this software as a service maybe you
don't know it but you use it when we
look at big companies that everybody use
software as a service Dropbox else for
us or whatever there is no reason to
reject it we cannot reject it it will be
used by the business teams so we should
probably accept it on keep what we can
you can keep so for the operations team
you need to keep the integration job the
security job and for the dev team you
will probably have to delegate at the
beginning to consulting companies or
consultant for specialized in this a new
new programming language on new
programming ecosystems and maybe hire
dedicated team for the convert it's the
same as when you were developing for
ASAP or your ERP this will be different
teams so software as a service most of
our work dev on abs disappear this will
be out we will discover I will see
software as a service in our companies
then let's review infrastructure as a
service so here it will be really really
different infrastructure as a service
when you create your Amazon account on i
recommend you or would recommend to
anybody to create an amazon account
there is a free tier that is enough to
start to play with their cloud on it's
quite inexpensive it's quite cheap on
when you discover it it's absolutely
amazing you can start new servers
anywhere in the world in minutes so at
the beginning you make mr.
because you are not used to the
graphical user interface you can create
database in tokyo's and you're up your
linux server in East Coast on stuff like
this so it's absolutely amazing on you
have infinite storage you can start
gigabyte terabytes of whatever you want
on when the project team you have been
limited in limit ated saying log files
must not be bigger than one gigabyte or
whatever when you see this you say I
want this and it's the same for server
you can often your when you have a
project him it's very difficult to set
up a new testing environment for a QA
team on something like this here do you
just have to click on you have it so at
the beginning it's very very exciting on
you feel that everything is possible be
careful with your credit card because it
will start to cost and it's very common
to forget to stop instances on amazon
and then when you look a bit more at
amazon you feel that it's completely
depressing because you have no choice
when you look at when you want to set up
a server you can buy it to Dell to HB to
IBM to whatever they have sales team
with very good restaurants on stuff like
this you can go in Las Vegas for
conferences here you don't have this
they choose the order for you you cannot
choose the options you want to you want
intel or AMD you want one network out to
network out screen network cards on all
these complex stuff that we used to see
in private data centers here your choice
is super limited at the beginning on
Amazon you you had something like four
or five size of servers which was very
small medium large and then maybe loud
with a lot of memory that now they are
adding and adding new sizes but it's
still very very limited in comparison to
what you could have on you cannot have a
server with 250
six gigabytes of memory it's I guess
it's still not possible so when you look
deeper you can feel limited on the cloud
at the same time it's really exciting
because everything is new you have new
concept of data center new concept of
storage of hard drive so you have the
long debate because EBS amazon EBS
storage is super slow so when you want
to run a database you have to tweak
everything i have discussed with the
system administrator we said amazon EBS
performance are between very bad an
incredibly bad until you have to adapt
your tools all the way you use this for
amazon constraints network you can only
have one public IP address per server on
amazon so if you want to do ssl its
complex security you don't have the
complex of firewall it's a concept of
firewalls exactly you have the concept
of security groups which filters inbound
communication but not out bond so
everything will be new it's super
exciting amazon is iphone you have new
technologies so i will review some of
them where we will see that we can have
a lot of fun software-defined Network so
it's very hype there are many startups
insists the idea is the virtualization
of the network I'm software-defined
Network is to the network what I /
Visser is to virtualization you can
completely design your network with
pieces of code with a pice if you are on
Amazon you can play with VPC with
elastic IP security groups on VPC you
define the internet gateways ipsec
gateways it's very very fun you have a
lot of to learn I recently did a kind of
demo for cloudbees with VPN on VPC you
can then create with amazon cloud
formation which is a way to automate the
creation of your platform with this and
it's super cool but it will take your
time another tricky point on we tend to
forget it
is security rules when we were in
traditional data center we had several
layers in our data center on the
database which is very critical with
critical data was not directly visible
from the internet so a hacker at to jump
from one layer to another on to reach
your database when you go on the cloud
and when you use cloud services very
quickly all your servers are visible
yeah yeah so yeah so very quickly on
when you use a cloud you will have
critical servers on visible on the
Internet so if you use Amazon VPC which
is private cloud you can easily it but
if you want to combine services from
different service providers maybe you
want MongoDB by Mongo HQ which is a
company specialized in austin MongoDB
they will run it on their own amazon
servers so you will have is relational
problem on your servers will go through
the internet to reach your provider
servers so you will have to understand
all you have all you can link all your
servers and protect them VPC is the
solution for many use case it's more
complex than the default amazon set up
so you have something else to learn a
lot thank you but it's super exciting
it's a I have a lot of fun with VPC and
you will have to do your fire rolling on
all this so security rules will be new
then high availability rules they will
also change when you run on amazon you
don't know if two servers are in the
same rack of your data center or on
different tracks on some time its kind
of things you want to ensure for high
availability here it will not be
possible storage area network sun which
is very calm
on to have high availability on
databases if you look at them as only BS
it's slow on its not shareable so you
have a problem to FL overs and if you
want fast disk before SSDs on amazon on
provision I jobs as a first disc were
ephemeral so if Amazon decides to retire
your server or if it breaks it's lost so
you use your local disk as a kind of
cash an accelerator but it's not a
person persistent place so you have new
constraints but at the same time you
have new things that are possible is
that multi data centers are everywhere
amazon you have the concept of region so
you have us hist one us west one
different continents and then in each
region you have availability zones which
are kind of data centers or buildings
which are separated one from the other
varying dependent on this allows you to
have new patterns of high availability
because in this availabilities these
availability zones are far enough to
have strong resilience it's not the same
electricity not the same network
provider so on but they are close enough
on the very high speed network between
them so you don't have latency issues so
you have to redesign to rethink your
architecture with this and then you have
all your servers on storage which are
infinite you can have as many of them so
it's much more easy sometimes we sell
for database high availability I chose
from two nodes one active ones done by
here on amazon it's very easy to every
node or followed and we will see that
this is a place where no sequel database
are much more suited for high
availability on cloud platforms done on
the traditional database when you think
of a database persistence is done when
you save on disk so we say f sync on
disk and then it's persistent if you
look at the database like MongoDB which
is a new generation they say we can
ensure persist durability if we
replicate
on one or two other nodes on the network
so it's not a disk access but its
network access so it's a new pattern of
durability it's interesting but you have
to learn it after the I have high
availability rules you will have to
understand on to learn all the
infrastructure as code things the cloud
is completely infected by api's you can
do anything you want on Amazon with OPI
its command line interface SDK is java
sdk python sdk anyone you want and
really it's in the DNA of the cloud to
automate everything when in traditional
data center now it's very high many
people speak about chef and puppet but
there are still emerging technologies on
emerging way of managing data centers in
the cloud you must do it because your
server can be retired at any time and
you will just have two days to migrate
all this to another box or maybe it can
just disappear much more frequently than
them in private data center on here the
tool you will see it chef and puppet
which are also known in private data
centers AWS CloudFormation which is an
amazon way to combine their services
together on to instantiate them all
together amazon ops work which is a
startup that has been bought by amazon
which is integral which is around chef
ecosystem uncloudy needs that you can
also use in your private data center
which comes from ubuntu which is a way
to set up your server by your server
when it starts but on the cloud
infrastructure as a service will be key
to the success design for failure is
super hype so the best one on netflix
have invented the concept which is ghost
monkey I think the invented it so we
have beautiful pictures you can buy
t-shirts and so on on Amazon will also
communicate on this you will find super
cool presentation
on the idea is everything will fail does
it mean that the cloud is less real
reliable than traditional data center is
a network card less reliable on the
clothes and a private data center I
don't know exactly but on the cloud you
really must act thinking that your
components will fail it's not maybe it
will fail it will fail one there another
until you have to find new architectural
patterns to support this and there is a
sometimes I love for it it's designed
for failure on nothing fails which is
very beautiful but then it will require
that you completely change your way of
working Netflix what they do is that
they tell us that the regularly kill
instances anywhere on see how it works
amazon no google that says that
sometimes i unplug a complete data
center from the network on the co it how
it works on you will if you deploy on
infrastructure as a service cloud seeing
the same way think if i have a database
I can crush a server on here with
survive so you will have to learn many
thing on this also so these were new
things that operation seem
infrastructure team will have to learn
on the cloud very interesting and also
very interesting for private data
centers but a lot of work to learn them
then if we think about the development
team what will be new for them if let's
say development team use tomcat with my
sequel load balancer ssl certificate if
they run on the cloud on an
infrastructure-as-a-service the my
secret servers that they will use on
amazon if it's the same that the one
their ops team have set up in their
private data center the procedure may
not change on it may still be difficult
without automation without web portals
to manage it api's to manage it
it may no change the same for tomcat
maybe you will still have to give a long
word document to the operations team to
deploy a tomcat server or maybe it will
owe to be automated but there is no
warranty that moving on the cloud will
change the mindset of your
infrastructure team there is really a
mind set on the cloud of as a service on
when you're on Amazon you benefit of it
to start winning services the servers
and so on but the people were on top of
it do they get this mindset or not it's
their choice awfully yes on it's
inspiring so it's a great opportunity to
have it but we have no we are not sure
about it and then another thing
interesting for your project team is
that on the cloud you have the
opportunity to do more automation of
your delivery pipeline which today is
seen as very important we want to
automate deployment on many testing
servers to automate end-to-end tests
automatic load performance tests on here
on the cloud you should have more
flexibility on it's really the culture
of the cloud to do this kind of
automation so this can be an important
benefit but it's not sure that it will
be a revolution then another point on
infrastructure as a service
infrastructure as a service yet
when you're dead theme are both
migrating to cloud at the same time
teams are migrating we inherit cool yeah
so I will refresh for the microphone
what'd you say that the dev team is a
project team migrate to the cloud on
then the ops team stains a private data
center until the dev team yeah I have to
do all the operations work on the dev
team becomes DevOps because they are
completely bypassing as your
preparations on the traditional data
center on Yates yeah it's a it's a case
where cloud has been promoted by project
teams usually what I've seen it was more
project teams and left team that wanted
to completely bypass the process to be
faster and then you have a project team
developers who one who need to manage
servers then I will propose you
platform-as-a-service yeah but it's so
it's a it's an important point on it's a
dunger but I cover it a bit after which
is be careful of the extra work on if in
your dev team if you're on droid doing
infrastructure as code automating
everything it's not business value for
your applications so it's something yeah
is that the management of the opposite
of the Dead project team should be
careful about so infrastructure is
called infrastructure as a service it's
just a transition to platform as a
service when you see a data data center
company which move to infrastructure as
a service they will add more on more
services if you look at amazon they have
more than 30 services on any time soon
they will propose you database as a
service on all these kind of middle
words message-oriented middleware the
service
on today when you are on Amazon it does
not make sense to run my sequel yourself
except in very very special cases but
the general use case is that people will
just use a MySQL by Amazon because it's
a amazon knows better than anyone all
the details of the file system on stuff
like this on amazon on the service they
offer you is good enough is really
enough for you for you need so if your
organization think that she will move to
plan infrastructure-as-a-service and
then continue to do their linux tov
themself and so on very soon your that
your data center oster your yes provider
will suggest you to adopt their value
added services on which they will charge
you more but you may have many benefits
so if we summarize
infrastructure-as-a-service shall we go
to infrastructure-as-a-service yes you
suggested one approach which was a
project team development team which
first jump to it i would say
yeah so yeah yes whoo some time you
decide to jump to the cloud maybe
because you have internal constraints
for other than because you like the CPU
or whatever of the cloud but just it's a
walk around on at the end of the day you
are maybe still happy to be on the cloud
because you are also many benefits but
them the difference of culture is very
interesting so it's very valuable to go
to the cloud I think every operations
team every infrastructure team should
have amazon accounts to evaluate to
think about it to innovate to to
discover the as a service culture it
does not mean if you see it does not
mean that you will adopt it because
adopting as a service culture means to
write documentation to really give the
power to your users and when you say
deep to a DBA this time it will be the
project team we will be able to create
the database themself then it's a in
many organization it's a big cultural
change and adan which is not related
really to the cloud it's related to as a
service on going to the cloud is a great
opportunity to to discover all this but
then there are some things we should be
aware of his not endures estimating the
learning curve learning curve which is
important on something else will be
challenging to manage that you will at
the same time keep skills for
traditional data centers traditional
database management traditional network
management on new skills for cloud
management which are different and so
sometime you will have you will need
more people in your organization because
you move to the cloud on the transition
can create such kind of cost with
infrastructure as a service how to do it
an important thing on it's the same
every time when you discover something
you don't try to do the difficult thing
first if you take an old-style
application critical application with a
very strong file system dependency is a
very complex high availability mechanism
and you want to move it to Amazon on you
don't have experience on Amazon it may
be a big failure so let's use a
Greenfield infrastructure something new
simple with simple database simple
application on there are many in our
data centers the team that will be the
that could be the most successful will
probably be the team that likes chef and
puppet if you have a team who says no
person seemed would say I don't like
chiffon pie bed because I can do it
myself with my own shell script and so
on they will there are less likely to
succeed on the cloud because it's really
in infrastructure as code is in the DNA
of the cloud and then something
important will be to adapt instead of
trying to force your own style modern
your private cloud approach on the cloud
you should adapt innovate change your
procedure change your technical
solutions to fit with the cloud instead
of saying I want to do exactly the same
thing on Amazon that I do in my private
data center so they are not surprising
or incredible ideas but i think they are
important on the cloud so this was an
overview of how to emigrate to
infrastructure as a service like ec2 EBS
VPC will impact development teams on
operations team now let's move to
platform as a service at the big toe
platform as a service let's review it
it's for java developers who does java
here yeah okay so all of us we are Java
one that's good
so we could take the sample of deploying
a java application java web application
on tomcat with my sequel database a
MongoDB database search index with solar
or forgot the name of the other one
search box at i/o elasticsearch such
kind of architecture on your platform as
a service will provide you all the
tooling to just push your war file with
a bunch of properties which are
application specific parameters to
deploy sis at the beginning it's super
exciting because you deploy your
application really in minutes on I did
this on cloud-based boost for three days
I'm really you have your application
visible on the cloud it's a with a
public beautiful domain name on tone so
it works very well and it is everything
is projecting friendly because we want
to seduce you to adopt us until we are
very careful about our documentation
about the ease of use the search service
approach so for the first application is
it's really really appealing then if you
dig a bit further you can be frustrated
because you cannot actual middleware if
you love to completely change the setup
of your tomcat server to modify server
dot XML and so on here on the cloud it
will be much much more difficult if you
like to set up many binaries on your
linux box in addition to your java code
to have something better than good stuff
like this it will not be available
because we standardize the run time that
we make available to you on if we look
at the way ec2 for infrastructure as a
service has increased the scope of its
offering with yours it started very
limited on now it's you have much more
choice you will have the same thing on
platform as a service platform as a
service is younger so today our choice
is limited on we see at club is that we
are adding new features
almost every month on more flexibility
for the user for the the development
team to customize what they need
security credentials tuning uncoiling on
stuff like this on the middleware but it
will not be the same exciting place as
it was for infrastructure as a service
because as I covered you you cannot take
everything you have stronger constraints
on the cloud than in traditional data
center probably the most difficult
constraint is a former ephemeral disk so
your local drive may disappear on you
will find it on most of the cloud
offerings your servers a smaller maybe
you screwed your application design on
you need the JVMs with four or five
gigabytes of memory we can see this on
the cloud it will be super difficult to
have it so all the design patterns these
are not new design patterns but they
were existing they are just more
important on the cloud and I will cover
it a bit after with another talk that I
could recommend you so you have some
constraints but at the same time you
have a great opportunities we will offer
you best of breed technology at
cloud-based we could support glassfish
for from day one the day it was
announced we offered it to the customer
when if you look at private data center
with complex for organizations it will
be available in months and months it was
the same for WebSockets where we
supported very early on you see
tradition traditional operations team
they don't have the skills that didn't
yet have the time to train themselves on
this on they have so much time to spend
to just maintain the existing
application we are falling all the time
they are over flooded with work on there
are less time that cloud providers to
integrate this new technologies and
another thing important is that
when you look at the cloud you we work
with an ecosystem so you will combine
services for minute from any provider if
you look at something like cloudbees but
it also works with cloud foundry or a
Roku you will choose a smtp mail
provider that will be a dedicated
special company for this which will have
very sophisticated med features with
great documentation and so on if you
want full text search index you will
have solar on elasticsearch it will be
different provider but you will find one
good for each of them when in a
traditional that hasn't heard you have a
limited choice of databases usually you
are told there is just one choice or
just two choice on cloud-based will
provide various java application servers
don't get jboss jetty and so on and we
provide more choice on the cloud because
we are specialized on this it's our job
to make it work on we can compose with
partners so for this it's something that
will be very that your team will really
like is that they have the choice to
really try new technology that will be
supported on production we've seen with
no sequel something like MongoDB
development team introduced it and then
when we had to put the application on
production the ops team said but we are
not trying we are not able to support it
on a 724 basis on the cloud you will
find a service provider which will do it
for you so with this constraints on this
new opportunities let's look at the new
role for versions team for versions
teams are there is some work that
disappears because we install the
application for you we provide all the
graphical user interface scripting tools
integration with your continuous
delivery continuous integration platform
we will provide all these for you so it
will no longer be your operations teams
that will write on the script on we will
run the application for you we will run
the middleworld for you so
sorry because people can be fired and
the compensation money and yet yes it or
you will transfer the money because I
don't know is a cloud less expensive
than traditional data center sometimes
yes often know do the organization want
to move back to private data center
usually the business team don't want to
my to go back to private data center
because they they had more flexibility
on a better time to market on the cloud
so often the cloud is not less expensive
you don't earn money on the cloud
cloudbees cloudbees run on top of Amazon
so it's something funny on the cloud
that you see that everybody composed
with other underlying technologies
Dropbox relies on amazon s3 itunes for a
while relied on amazon s3 on cloudbees
relies on amazon ec2 and we have at
Kobey's we have software as a service
companies mobile application with the
wave one customer who does a weight
control a mobile application on they use
us so there are software as a service on
the users as a platform as a service
cloudbees which use amazon as an
infrastructure as a service so we we
pile the services on when you run on
amazon in theory you can run on every
amazon region which is almost all the
world now technically in fact we do not
support all the regions we would
currently support only europe on the US
east on us but we we have some locations
share in Europe and they don't want so
yeah so data privacy that has a data
privacy on the cloud we run yeah but we
run on in Europe so you will usually
find a cloud provider in Europe then is
the blinn Island good enough for you
with Microsoft thatÃ­s on terror amazon
data center then it gets more
complicated too bad I propose yet to
discuss this after so if we look at the
new roles of platform as a service for
ops some work disappear so as you say
some accounts may disappear but there
are still some jobs 24 x seven support
at the application level stills need to
be done by the people who develop the
application we will not as a platform as
a service provider we will not fix your
database index issue or your business
logic issue so this need this is a job
that remains and another thing is
reproducibility as we saw as a service
is super exciting because you can easily
create nodes on nodes or not but then
can you reproduce it which is very
important on production system and this
will be a job for the operations team to
ensure that all the things we do are
reproducible it was difficult to
reproduce in private data center because
sometimes we didn't have enough
automation it will be difficult on the
cloud because it's so easy to create new
things to create new servers then you
have to at the end of the day be careful
though I have to write what I've done or
to write the right script to automate
this and then you will keep some tricky
things like integration and network
access security sings single sign-on
provisioning on all these for you remain
on the operations team
regarding the dev team for the dev team
the change will be best practices on
design patterns as I mentioned before
you have new constraints or if not new
stronger constraint we have already been
told that the scallop architecture where
you buy you finish by buying a mainframe
maybe your java mainframe who knows but
it's not as efficient as scaling out
with small boxes on big clusters and
it's even more important on the cloud
high availability is where you design
your high availability is also something
for on which you will be more careful on
things like ephemeral file system it's
when we look at real use case having an
ephemeral file system can be quite
tricky so you will have to learn few
things on this if you are interested in
such kind of design patterns i recommend
you to see my the presentation of my
colleague nicola here will present
design pattern for the cloud in two
hours I think another thing that you
will have to learn as a project team
when you go on the cloud is the cloud
services oriented architecture it was
the idea that i mentioned to combine
services from different provider on
saying i will not reinvent the wheel i
will not implement myself i will buy the
service from somebody else and so you
have when you do this you have to choose
the right partner which will be solid
enough not to bankrupt on this happen or
unfortunately because there are startups
on it's difficult you will have to find
the right legal constraints that apply
to your organization and so it there is
a real new job of choosing cloud
services like this in addition to the
mindset to compose services we already
knew it with softwares SOA approach but
it's another step of this approach and
then one thing that will be important is
when you go to the cloud
when you are learning don't try to tweak
and everything don't try to be smarter
than your platform because you may
really have problems and you may you may
have a failure on if it's the first
project on your fail then it's a it can
be really painful for your organization
on maybe for your career so few ideas to
go on the cloud first is
platform-as-a-service let's go for
project team it's it's really
interesting to faster the development to
have better time to market it's a great
accelerator great place to innovate and
it's a great place to learn this as a
service approach where you can really
give the power to the user also here
when you're on platform as a service
what we see is that secure a team can
deploy versions of their applications
where they want in the past it or eat QA
team at to ask to develop on team on two
or two ops team please i want to test
this version and so on on the platform
as a service for providing a photo
mission to let this power to the QA team
for example would you like a lot because
they can go faster on tests more things
and so on how to do it let's take one
more time a green field application
let's not take a old strats one
application with a lot of file system
dependencies don't take an application
that relies on the local leucine but
take care something with solar or
elasticsearch don't take something that
a complex egb to application because you
will not find easily an e gb to
container on the cloud gb3 sever its
really available but ers are more
difficult to deploy on the cloud so a
new pretty simple application the type
of team that will be the most successful
is probably the team's full of
lightweight applications we think that
Java has been to fight in the past on
that it should be simpler as these
people are more able to be up here on
the clouds they will feel less
constrained on they will play with it
more than rejecting them on them as well
innovate adapt your procedure on your
technical solution don't try to
reproduce what you did in your private
cloud in your private soria
infrastructure so this was the changes
that will that you're you're Devon ops
team will face on public cloud pass
platform-as-a-service now i will quickly
cover private cloud i will start with a
disclaimer cloudbees does not believe in
private cloud on i am an employee of
cloud be so this is an opinion i am not
an independent consultant but when you
want to install a private cloud in your
organization you will install the
software and it's a very complex
software that will cover many pieces
storage virtualization software
configuration management like chef / bet
on top of it dns security firewalls
network configuration all this is
integrated in a cloud approach if you
want to do something like easy to where
you you need to have a dns as a service
you need to have virtual private network
as a service or subnets as a service
virtualization as a service you need to
combine all these and this is much much
more complex than traditional software
on all these technologies are brand new
if in the past you had problem to
upgrade from one version of your
database to another or of your
application server your operating system
be careful on the cloud you will really
need to patch very quickly if your
vendor or tells you
there is a fix and then there is
something can we succeed when you look
at amazon when they do their cloud they
choose hardware network everything all
the components are chosen for their
software automation part when if you
take your private cloud will you be
ready to change your network switches
because they are not of the same brand
that OpenStack has validated will you be
happy to change your servers because you
took HP on openstax works better with
let's tat dell will you be happy to
change from exam virtualization to kvm
or to vmware or whatever but a project
like OpenStack try to keep a
compatibility matrix between an
incredible number of components because
it automates all these components on
this is super difficult we know that
VMware has been able to maintain a huge
compatibility matrix to virtualize just
the odd where but not the net network
and it has taken years on yours to do it
OpenStack it's not a company it's an
open source project and it's completely
new on it's much more complex will they
be able to maintain this compatibility
matrix on to do all the fixes in their
software automation layer to under this
another approach is that you have cloud
company which sells you cloud appliance
you start as the smallest clients are
costs $500,000 but then at least all the
hardware on the software are completely
integrated together gian three costs on
three price will be several million
dollars when on Amazon you start with
your credit card for a few hundred
dollar per month so it's it will vary
be2 it's an incredible challenge to to
have this working and set up and then to
run it because the software is more
complex we see ad cloudbees that we have
many things to take care of about
platform-as-a-service infrastructure
because sometimes rfu bleaches on we
have 7 24 people who are here to fix
this when you discuss with people from
amazon from google and tone it's the
sense of very skilled engineer to
maintain this you will have to maintain
something more complex in your private
data center so if you choose to go
private cloud you will it will be a very
important change for your operations
team primarily for the operations team
on the subject is very new so I I think
today there is no well known success of
big private cloud we will see which time
I with uh oh it goes but you will be you
will really discover a new territory
maybe to what we do probably you might
even call it more like a hybrid car
because some of it it's not done
entirely by their own IT but with the
help of companies like HP and IBM so
some of it is they own their own data
centers but it is maintained by people
from other components oil so yeah what
you say is so what you do is you I will
refresh for the mic is that you you work
with big vendors like IBM or HP or so on
who come with a cloud infrastructure
solution on you make it working for your
organization yeah yeah ok on Amazon you
can have dedicated hardware for you if
you want I think in cases because HP and
those other big windows had problems
with providing the virtual images as
fast as we would need so I think some of
the departments are evaluating that
already already yeah ok but it's a many
organization want to go there on a it
makes its reason number because it's a
way to reuse all the assets all your
data center but the challenge will be
very very big
was a its infrastructure to you yeah
