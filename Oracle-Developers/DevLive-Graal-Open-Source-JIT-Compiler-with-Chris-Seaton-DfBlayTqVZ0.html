welcome to article their life here that
article called London on a cold London
day I have with me I'm your host Javed
Muhammad and I will with me Christian
so this welcome this happened in from -
and those of us sometimes the best
interviews you can have so I understand
you working on growl which is an open
source a JIT compiler so talk to me a
little bit about that what's a there was
a little give it a little backdrop
behind it and everything good talk into
some of the more specifics well there's
lots different languages of one on top
of the JVM and there always have been
besides Allah light languages like Ruby
and Python and ah what we're trying to
do is improve support for those
languages we're doing that in quite a
radical way what we're doing is taking
the the JIT compilers you get inside the
JVM I was taking that outside the JVM
and rewritten it in Java okay because
that's then written in Java we can use
it like a Java library and we can use it
more directly than you can omit JVM
bytecode normally and we can give better
support for these languages by directly
using the the legit compilers inside the
JVM so it's just a more faster efficient
way of yeah in a revolutionary way to
support
kovin language on the JVM go sit before
with a language like Ruby you had to go
through quite a lot of Hoops and sort of
bend over backwards in order to run it
on the JVM you had to try and admit JVM
bytecode that sort of looks a bit like
Java but was running the Ruby it's very
complicated and what we've done is we've
made it very easy to support a language
like Ruby or JavaScript by giving the
people implementing these languages much
more power to do it so giving them
direct control of how the internals of
the JVM JIT compiler works so they can
more directly implement the languages
and we've had really big success with
this so the the implementations we've
got these languages on the JVM
are the same sort of performances you
get with a highly tuned implementation
of a language done on its own okay
our implementation of JavaScript is
about as fast as the v8 implementation
script my implementation of ruby is
around 10 times faster than the standard
implementation surface yeah these are
really big performance different choices
okay and what's boy done with relatively
little effort so our inference ation of
ruby was done with an originally just
one intern working on their own for a
few months and now it's a slightly
larger team that's still very small I'm
not gonna follow this all intern yeah
the fast rotation of Ruby there is done
by this this really small group of
people okay and we hope that this means
that you'll be able to get more
languages on the JVM easier to do and
easier to make them really fast and it
means people be more free to experiment
with new ideas for languages because you
can implement them relatively easy on
the JVM but for them to be really fast
and we hope this means that it'll sort
of herald a new polygon world where
people are more free to use whichever
language is best for their need but it's
still one of the JVM and still get
really high performance okay so if a
developer wants to check it out what's
the beds are like an SDK is they build
on the Oracle technology Network it's
open search on any search engine for OTN
growl vm you'll find it and now that
that includes everything you want in one
package together JVM which is slightly
modified and you get our languages which
come with that but it's also open source
so github com4 slash growl vm all the
source code is on there you can see how
it all works
it's fascinating actually because
normally the JIT compiler is invisible
to Java programmers because ours written
in Java you can actually go and poke
around and look in the source code and
get sort of idea of what's going on it's
quite a fun thing to go and look around
it ok so the only sounds very exciting
just the fact that you could you can go
about doing all of these things better
faster what do you think like is this
going to allow new kind of applications
to be developed that we never envisioned
or like well as chemical can be kind of
the this kind of a sweet spot for a file
for grow I think what it'll enable is
enable people to use whichever language
they think is best and they want to so
the moment if you pick a language you
need to think about what language helps
me write my program fest
so if I'm doing statistics and I've want
to write an R but R is usually really
slow so you feel like I can't use that
even though I want to because it's too
slow it doesn't it operate
other languages hopefully this won't
mean that people can start use whichever
language they want and not worry about
the performance because if all languages
can have a good performance running on
top of our system
okay well Chris it sounds very exciting
keep on growling and thanks for coming
by and thanks for tuning in to article
dev lives don't go away we still should
have at least a couple of more sessions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
