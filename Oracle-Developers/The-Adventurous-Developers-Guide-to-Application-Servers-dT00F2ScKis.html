to my session this was this is actually
an intro to a report that I thought
would be very very very very good to
have here as my as my opener so this is
the adventurous developers guide to app
servers thanks for coming first of all a
shameless plug about my company who
allow me to come and present at places
like here all around the world and and
talk about non product stuff so please
support sessions like this by going to
zero turn around and buying all their
products so your speaker me I'm Simon
maple I've only just got a voice still
after three days on a zero turn around
booth plenty of parties and drinking so
after this session my last session I can
just go away and hide in a corner for a
week but I'm sorry maple I used to work
for IBM I was a developer for 10 12
years on websphere application server
although now I have joined the awesome
zero turn around so I am a neutral and I
can say anything about any app server
and get away with it now yes and let's
listen I wanted to kind of gauge where
everyone here is so I'd like to
understand a little bit about my
audience so one thing I'd like to do is
take a quick poll for if you could put
your hands up when I asked if you're
using each of these app servers and if
you're happy with each of these app
servers so let's start with tom cat
who's using tomcat wow that's like
ninety-five percent of people person and
keep your hand up if you're a happy with
tomcat 75 and jetty who's using jetty
surprisingly few about ten percent and
who's happy with jetty at eleven percent
happy
okay that's that's about ten percent as
once that's pretty good glassfish who's
using glassfish about ten percent again
and who's happy with glassfish but Apes
and the Liberty profile IBM Liberty
profile one guy at the back to people
about one percent and you guys eat you
happy with the Liberty profile that's
very sad jboss oh okay about twenty
percent jboss and happy of jboss haha
i'll just put 15 websphere full profile
works for app server pretty good about
15 and happy with websphere i love it
happy together okay wow that's fast
interested so if I getting is drafted
gave up popcap a very very good ratios
to musings and unhappy yeah websphere
weblogic not too much to that we got
more people develop a point of view or a
nut importantly let's get both okay so
let's go since it's awesome to to get
that information so just start a start
the basic that's not at all what whose
application this is mr. education itself
a lot of people say if you are getting I
have paper leave in this case to go to
someone knows everything about need an
orifice not only does the one place for
13 place wikipedia now wikipedia says in
Java platform enterprise edition maybe
use defines the core set of a piccc to
drive our patient if you want to be a
job app server thank you what well but i
just read about i say that if you Oh
cigar up tasting then the service I'd
love it except request you can get quite
a response you're serving an application
request therefore you are an application
you're an application server if you
serve those God so these are the
application servers we are going to be
looking at today tomcat getting drafted
Lynch profile and gave us the two
glaring omission from the lift with our
website cases server pulpo crop and by
blogging and originally lose when we
visit this document or
rather lattice content speaking of zero
turn around we include them get them
short yes if you have a Pinot a day
early unfortunately in most categories
they little drunk very very loose behind
everyone else do you really want to be
that person you know these features of
production style architecture mission
college they can develop approaches the
reporter I mentioned is read aloud
reports actually towards the great after
debate and we take each application
server and we can we go to whole bunch
of mess let me take a look at each one
of you just forgive you development for
the beauty developers wouldn't you
rather than from we're going to be doing
a production equivalent property and
we're going to be releasing that we do
in december or early next year although
given how good the performance actually
going to do that might actually be a
reprieve anytime but then you do the
finish it we good developers hope care
about I'm sure that he didn't have a
look at each one of these sections and
we're going to run every application
what you do that at the end we're going
to we're going to a little bit fuller to
lose that a conservative estimate we
would be to be area most important you
I'm going to evict application server
this room collectively you would
actually shoot what I think I need Wi-Fi
if you have a hit so with this off with
with download and installation from the
developer point of view diogenes lazily
is you know possibly the biggest first
husband it doesn't take much to another
developer 50-knot needs a very very
motivated pieces when I'm trying to
download and try to find her
actually my focus so typically those
three things with you first of all find
and download secondly unpack forum tools
certain actually get started it's just a
to take very very much right when you
look at the full list of the app server
that we're looking at their up these
very very good pretty much all of them
were due to be smaller than a journal if
it's done today boxes in that I can be
slightly bigger but you get to become a
paroxysm I'm one of the cool event is
that too much work is that under
security because those 18 relationship
if you looking at IBM will play a
Bolivar you actually have a product
to enjoy your foot there's the
installation manager download you saw
your exciting matter then you trying to
fool anyone to let their paper and
install that production it up keep it
right that is why possible but in the
development point is you suck your you
don't want to download all it so minute
runtime is the new lightweight version
it whip it didn't size does not there's
no split an apt a conservative as more
than so small of it is if it's not it is
very turbulent home the way we see me
download files maybe the donation are
not not an appetizer good very very
systems whether you put in eight net
down over my objections on time whether
it goes with 15 is our most hits 25 or
50 great feature for example edit this
is really not a little racing next very
little bit of a few much about that so
while sighs it is awesome right you
don't want like to download you Dena
Webb butter cookies
registrar-se to London the other reason
because the grill the one what we have
downloaded for you did nothing hotter
that thing to do is easy how we did it
start if they're a really simple plain
starter no matter what is their company
I'm coming thats pretty ladies but not
really please stop get down no one right
so yeah that was an unrelated but you
probably should have ended okay but it
seems to be really really start over in
a bin directory capitalist and if it's
true I got ya got identity awesome ruff
any mrs. Keough as soon as I
like excellent now let me pick you up on
the hood so this is 50 cultivated
o'clock we have a bigger to a little
creatures are yeah I don't want to
anyone have to eat add up and out
looking to go without do feed it to a
first what we need it to the third of
the job well this is just what I mean as
I mean it activates up towards
gratefully do a lot with it but at the
start with your own summer server yes
good acting right now are happy to help
manual in any hitch hey your heart are
very pretty good yeah it was a new
problem but now he returned here this
video I want to show your output
certificate will download as doc so from
that page are there to do this second
here I jump back hit download cicerone
Utley download via version 7 a scotch at
my throat downloaded and written it turn
up front row go to the bin directory got
clever 40 seconds from not even being a
du du pape having a running from
Catherine or mother at five seconds if
you wanted to drop a drop an application
to whether 15 seconds from thrush to
eternity absolute certain application
that's the world we live in today at you
see as some of those two straight up any
years ago with a big about a percentage
of it but what if you concentrate up
don't be so places first foreign
Jesse absolutely
best two out of three small brief it
under control perfect jboss and his
profile jboss precise is there anything
about hundred makeover and Rebecca into
but again Eugene's with limited profile
the one by Taylor attack they can escape
out of a 15x15 extra lives are pretty
impressive that's a real great job and
miss clothes off as you did with you
like they do because they straighten up
a little bit over the one back hair i
had about mrs. press off is my i cannot
lead and except arising squeeze twice
once on download and one for them good
happen that is it is easy to accompany
with really great idea darkest that's in
half literally the degree air happen and
elizabeth profit-making to installation
they do a potential negative script
script will actively prison would get in
too much all of them very very okay
let's move on to tools for the to
support is a very very good to get any
that are claiming is rattle whether you
eat alligator clips that leave the
disparate i'm not going to the dentist
accident
still no one close so children very very
important and one is talking about for
that we're not just talking about your
listen to how we typically that much
before it is the star hackers start/stop
run out of her obviously rather toxic
food but for many of our tip calculator
download 1536 this is one of a remark
which is a gravity so I don't Italy but
it's pretty fun download humor
understood I'm going to get really sick
the other cool reported maybe or above
any other choice and a lot of the app
servers in the PDF cut from those you do
these for your app i'll create the
country's good intent yeah a lot of
management space from your videos photos
per person so as far as our tools to
those clothes and cat and they look and
socket oakley higher should not really
much beautiful little ever got from
purchases of the flip in that's big
differences between the shortcut to make
it quick so because you're a developer
it is you want to change their I do okay
okay people don't very often if it
doesn't use Twitter pages don't you
fight rd
I'm really dirty tights justice justice
fat you're you're idly feel if you're
slippery so what a big project is to
that particular what if which to do to
me very often I bien shop to have rat
very often or whether the abilities of
our lost when clear because support for
a quick is very very few corporate
holiday all those other projects which
are available let these correctly so the
droppings camp it was really got that
kind of app service is taking your
height and get a look from a little bit
wicked where the support using between
covers about very very very server
configuration
those that accomplished back quite a
rate it it's not just about how we do
that yes no it's not just about how easy
it is to kangaroo how much is honest my
deal with those changes were at TD
Garden thank everyone who's acting that
way but you love it the factories battle
circus there are many cupcakes living in
the past this you got a bit over they
say right everyone nothing right we're
going to have directory structure hat
with its know what you will attend a
specification extra do you do sir your
food we give you quite deserted have fun
exactly which smile you could say I'll
take that file and use rather out this
bed I'll taking vintages have over it's
hard as a little look even worse xml and
new because it really about offensive
odor configuration you go to lose you
yet another on a very section elbow
toward evil power won't do these s where
do you have an xml file and get change
the default value in fact so when you
want to maintain erection al-kahf did
not look huge amount of real the middle
the word of of figuration that they are
paid to fit idea let me care about
adherence all right i'll show you want
oh this is here i've got a clip with the
profiling tool and this is just that IBM
long way that sinful perform you prefer
the liberty profile
the Liberty profile goes about this XML
to go home if you haven't got it in bits
Eagle xml file this is all the XML to
fall of configuration and you are not
just that but if you want to take
anything you see the runs one hit up in
our faces of life without a nap so let
me give you a jump further into my
design I can see my future manager and
set a few I wanted to add a feature in
there Phillips ad Vinny see let's add a
bit to get there going to be a good I
just can okay I save that and I come so
now running we now live with it oh you
okay I turn in vase and compiler
services are you happy really good and
this is why it's why the minister
profile do so well a lot of the other
app service they AG be populated it's
relatively insulated and parameter
certain something differently here than
they seem up it is it but never
interferes with the recommendation is
happened which need requires a lot of
reading up as a lot of a lot of it
okay documentation and easy
no toxic music again before you destroy
described one minute ago we look at docs
when when you in the war room were about
to come finna go why they're having is
happy I don't know we we at them at that
point why that one through the door I
don't care I don't care how many trying
to add to your bookmarks locations great
reputation placing the one place you
always start when you look at the
documentation is using a public view so
we played out of that allows doodle
overlords and he says please help you
discover a typically 30 places where you
don't find your arms because it confuses
the network and online actual it
actually target distance reputation cuz
of how things fit community tells you
what you ought to need to change to get
it to it and I think it's very very
relaxing look that's to do with to the
sky bar that got you which version or
wittstock way up you've got their
diseases very often it's you know they
fit the skin number this will be easily
that service that's good we're not
talking about oh I want to cover they
help you actually
bring this ward where you find an
exception find out we're going to delay
that exception client Isis uses a porous
at this same often maybe show me exactly
what to it be pushing it into position
as effective if it's not available bad
this much presentation about how it
works what it's good if you're fishing
isn't it really that is working entire
full and you need to find other history
there doc beauty 101 pick any contact
okay that's it it is using I want to do
is like the most privacy look there and
I'm not just on top that's right if you
have a problem that you either in
railway and this isn't it if it's
important because they're very opposite
with their strong and tough you know you
can't be can't wait to lock it were
about to make you wet market copyright
or whatever thing is about that beauty
is the darkest I forgot to get which are
very very picky they don't really have
to say what you want hitters are you
feeling duty to get a little intense and
if it will be later on
and property so what is lower than an
analytical ah i DNT strike to the growth
market so everyone everyone please kiss
me guess you although it does have a
large community one can you that is a
lot a lot you looking to other what it
is is there i'm going to epcot an update
not see what I we do that yeah right up
in torment is reason because when it
comes down to a developer very very
often rugby and adaptive you get very
positive and good care about play with
care about numbers right about how to
get a cheap there's some like to move on
from what they could be so to create a
bunch of metrics do run from my weather
consists of a gram
the region here are some numbers you
will not know this is an epic sat atop
an empty service stop and really you
might as well just have that same either
way we're looking into anything between
one if you're waiting an extra one hour
sessions and the station and that
nothing really Wow chef server startup
repair clinic include have any kid who's
got a server startup and server we start
trying very very the idea ministers my
talk is very very well we'll see like
making the yeah i mean in pvp started a
little bit of the prize-giving you have
too much a blog with the arkamada
vendors come back useless now gossip and
it does very little bit disappointed
with this person which country you like
but it is an interesting perspective
jennifer i'm also i think want to do
that spring in it at the rules to want
figure out you get stinky
but again again mr. so-called sorry very
quick oh just behind it but you know
we're not looking a huge well no
actually I suppose we are looking at a
huge amount there that's pretty much not
going to double time the the figures in
bold are the number of seconds should
said this urgently the numbers in bold
are the number of seconds at the app
server took to perform this task where
we have our plus figure as the number of
seconds extra the other app servers took
ok so what about the deploy time
obviously deploys and redeploys hurts us
in development we want to spin between a
development code now test code as
quickly as possible so how long does it
actually take to deploy Liberty profile
again very very quick and deeply saying
you know when I dropped something into a
web app directory how long how long is
it before i can actually you know send a
request to it when is the winners the
consort flick up and say hey this up
this is ready you can you can ping it at
this address now so only a second for
the for the deploy different three
I pet clinic and anything from around
eight to eight to thirteen jboss
suffering slightly there as well okay so
now we're talking about indications and
this is how we actually see a slide for
the liberty profile and the reason why
it was so quick before and a fair bit
slower now is all about a bigger or lazy
initialization here we can see from tom
cat to the rightness that these are all
the actual figures now the actual
numbers in seconds tom cat to the right
we're looking in around the same corner
same kind of ballpark anything from
around seven to ten seconds 11 12 for
for pet clinic liberty profile a little
bit longer not so bad but when we look
at the Jenkins app we're actually flying
over we're flying over anything from
double tomcat a little bit more than
jboss and the reason here is the liberty
profile when it actually grabs an
application and puts it you know deploys
it it's not actually doing any of the
initialization code it pushes that until
the first implication of your
application or of your of your app so as
a result these are the kind of numbers
which we actually care about because
these are the numbers which are going to
be doing you know our full end-to-end no
one's going to no one's going to deploy
it up and not use it right right now I
have talked to the WebSphere guys
obviously because X IBM so I have a lot
of contacts there and they have actually
improved a lot of the a lot of the
initialization code pull that pull that
in slightly and in version 5 a version
855 these numbers these numbers are
actually a lot lower I haven't haven't
verified these numbers yet although I
will get to it at some point but when
you get the slides there's a link there
to some of the increased numbers or
improve numbers should i say so how are
we looking for performance these this
this is my only table which isn't in
order so Tom car is taught Tomcat did
really well pretty much throughout next
up it was very very close between jboss
and glass fish
jette only slightly behind but
realistically all four of these were
waiting around you know the the right
time Liberty profile stop it a little
bit in this one there are a couple of
other switches you can put in to certain
you know to change your initialization
so that you do an early initialization
but but it's not changing numbers hugely
but yeah 855 doesn't prove that greatly
whole zero turn around we haven't talked
about them so here's my intermission
slide so zero turn around have a product
called J rebel this is a small pitch
terrible is a tool which means a lot of
these performance numbers I just blown
out of the water you don't need to do
your build redeploy sometimes app server
restart with jerryl you actually think
your code in your IDE directly to your
runtime so that when you change your
code you're effectively hot swapping
your these classes in reloading these
classes in your runtime instantly so you
can literally code go to your browser
hit f5 and you see your new code that
you literally just coded live in your
running instance and this is this is
really really important from it from a
development productivity report me and
my me and my CEO got drunk earlier this
week and we were trying to work out how
many lives we save in just in pure time
the the free Marge a rebel has actually
saved over 82 years now which is one
developers life for all users of durable
I think and this is bedridden I think we
save around one developers life every
two weeks so yeah we save lives right
back to the script features soap
when we talk about features it really
depends on your application type we
could pretty much entirely split this
room as to how important features are
two people if you are a true pure je
lover and you don't want spring you
don't want anything else you just want
to use pure je e then some of the larger
application servers which which provide
the big Java here big full EE java then
these are absolutely essential because
otherwise you're going to spend your
life maintaining an application server
with loads nodes of plugins loads nodes
of glue code just trying to achieve that
the configuration you want the smaller
application service have got obviously
websphere full profile websphere
weblogic wit sorry we're here websphere
weblogic we have glass fish we have
jboss all full je compliant but is that
what you actually want how many of you
actually going to start up this full je
e server and actually just use servlets
or something like that you also have web
profile which is a much much kind of
cut-down version and the Liberty profile
now supports this in inversion in
version 855 you also have no that's it
and then tom cat and jetty I believe I
just below it's pretty much kind of more
of a servlet and JSP container you also
have West fear jboss and glass fish all
supporting osgi so you can actually
develop your applications modular e
module early and deploy as OS joy
applications great it's one it's another
thing that if you're not using it it's
just something else which is running on
your environment one of the service the
Liberty profile actually breaks this
down even further in that when you
actually start your application server
up you actually choose which features
you want to run so if you're not using
if your application isn't using it then
you don't need to load it i can see i
predict other application servers
following in this kind of vein whereby
we're not looking at the application
server why would we why would we care
about our infrastructure like that we
care about the application and
we need to model our infrastructure on
our application because that's what's
important to us that's what that's what
we're delivering so we should find our
application and then in a fine-grained
way so what is our application one or we
will need we need jazz peas we need to
me JB's and then we build up our
infrastructure like that i can see that
is going to be more and more popular in
the coming years I mean you know that
there are there are many many
application servers that have been over
engineered that have had loads nodes of
different pieces of functionality
crammed in while I actually would really
love a penknife like that just to say
I've got a pen knife which is about two
feet wide realistically you know in fact
even small pen nose right you only use
the knife right yeah it's a lot of
overhead that we don't need so features
are no as compatibility OS compatibility
is a no-brainer really I mean pretty
much all the all the features all the
app servers that we looked at all
supported kind of open source api's and
and and it's important to everyone I now
I think everyone knows that jboss in
glassfish absolutely topped with with
full support for the world Liberty
profile was next at the time of this
report it didn't support I actually used
85 so it didn't support web profile now
it does that maybe could jump a little
bit higher and then tom cat and jetty
underneath there really are there really
kind of servlet containers and JSP
containers although that said who in
this room uses tomcat by itself without
any any plugins or Dino adaptions to it
ok a good number but so who doesn't who
adds loads of stuff on to tomcat ok a
few people so you know that there's
another app server that I wanted to talk
about here which was Tommy ye I don't
know if it is David blevins in the room
no Tommy e is a version of tom cat was
not a version of tom cat it's an
adaption of tom cat so it's an Apache
product project
which takes Tomcat it wants to preserve
all of the benefits that Tomcat gives
you the simplicity the speed and the
ease of use but it wants to provide a
full web profile environment and that's
what it does it does this for you it
adds things like I think it's got a ejb
support it's that it's the web profile
supported version of Tom cut if you
hadn't had if you haven't had a look at
it or if you have an interest who hasn't
heard of Tommy II quite a few people
okay so take a look it's actually a
really really interesting product or
project and a great benefit to the
Tomcat community because you know
obviously because so many servers like
tc Server like T cat and so on make use
of tomcat you also make use of the
Tomcat community so so you know it's
something that should really be looked
at closely I've been in management UI is
this is quite an interesting one because
it depends on the it very often depends
on the developer who's using the the app
server so how much they actually care
about this I think in my mind but I
would say most up most developers would
only care about the XML go hack the XML
come back is it working but some people
some people do use to use admin console
this is I've got to admin consoles here
one is the Tom cup and the one just to
the right of it is jetty jetty doesn't
have an admin console so Jesse's not
going to score too well on this one but
this is the Tomcat one it's actually
quite limited you can install
applications restart applications but
then yeah there's little else of actual
actual main users from a configuration
point of view you really need to dip
into the XML here we've got the jboss in
the GlassFish environment so jboss
top-left glassfish bottom right these
are these these were the most feature
rich environments and easy to use
environments that we that we saw you can
pretty much it well I mean you know this
is this is red hat and an Oracle now
right so you know
you can pretty much do anything you want
through the admin console and equally do
that in a command line and equally do
that in probably some other API some
other interfaces you know you get you
get the full end-to-end spectrum of ways
to do things and this is the Liberty
profile now the Liberty profile doesn't
have an admin console but what it does
have is a really good way of being able
to create your XML and change your XML
in your development environment so you
can actually do all that in your IDE so
while it isn't admin console it is kind
of your your management environment so
you can either hack the XML will use
this in fact if you see at the very very
bottom here we've got design and source
the design is this view so it's kind of
like a deployment descriptor style
editor but the source you actually see
the XML so you know that it's nice and
easy you can configure anything you want
through here I can't remember why we
gave jetty to I think it was because of
the just like integration in scripting
and integration with with with some of
the other tooling that you can actually
edit the xml tomcat and Liberty profile
we gave three two very different ways of
administering and managing but they're
you know they're both I mean maybe even
live to profile we could give it an
extra half because you can do a lot more
jboss and glassfish both very very good
we dropped glassfish a half it was a bit
cheeky really we couldn't bring
ourselves to even give jboss five
because we felt it was a little bit from
the 70s as a kind of a pia as a kind of
visual effect and we didn't want to give
anything from the 70s 5 out of 5
unfortunately so maybe a bit harsh but
about that alive ok cost and licensing
the biggie now cost is cost is an
interesting metric because you can you
can view cost in different ways you can
view cost in terms of money and you can
view cost in terms of how much
maintenance how much you know manpower
how much
poor your environment needs at the end
of the day it's both dollars so from a
development point of view everything's
absolutely free as you'd expect because
no one's going to pay money no one in
their right mind will charge for a
development environment developers a
king's these days and so companies
vendors people want to give you know
code development code development
applications and observers to developers
to get it in people's hands to get to
build that development community
production changes a little bit from Jay
buzz point of view you've got EAP and
you've got you've got the Oracle
glassfish server and the WebSphere
Liberty profile actually charges I
believe it did a certain a year ago when
I where their charge the same amount as
as their full profile at base server
license wise jetty and tomcat really
rule there with their apache2 license is
really really really nice licenses and
obviously at the bottom you've got the
the commercial horrible Buy in and don't
sleep licenses so cost and licensing
jetty in tomcat obviously taught with
with glassfish as well Liberty profile
and jboss being a little bit more
commercial dropping slightly there
forgot about this load so there's an
elephant in the room there are two
elephants in the room I shouldn't call
them elephants we have weblogic and we
have websphere and we have ignored them
up till now but we can't we can't ignore
them any further because your company's
maybe IBM houses they may be oracle
houses and therefore a decision has been
made that you guys want to use Liberty
you guys when you use websphere full
profile or weblogic in your production
environments which is great they're
great they're both great production
environment service however you have to
co against them as your developers you
need to code against them and you've got
some options you can either bite the
bullet and have the full profile of
WebSphere or
or the full weblogic on your development
environment you can use a cut-down
version so you could use the good use
the liberty profile in your in your
development or you could use maybe
something like glass fish in your in
your development and then push to
weblogic you do get some risk they're
pushing up into it up into your
production environment but you know it's
better than doing something like tom cat
and going and entirely moving away from
the Golden Path using tomcat or jetty
and then pushing into websphere or
pushing into oracle weblogic download an
installation yeah I don't think I've got
much personal information left after
after signing up to these to these
programs and downloading weblogic and
websphere they pretty much took all my
information from work from a download
point of view weblogic actually did very
very well with their down with their
developer edition of weblogic like i
think it was 300 and meg just going by
memory i think it's 300 meg and will
confirm that three hundred mega yeah 300
meg fit for the for the environment and
you know you have you have a good
environment you have full support then I
try to download web burn as much as it
pains me there were there were up first
I thought ah it's only a gig in size
and then i read this horrible part which
said part 1 of 3 and this is this is
without the installation manager and I
thought okay okay let's download it so
yeah 3 gig later and I had a development
environment of Webster on my machine
essentially the big difference between
websphere for developers and websphere
is purely licensing good thing and a bad
thing good thing is you know when you
move up to your production environment
you're running in exactly the same code
base and interestingly the Liberty
profile does use a lot of the same code
as full profile the containers and
things are similar but yeah you have to
download installation manager and you
have to download three gigs worth I'm
not going to talk about rad at six gig
that's another story but you know a lot
the time you people have to bite the
bullet and do this in terms of config
changes and things like that the admin
consoles were good enough to you know
there's plenty of features in WebSphere
and weblogic the admin consoles were
both very similar in terms of how you
actually go about changing obviously
with the bigger app servers the bigger
config models you couldn't need to start
recycling servers more often so the
results the long awaited results these
are the full results of each of the
sections and we can see from that that
jboss never read drops below a 4 which
is very very interesting glassfish only
suffers in a couple of places and
download an installation and server
config tomcat only suffers in a couple
of places the the features as it being a
only a web profile support and also the
admin console but pretty close at the
top if we actually look at this as a
graph this is a scaled graph if we
actually look at this we've got Top
three within a within a point so
realistically you know these are the
kind of these are the kind of numbers
that we look at and think well how is
this relevant to me because I don't rank
all of these metrics at the same level
so what I want to do is understand which
are important to me and therefore then
say these are my weightings and this is
my application server so it so the
question is what do you really care
about and this is what I think I may
need some Sun Wi-Fi yes
can I claps up to the Wi-Fi here for
aquifer and what's the password well I
heard that open world 2013 well okay
we're in okay so what we're going to do
now is we're going to we're going to see
which of these sections are most
important to you guys and as a result
we're going to see we're going to see
the scores this is my actual doc as to
as to how i did this organism going to
see which which of the scores are most
applicable to you so going to go to each
of these download and installation who
thinks download installation for you as
a developer is most important hi if you
hype medium and low okay lo takes that
one tooling support high medium and low
okay odd between high medium plaything
high server configuration high medium
low medium takes that one real
performance metrics so speed of
development process is high hi
features an open standards compliance
high medium low high medium medium
documentation and community hi hi I've
men and caught admitted management high
medium low low high cost and licensing
high medium low and that was high okay
we have our scores now I'll put this in
a very pretty diagram for you here we
have it your winner for this session is
Tomcats
jboss and glass fish are very very close
second Liberty profile in fourth and
jetty bringing up the rear thank you for
listening to this is this is all taken
from a rebel labs report that rebel
rousers the content division of of zero
turn around you can grab a whole load of
technical reports from there including
loads of stuff from Java 8 JVM languages
dev productivity reports we've just
released one of them the great
application server debate is the report
which this session was based off so you
can download the PDF there for free of
course if you wanted to use me as a
resource you can follow me on twitter
follow my all my rantings SJ maple and
please tweet me let me know how how the
session was what we can prove what was
rubbish what's up and that's it so I
hope you enjoyed the session if you
thought it sucked and you want to claim
your 60 minutes back you can get a Jay
rebel trial license and you can you can
redeem your time back through j rebels
