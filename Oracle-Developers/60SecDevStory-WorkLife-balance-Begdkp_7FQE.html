Twitter and one thing that's important
to me and and it's mainly because or
because of that I live in Hawaii so I
carry a lot about work-life balance and
I think especially people in the IT
industry and Silicon Valley they feel
they have to perform all the time and
they have to work a lot and and work
late hours and and you know work 60-hour
weeks I don't think that's very
productive so my approach is very
different I work I work when what I feel
like I can do productive work I take a
break when when I don't feel it it's
like the as we heard earlier today it's
about you think about a problem and you
try to fix the problem and you can't do
it until you make a break you know you
go off you do something completely
different you clear your mind and
suddenly the the solution will come to
you so that's something very important
to me and that's that's what I do and
how I live by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
