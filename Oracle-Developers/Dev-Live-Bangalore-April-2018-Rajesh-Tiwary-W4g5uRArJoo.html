back this is Jim Griz anzio from oracle
codon in benkler and I'm here with
Rajesh Tiwari yes welcome thank you and
Rajesh you're a developer at Oracle yes
and what do you do so I will look at the
article IDC Bangalore I'm part of the
JDBC team here so our team basically
develops standard JDBC driver for Oracle
database in addition we also develop
tools around the JDBC ecosystem for
example I'm the lead developer for a
project called Oracle data source for
Hadoop that that is a tool that you can
use to connect Hadoop and and related
technologies like hive and pig with
Oracle database in a reliable efficient
and and most importantly secured manner
so that is the kind of work I do I quote
primarily in Java in scala cool and
you're based here in Bangalore I am
based here in Bangor yes is this your
first this is my first Oracle code yes
but I've been to Java one before oh yeah
up in Hydra battery in Hyderabad ok so
you mentioned JDBC yes earlier you
understand you just had a session on
this yes what is JD's actually what's a
JDBC next so exactly JDBC next JDBC next
it's just our way of talking about how
JDBC API is may evolve in the future so
what I'm talking about here is a
completely new way of connecting to the
database in a completely asynchronous
manner so this is a new API we call it a
DBA or asynchronous database access the
there was a push for developing a
completely asynchronous API so for
applications for a certain category of
application that require a very high
throughput they need a driver that
doesn't block them at any point so that
is why we came up with this idea and
there has been active
element within Oracle but now this is
going to be a part of the Java standard
and this has been developed by the JDBC
expert group with community input of
course just like every open JDK
specification this is going to be a part
of an upcoming Java release at this
point we cannot comment with Java
release but maybe in JDK 11 or 12 this
will be a part of the Java standard okay
so it's being developed in the Java
community exactly so Oracle is leading
this but this is obviously community
involved exactly yeah so we have all the
major database players participating in
it and obviously the the JDK community
itself okay so I'm interested in your
session
what was the reaction to your talk what
was some of the conversations that you
were having with developers afterwards
or during so so everybody that turned up
at my efficient and and this was the
first question I asked how many of the
people who turned up at my session I've
actually used JDBC and almost hundred
percent of them had used the ADB C so I
expected that people who have already
worked in JDBC would be expecting you
know what is next to come in JDBC and
their question mainly revolves around
the you know the current applications
that they have they had very specific
questions you know like I do something
in this way how can I adapt to this new
API what kind of you know effort will be
required if I want to say migrate my
existing JDBC synchronous application
into an asynchronous application and
what will be the kind of benefits I get
they they really wanted to know how how
they can apply this new API into their
existing code so there was a lot of
interest a lot of interest yeah yeah I
had to take we didn't have enough time
to take all the questions during this
session I had to take a lot of questions
offline
I hope they also you know respond on the
on the on the public mailing list I am
expecting input from the community
because that's how this whole effort is
going to you know go forward actually
you mentioned mailing lists earlier yes
so you have a mailing list and you have
a github repo as well for some sample
implementations exactly yeah yeah so
what we have done is we have created of
sample implementation we call it
a oj it is asynchronous over JDBC what
it is is a is a sample of implementation
of this API and it's completely
available long on Oracle developer
github so we want to you know developers
to download it and and try out their
hands on it and eventually then post
feedback all of it is available in the
in our slides will be which will be
posted on the on the Oracle code website
so everybody who could not attend the
session they can simply download you
know the the existing implementation try
it out and then provide us input ok so
what's the name of the repo on github I
I don't remember the ring but they can
get it from from the slice I keep
forgetting names ok some of the use
cases here for this yes yes so the use
case for this API will be as I said a
specific category or several specific
ecosystem of applications that require a
high throughput for example if we all
know Twitter so Twitter's server-side
code is completely asynchronous and they
developed an in-house JDBC driver that
was doing all the relational database
calls for them so there has been I mean
this is not a new concept people need
this kind of asynchronous JDBC driver to
handle a large traffic where you know
you need to you need you have a large
user base that are connecting to a
server and this is just an effort to
create a modern API that will be
standard across you know different
implementation so that's what this whole
effort is about one of the trends that
comes up over and over and over again is
ease of use ease of use yeah I'm getting
the impression this is a little bit more
complex it is complex because it uses
all the modern Java concepts some of
them have been introduced in JDK 8 and
JDK 9 for example the completable future
completion stage these are these were
all new ApS that were introduced in in
Java to do asynchronous processing but I
cannot say they are the most popular
JDBC law or Java classes but we have put
them to good use so to understand this
you will need to understand these new
classes but while saying that the
overall
effort while developing this was to make
code easy and robust so even though your
you need to learn the latest modern
api's but writing code the aim is to you
know make it easier the whole slow make
it clean and robust okay so we have a
new API coming yes developed in the open
yes and we've got a mailing list people
could participate on for feedback and we
got some sample of implementations on
get up get up and thank you for coming
buying good with it thank you thank you
thank you we'll see you soon for one
more interview thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
