so we're going to talk about bloodhounds
and a little bit more detail from the
keynote this morning so how many of you
went to the keynote this morning good
interesting yeah so we're gonna we're
gonna share quite a bit the so first of
all I'd like to introduce Mark Chapman
who's the chief engineer for but hand
he's the engineer who's done all the all
the wizardry stuff and then a staff who
I mentioned on stage who's done all the
Oracle wizardry stuff so these guys
actually know what they're doing I'm
just gonna share a little bit of an
overview of the technology that we use
so let's go into the project okay so the
important point about this car is
obviously it's a thousand mile an hour
car we talked about it this morning
and you know mark will explain the
complexities that has the a very
important point about this car is there
is no other place in the planet that has
ever been achieved at this speed so
there's nothing we can replicate a mark
will articulate all of those challenges
that the team are having to go through
and that's why a lot of the long journey
that they've had is actually going to
continued because they're having to go
where no one else has gone before one of
the points that actually Neil Armstrong
made during this visit was that actually
if you imagine the students specifically
if they had access to moon lander data
now from the 60s what they would still
be doing with it and that data's not
publicly available probably isn't even
really in a format that they could use
you know and when Assaf presents he's
going to talk about the structures that
we've used because a lot of the
technology that we're being used on
bloodhound and hal bloodhounds come
around is just really about lowering the
barrier of entry and it's really
important to note that actually a lot of
the sort goals of the team are to do if
not only the engineering side but also
the educational side so it's quite
exciting hopefully when we get to eight
hundred miles an hour and then when we
get to a thousand miles now the
important point is as I said to my
ten-year-old Charlotte when a car goes
faster than a speeding bullet is pretty
quick so you know feroz's it and there's
a great video on youtube you can look up
and you can see a bullet slowing
down as the cars overtaking it and you
know one the question she asked there's
a 10 year older so you don't see a
bullet how am I going to see that so you
know you you hopefully get some
explanation of that probably see a lot
dust so right so I wanted to show this
because it is a global STEM program so I
talked about this morning yes the UK
technology team has actually pulled this
together because the team are based in
Bristol so bloodhound itself is based in
Bristol to give you the understanding
the numbers of students that we've had
on it there's been roughly around two or
three interns and in three or four
graduates Asif from the point of the
lead developer Caroline asks you who I
mentioned on the stage this morning
she's being sort like a lot of the
visionary stuff she's quite creative in
the way she's come up with some of the
visionary stuff and then we've got niche
other experts that we bring in at
Pacific point so like data visualization
they were actually Pacific individuals
that new data visualization expertise
everything that you will hear from our
staff has actually been deployed in
Frankfort which is the new data center
we launched on Monday and as I said on
stage this morning you know this is the
first live customer that has actually
gone to Frankfort slightly ahead of our
GA date but pretty much there so you
know we were pretty proud that the first
piece of data to hit Frankfort was
actually from a jet engine from a you
know fighter jet so that was pretty
special for us the other thing as well
which is quite important is that I
talked very quickly this morning about
the transition in the world if you look
at the the challenges we have in society
today people talk about a is going to
replace jobs machine learning is going
to replace jobs you know that that
poignant moment I gave about Einstein's
comment about that you know logic gets
you a to SZ
really what's going to happen is where
we as humans are exiting the industrial
period if you think about that because
all of the artificial intelligence
machine learning and automation will
start taking away that need what it
means is the next generation I'm going
to have to be much more creative much
more understanding because the challenge
sees they're going to have to answer
heck of a lot more complex than we've
had to answer they're going to have to
deal with a lot more complexity in
technology a lot more complexity in data
so you know really is an important
program because if we as a globe don't
have these experts fundamentally we
aren't going to go where we need to go
and if you don't if you've recently
sauber Stephen Hawking said professor
Stephen Hawking said within a hundred
years the human life will have to leave
this planet okay that's a pretty bold
statement a few years ago he said a
thousand years and now he's saying a
hundred years and actually you can sense
it there you know the world population
is getting older so we need these people
or we are going to struggle so the last
one I want to show you is some of the
key principles I talked about them on
stage this morning but actually the
deployment everything you've seen here
has been done in less than sort of seven
eight weeks we started and when we start
the design if you link in with me you
can see a picture me and after on a
board in an office where we just sort of
like documented what we're doing all of
this is available to the public so
you're the augmented reality I showed at
the end of the keynote is actually
already up there on the web
we haven't hooked it into that they're
live cars live car hasn't run today
we've used model data but actually the
end of this month when the car runs for
the first time you'll be absolutely out
to see that go around the car sense the
data click on the data zoom in and Assaf
will show more of that he's going to
show a proper demo of it the other
important point is everything's based on
open source everything we're using is
based on open source technology and also
there is no barrier for the students so
everything's freely available via the
Oracle Academy agreement that we've done
we bloodhound education which is a
charity so that's an important point as
well so I'm gonna hand over to mark now
who's going to talk through the
engineering and we can do Q&amp;amp;A at the end
thank you thank you John
so money's watchin on chief engineer on
the project so I've been on this project
now for nearly 10 years
my background is defense aerospace
pretty much so before this program was
working on JSF with Lockheed Pratt and
rolls-royce prior to that I've worked in
Seattle for Boeing so it's very much
I've come from a nuts-and-bolts
engineering site and it's fantastic she
worked the guys from Oracle to do all
the other stuff because this car is the
world's most complex car there is
nothing on this car that you would
expect to find going down the freeway
I've got a really quick video that just
hopefully gives a bit of an explanation
as to as to what this project is all
about
we're building a thousand mile an hour
car and sharing that story with a global
audience
it's pot supersonic jet fighter hot
next-generation space rocket our mission
is not just to go fast it's about
creating an engineering adventure to
inspire a generation about the magic of
Science and Technology bring it to life
in the most exciting way possible
that's a really really quick shot of
what the cars can do and what the
projects all about so we've been working
for the last ten years of a very much of
virtual space so we've been working on
care to be doing analysis and actually
when we start going forward it's how we
get how do we get that data how do we
find out what the issues are because
there is no prototype this is the only
car we're making there is no wind hole
testing we can do there is no wind
tunnel in the world that you can put a
thousand one an hour car into because
this car is running two and half inches
off the ground so you would need a
rolling road so you'd need a thousand
mile an hour rolling road inside a
thousand mile at wind tunnel and
actually if you can do that that's a
challenge that's far harder than making
a car go at Mach one point four the
issues we've had is that model I just
showed you previously in computational
fluid dynamic terms that was a pretty
good model so that had rotating wheels
it had jet engines had rocket engines
yet all the flux modeled that would take
between each iteration about three
months to do now when you've got three
months between iterations you cannot you
cannot use that to to solve a problem
because by the time you get there you
can't change a thing if I know what it's
going to do so we came up with a way of
doing what we call the pointed brake so
this model converges in 20 minutes and
aerodynamically for what we were
interested in was the same as the model
previously so we could solve the car
problems automatically and actually the
whole back end of the car is designed by
an algorithm and it's taking that step
from where no people get very nervous of
machine based learning and artificial
intelligence it's you just everything
it's another tool in your toolbox so
people started with slide rooms I'm of
an age where I actually got talked out
he's a slide rule at school we then use
calculators we then used computers use
spreadsheets and now the analytical
tools are there that you can automate
all these processes but you still need
the man in the machine you still need to
be able to direct it and work out what's
going to what's going to happen so with
this model allowed us to converge very
quickly to a solution that we could then
use design of experiments and use that
to come up with an aerodynamic shape so
the rear of that car
is all designed by computer to minimize
lift mac 1.4 so the green color shows
its Mach number neutral so there is no
there is no high pressure underneath the
cars no suction on top of the car and
that car is completely stable has no
shockwaves attached to it apart from the
ones right on the nose you can see until
we had that point we didn't have a car
design that was safe however we don't
know if that's truth we know that we
don't know if that's reality so we have
over 500 sensors on the car and as as
John was talking about this morning
during that during the keynote it's
gathering all that data off the car so
we we stream that live off the car and
we also gather it off and that goes
straight into the Oracle cloud and very
much using their tools to go forward as
to how we gather that information out of
it we all see use things like table
logic optimization so basically using
the computer to design the car again so
this is the front suspension we need to
minimize the mass of that unit that is
we've got a supersonic truck we've got a
an eight ton car doing a thousand miles
an hour
just like a road car we've got a bump
case so you've got like a full 5g bump
so you've got potentially 30 to 40 tons
of load go on to these suspension it's
colossal and so use the computer to
remove metal where you don't need it and
trim all that away anything on the left
there we call the dead goats head so if
you had a really big additive machine
you could print that but actually you
can't do that so again you need to use
the tools available to you that
intuition to help do you do something
that is possible and that's how it is on
the car at the moment so over this last
12 to 18 months we've had the world's
biggest Airfix kit so we've had a huge
number of components and it's taking
that from where we've had all the great
CAD design for had the great imagery the
great CGI is now building that all into
it into a physical entity and make that
as as safe as possible so we have a car
that will break the sound barrier with a
car that will not only break the sound
barrier will actually break the world
air speed record for low altitude
aircraft so some of the challenges we
have on this vehicle are the first time
that they've ever been solved and I I've
quite an interesting so I got a lot of
people to come and say you want to work
on this project
and the first kind of question you may
ask is okay so it's very exciting now do
you have a look-alike is it it's not
like working for forward and looking at
dolger it's not like working at Airbus
looking at Boeing there is nothing like
this it is genuinely pushing the
boundaries of science but when we said a
thousand miles an hour
it wasn't cuz it was a cool headline it
is because it may be impossible and the
beauty with this project is that we can
share that adventure is how we get there
and if we don't get there that's
actually okay it's that aspiration it is
that moonshot it is that aiming for
something that you do not know if it's
possible
now when you interview people for a job
and they go okay so I'm gonna be asked
something that you don't know the answer
to because most jobs you're asked to
develop something a bit a bit light for
a bit quicker a bit cheaper it's
iterative you're looking at what you've
already got and how do you push that a
little bit this project is taking that
I'm blowing away what was there
previously and half the guys I talk to
interview they kind of get okay so you
don't know what the right so if I come
up with something how do you know it's
the right answer I'm sorry don't we'll
know it's the right answer when it works
they get what happens if it doesn't work
well the car crashes or something
happens bad things happen and half the
people into you walk out the room and
they just go that's not for me the other
half and whether that be from an intern
through to garnet 60s or 70s their eyes
go like dinner plates and they go you
mean you want me to do my job you want
me to do the job that I've been training
on my life to do you're going to trust
me as an engineer to come up with
innovative solutions to actually do it
and build it and test it and run it and
I will be the person that solves that
problem and they just go I want to be
that person I won't be on that job and
it's really interesting as to how you
try and capture that and put it into
other organizations to get that passion
and energy going forward so we we do a
thousand miles an hour now a thousand
miles an hour is a really hard image to
capture in your head so we do naught to
a thousand to naught in about a minute
and three quarters during that minute
and three quarters we cover eleven miles
the measured mile is three point four
seconds long and again it's a hard thing
to visualize but imagine sat in the
stadium and you blink just as you start
closing your eye the car comes in from
one side the stadium before you've
opened your eye after a normal blink the
cars already gone through the other side
the stadium it will do four and a half
stadiums a second and that's the kind of
facts that get kids excited
this car has 135,000 equivalent
horsepower it has 20 tons of thrust it
means that with the car with 55 seconds
of fuel if you aimed it on its back it
would go up to 25 and a half thousand
feet in 55 seconds and it would break
the sound barrier at 17,000 feet
vertically as it goes up and that's not
a fact I I kind of knew it wasn't you
know as chief engineer don't go how high
does the car go that was from a school
kid you're a very intelligent bright
audience here are some fantastic
questions the scariest audience in the
world to present to is 750 12 year olds
14 year old 16 year olds because they
will ask the questions without any
filter they'll just ask what they want
to know and a girl put a hand on the
scales please so how high does a car go
and I go it doesn't go up it goes that
way really really quickly we don't want
it to go it bad bad things happen which
goes and the teacher came up to also do
that that was severe so I've never been
asked that question before and they were
doing a physics class so could you go in
and chat about physics yeah and they
said have you done Newton's laws and I
went yeah so what shall we work this out
and they got a spreadsheet up and they
said well the car weighs seven a half
tons full of fuel uses this much fuel
every second it generates this much
thrust and the drags a squared term and
they just timeslice that you know second
one or second point one and it's her 80
throw in 20 minutes they told me the
answer and at each one that's incredible
that's you know last term they did
Newton's laws and they thought it was
rubbish and they just grew so much as
children because they they had used
stuff they'd learnt at school to answer
something that me sir didn't know and as
a 14 15 year old kid that is really
powerful
you can find stuff out isn't just
answering the question you can use
technology use stuff to actually find
stuff that interest you and this whole
products about that and how you get
people inspired now the work with Oracle
we're doing is taking that to another
level to be able to distribute that to
across across globally but also to
provide the tools now some we'll go
through in a second as to what that what
that is so this last you've been putting
putting the car together so he we showed
the car as you saw this morning in
London and it's a really small team and
we use as many tools and aids as we can
do to get a lot of stuff done as quickly
as possible and then we start running in
South Africa and we start increasing
that speed from 100 200 400 600 all the
way up to the thousand and all the time
gathering that data off the car and
looking at that predict what the next
thing is going to do looking for
vibration analysis looking for matching
the models because this is the only way
we're going to find if the modelling is
correct and using the machine based
learning tools using the augmented
reality is the engineering team to
actually see where we're going and South
Africa is a fantastic place we are on
the flattest place on planet earth we've
got 11 miles of desert that the highest
peak to the lowest trough is just under
two inches and it is being cleared by
hands 60 and a half thousand tons of
stone have been removed
that's occurring from a highway from
London to Moscow by hand I've put this
one up because this is true all models
are wrong until you've got the evidence
you do not know you have a correct model
and there's no way we can get a correct
model until we run the car so we're in
this quandary of do we believe do we
believe the models will do evenly the
data and know the data is always correct
so it's how do you merge that model how
do you predict that next level of how we
go to and again that's a key part of the
relationship with Oracle and be able to
share that with children be able to
share that around the world we don't
need a nation of supersonic car
designers but you do need people that
educated and skilled in science and
technology so
those challenging questions and are
actually motivated to try and solve
those problems are going to become in
the next generation so a low-carbon
future code it all these things that
need people to solve those issues but
also to challenge governments and to say
do we need more nuclear power do we need
what systems do we need to protect our
future going forward so we are running
the car I'm looking a bit more shabby
than I usually do because on Friday I
was in the UK arrived here some Sundays
and they wrote it yeah some day I don't
even know what a week is about and we'd
been testing the car Aniki so for the
first time ever we ran a new eurofighter
typhoon engine so we have an engine out
the current frontline fighter they're
all Air Force and it seemed of geeks
from Bristol managed to do this
so it was incredible about that was one
was managed to getting a jet fighter
Indian to work that's not particularly
easy but the fact was that when we did
that we were getting the data straight
off the car and we could see what
exactly was happening we could see the
fuel levels of thrust levels we could
actually tell Andy in the cockpit what
was going up some sensors that were
tripping out we could work out exactly
what was happening in real-time as we
were working on and that's the fantastic
benefit we have him being in a
partnership with with Oracle and the
amount of work we've done now we're
progressing that testing this week so
we're now starting to run the car along
the runway or got to 200 miles now by
the end of this month and to put it into
perspective the reason the guy put his
hands over his ear defenders that has
got earplugs inside is that the the
microphone on the camera took that maxed
out when it was on idle so as you see
even put his hands on his it is getting
so loud your whole body is shaking and
to see that as an engineer is if anyone
is awesome it is seeing that amount of
power that is only one third of the
power of the whole car so when we start
running in South Africa it will be an
astonishing experience and again with
pancha with Oracle you will all be able
to be involved in that and you can see
what's all that is so I'd hand over to
SF now
thank you Mark
so hi I'm staff from I'm leading the
blood iron oracle technical solution and
i'm gonna talk about how we connected
the car basically to our cloud what
we've done what kind of assets we
managed to produce in that short time
like john was saying in in the last
seven weeks and I'll show you a short
demo of the augmented reality as well so
seven weeks ago when I when we got to
the Bloodhound John called me didn't say
why and and then in front of a lot of
people from the Bloodhound as well as
from Oracle he said we need to connect
that to the cloud so you'll do it right
so yeah I was nodding what else can you
do and right afterwards right after that
session I stay i sticked around in
bristol when to talk with the one of the
main main engineers his name is joe and
and i've asked him all right where is
the IP of the car how do i connect the
car to the internet how do I take that
assets what what's the events like how
many sensors do we have so he said well
we don't have any connectivity to the
outside world the car only lives within
itself so what you see over there is 550
between 550 and 600 sensors that are
connected to the car we the reason why
you've heard 1,000 sensors is because
that number always growing because we
find out who need more sensors and we
can't imagine that by the time we get to
South Africa we'll have approximately a
thousand sensors all these sensors are
connected within the car in different
places of the car into a real-time
computers that's how they call it on the
project but in the IOT space we call it
just a gateway so and within the car we
have a UDP based network so
it's very fast working on 400 Hertz from
each each computer and even the
dashboard of the cockpit is made out out
of all of these sensors so the digital
dashboards that you are seeing on the
cockpit will see that in a second are
combined from the data that is coming
from these sensors so we we said all
right how about we'll give you will get
a couple of 4G Reuters and connect that
to our cloud and they said yeah we don't
have the time for do that to do that if
you can do that yeah go ahead so we went
and and like John was saying on stage
using a couple of raspberry PI's and and
a couple of 4G rooters we wrote down a
Python code that translates that UDP
packets according to the spec we got
from Joe from the one of the main
engineers and translated that into
something readable translated that into
a JSON payload and send that over to our
cloud multiple components in our in our
cloud so you've heard a lot in the last
couple couple of days around the OCI so
around our infrastructure and on top of
that we have the IOT cloud service so
all of these sensors are going into into
our IOT cloud service also to our Oracle
analytic cloud we'll see a couple of
visuals from there as well as they
database because the analytics gets that
from databases and also we want to
expose that to anyone
publicly so it will be very easy to do
so to our storage cloud service we're
saving that as a CSV and we were hoping
that to download for whomever wants that
into our customer experience where we
put our the not in our document cloud
service we provide all that as well so
everything is open for the public
because one of the main reasons we we
are doing that project is that we want
to provide that to educational side of
things
what is Osceola also over here we have
Taurus berry pies for redundancy in case
we don't have network between the
raspberry PI's on the car to the
internet because maybe we don't have
signal by the end of the day even now
we're running on an and on new key
airport lucky enough we chose two
carriers that are the strongest in
Newquay without checking it because we
checked online they seem to be alright
but when we got there we found out that
these are the main carriers that are
working on a new key airport so if we
still don't have sing signal we are
saving all the data into local queues on
the raspberry pi on the SD card which is
128 gig and we used over there something
called rabbit and queue
we'll get to that in a second so like I
said we have approximately 600 600
sensors connected to approximately 7
real-time computers the reason why I'm
saying always approximate Lakers for
instance is so you saw the picture of
the car the video of the car the fin is
not there the fin will be there we'll
have another real-time computer so it's
it's just adding up and this is just
summarise what we're doing on the UDP
ports are and converting that to
eventually Jason and rest and around the
error handling we have two processes in
order to keep on we try to take these
messages and send that through our cloud
this is an example of or just a really
small portion of the configuration files
of or the metadata of the sensors so on
each one of them you can see the
computer name or the CPU name this is
basically the real-time computer name or
they in the Gateway name and on each one
of them we have the spec so and that's
back keep on changing because sometimes
they add up sensors and our code needs
to
dynamic in the same way so we just parse
it as part of the part of the code and
translate the binary into into JSON
payload and this is how it looks like I
know you guys probably are laughing of
the binary side of things over here but
if the only way I could explain what
we're doing and this is just an example
of the payload that we are enriching as
well so that payload is say is seven
different kind of formats and and in
real-time and you know in high available
way so and the reason why we have four
for root is I'll get that in a second so
this is the architecture of once we are
living the car it gets to our pub/sub
engine within server cloud service or in
other words we are using web logic JMS
topic in the future we might change that
mechanism but at the moment we are
pretty happy because we tested it out
and at the moment we are we see that the
car produces almost two thousands events
a second between 1500 and 2007 second
the PI's are are the Python code highly
performs because it's a multi processes
as well as multi threads and we see that
we get that in instantly to our cloud so
that goes to Gemma's topic and the
reason why we're using that topic is to
prop publish that to the IOT using the
Java client library to document cloud
service to filesystem as CSV to database
and we also using another component from
so called service pass in order to
enrich the messages because a lot of the
data is being enriched from the weather
for instance so we integrated with the
Met Office this is the the main
Institute that provides weather for for
the UK and we enrich that data and store
the database funny enough Met Office
said that they'll they'll be able to
provide special sensors and special
weather stations
in in South Africa so we'll have that
over there as well and a lot of these
components are based obviously on our
OCI
you've heard a lot about that how fast
it is but first former personal
experiences I know I'm from Oracle but
it's just I've never seen anything like
it and I've worked with a lot of is in
the past
and the outcomes that we are providing
is the augmented reality you saw is so
that that you saw that on on John's
keynote and a couple of websites so for
instance we are duplicating we'll get to
that well duplicating the dashboards
from from the cockpit in live to the
audience because now we have all the
events so given that we have all the
events we can basically show everything
that runs on the car just to the outside
world and lastly this is what was for
marketing purposes so the guys the
marketing guys of bloodhound are very
active on Facebook but they wanted also
to have automatic responses and videos
and and pictures and there's so many
like repeating questions like when is
the event can I get a discount where is
the discount code etc so all of that is
on on on the chat on the chat pod so now
that we've connected the car to the
internet this is a bit of outside of
Oracle but we got excited we caught got
thrilled from the project and we said
are you planning to stream live because
we're talking about kids or how are you
planning to take any videos out of the
car because you know what's more visual
than than a video so they said to be
honest the outside is covered but we
didn't have network from the car so no
the answer is no and to be honest we
don't have time for it so we said how
about we'll get again a kit and and and
play around with it so we bought a
couple of GoPros so we have one that
facing Andy green
that's the pilot and one is facing to
the outside which is behind him and
another another to actually now it's
changed to two GoPros on the fin because
they said how cool that will be that if
you can have a GoPro that take a video
of of you know or the fire that goes or
the thrust that goes from from from from
from the behind of the jet engine so we
added a fourth one as well and then we
thought about VR so as as John was
saying on his keynote we together with
the nd green he said I want to see that
life and in Bristol he came over one day
and we positioned that over there we
showed them the outcome how cool the 360
camera looks like and he said you know
what I don't mind that it's bothers my
eyesight we gotta have it so on the on
the on the cockpit on on on exactly on
where is sitting you can see the little
camera and then you can see the
dashboards with between the dashboards
and and and the canopy so it is pretty
cool and the engineers on the field they
build like a special bridge to stick it
on over there
so we will have like a VR for for the
young generation so this is how it looks
like and this time Raspberry Pi we tried
to stream live Raspberry Pi to we did
that test with YouTube and the Raspberry
Pi was good for two three minutes and
then it crushed just crushed each and
every time one on memory so we said all
right we need to have a really quick
solution over here and we had some space
on the plate you'll see that Plata to
installed on the car and that was
exactly the space for these two these
into into nooks it's basically like a
laptop without a screen yeah it's i-5
with this this time is just 8 gig and
they are amazingly stable for for life
streaming so we are streaming all of the
four cameras through these two
till nukes and we're using same
recruiters so we had only two and
because we added the cameras we had the
extra two and this is how it looks like
so we assembled together with the
Bloodhound team we assembled that metal
plate with everything is installed so
what you see over there is the four for
G Reuters over there at the back you can
see the Raspberry Pi there is a micro
bit over there that so that's one of the
sponsors so we wanted to put that over
there and we are checking the
acceleration using the on the micro bit
we have just a switch that's that
network switch is connected to the car
so all the UDP packets are coming
through that switch and connected to the
PI and the PI is connected using Wi-Fi
to the rooters and the two inter nukes
what you see over there on the behind
the car itself it's not like a regular
car it's not 12 volt right so it
produces 28 voltage with huge amount of
amperage I mean I guess mark knows
better we will be able to give an exact
details about that so we had to reduce
that to 5 voltage for the raspberry PI's
and up until 32 the sorry up until 12 to
the intern nukes so the inter nukes are
so that's why I have the two
transformers over there oh and on the
right hand side this is how its
assembled so the reason why it looks
like upside down because it is upside
down it's on diagonal where in the
future the rockets will be so this is
just the tunnel of the rocket at the
moment it's assembled there in the
future it's going to move a bit a bit
forward so now that we have all all the
events coming out of the car
we want to show what Andy is saying not
just in terms of videos but instead in
terms of data as well so the
we'll be the aggregated view this is the
website that we are working our interns
and grads are working and integrating
that to our cloud and what we see over
there is is basically you can choose a
run you can choose whether you want to
have a dashboard or the analytics or
download the content and you can switch
between the cameras and let's have a
look on the next one so this this is the
analytics side of things and lastly you
can download the latest run data or the
around that you're currently on and the
videos now it looks simple right I mean
that UI which I mean how many things how
many how many people think it's a thing
it's simple that UI so that that's the
purpose so we're trying to simplify that
each and every time more and more so
this is like the third version that
we're trying to simplify it because by
the end of the day the young generation
needs to go over there and and enjoy
enjoy the these assets Richard mentioned
that so we have another project called
put your name on the fin so you can get
to the website and and and and by your
name on the fin so previously before
Oracle they printed out the fin and
printed the names on the fin and if you
wanted to get your name you literally
either had to go physically and look for
it or go to one of the blood on guys to
their PDF and search for your name and
then oh go to the fin and find where it
is so we created a website for that so
on the website you can search yourself
and then zoom in zoom out etc so again
our rallies are working on that as well
this is documented reality you've seen
you've seen that that that video it's
keep on progressing it's again it's
about the fourth or fifth version we are
having for the augmented reality
on each label that you're clicking
you're saying either in real time or or
so over here you can choose live or
previous runs and rerun the the car so
that's just the first stage the second
stage will be full they are not just the
3d model as well as VR with with with
the 360 camera so we've connected that
to the IOT this is quite all data to be
honest it's a data we did mainly from
the simulation and the very first data
from the jet engine so this was a jet
engine before it was on the field so
just connected electronically not not
really running but that's already
related that's why I put it over here
and this is just an example of the
virtual devices that are connected so
each each real-time computer is
considered a virtual a virtual device
over here on the IOT cloud service this
is the the analytics Oracle analytics
cloud or this is the dashboard that we
are providing for this is specifically
for the engineers and the reason why I I
put it over here and I'll be really
quick so we will have some time for the
Q&amp;amp;A is we tried something called the
kill switch a kill switch is when it's
just a switch when you just click on it
or horse or switch it on and off or it
just kills all the voltage on the car
and when we've done that the files on
the real-time computers on the gateway
found corrupted so they couldn't check
if it was a valid check or not
so to rerun it again it was it would've
taken time you know a couple of hours so
Joe asked me can you show me that in the
Oracle cloud we've done that and said
wow this is incredible because I don't
have that data on my on my
my data so this is this is like our very
first quick win from from connecting
that to our cloud that's why I'll put
that over here and like John was
mentioning our data scientists are
working on more dashboard so this is a
an example of 3d model for acceleration
data and as well as this is the real
temperature from the last new key engine
run that you've seen it's in the video
around that yeah now I will move to Q&amp;amp;A
any questions that you would like to ask
probably mark yeah is there a remote
Monica news or I did need to repeat the
question
repeat the question yeah
that's so the question was and correct
me if I was wrong but the question was
we picked up GoPros we put that on the
fin the question is in that kind of
speed do we know if the frames per
second will do in order to catch the
moment is that is that a fair way to
describe that the answer the honest
answer is no and but in terms of what we
tested in the market we checked a couple
of solutions because we wanted to see in
terms of the spec who gives the most
frames per second even if we reduce the
resolution and the answer was GoPro so
the logic run is choosing GoPro was that
so not because it was a brand because we
tested out couple of other brands as
well but they just get provided the
highest frame per second so that that
was the main reason to pick them up
yeah any more questions yeah
yeah so the question is if we lose
signal what happens with the video as
well as the sensor data so the sensor
data is being saved to RabbitMQ on the
SD card we we did the estimation for two
and a half minutes where is the that's
the run that will be taking place in in
South Africa we won't produce more than
four or five gig so we'll have 128 and
on the SD card so when once we once we
get back a signal we can rerun it also
in addition all of the files all of the
data the raw data is stored on the
real-time computers so we can copy that
and rerun it even with the same GPS time
so we we can if we lose any kind of data
even within the PI's we can get that
from the gateways again as for the
cameras on each camera we have again 128
gig of SD card for two and a half
minutes we push the record button or
started to remove it from the app before
we started each run and in addition we
stream it so even if we don't have
signal we can retroactively lis go and
stream it or attractively just copy that
from the SD card to the cloud yeah
so the question was because it's
recorded I'm repeating the question the
question is are we are we using MQTT for
the IOT cloud service so we were in a
rush of time so that's why we did the
connectivity straightaway - - so work
because we have the JSON payload but now
that we have the JSON payload this is
the next step the next step is to have
probably either both we haven't decided
yet whether it's going to be both till
Sowa or just to IOT using MQTT and from
the iot we can send that back - so I
even and then publish that - to the rest
of the components so at the moment the
first encounter is is is so ax but in in
the future or in the very company in the
next couple of weeks we are planning to
have I or T's the first the first stop
and then from there we'll publish that
so the question is it will be mqtt and
the moment is not
if you can repeat the questions so the
question is is can the caja voyages need
to leave on the weight you need to leave
wheel truck so yes you do need to leave
wheel tracks there are two lands three
records so there is one for a wheeled
vehicle which is what we're doing now if
we read the rules a bit more carefully
you can be in ground effect so there's a
huge there is another category that
nobody's actually trying to attempt yet
you can do it in ground effect so the
Russians had a technology called micro
no plans
so they're basically aircraft that work
in in ground effects if we'd have done
that you wouldn't have to pick up all
the stones so maybe something else to go
a bit quicker you can do it that way the
issue will be slowing that down because
you do need to all the changes have
you've got we do a run we have to stop
to turn around and come back the other
way
so there'll be some issues about about
doing that but no we definitely will
tracks so the questions are on downforce
how much we generate well actually
unlike a road car we're not trying we're
not driving the wheels so it's a thrust
powered car so you want to be at 1g you
don't want to be pushing down to too
hard X you'll burst burst the crust of
the desert as you as you run up and so
it runs pretty much neutral there was
one more question there I knowed it I
didn't hear the phone
I'm mister currently so we're doing the
testing at the moment in Newquay cell
takes to 200 we then need to finish the
rocket program development so we're
probably looking to be running early
2019
so the question is do you know how
faucets go in a vacuum so what's what
you're seeing in America there is a
wheeled vehicle that's gone faster than
we go Holmen Air Force Base they
basically tunnel full of helium and that
they ran a socket sled through that on
wheels and that achieved max 7 so we
could run in a vacuum and it wouldn't be
too happy but we have a rocket
so we're rocket and a jet the issue with
people going fast and we're going a
thousand miles an hour is that we're
already going 200 miles an hour faster
than the jet fighter that engine comes
from so you could run in a vacuum if you
run on pure rocket it wouldn't be a land
speed record traditionally and you they
want to work out how do you evacuate an
11-mile tube to run in so there will be
some interesting questions I'm sure sure
Elon Musk with Hyperloop if he could
have a rocket powered rifle it rather
than a maglev time acceleration thing
you could do some interesting stuff but
it would go very quick thank you all
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
