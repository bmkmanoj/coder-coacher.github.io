source as a service which will actually
accelerate the leverage of open source
I love open source because there's so
much innovation and the rate of
innovation is really high but I as a
developer if I want to use kubernetes I
need to know how to install kubernetes I
get releases of kubernetes every six
weeks I need to be able to upgrade to
varieties every six weeks I need to be
able to scale kubernetes have high
availability around kubernetes etc that
orchestration platform I just want that
available to me as a service managed by
a cloud service providers same tell taka
which is used for event based queuing I
have to set up Kafka after back up the
Kafka nodes I have to scale the nodes up
I have to manage the cluster etc so more
and more I think what we're going to see
is open source being delivered as a
service by the cloud platforms where the
enterprise grade providers are going to
make sure that you have a highly
scalable secure highly available cluster
of that open source content available to
you as a developer so you can just use
that capability that's open source
delivered as a service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
