developer events today here in San
Francisco so I'm going to cut directly
to our content what are we going to talk
about Oracle has a vision to deliver
infrastructure platform software as a
service and data as a service through
the cloud so we're going to show you
what we mean by that we're going to show
you how you can use it to build really
cool stuff let's start with
infrastructure as a service what are we
really doing we're allowing developers
through an API or through a GUI to build
a software-defined virtual data center
that runs in the cloud what are the
components of this because you're
building a virtual data center you're
first going to set up your user accounts
and identities then you going to set up
a virtual network attached compute and
storage to it set up load balancing DNS
and other services ok so we're building
out data centers that have three in a
particular region they have three data
centers on non-correlated fault domains
so for example they're in separate power
grids they're in separate earthquake
zones we call these redundant data
centers availability domains they are
connected with a very very high
performance low latency network link so
you can build a highly reliable
application and even if one of those
data centers goes down you still have
two of them and if you want remote
disaster recovery you can failover to a
region that's outside of that
geographical region ok now inside one of
these data centers inside one of those
availability domains we set up a flat
horizontally scaled non oversubscribed
Network so as an example a data center
that we have in the East Coast has 50
million ports okay now normally in the
data center the network gets taller and
taller the more computed storage you add
therefore at the very top of the network
it's oversubscribed which means you get
very unpredictable performance our data
centers are horizontally scaled the
network so any compute node can talk to
any other compute node with a maximum of
two hops which gives you very
predictable latency and throughput and
that's true between compute and compute
and compute and storage so the larger
the data center gets you still get very
predictable performance now the third
thing we've done is we've taken
virtualization and moved it from being
done on compute in a hypervisor and put
it into the core network so this flag
for is this horizontally scaled physical
layer to network has been virtualized
with an overlay layer 3 network so when
your traffic comes in as a customer you
get encapsulated in a private overlay
that runs on top of this core network ok
you can connect your data center to this
over a V PC where for example you see
this cloud as an extension of your IP
address space you can do a layer 2 VPN
or if you want a huge pipe you can
connect over an MPLS circuit ok now
having put virtualization into the core
network we then present compute and
storage to you we present compute in
four ways you can buy a raw physical
server called a bare metal server and we
configure that to an elastic API you can
run Linux or Windows on top of that you
could say I really want a hypervisor or
a virtual machine as a service so you
can spin up Elastic Compute with a
hypervisor
you can also spin up darker containers
so you can run docker inside a
hypervisor or you can run docker on top
of a raw physical host and then lastly
if you want a whole collection of
servers we can give that to you as well
we call that dedicated compute storage
we provide five different kinds of
storage on the physical host we give you
local nvme which gives you amazing
performance for both reads and writes if
you want to share information across two
physical hosts or 2 hypervisors you do
that using block storage and we give you
elastic block storage shortly we're
introducing an all flash elastic block
storage if you want to see these shared
blocks as files we allow you to use a
NFS service elastic filesystem on top of
the shared blocks if you want to
replicate data from one data center to
another or globally will give you object
storage which can be replicated around
the world and then lastly to save data
very cheaply and archive it you can also
rotate data into archival storage okay
now these compute nodes and these
storage nodes are extremely high
performance high performance compute you
can get a server with 44 cores with 29
terabytes of nvme and a terabyte of DRAM
ok that's 30 terabytes on a physical
host with 44 cores of compute ok if you
have two to one compression you can fit
60 terabytes of data on a single host
now you may say how fast will that run
you get 4,000 read I ops and 4.2 million
4k read I ops of a single host and 2.6
million write I ops on that same host so
these are incredibly fast computers so
what we've really done is we
ardan at the bottom and said we're going
to set up data centers in regions each
region consists of a triple ring with
three availability domains on top of
that we set up a high scale core
physical network then we move
virtualization into that network and
then we attached compute and storage and
present that to you in a variety
different ways we've also certified for
those of you who are developers a huge
range of open-source offerings on top of
the stack so you can certainly run
Oracle technology on top of this but you
can also run your favorite open-source
tools on top of it so let me show you
how this actually works okay so you go
to the Oracle cloud and set up an
account and you come in and sign it you
can enter username password you sign in
when you come in the first thing we ask
you you you know you get an integrated
experience in a console and everything
I'm showing in the console is available
as a RESTful API so you can script
against it using chef or puppet or
ansible or whatever tool you'd like to
do okay so the first thing we're going
to do is set up something called a
compartment what is a compartment
imagine you're a company and there many
different divisions and you want to set
up a set of compute and storage
resources for an application that's just
for one division and you want to
restrict user access to that to just be
one division within the company a
compartment gives you the ability to set
up a partition that has access control
for the resources within that partition
okay so that's what a compartment is so
we're going to create a compartment
called demo okay and we just set that up
now the first thing you do after you set
up a compartment think about being in a
data center is set up a core network so
we call that a virtual cloud network
there are none in this compartment so
we're going to create one so we're going
to set up we essentially set up a core
network
to which now you can attach compute
storage database analytics so we set up
a virtual cloud network what's the next
thing you typically do you want to hook
up that virtual cloud network to the
internet so you create something called
an Internet gateway okay so we're going
to create an Internet gateway we call
that demo so when we setup that this
internet gateway if you're setting up
web servers and things like that that
need to be accessible from the internet
it will provide a public nack IP address
to those so you're reachable over the
public Internet okay so we set that up
now you're going to create subnets
subnets are you're taking that core
network we set up called the VPN and on
top of that we're layering subnets so we
call the first one dmz one it's set up
in an availability domain western region
you can set up the route tables you can
set up DHCP options etc and we setting
up a subnet to each of these operations
takes about a minute or two to do okay
now you can set up multiple subnets in
the same way okay so now you've got an
entire set of virtual networks set up
and you can now say okay I want to
create services within that subnet so
the first one we're going to do is
launch a database so you can say look
I'd like to create a database I'm going
to call it database one it sits in the
availability domain that within which I
created that subnet I'm going to call it
extreme performance edition of the
Oracle database okay so we created a
database I need to give it some network
information like the host the host
domain and the vcn in which I'm setting
it up I'm going to pick version 12 one
or two of the database and we created it
is about eight to ten minutes to launch
a database okay so once you launch that
you're going to say I've got you know a
second instance so that I can get
availability high availability between
those if you notice the second instance
is created in availability domain - so
it's highly available and we're set up
data guard between those two okay so now
that I have the database we've got to go
and create the application tier so the
application tier is going to run if the
collection of web servers with a node
applications that run for the middle
tier first thing I'm going to do is
create an instance these instances are
created within the demo compartment so I
get asked what kind of OS do I want to
use I can certainly create vanilla
instances with Oracle Linux or Windows
or CentOS it there's a variety of
standard images if you are a customer
you can also bring your own images if
you look at the custom images we've
added a custom set of images the bastian
one being for high security okay so
we're going to pick and you know a
compute instance I've called it web
server one I'm going to choose if you
notice we have a variety of different
shapes they're bare metal B M stands for
bare metal that's whether I get a
physical server VM means it's a
hypervisor I'm just going to use a
hypervisor in this environment I'm going
to choose that shape I provide the SSH
key that I can use to access the
hypervisor and I've created it that you
can now create it it's running I can
create a second one and it's running so
you're probably thinking what about
storage so now I'm going to go and
create storage remember we have
different kinds of storage block object
backup so I'm going to create block
volumes I'm going to create a block
volume and I'm going to create that in
that demo compartment and now I'm going
to attach it to the compute instances
that I created so I'm going to take this
block storage volume and attach it to
compute instances so that now the
compute instances have the block storage
attached to it okay
so we've done that now remember I have
to compute instances serving the middle
tier I need to set up load balancing
folder so I'm going to set up an elastic
load balancer it's the equivalent of
what you traditionally think about it's
a big IP or physical appliance but here
you're doing it through software it's a
piece of software that provides the
elastic load balancing capabilities so
to do the elastic load balancer there's
a couple of things you need the first
one is you need to name it and you need
to tell us how much throughput you need
through the elastic load balancer so
right up there we've got a hundred
megabits per second throughput through
the load balancer and we pre provision
the I ops so that if you get a huge
surge in spike in traffic you can go all
the way up to that pre provision
die-offs and then be elastically scaled
beyond that okay so we've also set up
which virtual network you want to have
the load balancing back endpoints
seconds so those are within dmz one and
dmz two so I've created a load balancer
okay so now you're looking at where do I
go to set up my load balancing algorithm
because now I've got the load balancer
and do you do round-robin you will do
weighted round robin do you random so
what setting up a back-end set
essentially means setting up the load
balancing policy so I'm going to set it
up it's using TCP on port 80 port 80 is
the HTTP port and we're setting up a
weighted round robin policy so this sets
up that load balancing policy okay so
what and you can similarly set it up
with the other backends across which you
want load balancing to work so what are
we done here we essentially took what
you would normally do within a data
center right you're going to create
users in groups we map them to a
compartment within which resources set
we then set up a virtual network we
created subnets on top of it we attach
the word
network to the Internet to an Internet
gateway then we attach compute storage
we created a database we then set up a
load balancer that front ended the the
web tier so you could get round-robin
weighted round robin load balancing
across it so what we've really done is
taken the data center and instead of
having you to have to manually create it
expose that to an API and what we just
did was set up a virtual data center in
the club okay now the second piece that
we're working on is the thing called
platform-as-a-service
so what are we really trying to solve a
platform as-a-service if you took our
infrastructure as a service and you
wanted to deploy your software and top
of that of course you can but you are
responsible for all of the manual labor
associated with installing the software
configuring the software patching the
software backing up the software
encrypting the software maintaining it
so what we're really doing with
infrastructure as a service is
automating the process to give you
infrastructure resources what we did was
we took Hardware made it accessible
through an API and allowed you create a
software-defined virtual data center now
for the platform layer which sits on top
of infrastructure what we're really
doing is eliminating all the manual work
associated with installing configuring
monitoring administering patching
backing up maintaining the platform
layer that you want to use to build
cloud services and it's not that we're
doing that
with human beings of our own we're doing
that through software itself so when you
look at the platform layer what we're
really doing is providing you a complete
platform that includes all these
elements and then automating through
software and machine learning how
software itself administers this
platform okay so you get to simply use
the platform you don't have to
administer the platform so let's start
with data management we provide you a
variety of databases in the Oracle cloud
historically people have known that the
Oracle database runs amazingly well in
the Oracle cloud we provide you full
flavors of the Oracle database you can
run a data warehouse you can run a
transaction processing you can run that
on commodity hardware for tests and dev
or you can run that on extra data as a
service if you want super high
performance we also give you the
in-memory database and if you want to
build lightweight apps we give you
something called multi-tenant database
but our cloud doesn't just run Oracle
database it also runs other databases so
you can run my sequel if you're an open
source developer you can run Cassandra
if you're an open source developer you
can run HBase for Apache for Hadoop in
her cloud you can also build apps you
can use a variety of IDE
NetBeans or Eclipse for example if
you're in Java we give you a system
called a developer cloud service which
is a source control system that has a
git repository a JIRA task management
system a continuous integration pipeline
which I'll show you and then we really
see four styles of application
development you can do traditional Java
EE application development you can do
lightweight scripting using Ruby node
Python a variety of programming
languages you can build apps for mobile
environments using either mobile web or
for mobile applications or mobile
messaging we showed last week and
another event something called a chat
bot that allows you to take applications
and expose that to a messaging system
and then lastly a big push for us is
allowing people to build new types of
applications using microservices on
darker
and so our vision for how people build
microservices as I said our platform
runs on top of infrastructure as a
service we were giving you a docker
registry in which you can publish your
doctor images you can run both stateless
and stateful docker containers and then
you can build a variety of different
applications in a variety of different
programming languages Java Ruby North
Python Scala now when you use docker
though today you have to deal with for
example scheduling an orchestration
we're going to give you a manage docker
environment we're using kubernetes we'll
schedule it for you today if you're
using darker you are responsible for
writing a discovery service we're going
to give you a discovery service so you
can use it if you use darker today you
have to write your own caching solution
for example if you've distributed
caching using red we're going to give
you an in-memory you know data data
management system using Redis so in
addition to giving you a raw container
runtime we're also giving you a variety
of prepackaged multi-tenant services
that will simplify how you build
applications so if you look at what's
happening we're giving you a data
management fabric an application
development fabric and then what we're
going to do is give you the ability to
dev ops what is DevOps DevOps is
converting software into a supply chain
so that you can build package ship code
in a standardized way so let's say as an
example you're a developer you can go to
get or to our developer cloud service
check in code you can use maven or
Gradle for dependency management and
build once you build you want to package
your artifact you can use Packer for
example packaging and you can get
notifications that you both succeeded
over slack the output of a build can
call a function and the function can
kick off a simple workflow
to say hey I need approval before I can
deploy and then it calls scheduling an
orchestration to deploy if you're using
VMs you can use chef or puppet or
ansible as your orchestration language
and spin up VMs if you're using
containers it's essentially the left
hand of the pipeline is exactly the same
but for scheduling an orchestration you
can push to kubernetes for scheduling
orchestration and you push your image
instead of into our image service into
the docker registry okay so now think
about that left side of that what we're
really doing is saying there's a you
checked in code that fired an event to
say kick off a continuous integration
pipeline that did a build and then it
fired an event called the function and
then the function kicked off that whole
workflow process in the backend right
now
imagine you tied in your production
system back into this so you could say
for example scheduled every night I have
a scheduling service that says every
night kick off a build and then that
calls the same workflow and deploys the
code you could do it based on policy you
could say you know on the last Friday of
every month I have a huge rush as a
retailer so I need more capacity kick
off that rule that will then drive an
auto scale procedure continuous
development integration could be in the
pipeline or you could for example use an
event service we have called Kafka where
from whatever environment you're calling
in you can kick off an event and that
can trigger this workflow and so what
we've really done is taken the software
supply chain and standardized four
elements we're giving you a platform on
which to build apps you don't have to
administer that environment at all who's
administering the environment software
is administering the environment for you
and it's setting up the environment and
administering it for you
secondly we're standardizing the way
that you check in code kick off a build
tight into an integration pipeline and
generate a packaged image for deployment
third is we've provided you a software
based way to deploy scale and manage
this environment so let's show you how
this works
I go to the cloud and log in now the
first thing we see is we see this
console which has a list of all your
services that you're allowed to use in
this environment you've got three sets
database credits infrastructure credits
and pass credits which are essentially
credits that you have that you can
consume and it tells you how much you
have left in all of these so I'm going
to go to that thing called stack manager
what is that mentor stack manager is a
template that allows you to build a
complete stack okay so we've got one for
Java on our Exadata Express service that
lets you build an app using Java an
exudate Express but since many people
have asked us how do you support open
source development I'm going to show you
how to do it with node and my sequel so
we built the the stack template is just
a JSON file that shows the services you
want and the relationships between them
if you look at that web app template
this is essentially what we're saying
okay we've got a my sequel database and
two java instances and a web app and
that's the topology so you can write
your own stack templates we give you a
set of prepackaged ones this one looks
good so we're going to go create it so
what do you have to specify you have to
specify the name of the application you
have to specify the template you want to
use you have to specify you know in this
particular one we have oh let's call it
a Java tier 4 for the business object
layer and the front-end app is a web
tier and then your my sequel database
password that you want to use
and then the developer project the
developer project is the project in our
developer cloud that you want to be
associated with so you can look at
confirm you'll find with this and we're
going to create it so when we created it
what we're really doing is we're
creating an entire stack we have setup
your web app here your java the the web
apt here is an odious runtime it runs
inside the docker container we've setup
a java tier we've set up a my sequel
database and we've set up a project in
the developer cloud service called the
address check app project okay so you
may think that's really quick and easy I
don't have to worry about setting up
compute and all this infrastructure
you're giving me an entire set of
runtimes so now imagine you have to sit
in front of this and monitor it all the
time and if there's workload that
happens you have to scale it we said why
do you need to sit there why don't we
allow you to go get coffee or do
whatever you guys like let's have the
system do it for you so we're going to
set up what we call an auto scale
template what is the auto scale template
do it sets up it allows you to specify a
set of business rules if the average
response time on this application is
more than 100 millisecond scale-out by
two instances and you can add if you
want once you scaled out wait for 30
minutes for example before you scale
back down so you don't set up a very
spiky scaling policy and then the
average response time is more than is
less than 100 milliseconds or is less
than 10 milliseconds you can scale back
down as well okay so we're setting up an
auto scale rule here we've set up the
auto scale rule so you don't have to
monitor this environment anymore for is
it got enough capacity the system is
going to scale it out for you
automatically and I showed you scaling
out but you can also scale up if you if
your application is not designed to
scale out so now let's go look now that
we've set up that
let's go look at our developer project
okay so we're going there and what you
see here is the console of our developer
cloud service you can look at all the
projects you have we're going to go to a
particular project okay so this is the
scrum dashboard for our address check
app project the one that was associated
with the stack template okay so when you
look at that it has a built in
lightweight IDE directly in the browser
so I'm going to go in and add a node
function you can check in code it does
all the things you would expect a design
time to do context-sensitive
highlighting you can run syntax checking
etc okay so when I made the change I can
then say ok I've updated it and it'll
kick off a build in the developer
project and so when you go to your
master code line because I checked in
code into my master bill code line this
is exactly what you would see and you
would see if you've looked at it at the
top John Dunbar which is me has updated
a notification based on the new spec
that I've checked it okay so we've
kicked off a build so now you can look
at all your build jobs and go where are
they if there are build failures you'll
be notified on slack if you you know if
it succeeds then it's going to go to
deployment and so how do we handle
deployment there are two ways we handle
deployment the first way is you can set
it up to a developer instance like for a
dev test you can click to auto deploy
what it deploys directly ok for
production however you probably don't
want somebody checking in code and
directly deploying the production so for
production we've set up a function again
what is the function to the function
says the release manager has to look at
it and say approved and then the
function will call the developer cloud
service API to deploy so we set up a
service function to allow you to do that
okay so here is the function page in the
same console it gives you the ability to
see the function and it allows you to
for example control things like memory
usage etc on the function now if you
visualize the function what is the
function it has a web book to which
you're going to get the external call
from the release management system
saying go ahead that in turn calls a
node.js function and that calls the
developer cloud service or call anywhere
else to say bind this and promote it so
here is the nodejs function itself and
you can see the code in it and it allows
you to add essentially functions so that
you're dealing with scaling out lot of
physical resources but scaling out a
particular functions in this case okay
so here is the trigger source for it I
think you guys all know node so I won't
go through it in a lot of detail but
we've just added a function and now if
you look at it the response is deployed
and if I go back to my console I will
see that that we've now deployed this
application with my check in that I had
done okay so what have we really done
here what we did was very simple you can
certainly get
infrastructure-as-a-service
install your own stack manage the
software stack on top of it okay but
then you're responsible for configuring
this back managing the stack patching
the stack backing up all of that so we
said if you're looking at a platform why
don't we raise the abstraction through
which people deal with it so what we did
was we said look we're going to give you
a stack template the stack template
allows you to define the collection of
runtime services you need to build your
app in our case we said I need a
developer project
to node.js instances
a Java Runtime from the business logic
tier and a my sequel back-end we then
created it for you we then said look we
can auto scale this whole thing so you
won't have to worry about scaling we
would also catch it we would back it up
as a unit we'd set up disaster recovery
for it all of it will be done for you
you don't have to do any of it okay now
we then said look what we want to have
you do is focus on writing code so you
wrote code you checked it into the
continuous build pipeline the software
built it for you for your development
instances auto promotes your production
instance you can add essentially
workflow to control what you deploy now
over time we don't believe people
necessarily want to deal with servers
and storage and other things people
really want to say I want to write code
and I want to give you you know my code
is packaged as a module called a
function I'm going to deploy that code
you scale the code and I don't care
whether you scale it on top of a darker
environment or a VM or a physical server
what I really care about is that my
module of code which I'm promoting is
unit of work that I want you to scale
and I'm going to tell you what SLA I
want you to meet and so you increasingly
there our view is today people look at
infrastructure which is compute storage
etc and they say applications sit on top
of it and what I deal with is scaling
that infrastructure and over time do you
think people should deal with the
modules of code they want and they want
to focus on scaling of that as opposed
to saying and from our point of view the
infrastructure to transparently deal
with that and infrastructure over time
becomes invisible because you don't have
to worry about what infrastructure am i
deploying on you worry about the modules
of code you're deploying and we take
care of that infrastructure for you and
so that's the heart of what we're
building with platform next
the same platform has on top of the same
infrastructure for additional sets of
capabilities I talked about data
management I talked about app debt but
there's four additional set of
capabilities same API same process I
showed you to build out a stack you can
say I want an analytic stack what is an
analytic stack I need a dupe data Lake
I want to stream some events in it in
real time so I need a Kafka event
streaming service I want to clean data
in that Lake I want to run a spark
sequel or spark ml for machine learning
and I want to then visualize the data
coming out of this a dupe cluster same
API same experience we can elastically
deploy a Hadoop spa cluster you can run
hive you can run Pig
you can run spark increasingly receive
more and more people using spark and
then you can stream in events if you're
moving real-time data into that
environment okay you can also integrate
our cloud with other clouds using the
same platform you can build ad eyes and
publish them you can integrate api's
with other systems using our service bus
you can add orchestration or workflow on
top of it and then you can use a set of
tools if you want to move data okay
identity so when you build applications
with our ions or tasks with a central
place where you manage your user
identities you map your users to groups
you set up authentication policies and
authorization policies for users and
groups inside each of your services you
have permissions you map those
permissions to roles and then you grant
groups of users permissions on the
applications by mapping groups to votes
okay so it's a very simple model for how
you handle permission
in this environment you can match manage
these users and groups in a cloud if you
happen to have an on-premise identity
management system like Active Directory
or LDAP you can federate up using sam'l
or orth - ok so you have a central way
you manage security and identity in the
cloud lastly we also provide you a
management service running in the cloud
imagine you were using infrastructure as
a service and you were running an
application on top of it you wanted to
monitor your physical hosts you can
deploy an agent that's it you don't need
to run a management system yourself to
monitor this environment all you needed
an agent the agent talks back to a
monitoring and management cloud service
it monitors your hosts it monitors your
databases it gives you performance
information how fast and how efficient
is performance you can compare the
configuration of all these systems and
you can get a configuration baseline if
you're unhappy with something you can
kick off a change management process and
orchestrate using a variety of
orchestration tools ok so it's a
complete stack and the heart of what
we're doing with platform as-a-service
is to give you a complete stack to
manage your data build applications do
analytics integrate different systems
together and then monitor and manage
this environment in a secure way and if
you deal with the platform layer you
don't have to worry about managing the
software monitoring the software
patching it backing it up now the last
piece application software is a service
so you know we know that everybody wants
to manage money in an ERP system hire
people in an HR system do work in
meeting customer requirements in CRM
build things with supply chain and then
manufacture stuff so we've built an
entire staff suite
that works and runs in the cloud people
then ask okay so if I have one of those
applications so far comments what you've
showed us was what hardcore programmers
would do but I'm not a really hardcore
programmer guy you know my skill set as
a developer I am somebody who knows how
to drag-and-drop and assemble
applications does Oracle have a solution
for me as you know so my answer to you
is yes if you're one of those developers
who's not a hardcore programmer but
wants to build our petitions with visual
drag-and-drop we've got a solution for
you
okay that's called the application
builder cloud we're going to show it to
you
and so here it is I go to a cloud login
same person John Dunbar we're going to
build an app the app is really simple
the app is designed to run on a mobile
phone in a web mode and a mobile app
mode so you can run in both a browser
and a mobile app same tool set same
back-end business object but now deliver
to two different front ends okay so we
call it fix it fast because it meant for
service technicians to go on-site and
then find problems and remediate it so
the first thing we do is when they
create an incident business object
what's the incident business object it
takes a customer name and a description
and then we're going to set up some
rules that say depending on the customer
name or type of customer if they have
more than a certain number of incidents
and their gold customer raise priority
on it to a high priority okay so what it
is is the customer name there's a
priority field which is a master detail
on customer and a set of rules this here
is the customer object the customer
object has a bunch of fields okay who
was it created by when was it created
when was this updated etc this is all
about the incident okay so think of it
simple simple
a simple service request got a service
request from a customer on a particular
day time I created it so these are the
fields of that incident object now I
want to add a validation trigger on
something called
gold customer escalation so I first
write a description of it if the
customer is a gold member and as more
than five open incidents set priority to
hi okay so that's essentially a trigger
function so you can write that and then
you can draw how the trigger can be
fired and you you know I'm showing you a
very simple trigger but using this rules
base you can build very very complex and
sophisticated triggers so we'll be just
done is set up this business object
called incident that's associated with a
customer set up a business rule the
business rule is when do escalations
happen for gold customers so now we're
going to show you that same back end
business object access from a mobile app
not mobile web just to prove the point
that we've got a comment back-end so
here is the mobile phone simulator it's
an iPhone simulator we've got this thing
called high priority incident okay so
that was tied to that business object
and that business rule that I created on
incidents and what I'm going to do is do
a simple extension to this mobile app
showing if I do see high-priority
incidents I want to go to a set of
screens that show me the geographical
layout of where these incidents are
because of the technician I want to
drive right over and help these
customers
it's a here it's the high priority
incident and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add a screen as an action so
that when I tap on that high-priority
incident tile it's going to take me to
an action that lets me navigate to the
judge geography and so I'm going to add
navigate to a screen and then here it is
I'm going to give the title of the
screen around me because when I see the
mole
phone you're going to see an app and the
app is going to tie to a mapping system
and the maps show you all the incidents
around me so I give the title around me
I add you know the content so that it
links to that label so when I hit the
tile it's going to navigate over to the
screen and now I have to bind data into
this page so what data am I going to
bind I'm going to go obviously I said it
was a location so we give you a whole
bunch of prepackaged components you can
write your own in this particular case I
have a map so when I bind the mapping
component in okay so that allows me to
bind data into this particular page now
there's one other thing whose location
do I use to show the map so I've got to
show I want you can address and then I
want to see multiple incidents not just
one so I picked the multiple and then
the incident is then tied to a business
object and the location value is based
on the formatted address and I can then
tie the query parameter to be me so that
username is the application user okay so
what do we do we built a business object
declaratively that captured this notion
of an incident we then added a business
rule to that that said if the business
object incident has more than five open
when open is a status then and it's a
gold customer then make an escalation
meaning make it high priority and that
was a business rule that we added to
that business object so that was setting
up the backend we then added a UI to it
the UI shows all the incidents in a tile
and the high-priority ones are what
shows up in the top tile and when I see
the high-priority incidents I want to
figure out where all these customers are
so I then added a screen to say take an
action when I tap the tile to navigate
over to that
and in the screen bind it to a map
component and use the location of the
customers but find them around me as a
user so the location is the customers
addresses but it's showing my location
of what's around me so that's the app
and you can see that we've got the
simulator running so the simulator shows
you can do that now you may think okay
so can I actually see the app so we
actually built the app you can publish
it out let's see if I can switch the
screen so if you had built the app you
can you know scan the zip code and the
app code here so here's my screen I'm
loaded Mac's tap on it you can see the
high-priority incidents it's the same
app that we showed you I touch on label
you can see takes my location and then
if I tap more it's going to zoom in on
the location in which I am okay so we
showed you not just professional
developers who are writing code but also
declarative developers we have a
solution for okay so let's switch back
to the slides so in a very quick summary
what's our vision for all of you as
developers we want to do three simple
things take Hardware make it
programmable to an API and once you've
made a programmable to an API allow you
to build software-defined virtual data
centers that run in the cloud that's
what we're doing with infrastructure of
the service and we wanted to give you
amazing performance and scale with those
data centers okay so we showed you how
easy that is to do on top of that we
said let's build a platform layer that
runs on top of this infrastructure and
the valley the platform is give people a
complete platform expose it to a higher
level abstraction API allow them to
build a stack of stuff and then take
away all the burden in managing that
stack
provision the stack scale it patch it
back it up encrypt it do all those
functions and the third is allow people
to access and build application not just
as professional developers but also
declarative developers and standardize
that software development or DevOps
supply chain so you can build package
ship run software in a standard way and
much more quickly than you could before
you should be able to deploy every
minute or every hour
now how we bringing this to you so you
may think that sounds great Thomas but
when I go back and talk to my company
and my customers within my organization
they're uncomfortable going to a public
cloud okay so you can for example do all
your development and test in our cloud
but if you're a developer in a company
and they want to deploy on the floor the
same software that I showed you is
available on your floor with something
called the Oracle cloud a customer
program so you can use the same API same
software to build something in the
public cloud and then bring it to your
floor you could also say what about
third party stuff are there lots of
people building on your cloud and where
do I go and find my latest open source
tool or widget that I want to use so we
have something called the cloud
marketplace where you can find lots of
applications and partner solutions that
are built on the cloud and you can
access those from our cloud you can even
press a button and many of them auto
deploy to our cloud back-end so to
simplify and bring all of this to you we
have three announcements today again the
first one is how do you learn about this
so we're noun Singh a partnership with P
Rho site where they their leading online
education organization they're working
with us to take all of our content and
training materials and make it available
as Learning Path
to the developer community so that if
you want to learn you don't have to go
to a classroom in a building you can sit
at your home on your laptop watch a
class learn from Oracle and clean
website together so the first piece was
bringing all of this technology in an
easily consumable easily trainable form
to you and that's part one part two is
where do you go to find the latest
content the latest sample application
code the latest you know blog posts
about what we're delivering new were
introduced a new portal called developer
oracle.com
where you get the latest information
about new technologies that we're
bringing out and get code samples and
everything else you need to get started
to build really cool apps third if you
want to try this we're introduced a
program where you get $300 in free
credits all you go to is go to the
Oracle cloud sign up you don't need to
pay for it we'll give you $300 a free
credit to allow you to experience and
try these things and then if you really
like it obviously you can then continue
using it but it's meant to make it zero
friction for people to use the software
you can do it a hundred percent
self-service online without talking to
anybody at Oracle and you can go ahead
and try the software so what we've
really done is change how Oracle is
delivering software to you we've done
three simple things we've changed how
we're delivering hardware and
infrastructure no longer do you have to
buy a box no longer do you have to cable
a box no longer do you need a sysadmin
what you do is you go to an API and
create your data center virtually you
get amazing performance and scale if you
then want to use our tools on top of it
you can deploy the code and top of it
and what we want to enable it's
something very simple any developer
anywhere in the world as long as you
have a computer with a browser should be
able to access any of our cloud services
so you can build really cool
applications for every human being in
the world and that's what we're doing
