back at Moscone and the developer lounge
area I'm Heather Van Kyra and I'm here
today to interview Brian gets welcome
Brian hi Heather
thanks for joining me making time in
your schedule I really appreciate that
no problem we've been spending a lot
more time together it feels like old
days not our wait only are we back at
Moscone but we've been interacting just
like we were back in those days oh yeah
there's a lot going on in the community
so tell us a little bit about the
release of Java 9 that's really exciting
of course you know that just happened in
September community is anxiously
awaiting it once you share a little bit
about your perspective about the launch
yeah so obviously that's the big news
this year at JavaOne is the launch of
Java and I and and this is you know job
and I know something's been working on
for more than three years at this point
and the major feature of Java 9 the
jigsaw module system is something we've
been working on for a lot longer and so
it's very nice to see this one in the
rearview mirror and I think you know the
community response has been very
positive I think there was a little bit
of hesitation and concern about oh my
god you know Java 9 is gonna break the
world but the reality has been you know
quite different we've been you know
seeing a lot of announcements of you
know maven works fine with Java and I
and all of these you know popular
frameworks have all up you know updated
to address any you know concerns people
might have had and it's all seems to be
working yeah actually so last week we
were chatting I heard about the hash tag
that's going on Twitter was that works
to find on JDK 9 yeah right absolutely
and there were there were a lot of
responses on that so you know I think
people are always afraid of change but I
think you know looking back on this one
I think this is gonna be a really good
thing yeah I was really encouraged to
see all the positive comments on that
hashtag so yeah was really exciting to
see and also the things that people
developers have been sharing with me is
you know it's it's more than modularity
as well so a lot of people just have put
that you know hat on it and think of it
as that but there are lots of other cool
things
yeah there's over 100
50 new features in Java and of course
that you know some of them are things
that are way behind the scenes that you
know that are only interesting to small
niches some of them are new libraries
new frameworks new protocol support you
know support for Unicode support for
updated versions of security protocols
so there's an awful lot going on in it
but of course a lot of it is in the
shadow of the module system and so
that's what people associate with Java 9
but there's quite a lot of work on
behalf of quite a lot of people have
gone into it right it's it's impressive
so I know even before the release and
the final release of Java 9 and the
official product launch actually you
started announcing some things about
what's coming next in the future for
Java in terms of delivery models so why
don't you share a little bit about about
that yeah so we have a lot of big news
on that as well and that and that's also
related to you know to the jigsaw module
system one of the reasons we did jigsaw
was it was taking a certain amount of
pain in the present to enable us to move
faster in the future by encapsulating
the the internal API is it made it a lot
easier for us to roll update to the
platform out faster and so now that
we've we've done that groundwork we're
able to move to a much more rapid
cadence for rod for doing Java releases
and so one of the things we're
announcing this week is we're moving to
an every 6 month cadence for a major
Java releases each of which is a you
know full major release that can have
you know language features and library
features in it so that's gonna be a big
change both to the way that we
internally work to the way we plan
product releases and to the way people
uptake Java right and I know some people
actually haven't picked up on that but
actually a lot of the groundwork was set
up in Java 9 so I think that's a really
interesting point that people have lost
so it's yeah you've been setting the
groundwork it's not like oh all of a
sudden we've made this decision
yesterday and we're now gonna just move
to a six month release cycle right I
mean we've been wanting to move faster
for a long time and you know some of the
impediments have been the you know the
challenge of compatibly moving forward
when so many popular applications and
frameworks are using internal api's and
so you know we knew what we had to do it
took a while to get there it'll take a
little bit of time for the community to
to catch up but then we should be able
to move on
and the next you know the next version
of Java after Java 9 is releasing in
like five months in March of 2018 so
we're you know we're really moving right
so it's Java 18.3 18.3 jsr has already
been filed the jsr has already been
filed and we'll be filing the jsr for
18.9 fairly soon because you know we got
to keep it moving you're serious about
that so we we have been discussing open
JDK in the JCP cuz of course you know
that's what I spend most of my time
doing not all of my time doing right I'm
more than the JCP I think as we were
discussing earlier so what maybe share a
little bit with the folks listening here
you know what we've been doing in terms
of work within the JCB how it can open
JDK and the JCP work better together and
what kind of things we might expect in
the future to enable this release cycle
to move a little bit faster you know I
mean a lot of people have made the
assumption that open JDK and JCP are
somewhat somehow opposed to each other
and in conflict and and that's not
really true at all and each of these
each of these governance models has
there has their strengths and weaknesses
and we want to play to the strengths of
each right so open JDK is a wonderful
place to do innovation it's a wonderful
place to get community engagement to
anybody who wants can show up and so
that's a really good place for us to be
doing exploratory design and
implementation and the JCP is really
focused on specification and there's a
lot of people have been participating in
the JCP for years who are experts on
specification and vetting specification
to make sure that it can be implemented
independently and so the process of do
your innovation and your design and open
JDK when you think you have the right
thing bring it to the JCP make sure that
the spec is is all there is suitable for
independent implementation the to work
very nicely together mm-hmm
so maybe sherry we're gonna make a few
changes kind of based on your feedback
as well as some general community
feedback to kind of make things a little
bit more efficient but like what kinds
of things are we looking at yeah so the
JCP has been around for 20 years and it
was designed at a time when all
development was done in the closed which
isn't true anymore and it was designed
at a time when development was done in a
more waterfall model which also isn't
true anymore
and so we're making some you know for
minor updates to the you know to the
process to make it you know help it move
a little bit faster I help break the the
waterfall nature of a little bit and
part of that is moving the less
predictable work to open JDK where
things can spin much faster and where we
don't have to commit to when something's
gonna ship we can decide we're gonna
work on it until it's ready and then
when we think it's ready then bring it
to the JCP you know for for
specification standardization and
vetting mm-hmm and so with the release
model shifting to every six months you
know whether you know a certain feature
is ready or not it makes a little bit
harder to say like what would be in the
next version of Java moving forward so
what's in eighteen point three but I
know you can't say that but maybe share
of some of the new cool projects and
jep's that you're working on that are
possible candidates yeah so you know
we're moving to a late binding feature
model right where we say rather than
saying three years in advance these are
the features that are going to be in the
next version of Java we say these are
the things we're working on and when
they're ready
then we'll book a ticket on the next
train right and with trains leaving
frequently you know the risk of oh it's
not quite ready we'll have to wait to
the next train is actually not so bad
six months is not a very long time so
you know one of the features I think
people are gonna be very happy about is
actually one of the most frequently
requested you know Java language
features is type inference for local
variables and this is a something that
we're confident saying will be in 18.3
because it's already been committed it's
been pushed and this is a feature that
is popular in other languages that are
similar to Java c-sharp Scala
even C++ has it and so like I said it's
one of the most frequently requested
features and we looked at it and we said
this is a perfectly good fit for Java so
we went ahead and did it
right well I'm really looking forward to
continuing our work together and working
with you to ensure that we have the next
release of Java out in five months yeah
it's gonna be a wild ride
and we're starting our week here at Java
one so thanks a lot for making time for
me today and sharing with everyone
what's coming next in Java and
a little bit about Java nine in the
future real always great to see you and
we'll talk later
thanks a lot Heather good to see you and
we're out can you help me turn this off
Chuck Chuck
welcome to another session of dev life
here at Oracle OpenWorld check check
check check
can you hear me Gabe you all right there
just come in a little bit it's good
thanks
yeah so it basically goes I always have
a hard time with our teeth part of me so
what shall I
okay can you hear me now okay good
thanks Jim I always have a hard time
describing this is it go this way I
think it goes this way like that hope
you're right
left here yep you got it
thanks Jim Oh deeper go talking
blockchain
okay you good yep all right you can just
give me just keep talking it just would
not actually if you can come in a little
bit and just keep it straight and you
just talk to me just so come with it so
just just say something
hi how are you good thank you all right
bump you up a little bit all right so
with that we will start came up with
some kind of an error message
I think it's going so
it's running
so welcome to another session of dev
life here at Oracle OpenWorld 2017 I'm
your host job at Mohammed and I have as
my guest today Deepak girl
Deepak welcome thank you and your title
is senior director product development
senior director of product development
so we're going to be talking about
blockchain today let's just start off
just for the benefit of some of the
folks who may not have heard about
blockchain
I guess what it's a distributed way of
doing creative things from I don't know
finances to a whole bunch of things
probably I'm stumbling all around can
you give us perhaps a better
articulation of what blockchain is
blocking can solve all the problem of
the world of the world okay for
president for you I got one so you have
to look at like how transactions are
done today actually in the enterprise
world if two organizations are talking
to each other what they are doing is
they are going into the central system
central database of a organization and
making transactions over there and each
organization has their own source of the
prote
over a period of time these databases
can go out of sync so the problem is
that these organization would have to go
to get together offline and reconcile
and make sure that they have the same
information in their databases so that's
one problem second problem is most of
the time these organization because they
don't trust each other
they go through an intermediary so they
are trusting the intermediary and this
organization is also testing that and
they are saying that okay you do the
transaction and all these handshake on
behalf of us that takes a lot of time
because all the transaction first have
to go to intermediaries from both
directions and reconciliation and
settlement for example they stop trading
right so it takes three days for us to
settle they stock probably even a more
simpler example is probably just a
regular bank transaction and that's why
I can a bit Bitcoin can I come here and
write so yeah so every time like you
talk about god blockchain the first
thing that comes to mind is Bitcoin
Bitcoin but let me actually
that bitcoin is just one application of
blockchain the blockchain has huge
potential actually to change all the
transaction that goes on between
organization
so what blockchain does is is basically
also known as a distributed ledger
technology a distributed ledger a
distributed ledger technology so like
everyone has their own ledger but they
have the same information exactly the
same information in their ledger
ok so what's happening here is like when
I do a transaction I create the
transaction this other organization
which I am transacting with they also
execute the same transaction and the
update is made to the ledger at the same
time ok and in order to an update to be
made to the ledger a consensus among
these transacting parties have to be
achieved so they reject the concept of
consensus among these parties that come
into the picture ok but at the very
basic level it's a way of storing the
distributed ledger distributed
information and doing the distributed
transaction across many cross
departmental cross organizations
business process yes why you're doing
some other example you can say these
supply chains for example you want to
understand like from where your food is
coming so there are so many components
so many places the food might have been
and how it was transported and all that
so using the block ledger blockchain
Ledger's this all this information can
be tracked and one other benefit of
block ledger is once the information
gets into the ledger
it cannot be repudiated it cannot be it
cannot be repudiated ok it's immutable
so no one can change it so if even if
like by mistake an organization makes a
bad entry into the ledger it cannot you
can't cover it around cover it not
anyone watching out there all right ok
so that's I mean obviously the the
number of uses of it's just based upon
your explanation is very multifaceted
and as you said it can solve maybe not
world peace but probably a lot of other
issues so tell us how Oracle kind of
plays into blockchain what's what's its
plan how does they fit in
what's what's the roadmap look like sure
sure
so let's look at like what Oracle is
Oracle serves the enterprise customers
we have four hundred and thirty thousand
customers and most of these are
enterprise customers who are running the
mission critical business application an
Oracle stack so these enterprise
customers have unique requirements as it
from any technology that they want
reviews the requirements are like a
scalability reliability they want the
performance security security the
topmost blockchain if you saw some of
them so what we are doing is we are
creating a blockchain cloud service on
Oracle cloud and we are making it
enterprise grade if you go actually in
the open source and all that you will
find a number of blockchain
implementation but none of them really
cater to the enterprise needs as such
okay so that's what we are doing here so
that's one thing second thing is Oracle
at a very unique position with respect
to application Oracle has a very
comprehensive suite of apps like HCM and
fusion ERP and supply chain and
healthcare and whatnot although suite
what's happening is today all these
applications are running in silos within
an organization I may have any RP you
may have an ERP but they are not talking
to each other
ma consummation and all those things
have to take place what the Oracle can
do what we can do actually is we can
have the DS ERP application connect
through the blockchain with each other
so I have a blockchain network on which
my ERP is connected to your ERP is
connected to one third party Europe is
connected to now if I make a transaction
all of them have the visibility of what
they need to see yeah so that actually
can reduce all these business processes
transaction time considerably okay so
like from page two seconds to minutes
and so on so basically we help through
the blockchain application we basically
what I heard you say was that we remove
a lot of the silos so that all of these
different whether they be erps or other
applications can can communicate with
each other right and we call it like
extending the boundaries of the
enterprise uh-huh so like Enterprise now
doesn't have to be enterprise
application does not have to be silho it
actually within one organization it can
be the cross businessman it can be
distributed and this blockchain can help
to increase the velocity
the business network and in Dedham so
how does Oracle's blockchain offering
differ than what's out there from I know
you compared a little bit with the open
source which obviously isn't enterprise
grade and it doesn't have some of the
the features that customers were on but
how does it can you come position it
with respect to what's out there in the
market right so first of all we are
providing this cloud service as a cloud
service on Oracle cloud so this would be
a platform as a service okay so once
customer comes they have actually a
blockchain network provision to them so
they don't need to worry about
assembling all the components together
like a peers and ordering service and
consensus algorithm and Ledger's and so
on everything comes preassembled to them
cool they just click a button and they
have the blockchain network running so
that way the customers can focus just on
the business logic of their transaction
that is creating the smart contract okay
and not worry about any infrastructure
details the configuration detail and
whatsoever so that's one thing it allows
developers and is fees partners everyone
we start developing the blockchain
application and experimentation very
quickly so they can within minutes they
can start running a blockchain use case
the second thing is for developers again
we provide the REST API driven
development okay if you go to the open
source implementation all of them have
these native API is there but REST API
is well known concept everyone can do
that we have the API management and
catalog and all that you just pick up
the API from there and you call the
smart contract business logic and so on
there's again like very fast to do that
third thing is the availability and
scalability and enterprise so that's
enterprise grade of the blockchain so we
are really focusing on that our
blockchain service offering that's going
to be highly available zero downtime
patching and all those things as well as
highly scalable so you can have like
hundreds of members in a blockchain
network as search and the
correspondingly increase in the business
transaction through port okay and you
can add actually all these members
dynamically to the blocks okay pretty
comprehensive exciting so if folks out
there want to learn more about
blockchain and what article offers can
is it available now is it uh what's
where are things that and how can they
get more information about it so we are
in the early adopter program at this
point
hope you're working with select partners
and customers there is very specific use
case they want to experiment with it and
they want to implement it on our service
so we already have our 10 or 12
customers in the program so if
somebody's interested they can approach
us Oracle through their account rep or
through any means okay and we can work
with them and getting them the early
access version is a controlled program
is a private program it's only
invitation by invitation only but there
is a lot more information available on
oracle.com slash blockchain oracle.com
slash blockchain that's right
all right you have some YouTube video as
well our service works and so off camera
so leaving blockchain aside you
mentioned you from New Jersey yes I
don't think I've been there
but should I any of the folks want to
visit there what's like one place you
would recommend to go and eat or to
visit over there eat outside but if I go
to New Jersey what do you recommend or
go and visit the Statue of Liberty the
stuff in New Jersey it's not in New York
as people say it's a New Jersey City New
Jersey you are you making a claim here
officially it's I have never heard well
folks you had this first an open well
2017 I've never heard that before the
fact thank you so much for coming and
sharing your interior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
