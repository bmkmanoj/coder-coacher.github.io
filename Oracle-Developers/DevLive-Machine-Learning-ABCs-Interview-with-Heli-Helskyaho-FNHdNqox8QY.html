here at Oracle code soul and we host
Javed Mohammed and I have with me Holly
from Finland and I won't pronounce try
to pronounce your last name so thank you
for from saving me from so first time we
had opportunity to look around so far I
write like six hours ago so surprised
that you're even awaken able to talk
coherently so that's impressive so you
have a very interesting presentation
about machine learning was the title of
it the basics of machine learning the
basics of machine yeah that's a great
title because I always love doing basics
so talk to us about machine learning I
mean it's obviously a very hot topic
yeah give us a little preview so what a
machine yep so machine learning is
actually an old thing it's been there
forever one of the quotes I have in
representation is from 1959 mentioning
machine learning already so it's not
something new it's very old but what has
changed now is that we have the ability
to really use it because of the
technology improved technology and also
because of big data so we have so much
data we need to have so we want to make
decisions based on data which is great
because the decisions are better if we
have a lot of data to to rely on but the
problem if we don't use machine learning
is that you should do it manually
you should check all the data and make
decisions based on that
but using machine learning we can kind
of ultimate eyes it so the computer can
do it for you but the idea so if you
think about traditional programming and
machine learning the difference is that
the machine is is learning all the time
by experience which is the algorithms
so we as human beings we learn everyday
we learn new things every day and we get
better hopefully better sometimes worse
but hopefully better and the same with
machines so with algorithms they get
better they learn more and they get
wiser and they can predict things better
so that's basically what machine
learning is about so we need to use it
for making decisions and making them
faster because life is going so fast
nowadays we need to have decisions very
very fast and we need to have some basic
why are we making these decisions or not
not this decision so we need to have
some kind of idea behind the decision
and that's machine learning so machine
learning is giving the idea why we are
doing what we are doing I think you may
have missed a key no but I think in one
of the keynotes I think the speakers
spoke about machine learning and then
just how for example like Oracle is kind
of introducing it through not just
article but other companies through
things like chat parts and you know I
think the example they give is of trying
to get bike Golden State what are your
tickets and when you go in there the
fact that you can have some kind of like
an intelligent conversation which kind
of yes makes the experience much more
rewarding yeah exactly the user as well
as the service provider yes sorry
thoughts about that so so just from I
mean how do you measure intelligence I
mean such a Deb Ulis concept is a good
question because actually it depends
what you are looking for domitius always
depend what you are looking for so what
are you aiming to do depending on that
you can be smart in math or you can be
smart in cooperating with other people
so it's different kind of intelligence
that you you have so depending where you
want to use it you are either good or
you're not good so the measures depend
what you are trying to do in the end of
the session I will talk about measures
and and how to find the right measures
for you and how to really measure
because it's it's really important can
you just give us
sample an example like a currency so I I
want to have very accurate answers I
never get true answers with machine
learning it's always approximations but
I can get a better approximation if I
tune certain things in my learning
process so depending what you're trying
to find you will measure different
things and you will tune different
things in your process so if there's
like one takeaway I know it's a very
broad subject it's a very deep subject
so from our viewers standpoint if
there's like one take away from your
presentation what would you want them to
walk away with machine learning is a
broad area so it's not just one
algorithm you have to remember by heart
and it's not just about mathematics
because this is what people are
sometimes very afraid of I'm not so good
in math so how will I survive with
machine learning so machine learning is
a very broad area and I think we need a
lot of different kind of people to fill
it so if you find that one of the areas
is not definitely your area try another
one if I'm sure there's something for
everybody because it's so broad so last
time I gave this presentation in India
and the Oracle code somebody came after
my presentation and said oh I survived I
was so afraid that you will talk too
much math and I'm not very good in math
I said well algorithms are about math
but you don't have to do them you don't
have to build new algorithms and you
don't have to do that kind of things you
can do something completely different
you can be like visualization one part
of the process or completely different
things you don't have to do exactly that
part somebody else is better on that so
he or she can do that and you do
something else
so if don't think it's only about math
and don't get afraid about that that's
my message there's so many things in
machine learning and I think machine
learning is something we should all be
aware of because that's the future we
really need computers to do things for
us like you mentioned those examples
from the keynote we really need to have
that kind of things to to be able to
facilitate the fast life otherwise we
will be stressed about stupid things we
shouldn't be because computers can
handle them and another thing is people
are afraid of losing their jobs because
of this computer
I don't because if the computer is doing
all the boring work for me I can
concentrate on something more
challenging that I will find interesting
so I don't have to do the basic things
anymore because computer can do that for
me I can do something advanced so I
think computers are bringing more
chances to our life not not taking
something away but bring me something
new so another thing is don't be afraid
of machines so I hope the machine
doesn't take over my doll because no I
love it sounds like a very interesting
topic
and I hope the folks who are present
will actually come and come and attend
it if not check it out through the
livestream so thank you so much thank
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
