computing Java fix in the cloud with
open dolphin I have just been to the as
it is tradition with every Java one to
the Java desktop developers lunch so for
that and I would say that Java desktop
is more vibrant than ever
that was our observation in the lunch
more people and more excitement in even
more than ever before despite that we
also have to face the deployment issue
of course with Java fix and in the cloud
story is kind of missing right this is
what we're going to talk about today the
cloud story for desktop how can a
desktop run in the cloud how can the
cloud run on my desktop with the help of
open dolphin we have a quality group
today which I very much like and peer
excited and also already a fan group of
dolphins I see thanks for coming good if
you have any questions along the talk we
have all the opportunities of directly
addressing them just bless your voice in
we'll talk about it
like I know that at least one has
already seen the video have the other
one seen the video already there what
okay so let me see this is kind of the
the most difficult thing that you can do
in a desktop a 3d application well let's
see where it is and that is actually um
my desktop
dolphin resources in nervous video this
is an application that we have shown in
the strategy came out two years ago and
developed together with Oracle and/or
business partner nevus the world market
leader for Container Terminal software
it starts with the 2d view there's a you
see the 2d button total button being
pressed and it shows in container yard
from above and consolidated for view
first and then a picture also recovered
by the point of destination where the
various containers should go this is how
an operator usually starts his work but
then you can choose with the very same
logic and the logic resides on the
server side hope start a 3d view of the
very same information giving you new
insights about what you can do and what
you should obey as business rules like
what you can stack on top of each other
and what you shouldn't this is very
critical in that domain and there's even
more exciting I think a capabilities of
JavaFX 3d you can have animations in it
for example back there is the truck you
can I see the trick so back here trucks
moving and rapid tubes gantries moving
the the containers around which follow a
path animation that's if you'd look in
the code it is absolutely simple to do
we have a path animation just like Java
fix 2d and apply it to and 3d up through
a 3d object also the 3d objects are not
so difficult to do with the bits boxes
mainly within some image this is wrapped
around it
which make it look like real containers
with all the foldings and the droppings
and so on on top of it so this is can
kind of the the most difficult thing for
a desktop application and not every
application needs it but you would be
surprised how many actually do not only
do we have this in logistics part but
also we have four factory floors where
you have lots of machines in the factory
and you have to keep track of what
happens in which machine where these
what the sensors are doing it's wrong so
this is now the important statement
about this is that this is an enterprise
application and enterprise means it runs
on the server this application runs on
the server well hmm what what is what
does it mean I mean but obviously it is
displayed on the client and with JavaFX
3d but all the business logic all the
interactions when I click on it contain
and what then is to be done whether i
zoom in zoom out what kind of detail I
see this is all controlled from the
server side the application logic is on
the server having direct access to all
the - sorry - or the the whole data
sources and services that you have on
the server side that was the main reason
that nevus has used this technology and
together with soap important to make
that possible integrating rich
visualization capabilities with the
option to run on the server and once you
have run it on the server your personal
tomcat whatever you have the option of
deploying it in the cloud you can just
deploy anywhere where you'd like to have
platform as a service and you can
provide the software as a service on
platform as a service in the cloud this
way that's the idea that's the whole
idea of the talk that's everything you
ever wanted to hear we're done
but I've caused their details in yeah
how could this possibly work so let's go
back to the dressing-table to the
presentation what we see from our
customers they would like to have cloud
deployment that it's Fisher pair they do
have different requirements for their
clients there is always desktop lines
for many many enterprise applications
and not only web of course you will also
like to tackle web if you're in cloud
computing but desktop is still there and
you wouldn't believe how many still
existing spring applications are out
there that each run on the desktop
increasingly we see need for Android and
iPad devices and equivalents I was very
happy to see this morning and community
keynote who was in the community keynote
only me ok you could see JavaFX running
on iOS and Android and this fits fits
perfectly well with the open dolphin
architecture because it means you you
only need to have a small piece of
visualization find your data to it and
have all your applications run on the
server side and even for embedded in for
IOT this has been a recent addition to
open dolphin that you can also control
devices directly even though they don't
have a user interface making an LED
blinking or reading a sensor is just as
reading a text field or setting a
checkbox so we have this whole
combinations of things in an enterprise
world that we would like to cater for
all these requirements but we need some
carrot the open often gives you in a
uniform way of addressing all the
various capabilities we'll start with a
simple demo and the general will run in
the cloud
so for that reason I I've put the in
preparation of this talk the open
dolphin github project so it's all open
it's Apache 2 license it's all in github
and there's a server component in it for
the testing for the demos and I've put
the package the server component in the
wall file it's only one one line of code
is of doing it on the command line and
then I've loaded it up to the OpenShift
cloning service this is from Red Hat and
that was the only one that would give me
30 days of free access and I needed a
few days before the before job one so
the they get some extra airtime here
which is pretty good because they offer
such a nice service so that is open
shift from Red Hat where I deployed it
now we can go to let me see where's my
browser so this is actually the not
particularly nice homepage of that but
if we just remove away the very special
application from the line connects and
you open a little bit bit closer here
you see that's the URL open dolphin -
canoe our edge cloud that is for Red Hat
com that's where it's hosted you can
then see what's in there
sorry oops and then there is somewhere
that's managing thing where you can go
to your application learn more about
where my applications are and then you
can go from there but lead you through
the process and in fact what they do is
they give you a git repository that you
have on your machine with a web apps
directory front like from Tomcat and you
just put your web application in the web
apps directory and push it took it
done I mean that's pretty cool this is
really a nice service because nothing
more is what you have to do beside
waiting for half a minute maybe that
everything is restarted again and then
you came over to okay have to go back
like so and that is stuff like like this
okay this is open dolphin - canoe or
edge cloud if you'd like to play with me
along the right that would be the
address where it could start now we'll
stop the demo and the demo will use
sorry let's not the team started it will
use the starter utility the start this
is all code that comes directly with
open water film it's part of the open
dolphin project and here you see that
when we start we first asked whether
there is a system property of a certain
remote what you'd like to go to a
different URL and if not we are using
this one so if we exact one that I just
showed you there's a dolphin servlet
deployed that does all the work that's
dispatching that we will see so going
back a little and now we're gonna start
the start grants client push demo
control chef FTM so it starts a local
view of the server side deployed
application all the logic is in the
application and here it is now we go a
little higher so you can see it
but this one's doing is keeping track of
you can see this as vehicles it's like a
very down strip version of the
containers right just stuff moving
around but it has a number of properties
so there's it has a color it has an XY
position and an angle which it points to
now if I click in the map in one of the
master views we see the detail view
being filled and the detail view also
being immediately updated whenever the
respective value changes that's I do a
few interactions and you have to
consider that this is a cloud service we
are reaching out from here to somewhere
on the planet I have no idea where
redhead servers actually reside I guess
it's us east coast if I'm not mistaken
so this beauty of who you would expect
quite some delay right hmm ok let's
switch to blue death switch to green
let's switch to orange and let's use the
arrow keys for switching because that's
quicker
up up up down down up up down down up up
sorry miss clicked up yep so fake it's
so quick that looks like a fake it is so
quick it's so awesomely quick that you
think it's affect no it's not it's
the the speed of this solution does not
come from technology it's not like depth
sockets or speedy or HDL 200 or hazel
caste or something
this one comes from architecture by the
way you can also click on the on the
second master view which is this nephew
here when I click on blue one it gets
the indication that it is now selected
it is selected in the map in the
detailed view but also in the other
master view if I click on the orange one
the orange one is displayed here
whatever is available and changed over
here is also immediately changed over
here can even change the values now we
go into edit mode when they change the Y
position of whatever let's say vehicle
we have it will float up to the very top
accidentally it will be rewritten with
server-side information for the new
position that the server knows about
that you'll most likely see it going up
to the top well this is how the
application works that's not a
restriction from open bottom so let's
say Z 0 is 0 so it floats up out of the
pots blue one was incorrect
floats up no seven dip 0 clear
and then it's Philip wait until it's
gone back beyond mm-hmm
takes a while until the this is now we
are cooking we are coming to the to the
point that we really have to wait for
the server Rancher because that's not
available locally what is available
locally where we already know what the
server will do it's applied immediately
and unless the server rejects the job so
ever may later rejected change and put
it back this is the asynchronicity of
the system so you enjoy quick updates if
you decide to use it this way but at the
very same time you get the full safety
that you have for server side
application freshness so far now as an
as a side effect this master view of the
table and this master view of the map
view kind of and the detail view they
don't know each other no you will knows
any other view it is not so that
clicking in this view issues in
selection change event and this election
change event would go to this to the
detail view and update it this is not
the case I can add I can remove I can
change any of any detail view whatsoever
without touching the other views or
without touching the controllers right
the local controllers this is an
important architectural property
characteristic of open warfare because
this is the prerequisite for having
incremental developments that you can
add or remove or change and you view at
any time without possibly affecting the
existing ones that's correct that was
the initial example and I try to explain
a little about the architecture that
makes this possible I just closed my
view and looks as if nothing else is
happening anymore and it isn't
so let's see then architecture has two
things structure and concepts the
structure is when you hear a talk about
architecture it's in many cases only
about structure as the structure is
really the less important part of an
architecture concepts are more important
so here's the structure and it is very
simple there is a Model View controller
pattern in place whereas the view is
responsible for displaying whatever is
in the model the model in this case is a
presentation model it captures
information not from a domain but from
visualization it has things like there's
a text field what's the value in the
text field is the text field enabled is
visible what kind of label does it have
is it dirty because it changed the value
from the its original value or kind of
meta information of that kind that's
what the modelers here and then there's
controller where your application logic
is and those two are totally separated
they even compile on different class
passes they do not see each other at
compile time so you cannot accidentially
refer from one to the other it's not
possible the only way of communication
is through the presentation model which
opens often cares for distributing
between client and server
the response the responsibility of the
controller is to manage what is to be
displayed in a container yard example
the controller says how many but what
what's my elevation level that I see
when I look from to the onto the arch
right how high is my viewpoint that that
says how many of the containers are
actually to be displayed and if there's
panning and zooming going on it's all
handled by the controller heat this is
it is his application of doing this and
of course what kind of sort of boxes are
to be displayed this is then in the
model the the view is pretty
unintelligent he only reacts is up very
it's likely it's reactive programming
to the most possible extent it only
reacts to changes in the model and
displace them as pretty as you can but
that's how to display is individual
that's his responsibility in since the
these two are separated by separated to
the such as very low dependency budget
whatsoever no cord dependency whatsoever
you can have them under compile on
different class passes they have no
dependency you can even distribute them
on different machines so the view can
live on the client machine and
controller can live on the server
machine that's the architectural
underpinning of the whole approach
then you get this kind of independent
views and this this is an example that
gives you some kind of portfolio
management thing Ashley vanity we did
with the UBS in Switzerland by the way
my name is dirk runic at work for
canoeing puzzles with slender guess
forgot to say that so we're working with
financial institutions and they are
managing portfolios might be you've
picked one portfolio you add and remove
new positions in here and all these
views the chart view doesn't know
anything about the table view but even
the plus and minus buttons do not know
about the table the plus button is only
giving to the server the plus button has
been clicked from those services oh I
have new presentation model for a new
position in here I created done then the
view says oh there's a new presentation
wall I better display it in my table
that's how it works concept is no view
knows any other view this rule of this
concept has a slight exception if you
want if you're very picky you could say
at construction time when we have the
JavaFX scene graph the scene graph
itself contains all the various views so
they kind of know each other
indirectly over the scene graph okay but
we make no use of that concept no
controller knows any of you this rule
has no exception it cannot possibly have
an exception because in controller code
you have no access to the view it's not
even on the class path you cannot
accidentally say when the seller sub
button is clicked when submit button is
clicked I update the status bar you
cannot you know there's you don't even
know whether there is the status bar or
whether that is the swing or JavaFX or
javascript status bar you have no clue
or whether there's how the status is
displayed whether it isn't a bar or not
this is not the business of the control
of controllers has
when there's an the statusbar
presentation model I put a new value in
the status bar presentation model and
client is responsible for displaying it
in the most beautiful way yeah please
always say the view is the view is
pretty and beautiful but unintelligent
in there from view quality body view is
the same for that anyway so if the views
do not know the controller and
controller doesn't know the views how it
is in view when let's say button if when
it's clicked how does saying which
controller to use and so they can kind
of ping the controller they can say I'd
like to have the plus action being
executed right now that's like a ping
and it has no parameters you cannot give
any parameters to it everything they the
presentation models are a shared
knowledge between client and server and
everything that the server needs to know
to fulfill its duty must be in the
presentation model and everything that
the view must know to fulfill his duty
of displaying things must be in the
presentation model view now now that we
have this distinction we can make sure
we guarantee that views are never
touched outside the UI thread so that
every update is in the u.s. Ratman will
therefore work correctly controller on
the other hand best if they cannot
possibly have access to the UI thread
they live on a different machine a so
they always work outside the US read
like every controller should do because
if you have controllers in Europe let's
swing more Java fix application in the
book inside the UI thread you make yet
not one exception in there for some
reason or any other kind of exception
will have a long-running operation and
at that time your UI thread is blocked
and you cannot do anything anymore you
cannot even display a progress or an
error indicator
when it fails react somehow is you toast
right there for controllers must always
work outside the US bed and this is
guaranteed
even if open door from client and server
run in the same virtual machine what we
can do when for testing and debugging
and running test cases in in development
there's a special mode in in memory mode
where both running the same VM that's
the concern then the communication
between client and server communication
between view and controller is through a
limited set of commands you cannot
extend well that's a set that we provide
create a presentation model the heat of
presentation model will change the value
change the base value of this like 15
and there's one called named control
named command we can say now please the
plus operation I'd like to be executed
that's all this and the command pattern
is a prerequisite for undo redo if you
have a comment that and every change
near system is a value change then you
can roll back the system and all the
visualizations they're only changing
values back to the original bug
and to see what that means
here's a small simulation of imaginary
login screen in the system so the idea
is that what you see between view and
controller that's your the sea level and
everything below in the water is time to
belt off and then everything above is
handled by your application and it's
it's login right so a login must have
some nugget logic once you have the name
and the password how to figure out
whether the login is okay or not that's
some service on your database or
whatever right that's sort of site logic
so this logic needs to be registered on
the server side just like it's struts
actions or whatever action framework you
have for a server there's a special
registering component in orphaned that
does it so this logic is some aside
logic you put it on the server side and
since it is application specific it sits
on top that is well shortly see how it
looks like and then you create a
presentation model and after creating it
it will be automatically synchronized
between client and server and be
available in both places this one has a
given name we know the name by heart so
to speak it's called current user we
identified this over it's ID it has
three attributes name password and
whether this person is currently logged
in or not which is the boolean value
then client displace client creates of
you and binds it to the presentation
model all open dolphin clients do the
very same thing and only this create if
you do the binding create view to the
binding creative you do the binding it's
it's absolutely identical no no matter
what client you look at whether you have
JavaFX view then the Java ethics you're
being instructed
you do the binding in the JavaFX way if
you have a swing view then you have a
swing view created and bind like swing
is doing it with property changelessness
if you have a javascript view also we
have an HTML view you have the HTML on
top and JavaScript that does binding and
then hands off it even the code looks
almost identical and even the job
effects and swing and JavaScript code
looks almost identical it's very easy to
understand you'll see that music so
here's the view being constructed let's
say that job affects two text fields at
button inside let's say dialog if you're
using controls effects there's a dialog
otherwise job FX has no dialogues and
the dialogue has a visibility property
you set this to true and it appears good
now you do the binding the text field of
the view is be directionally bound to
the name attribute of the presentational
model
the password is bound be directional to
the password and the visibility property
of that dialog is bound against the
boolean value of the locked in as soon
as we say the user's not locked in this
one will appear there's a convert
average because we have to disable do
this the other way around bit okay
that's automatic no method changes it
whether client-side there should be no
client-side logic but if there was in
somebody changes this property it would
immediately show this dialog and block
the other ones right
therefore if on the server side for any
other reason later in the program the
the controlling logic decides that the
current user should now be locked no
longer locked in right it would just set
the locked in property to false and
immediately appears this dialog without
you doing anything it's a reactive right
it reacts
it's cool so now what happens when the
user tries to enter his first name
so his name this because of the binding
it is immediately mirrored in the in the
respective attribute value and behind
the scenes asynchronously without the
user noticing this information will be
sent to the server and updated on the
server-side
before the user even touches the next
text field this information is already
on the server the servers and full
knowledge what happens on the client
site and I I guess you know already this
is actually what Facebook is doing with
you right you create a Facebook posting
and you decide not to send it but
Facebook knows anything because this
information is already on the server
site and it makes use of that
information so you better compose your
messages in an text editor if you're not
quite sure whether you should really
call your boss that name okay good so
here you go
same for password so you enter password
password be transferred it will be
automatically on the client site before
the user even has an opportunity of
touching the login button it's already
on the server side all these sequence of
things are guaranteed by opened all from
the sequence of actions as they appear
on the C level let's say a guaranteed to
be sustained over the whole range of
events that happens that happen now user
clicks log in log and goes over to the
server and they'll be dispatched to the
log in action how the dispatch happens
is part of our dolphin now the action
starts the action will of course read
from the server side model store the
information will do its logic now maybe
do a database update database query or
whatever and sets blocked in value let's
say it was okay sets it to true now the
very same happens to the other way
around setting it to true
immediately be mirrored on the
client-side and since this is now true
this binding fires in this end this
disappears and you can make more use of
this information like in the upper right
corner you can say our carrying users
this one right this is it question so
far and all the a synchronicity is at
the heart of the perceived performance
that the user gets and also at the heart
of the very efficient resource usage
that Oakland Dolphin is doing you have
to think about it like this in
traditional HTML application we would
while the user is filling out these
fields what happens on the channel
nothing silence on the channel now when
he clicks all the information has to be
assembled in once in sent over the wire
and then things have man come back this
is the worst possible time to send a lot
of information when the users waiting we
make use of the resource of channel
resource in a much more intelligent way
by sending information when the user is
busy otherwise right and at the very end
when the log in action should happen the
only thing that we sent to the server is
a is the ping right it is technically
it's not a ping but it is still tcp/ip
packet but it is the smallest possible
amount of information that you can ping
the server with and it's the fastest
information that goes over the wire
nothing is faster than a single packet
you're the first one in every route
repeater a firewall proxy whatever the
first one to be dispatched for for
further display for further routing
the whole API by which we control the
user interface is very simple it is all
value driven everything is available
change the appearance of yep seen it the
appearance of a dialogue is not a piece
of code that makes the dialogue appear
it is the value change that it should
appear so the whole API on the server
side for controlling is reading a value
writing about you and listen for value
changes right
I don't move client-side that's mostly
listening for value changes that's all
this couldn't be any simpler I would say
there's a few more other operations that
you can do but this is the the guts of
it how do you create a presentation
model where on the client side you have
a facade object that is called the
client orphan and it has a factory
method for a presentational model and
you give it the current user which isn't
string that which is either string
latest world or as is a constant there
is a constant string you can give it you
can absolutely give it a type and you
can have attributes and bind against the
attributes later form a interspersion
cocktail how do you bind in the client
side how do you make that how do you
would how would you bind the attribute
of a presentation model against in text
field while we have this small versus if
static method in the JavaFX binder for
example this bind method where you can
say well we'd like to bind the name of
the user to the text of the new to the
text property of the name text field
that's it you typically have quite many
such statements in your code because
little lots of user interface components
that need binding input this kind of
fluent interface that especially when it
comes of one line only mmm is makes it
very good over you you have them all one
after the other and there's no kind of
nesting involved so they all line up
like in a table and say oh this one they
are this one they have this mix makes
for very nice code
and how do you assemble la conexiÃ³n I
say climb too often send locket that's
it
and particularly is important here there
are no parameters you don't you cannot
possibly send any parameters because the
API doesn't allow it and whenever
there's the new open dolphin user I can
tell that in the first week of he him
using it in anger he will ask for
parameters for commands right this is
always the case when I see this ah
you're a first week user yes okay so
here it house works you sorry you forgot
to model something that is important in
the presentation model right uh yeah I
can't see it
that's happens every time so I'm quite
busy giving the same answer in good how
do you read from the store so there's a
certain like this client client or from
they also have a dolphin and your
there's a method find presentation
loaded by ID if you like long names I
prefer the short names say get at the
current user now I have a server
presentation model object in my hand I
can ask that one for the name attribute
and get the value the name attribute has
many different interesting
characteristics you can ask about your
dirty may I bite myself to you for
listening for changes and so on that's
rather rich API that you can also just
deal with about you how to change the
value of all you have to you have the
server presentation model user you get
to the locked in property and you set
the value that's it that's all you do
that's the whole application is getting
a value setting a value and then
otherwise do your logic what you want
this I'm originally from Germany and
there's a German saying is like baking
the Gretel's ranked when you have this
you know pretzels like JW Bush swallowed
and couldn't really swallow with those
months and bacon to Brazil it's guilt
like you make this long string and then
you do it like this motion and then the
next one show that taking the pretzels
is like choosing open dolphin you're
setting value getting value tax don't
buy an exact yeah that's what the
clients like so we said we we have seen
it with one user but now that we know
that we are running in the cloud we can
really use make use of the cloud so all
the application logic on the server so
people are sort of the user can share we
will try this immediately with with our
Red Hat open safe installation for some
fingers yeah yeah I guess it will work
so here is an application that up again
and Anna makes it bigger that you
believe me this goes now to open door
from cloud we're going to the cloud know
we have no knowledge whatsoever where
that resides and what kind of
characteristics this has and yep starlet
so it comes up with the user interface
that was pretty quick there is not a lot
of information that that this server
should send back actually there's no
information as I can tell and if there's
no motion whatsoever between the red
lines back here there is no no traffic
on the channel we don't have any traffic
at the moment right no traffic now this
is a small application for managing team
members let's say we'd like to assemble
a new team for a project development
effort and say plus please give me a new
a new member and this one is Derek and
kernig and he's gonna be architect okay
that's nice this is my mentor which I
learned everything from and I will be
available I'm not a contractor but I
have a workload at for it most like okay
let's say so much like 3/4 did you
recognize what happens over here and
when it changed the slider so that I
should pick it up correctly so and back
again and down in back again you also
see it visualize the dirtiness of the
attributes these attributes are dirty is
that visible from our that peanut like
yellowish the background here is not
normal background that's a slight thing
to it and transparent that it is it's
showing you the dirtiness if I and since
we're dirty since the presentation water
here is dirty I have the save action
available if I click on the save action
it's no longer dirty well everything is
now cleaned again but it's but since
it's no longer dirty I cannot do any
action but it makes no sense saving
something that hasn't changed
same for resetting whereas deleting
still mixing mixed
since hmm I see it in your eyes that you
don't believe me that this is really
running on the server I mean it looks so
as running on the client okay here you
go
we will go to you believe me that this
is the browser and we will go to the
team members master detail view and book
okay
it shows our information here hmm
rearrange this just slightly such that
you can better see that things happen
automatically in both places so when it
come here the point is I will know two
changes here that by the way the
selection that we have the first one
selected is not reflected on this one
because the second user may use a
different selection right but you will
you will work on the same data on
suicide so I create I create a new one
what you think should happen it should
appear here it's not yet saved it's not
yet saved right it will appear here but
it will also appear over here of the
selection will not change okay so make
sense okay plus
now this is a web application this is a
desktop application hmm got updated
immediately now let's say I make a
change over here Robert right Bob
okay I'll say let me make it so Robert
right you see you drop up being typed
over here while I type here this front
in the cloud right can you confirm my
goosebumps with it with that speed and
this is not WebSockets this is HTTP push
okay now why do we care because we would
like to work collaboratively so the
client side user sees this and says you
know what I select this and I said here
robot was false right this is really Bob
hmm
over here this is web and desktop
working on the same model at the same
time on the server Keep Calm it's not
it's not good for your health to get to
get over the excited in the afternoon so
that we can really drive this to to
quite some extent plus plus plus plus
maybe select this one here now the last
one maybe the last one as well over here
that we can see that I mean but you know
maybe should work on the first one
because that's better visible good and
here by the again by the yellowish color
you'll see that it's dirty
visually you get a visualization between
all the users that somebody else is
currently working in this area and you
may want to help or you may want to just
step off most people are good people and
they don't want to
on somebody else's foot but we may need
to know that somebody is working on that
area for not going into blood conflicts
right you can actually avoid vertical
merge conflict this way so let's say
this is should really I get promoted
right I'm no longer checked I'm now CEO
click look this is my boy okay yep in
the upload oh my boy is not so good in
workload so pass it back you see this
slider over here have you seen that
slider moving while move the slider be
hmm not too severe I would say good and
then once you have this you can also
cater for other totally other use cases
you can start in your desktop
application without without saving right
but then you have to leave you have to
go for a meeting and then afterwards
you're sitting in the meeting get bored
you put your your iPad and then on the
on the very same state you proceed
working right you still have it and then
then you use it on the web on somebody
else's machine and then from home
against the desktop it follows you
wherever you go this is a new notion
epic posit continuity and Microsoft
wanted convergence itself heavy names
and it's available to the enterprise
programmer right this is for enterprise
applications and not only for special
consumer applications that needs Apple
or Google power to make that happen it I
could do it so anybody could do it I
would say
works pair perfectly with a cloud neat
new instances they fire up you know like
that and especially I liked the smiling
faces in the crowd that's I really like
that so I proceed a little going through
it instant updates notifications that's
impossible of sort that is important for
a while to use the applications you need
to have some kind of awareness who's
around and then you can work together
with your customers with experts with
your peers with back-office
it's like I would usually start with
writing Bob and then the back office
employee my teammate would say well you
know you should better be a little bit
formal yeah Robert okay as if there was
some intelligence in the tech in the
technology where it really is in the
people you should enable the the
intelligence of the people and of the
other way around together with your
customer doing doing doing that kind of
stuff so how does it work this has been
our initial picture and this is and one
or two save the same now when there's a
second user coming this kind of doubles
okay second one and how do they
communicate on the server side they
share their relevant information over
the event bus that's normal event bus
that we use there that's it nothing else
one both have been subscribed to the
event bus hmm and you can inject those
if you want to then comes all the Java
EE stuff and but it's very small and
lightweight and you'll and on the server
side you just listen for changes on the
event bus when they happen was next
server around front they will be picked
up and sent to the client it's all all
the value changes they're gonna be how
they just merge together nicely
so and then not only for Java desktop
technology but in in the wild so when
you go to the web here in the wild that
this is free Billy for open hearth in
free Italy so to speak
yep and then since we all since we no
longer know not only have Java clients
but also JavaScript there's many
different UI technologies that you can
have in the very same way actually we
intend to have an extension into ios and
android natively there was how that
works in typically when you address
multiple channels like so-eun and use
the technology that that's that
especially when it has source code
generation then you have the least
common denominator between all your
channels available no this is bad you
would like to have the full channel
fidelity right whatever the channel is
able to do if there's a few minutes left
in the end I'll show you what that means
follow me apps you start in one place
you complete in the other place how is
that working well this very same picture
only that the various views are now
using a different technology that's it
desktop or mobile the blue stuff stays
identical everything that blue is
exactly like before and by foot by the
way I forgot the two controllers are
exactly the same that two instances of
the same class
two instances of the sampler not only
are they equivalent they are exactly the
same so and then mobile web the question
is what kind of framework would you like
to use with your HTML uh-huh and there
is the popular framework of the year and
next year you have to change right you
better prepare for change and here you
have a combination which also means you
can more easily change because the only
thing changes the view and that's it now
you can since recently even run it on
very small devices we have it running at
canoe for on a Raspberry Pi this is at
canoe this is our our meeting room floor
and here is the corporate calendar
showing all the meeting rooms and how
they are occupied and these it runs open
boyfriend on the Raspberry Pi and that
connects to the server which is reading
the corporate calendar that's it need to
need a free space in the meeting room
you go by and say well this one's this
is going to be free for the next half an
hour and kind of sit there we introduce
this is from Todd Castella this is
temperature readings in Calgary for his
chicken farm you wouldn't want to have
them frozen right okay
this is a very small one that I've used
recently this is a microcontroller you
cannot even run java but can run
JavaScript and I installed the open
doors and JavaScript client on it and
this this javascript line in this java
ethics client they work together over
the server and i can't control this
microcontroller and vice versa by
clicking on these circles and the LEDs
will light up and so on very simple
actually
I've shown the in the Duke or my stop or
my pupil shoot in 2912 room for I've
shown in a way of controlling these
rocket launches but is for the tehsil
and then my snip it will fire the
Rockets and before that you have with
your using your iPhone for
putting it to the left or to the right
so we would be aiming to the other side
of the room that was it pretty cool
people liked it yeah how is that working
so we started here and now we have much
more right
there's desktops running Java there's
more vile running Java s Java Script
this raspberry small device running Java
and then to something a tehsil that runs
JavaScript but is a device only from the
point of the Java developer on the
right-hand side it makes absolutely no
difference they he cannot even tell what
kind of client that is he just says a
blue LED true and whether that means
that a circle becomes visible in Java
ethics or an LED on a microcontroller
goes on he doesn't even know one
programming model to care about the more
it goes even a little bit further so
that was where the open plotting client
could be deployed but even if the open
bottom client cannot be employed
we have alien devices that we have not
under control but what they can do what
the intent the minimum of the Internet
of Things is things and Internet so what
what is the thing that can possibly be
called part of the Internet of Things it
can do that say a get request to a
server or any other protocol it can
reach a server I'll call it like so and
if it can't do so then when it reaches
us on the server we just put the
information on the eventbus
period and everybody else can use it
it's one channel it's read-only anyway
right you at least get the information
that's very solid application
architecture I would say that's it it's
all decoupled
yeah there's you can be doing 3d stuff
with our customers we're doing generic
undos which I taught about that before
yep I'm not going to go to this one-week
Mary deep data analysis because we can
filter on the server side it can be very
efficient in deep data analysis and if
you have to convince your management
here's what it is it is an architecture
it's also a library it has an
implementation that in the first place
it is an architecture
how did four views and controllers
communicate asynchronously and
optionally reroute their who's the use
of presentation modes well I want to use
it save money outperform competition you
can't do something that others just at
the moment cannot do at reasonable costs
yes and when you have your code on the
server side and can reuse it for so many
different devices and can in less over
time even when the UI technology changes
then you have a bigger part of your
effort being an investment and small
about being costs that's where the money
aspect comes in yeah UI channels
technologies come and go application
logic lives on if you have an a project
that will live for one year you better
to bet on the technology and then go
with it you know natively if it should
last a little longer I would invest in
hedging my bets yep with this you can
lead the pack that's very good lazy
loading support the rotational load any
biases migration and so on if you have
to go from swing to job ethics that's
also much easier with the kind of
approach left a swing try this Java fix
if I have to say that ok and when to use
it when you think clean is better for a
very long time ahead on the slide saying
well
low coupling and then in a recent
training one of the participants said
well you should say no coupling because
there really is no coupling it just
wasn't so brave
so there's leave it there's still a
little bit of semantics illogical
cupping coupling between your client and
your server because you have some
assumptions on what you're doing right
so I'd say no traditional syntactical
couple it's very easy to test you can
now the the testing of your logic it's
fully independent on how this visualized
when the green light goes on the blue
light must go off this is a piece of
logic that you can test unit test
without the UI even being available well
the futures open if you think futures
open then it's a good way to go there's
gonna be we will propose the jsr for
this architecture I have some very I had
some very good conversations on gel one
they it seems to fall on fertile soil if
you'd like to follow this if we'd like
to support it if you like to say yes I
I'm all for having a jsr on this please
follow up and I'll keep everybody
updated on this channel here are the
coordinates this is me on top and then
there's open ball from the github
repository the user guide and so on it's
available from Athens central can you
just plug it in with maven of Gradle or
whatever have you and we add canoe we do
lots of absorptive open-source
development we give away software for
free we give away knowledge for free
within publications and speaking
conferences and so on there's a small
commercial branch as well we do
consulting engineering training and with
the goal to enable you to sign with your
applications in fact the best
application is possible
thank you so much and have safe travels
