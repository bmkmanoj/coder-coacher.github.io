Washington DC I'm Bob rue Bart with the
Oracle technology Network and my guest
for this session this segment I should
say is Michael hitch one Michael so the
folks at home what you do and who you do
it for sure I work for Oracle my home
city is Washington DC so I'm happy to be
here at Oracle code in DC and I look
after database tools for our database
organization let's talk a bit about low
code environments what is the value to
high code developers sure low code
environment right so a lot of our
customers in Oracle the enterprise space
we have a lot of high code customers
that develop in JavaScript that develop
in Java they develop in all these
languages there they are expert
developers they are the best in the
world the best in the industry so why
would these people want to use a tool
that's a little bit lighter or low code
environment and there's a lot of good
reasons so let's say for example you're
building a mission critical application
to look after your sales or finance or
things like that
you might want to build a number of
auxilary applications that kind of
complement it so for example you might
need to track your bugs or track the
release schedules or track your
customers or track all these things and
so what LO code offers is an ability to
have pre-configured components and
features so for example if you're
building an application is a very
specific use case you might want to
optimize every pixel on the screen but
if you're building a system that's
tracking things for example you might
want to have a reporting solution that
allows you to slice and dice your data
maybe you want have a charting solution
that allows you to see it
but you don't need to develop these
individual components repetitively again
and again so you can use these shared
components so a lot of low code
solutions just build on top of the of
the components so for example Oracle
offers a Java Script jet library which
combines some of the best open source
available and wrappers it all up in a
fully tested configured way that you can
get greater productivity and so
for example on top of that then you
could have applications that leverage
those jet components and that JavaScript
and provide a sort of as out of box
experience to give you allows you to
build an application in a few minutes or
hours that might take a lot longer now
maybe these are opportunistic
applications maybe that years are not
your marquee applications the company
but but most applications for every
marquee application still have 30 you
know back office applications your
session today was on rapid application
development for the cloud generation yes
compress that down into a capsule
description of what you talked about
sure so I talked about first the cloud
and web browser and web centric are all
kind of synonymous so everything I will
do will be through a web integrated
development environment I can do that on
the Oracle cloud I could do that
on-premise it doesn't matter but the
Oracle cloud is certainly more
convenient because everything comes
pre-installed I can do it for free I can
do it for cost
I go to a text Oracle calm and do the
the demo so but in terms of compressing
what we actually do is we'll create a
data model that should take about two or
three minutes generate some random data
then we're going to build an application
on that that has a number of feature
functions for example we'll show master
detail reporting will show the ability
to create a report and filter it and
send email alerts on certain data maybe
you want to know when sales come through
or some anomalies in your data and then
we'll show a number of the features that
we can't come in a lo code environment
like access control and the ability to
monitor the usage of the application
what sort of questions did you get
during your session
well my session is until 5:00 but I've
given it before and I get a number of
questions so a lot of people with low
codes but they don't want to be the only
placed in the box
so what low code has the benefit of
doing is leveraging pre-developed
pre-tested free optimized components but
what if you don't like the component
what if you need something different
what if you want your map to be
different or what have you and so
note what the low code environment which
is very hot in the industry today it's
evolving into allowing you to extend it
so it comes in this whole spectrum from
no code like just a little check a box
saying yes I would like access control
to low code like I just provide like if
this then that to full control full
JavaScript full ability to leverage the
lower-level
work will jet components or angular
jQuery or those sort of things so it
basically a lot of questions I get the
disability to not be confined allow
developers who have the skills to take
the most of you know build do whatever
they'd like to do what single point do
you want the audience to take away from
your session today if they remember only
one thing from your presentation what
should that be so if they remember only
one thing I'd like them to know that
that there's a whole world of low code
out there that can make you more
productive by leveraging work that other
people have done to lay a foundation you
wouldn't for example every time you want
to newest build a new system rewrite
your own operating system likewise
there's a number of web applications
that you would want to build that you
don't need to rewrite every component
within it to deliver it so that's I want
people to know that's a locota
area out there and they should look into
it it's hot in the industry and and they
should look into it for all their next
projects it doesn't have to be the only
thing you use it's just something that
can help you out there are some 16
Oracle code events left as scheduled
will there be sessions in any of those
events covering the same subject matter
yes I believe every every Oracle code
event will have a low code session
application Express or application
builder cloud service and others and so
it's a it's a it's a hot section it's
it's not maybe the first thing that your
your JavaScript and Java developers want
to see but I think that anyone involved
in those projects can leverage this
technology and they need to learn how to
do it alright if you'd like to see any
of those sessions at any of the 16
upcoming order
event visit developer Oracle complex
code you'll find a complete scheduled
listing of all the upcoming events as
well as information on how you can
submit a proposal representation of your
own for the Oracle technology Network
I'm Babu Bart thanks for watching and
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
