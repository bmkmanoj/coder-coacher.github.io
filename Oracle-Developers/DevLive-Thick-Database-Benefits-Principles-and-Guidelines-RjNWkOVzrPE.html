technology Network and we are here at
Oracle code New York where a whole bunch
of people are hungry for lunch right now
so they're waiting to line up for the
food but in the meantime I'm talking to
Peter Cole etske one of the presenters
at today's event so Peter tell me about
your session
well I'm talking about this technique
that's called SiC database and it's not
one of these new modern things the
conference's a lot about what's up and
coming and all the Micra services and
things like that this is a technique
that's been around for a long time and
it really applies to any kind of
development work that you're doing it
doesn't matter really which language
you're using and which tools you're
using it doesn't matter if you're doing
cloud or not cloud it really has to do
more with how you leverage the Oracle on
how are the Oracle database programming
language pill sequel to simplify what
you're doing in the user interface so
that was the main main topic and I had
techniques about how to do this with
database views and PL sequel packages
that you can use if you're if you've got
an Oracle database other databases you
would you would have to kind of modify
the approach a bit but it's still
applicable to other databases you had
mentioned just before we started this
that you got caught in the hallway with
a couple of questions those questions
well one question was about the the
actual path that the execution takes
when you use this technique and I was
describing it for using the full thing
that I that I talked about in the
session was you have a user interface
that is connected to a database view the
database view is arbitrarily complex it
could be many tables that could use sub
queries and joins unions aggregate
functions analytic functions leads Inlet
leg and that view presents a simple data
view to the user interface so the user
interacts with that and there's a single
message that goes from that a select
statement or insert update to the
database
of having multiple statements goes
through different tables that are
represented in the user interface at
that point the database takes it and
runs it through what we call an instead
of trigger which is a view level trigger
and that calls the procedure
sounds like a Rube Goldberg kind of
thing but it makes the whole thing more
efficient because you're centralizing
the code that's doing the work instead
of having it in the user interface
you're having in the database which is
why we call it sick database most of the
processing is happening there and with
the Oracle database we use PL sequel
which is in the database so it's close
to the tables and you can do sequel very
easily without messaging in and out you
know from other servers it's all in one
place
so those hallway questions
notwithstanding what's the one thing
that you hope people remember about your
session what I'm hoping the main thing
is data use database views with instead
of triggers now that's something that
can be used regardless of what you do on
the back end because it's a standard
sequel thing instead of triggers it may
be particular to Oracle but the pieces
that that trigger calls can be done in a
procedural language if it's not Oracle
but using the view itself is the main
thing so what's next for you any
speaking engagements in the near future
I've got one in June coming up at the
Oracle develop user group conference
which is in San Antonio this year ok and
two sessions they're different different
topics but that's the next one well
Peter thanks for taking time you're
welcome if you'd like to attend an
Oracle code event in person you'll find
a complete schedule of all the upcoming
17 events on developer Oracle comm /
code so check it out thanks for watching
and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
