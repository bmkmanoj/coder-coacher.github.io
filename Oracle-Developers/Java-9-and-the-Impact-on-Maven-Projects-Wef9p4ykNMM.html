name is Rob salt I'm the chair man of
the Apache maven project and I'm going
to talk about the work I've done for
supporting Java 940 but you may have
project this quotes the success of Java
9 depends on the adoption by IDs and
build tools like maven is well it's not
actually only for Java 9 but it would be
for every Java version but in this case
Java 9 comes with so much new features
that this is probably very very
important so when did it all start it
all started in 2004 13 with the first
releases of Java 9 and in 2015 they came
with the jigsaw early access releases
the jigsaw early access release is a zip
file and it's just a matter of unpacking
it and putting it on your system the
other one the other one G of 9 1 is is a
wizard and it will be the new default of
your system so for that reason I prefer
to use the jigsaw so we have challenge
and we say that we want to support Java
9 with maven 3 todo
right now we are made at maven 3.3 the
ninth and we only want to support the of
9 by upgrading the plugins so that's our
challenge
I'll be how can you test that well a
standard upgrade is use specify the Java
home and you point it to the JDK 9 you
verify the source and target is in this
case because Java 9 the minimum
supported version is for source and
target is 6 so if you have a Java 5
projects you will have to use a fork and
refer to a different jdk so this also
means that the runtime of maven doesn't
have to be exactly the same as the JDK
used by the maven compiler plugin one of
the most interesting things when doing
this for us was depth 260 it's about
encapsulating most in internal API so if
Nathan would run it would kind of proof
that we are not using any internal api's
so what happened so far the first Java
9e early access release that's the one
which started in 2014 we had close to no
issues there was one about system
properties in combination with null
values but that was restored quite fast
and nobody not a lot of projects had
issues with that however the first
jigsaw early access release about 99% of
the Java maven projects failed to
compile so in the beginning we I when I
noticed this I thought it was may have a
core issue but it wasn't it was actually
caused by the Java 2 provider in
combination with the system class loader
we are not using the Java executable to
compile code we are using the Java tool
provider so we can do it with Java
itself
so this was fixed and released within 72
hours and up until now we had to change
zero lines of code in Mayville core just
to run on Java 9
about 10% of the jobs are related to
maven and this is a list of the related
jobs the session is too short to handle
them all so this will be the agenda and
let's start with the utf8 property files
so especially for Europeans which are
familiar with special character sets you
can know that sometimes you get very
weird characters in the output and this
should solve that so let's see suppose
we have this kind of file in this case
this this e is translated by by eclipse
correctly but it all depends on the
editor you are using if that this is
still this kind of e the proper way to
do it is to escape it like this so in
this case we can run it like this and
above you see the result of Java 8 and
below Java line and this is ISO based
properties files so now let's do it with
utf-8
you see the this church for those who
are familiar with utf-8 and all kinds of
things
if this run and CODIS you will get
always something like this but you will
see that with JDK 9 it will not be
accepted no problem
next is about the new version string
scheme yesterday Allen bayman already
told that this has a huge impact on the
whole system all projects using it in
our case we are using several system
properties system properties so in the
middle you see the original version
schemes
and on the right you see deeper posts so
why is this an issue what we do is we do
a version and dot split and take the
second argument and in that case you
will get the index out of bound
index exception so in case you see
something like this there's probably
something wrong with the version so this
has already been solved in several
projects so then this issue is in maven
archiver
and fixed in 3.1 and almost every
packaging plug-in depends on it so the
major are three dots oh it's ready
released exactly the same for the maven
war plug-in and maven air plugin will be
released soon with including this fix
also the maven Java plug-in is already
fixed and maybe there are more but we
have to hit this issue yes
next jack is about compiled for all the
platform versions the issue here is that
in some cases it can lead leak classes
from the jdk the official requirements
to run a Java of Java C is with both
source target but also the boot class
path and I'm pretty sure that nobody
does it even we add it maybe we don't do
it because we have other solutions for
it but this is the official way to
ensure that your codes will be compiled
and will also run at runtime so let's
see the problem
so here we have a bit of coat
like this and we say it's Java 6 it
should be Java 6 cot it should run on
that what it's using laptop eclipse
already recognizes that this is an issue
but it comes with something interesting
it says comfort to anonymous class so
let's do that
I think I did it that's okay
projects
okay there we have the error again
it's used to work
okay I can do it it's not problem if I
just say in this case and for 40 example
it doesn't take here so in this case I
will save it but this stream method is
introduced in Java it's the same as for
each so even though we say that this
should be Java 6 code with with these
Java 8 methods it's not complaining so
here we go may have clean compile of
this class
it says bill success
if I am going to run this with Java 7
again Mavenlink by now it recognizes the
compilation failure by the way discolour
thinks this is a new feature in the next
version of maven so I'm using it here
for the demo so this is the real issue
we have several methods which are only
known in Java 8 and when you compile it
with Java 8 it's not recognized the
first mavis solution that's already
there is to use the maven toolchain
plugin with the with this plugin you can
specify the JDK switch are installed in
your system the tool chain XML can be
placed on two places one is equation is
in the bottom two folder and since May
3.3 that one it's also available in Econ
folder of the amazing distribution
the other solution is to use the animals
never maven plugin
it's called animals sniffer because of
the code name used for earlier versions
of Java so we have for instance tiger
mustang dolphin and based on that ID we
have had created the animal sniffer so
you have here a signature and that
contains all the classes and methods
used only for death and JRE and now with
a Java 9 there is a new solution there's
- release actually since the latest
jigsaw is - - release and that's exactly
the same as saying this source and -
target and that bootless path for em
you can figure can't configure it like
this just at the release deck with a
specific version but you can also use a
property may have not compile the
release and if you have both source and
target and release specified then
release will win so let's see so now I'm
going to compile with a tool change I
have edited in this case to profile as
you can see I'm running it with Java 8
the one which wasn't complaining about
this this compilation failure and here
you see the tool change picks up version
in this case Java 7 because that's the
one I've installed on my system you also
see that the medical pilot plug-in will
use this from tool chain and it's using
again Java 7 and we already saw it
before that when you compile this with
Java 7 it will have a compilation error
so now we're going to verify it with the
animal sniffer
maven plugin
again we have built failure in reason is
that the the completion succeeded and
afterwards the animals information
begins jack and it detects that this
java.util this dream is not known same
count 40 for each with consumer
and then we have the JDK 9 or Java 9
option where we can specify it as a
release so now we do May 15 for Phi and
we specified in this case with the
property may have a compiler release and
again it's comparing complaining about
the failure in the code so the solutions
which are already there available in
maven there's now probably a better
solution in Java 9 now let's see
something about forward compatibility
suggests we have something like this we
have a specific code and we want to do
some calculations and in case of Java 8
we can use the data API because it's
very strong and otherwise we can do it
based on this but it's more work to do
it so and we want to be able to run this
code with Java 7 there are two options
in this case so either you are going to
compile it with JDK 8 or you can compile
it with jdk 1.7 but use reflection to I
use the date/time API
for this there's the Nautilus jar files
a new jib to 3/8 and for those who were
yesterday with the session from Allen
Bateman there was already an example
about it and this is how such as Josh
structure could look like so we have a
jar root it has the claws a b c and d
and then you have a meta-inf with
directory versions and in this case 8
and 9 with specific implementations of
those classes of course java 8 is not
aware of a multi release jar so it's
only 40 X example to understand what
it's doing what it is doing so if we
would translate this back to source
files it would probably look something
like this
so we have the project root we have
source main Java with those Java files
for a b c and d and we have a source
main java 8 for a and b and a sort of
main and java 9 so this would be if you
have only one maven project one jar this
will work with maven without any without
any problems because of the execution
blocks you can specify but most IDs will
complain about it because they can only
use one version of java per made project
so we've been thinking about it and we
came with this solution a multi module
project it is ideally friendly and you
can already use it right now so we have
in the root we have a military space
with the ABC and d f-- versions of Java
for a motor race 8 same sort of in Java
as we are used for 9 as well and in the
end we have an assembly descriptor which
assembles all those goes back to one jar
file
you can download this example from the
link below so let's see how that works
so here
here we have the military's route with
sub-modules Nash Cassie this is the base
with Java 7 Java 8 and the first no
Felicia Eclipse I'm using it's not aware
of Java 9 yet so it's complaining about
this code this is a specific methods
that has been introduced in Java 9 so
for that reason it's complaining about
it so let's execute it so I'm doing math
cleanest all and most of the time I
would say never use math clean install
unless you know what you're doing and
here we go build success so the reason I
did
maven clean install instead of may
verify is because I want to show you
that the install is skipped in this case
and that will also be in case of the
deploy so the the sub products will not
end up in any of the repositories
so let's have a look at the output if we
run it with Java 7 it will be simply
base for Java 8 of course the same
because it is not aware yet of the most
released jar in the case of Java 9 it
will be from base mine and we have if we
have a look at the code you can
recognize it that's here it does s gets
which is mine
so it does pick up the right class and
this is the content of this not Aires
jar so you recognize here the folders 8
&amp;amp; 9 we have an a for 8 a 4 9 and here we
have the base a first
like I said this is just proof of
concept to start with and we're thinking
about several improvements we want to
apply we want to introduce new acting
type something like sabji R which
doesn't do any install or deployments we
also have to think about dependencies
for instance if you have the Java 8
module multi module there can be
specific dependencies there and we need
to put them in a new dedicate profile
and of course we want to get rid of the
assembly descriptor it should work out
of the box that's the future so we're
still in still work in progress now
let's go to material runtime images as
you probably already know and that the
whole full structure has changed and
what's the impact for a maven in this
case well some projects depends on tools
top jar and that has been removed but
most of the mave plugins are already
aware of that and they have several
scenarios to work to cope with such
situations one project we worked on had
to do with custom doctor context that
requires toast OTR and we had to do this
fix at profile and just say that in case
that it's the JDK is below 9 so this
means 9 not included in that case you
can use this tools dot you are picked up
from the system path
and this is actually actually quite cool
because maven we as a project want to
get rid of this system scope and with
Java 9 that path is there looking good
mmm
now let's go finally to the module
system itself which has been changed in
a nutshell we have a in in in in in
perspective of the format so we have
this module info Java file and it has
several dis content you can specify the
exposed packages and you also can
specify the required modules for both
Build time and run time and you can
specify usage and implementations of
server SBI's so this is an example which
is at this time on still on the internet
but as you might see is it is still
talking about public and static some go
to dive in the request part which is
closely related to Maiden dependencies
so yesterday when I heard that the talk
about from Alan about this is that the
requires model modifier public is
probably going to be transitive so I had
to change the title this morning the
rest is what I said is it was already
comparable with transitive
it is actually a hint for other projects
using this jar as a dependency so it has
no effect on the project you are working
on actually maven best practice is don't
trust transitive dependencies always
specify the dependencies for every class
you are using and the reason for this is
suppose I have a project that uses
spring spring uses Commons logging and
for that reason Commons logging is
available on the class path so I can use
it in my project spring decides to drop
comments logging and I just simply
update spring just by upgrading spring
the Commons logging here is lost and I
will get compilation errors or even
runtime errors so for that reason we say
always specify the dependency for every
use class however I was talking to many
Chong yesterday and she said in this
case this will only happen when spring
has set transitive on Commons logging
but if it is not exposed on the method
they should never do that the other one
you noticed is static or I saw a mailing
is it there's a proposal to change that
to optional which is comparable with
method and dependency optional
I'm not sure if everybody is aware of
the optional tack I think most of you
probably will use something like
provided but it's not the same okay at
Build time there's no difference
difference they are both available on
the class path but at run time there's a
huge difference in case of provided you
can expect that that gr is available so
for instance the surface API but
optional might be available so for
instance the springboard dependencies
so let's have a look at the use cases we
know so on the left side we have a
classic project and on the right side we
have assortment Java which has also a
module info you can of course also have
a module info on the toes source tests
Java but that's not supported yes and
I'm also wondering if it makes sense to
put a motor info file there so what's
going to happen with the medical pilot
plug-in well in case there's a module
info file it will automatically switch
to multi path for you so you don't have
to configure something for yourself to
use I use the module path in case of the
test compile and MAIF compiler plug-in
will switch to module path for the main
sources and for the class path for the
test sources so let's see that in action
I was thinking about projects Multi
multi projects using third party Josh
having a large code base so I thought
about why not build maven with me and if
we have a look at this this picture this
is the whole graph of Apache maven
wait a minute
so we're not going to compile the whole
project but we're only going to compile
this part the setting settings is
actually a descriptor which is
generating the code to have Poggio style
and it's also creating a reader and a
writer for the settings.xml so it's
actually about the settings.xml the
build spot is about handling errors and
to combine them all together so you
don't have to go from one error to the
order to fix your issues in a
settings.xml and the settings builder
itself it has all kinds of rules in it
for instance that IDs are unique
so we're going to compile this part
looking good so this is what we did with
JDK 9 in the beginning I said well our
wish is that it will run with maven 3.0
so let's give it a try
that's all white again
again build success so for now it's
looking very very good let's have a look
at the Maven build sports to see if we
can detect that it is actually using the
multipath so we use debug here you can
see that it is not using the classpath
it is only using the multipath and it
has added plexus utils and comment
length 3 now let's have a look at what
just compiled us
again ready
so now we have a combination of class
path and multipath so the jars we
already had during the compile are again
on a module path but in this case on a
class path is J units and Empress pore
so this is all just based on if there's
a module info file or not
so nothing you have to do about it how
to discover the module name well I hope
that once the module names are published
that there's a little documentation
about it however I also hope that maven
central or any other repository manages
will provide that kind of information as
well but right now what I've done is
I've improved the maven in Tennessee
plug-in and in this case the lisko which
will show you the module names for all
those dependencies so in this case maven
dependency plug-in is still the snapshot
I've haven't released it yet call the
list goal on a specific module
and as you can see we have here the GRU
body an artifact ID and the module name
in this case is common slang and 4j
units the motor memory is jailed in this
case it is actually using exactly the
same code as what a of mine is using to
resolve the name of other modules and if
there's already module info file inside
the gr it will use that dead name so for
those who are library builders or
framework builders or maven plug-in
builders the lower the version of Java
are the more projects you can use it
however that also means that you there
are less job features that you can use
can we add module info in this case yes
we can the module info will be ignored
if you are using Java 8 or less however
there's a trigger there's a small issue
with it the module fo has to be compiled
with - release 9 and all the other
sources have to be compiled with source
target below 9 so we have to call the
maiden of the Java C twice so there are
several several solutions for death we
could separate it in source force so for
instance source main Java and short main
jigsaw what that would mean that we only
have death motive info file in the
jigsaw folder not really nice it would
be much nicer if we could keep it all
together in the short name Java same a
bit like the naughty release GRE
recently you will have to require a
multi module maven multimodal projects
we are probably going to suggest to use
two executions blocks and in the first
one you say explicitly only compile the
motor
info with nine and in the other case in
the other case excludes module info and
compile it with another version of Java
I've been working on
mave compiler pledgee plugin magic to do
it out of the box I didn't like it so
I'm going to follow for that now let's
talk a bit about dependencies and class
paths and the reason is that this is how
the class path order works in in case of
Nathan for a project it will first
select all the direct dependencies next
it will go for the first level in direct
dependencies then the second and so on
and so on and so on for locating a class
it will iterate over this class path in
the same order and first match wins this
will change in case of a module path you
can think of that pictures are mapped to
a specific module in case there are
duplicate packages there will be an
exception thrown locating a class is now
quite simple just pick your packages key
it will find the module and it will get
that class from that module
now there's a small gotcha and that's
about the dependency excludes the Java C
has an option where you can say limit
modules and you have to specify all the
module names you want to exclude from
this execution however the name of the
module is inside the gr and maven
excludes those dependencies already up
front so there's no need to download
those from or jar and/or jar so if in
case you have an exclude we probably
have to download the world plus a bit
more because we have to know which
motives we have to exclude so there's no
solution yet for that and the workaround
is to specify it yourself in the
arguments of the configuration so are we
there yet no this is a list of all the
topics which are waiting for a proposal
and there are some related to maven and
they are waiting for an answer for it
for instance the maven shade plug-in it
is plug-in which can make an uber drier
which means that it will just unpack all
the jars combined it's as one the
problem is that if we would merge the
module info files it would break
encapsulation because it's not aware
anymore which packages are of your own
VR and we also have to think about
relocation relocation is about shifting
or renaming the package name so this is
an issue which still really quite an
answer there's something else that's a
bit too fast the animal sniffer now
there's not anymore just one huge
runtime which we can verify with
signatures so what do we have to do do
we have to do it for module
or is it still requires now that we have
to - release our option it's still a
question that's a request an answer
oh that's optimum team so now the
question for you is my project job and
I'm ready one of the first questions you
have to answer yourself is am I using
internal classes and for that we've
created the Maven jaidev's plugin it was
released about a year ago and it was
during Java 1 when I noticed that the
the slides of the jigsaw team suddenly
mentioned this plug-in and it wasn't
released yet so we did it quite fast and
the official release was during the java
one and I will show you how that works
so what I'm going to do is am Ava
compile
so I have the class files because Jade
EPS uses the classes and not the sources
and in this case it's using the maven
artifact module
so now we have a huge list and you can
see the the mapping of all the packages
so in this case the org that she made an
artifact package is the classes inside
that is are using all these packages and
here you can see where several packages
belong to in this case there are no
there's no usage of any internal classes
from Java but of course we want to see
that as well so the jeddak's begin also
has an integration test for it so again
I will go into that integration test and
run math compiled and verified with the
JDK internals go
and we see failure in this case you see
that some misc
it's marked as Angelica internal API and
this already breaks the build so this is
something you can do already right now
just add the jeddak's plug-in to your
own file and let it check your code over
and over again during our built just to
see if your product is Java now ready
the other thing is do I have duplicates
and you can verify that with the
enforcer maven enforce plugin and inside
the Nathan force plugin specify this
rule then duplicate classes and in case
you want to use specific job 9 features
upgrade the plugins to that specific
version
we all have to pick on the eye at the
end please okay so the attachment for
project still has tasks list most
features should already work with maven
3 that we already notice that although
some require method 3.3 that one due to
the improved tool change support and
that probably has to do with when we
have the module info inside the source
main Java and we want to compile it with
an older version of Java that will
require to change a large number of
features are already developed but they
are not you released yet and we also
have to write several recipes for the
maven way so something this is something
you all should know that the module info
Java triggers if the module path will be
used or if the class path will be used
in case of test compile it will use both
motive path and class path in case
there's a module info file in dark
glasses and again in case your project
will fill with Java nano jigsaw is
probably because of the usage of
internal API or duplicate exported
practice so here's the information you
can find
and I will publish this this slice as
well so and that's it for now give it a
try I would say and thank you very much
so are there any questions please come
to the front so everybody can hear it
they've come to hear so because they're
also filming it yes then you talk about
duplicate band to play pluses then force
plugin my question is like it only
checks my own build classes like my
application classes or it also checks
duplicate classes in the third-party
jars our typical use cases in big
applications we have seen or as a
developer you don't know sometimes you
have a dependency on different versions
of third-party jars and it brings two
versions of the same implementation and
most of the time it conflicts and yes
gets error in the runtime so to avoid
that one does it really mean that way or
just a us exactly what's this for this
enforce rule is the way it's verifying
that you don't have any duplicates
classes okay including third-party jobs
exactly perfect especially especially
those third-party jars so all the
transitive tree please come to the front
I will
so are there any plans to merge maven
dependencies with the module
dependencies in module info or do I need
to specify both maven dependencies and
the module dependencies there's no
difference between your just specifying
maven dependencies as you are used to if
you are talking about do I have to write
my own module info file yes probably and
merge them you're talking about
generating the part of the module info
file the problem is that it's only a
specific part of that file the other
things like the let me go back to export
yes
right here so yes the requires parts can
be generated but all the others cannot
so then we have Church are we going to
generate half of a file the other way
around is not possible because where are
those jars coming from you don't you
cannot specify calculate the path to a
specific artifact purely based on the
name of the module that's the whole
problem
hi notations is there's actually one one
developer is trying to work with
annotations to see if that's going to
work it's it's a proof-of-concept he's
working on it thank you for the talk I
was I wasn't completely following with
how banning duplicate classes relates to
being ready for JDK 9 okay the problem
is in case you have two jars which have
duplicate classes so I know for instance
I think it's it's JBoss it sometimes
just has an uber jar which has and
