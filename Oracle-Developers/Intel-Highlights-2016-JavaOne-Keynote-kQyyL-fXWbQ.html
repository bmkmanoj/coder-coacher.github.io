one of the things that were continuing
to look at is how we're looking at the
into n solution and in fact what we're
starting to understand and how we've
characterized it we've characterized it
as the virtuous cycle of growth we're
looking at what smart devices can do and
all the data that they're driving into
the cloud and did cloud and the data
center enabling even greater experiences
for the smart devices today we're going
to talk about what we're doing to make
Java easy efficient and expansive easy
make it easier for developers to deliver
applications efficient making it faster
and more efficient to run and also
expensive to make sure its future proof
through better connections support for
more technologies and more community
very often we think about the cloud will
focus on pure performance but often it's
about performance for total cost of
ownership for smart connected devices
you have a host different set of design
criteria across-the-board performance
power and thermals all play a role we
doubled the performance by enabling our
new 512 bit AVX extensions in openjdk
fast and performant implementations of
many more encryption standards making it
easier for developers to deploy secure
options and we've made math operations
even smarter by squeezing three to four
times more performance out of key
operations 3d cross point is a
revolutionary technology which one
offers byte addressable storage class
memory imagine what we can do with
systems with terabytes of memory that
stays even after the systems turned off
and integrating fpgas into the platform
that can dynamically be reconfigured to
accelerate the work at hand which opens
up big opportunities in software Java's
run anywhere approach is critical to
actually really taking advantage of the
data that's coming through this virtuous
cycle of compute
