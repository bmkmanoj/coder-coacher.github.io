Washington DC I'm Bob Rubert with the
Oracle technology Network and my guest
for this segment is actually Tosh
Tripathi tell the folks at home what you
do and who you do it for hi everyone so
I'm a suppose to party and I am a
platform specialist with Oracle
Corporation and my session was primarily
focused on developers who are using new
technologies or node.js in MongoDB to
run on containers how they can get
started when they start using this all
these new shiny technologies which have
a lot of value but a lot of people are
not using so my main aim was how they
can get started with that on the journey
what do you think is the basis for the
reluctance to get started in no js' in
MongoDB so a lot of customers have been
using Java or.net for a long time and it
has been one of the most popular
languages in the past and of course no
deus is not really new it is based on
JavaScript based framework and it's all
about the thing okay I am using node.js
it's primarily for starters but my point
is if the startups can get those agility
and the benefit of using new languages
you should certainly try it out because
there are certain languages which are
good for certain things
there is no golden hammer to solve
everything with one language and node.js
could be essence owners event-based
technology this could add a lot of
flexibility and help you build a
lightweight application section are
there aspects is working with nodejs
especially early on that developers
should be careful of what what's likely
to trip them up so my session was
primarily running node GS or MongoDB on
the containers actually so the
resistance or the question based on the
audience I was in the room right it was
not against node.js or MongoDB it is how
do I get started on the containers
actually
so real challenges how do I build the
application using docker for example
docker containers and not many people
were doing these kind of things even
today in the production environment or
even on pilot basis except few startups
which we all know and one of the main
reason I see the enterprises are not
using to this container or not Jesus
type of things because they have
monolithic applications where over a
period of years and it takes time to
really take those applications so the
claim is when you are adopting a new
technology or new application you may
not be able to refactor those things
that easily but we should think about V
architecture and how I can use XYZ
technology could be a node.js MongoDB
PHP or whatever it is right for the
purpose based on what you are building
and if you are building the applications
using micro solution architecture that
provides your flexibility to build a
technology stack with the programming
language of your choice let me give you
an example I was a develop an
electrolyte developed lot of
applications a long time back I was
working on a building platform and the
choice of technology was okay know what
I believe the programming language as
Java and I will use relational database
and that clearly get started but over a
period of time once the first release of
application was successful we got to
build certain other features maybe I
should be able to recharge my prepaid
phone itself or telecommunication
companies I want to make sure customers
should be able to register if they
should be able to add comments on it
like more of a poor on type of situation
so of course Java and our DBMS database
and everything must fit for the purpose
where we started but what happened over
a period of time we start putting
band-aids on each and everything because
I want to achieve XYZ functionalities if
I am building let's say using micro
services with sign architecture which is
you can say it's a buzz word but to me
it is the necessities how you can
decouple the application let's say I'm
building a forum or I am building
product sells I want to use no sequel or
node.js but if I am doing some
transactional type of activity in my
system I may want to use the relational
database and this node.js Java MongoDB
and everything if you think container
first approach you should be able to
build a micro-services architecture it's
all about starting and how you can
really take your existing model effect
applications did you get questions
during your session yes what were what
were some of those questions so one of
the question was how do I first of all
when I ask the question how many of you
did a HelloWorld program not there were
not many hands they knew about docker
containers the question was how do ideas
services Discovery's because when you
are building a typical monolithic
application all these database calls or
the module cause it is self-contained
within your application but when you're
building a microservices architecture
the application should be resilient
enough you should be able to make call
from a service a to service B and if
service these are not available you
should be able to tail over very easily
and it's I would say a nice type of
failover and the primary question was
what about service service discovery so
as we talked about container right there
shortly
they can be created and destroyed so the
question was how do I do discovery so
for that the way I look at it of course
the Apache zookeeper is one of the tool
and typically when you go with the
services approach the API platform is
one thing you should make sure whatever
services you expose exposed to the API
platform for your behind us in
infrastructure or container even if it
is destroyed you are still able to
operate or if you change IP addresses
may change right it's all about
immutable infrastructure you spin up
something it destroy something so you
should be able to do a service discovery
with the tools I talked about like
zookeeper for example API platform is
one of the latex posts and uses action
if you could take your entire what 45
minute presentation and squeeze it down
into one key point what would that key
point be so the key point would be by
containers are import
and containers are important for three
reasons one is clouds we all are going
to the cloud right whether we like it or
not that's the way to go because of
agility and flexibility you get second
option is micro-services a style of
architecture how do you dig up all your
applications and third thing is there
are only way you can get a DevOps a
quick turnaround in your code if you
have decoupled architecture and a small
team this can work on the functionality
so cloud micro services and DevOps helix
meetings will you be presenting this
session or content like this at other
code events I will be I offend my
nomination and hopefully I will be
getting the chance to present there as
well applause well received and I want
to make sure that all the road shows we
present these type of talks all right
well we look forward to it if you'd like
to attend an upcoming Oracle code event
please visit developers oracle.com slash
code you'll find a complete list of the
16 remaining Oracle code events around
the world along with information on how
you can submit a session proposal so you
can present your own session at the
Oracle code event for the Oracle
technology Network I'm Bob Rupert thanks
for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
