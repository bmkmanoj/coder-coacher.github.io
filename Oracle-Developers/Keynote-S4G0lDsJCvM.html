George Saab
all right welcome everyone to the 19th
javaone conference so it's really
fantastic for me to be standing on stage
here welcoming you all to this
conference and this keynote I've had the
pleasure of spending many many days and
nights over the past years over this
past year going around the world and
celebrating 20 years of Java this is a
tremendous time and it's a great
achievement a great milestone for
technology like Java to be at 20 years
young still strong vibrant and and
continuing to move forward so all of you
are in this room because you have a
connection to Java you've made some kind
of investment your career may have been
based on Java and so I think it's it's
great for us to be here and look not
only back at the last 20 years also take
stock of where we are now and then we'll
be looking also forward for the next 20
years so this is where we've gotten to
today and I think this is an amazing
amazing place to be quite an achievement
so at javaone this week please take
stock look at all of the things going on
there's a huge number of sessions lots
of things to find out about wonderful
presenters both from oracle and from
from the industry at large and so this
is a great time to be learning about
Java about things in Java 8 about any
and about EE and all of the other
technologies so oh and by the way while
you're here I I think we owe it to
ourselves to have a little bit of fun as
well I think sherratt mentioned
something about beer or something okay
maybe there'll be time for for one
great I would also like to thank all of
the sponsors that we have so there is a
an exhibition hall where both these
sponsors and a huge number of other
sponsors have all kinds of things to
show you so please take advantage of it
make sure you go by you know maybe
they'll give you some schwag but they
also will have interesting things to
talk about and learn about so finally
what I'd like to do now is to invite our
innovation sponsors to come up and tell
you a few things about what they've been
doing with Java so my guest leads
worldwide organization which is
responsible for enabling development
architecture analysis and optimization
his organization delivers system
firmware modeling and simulation tools
client-server and big data software
stack optimizations and they actually
have been working quite a bit over the
last year since they joined openjdk to
help make sure that the performance of
Java is as good as it possibly can be on
new generations of hardware as it comes
out so please help me welcome on stage
michael green here's the Intel vice
president and general manager for Intel
software systems technologies and
optimization
alright thank you so very nice so intro
thank you Michael all right hey good
afternoon javaone okay that I heard one
person who's really excited well I'm
super excited to be back here to tell
you what we're doing to accelerate Java
or connected world but first this is the
20th anniversary of Java happy 20th
anniversary Java before I go forward I
wanted just to take a quick look back
now when you think back to 1995 at least
in my mind two important things happen
first I married my wife of 20 years who
transformed my life for the better I
might add and second Intel signed his
first Java source license in the fall of
nineteen ninety-five with sun
microsystems and that actually
transformed my career i was one of the
first engineers pulled in to intel to
actually work on optimizing Java to
ensure that we're providing the right
insights to both our hardware and
software teams to make sure that Java
runs best on Intel platforms intel has
been working closely with Java starting
with Sun and continues to work closely
through our collaboration with Oracle to
this point I'm glad to say that we
haven't missed a beat so Java continues
to be one of the most widely used
programming languages on the planet
labeled as the world most popular
programming language by i triple e
spectrum just this year enabling java
really is important to Intel as we think
about the number and various platforms
that we support this is important for us
because we have a simple yet powerful
vision if it computes and connects it
runs best on Intel it would be hard to
realize that vision if we actually
didn't take advantage of this Java
ecosystem and a power Java one of the
most important programming languages on
this planet as such we do broad enabling
for engagements with key ecosystem
partners I
v's in users and developers and that's
why I'm here to talk with you so last
year I announced Intel was joining
OpenJDK and in the next 27 minutes and
36 seconds I'm going to tell you what
we've been doing so if you have been
asking a question but what have you done
for me lately I'm here to tell you I'm
going to walk you through what we've
been doing to extend Java into new use
areas to simplify the development
experience and to optimize Java to make
sure that it runs best on Intel
platforms so let's start with extend
Java clearly is used widely across the
continuum of computing on Intel
Architecture in ultra mobile phones too
and ones and all the way into the data
center but what about the Internet of
Things about two decades ago compute
technology began to be embedded into all
types of machines you know we start to
see ATMs and cash registers embedding
compute as a result information was
processed on a large scale this was the
first wave of IOT the second way of a
vile T came with about ten years ago
with the introduction of cloud computing
the cloud ushered in the second
connected wave of IOT this established a
need for big data solutions finally
today we're witnessing the beginning of
the third wave of IOT smart IOT not only
are we net disconnected but we're also
smart and able to create intelligence
everywhere we could finally harness data
analytical power from these embedded and
connected devices this creates a new
relationship and opportunities for
collaboration and creativity computing
is now more than retrieving and sharing
information today IOT enables devices to
act automatically on shared information
the potential IOT is that give us data
metrics around everything around us that
could be used to improve the efficiency
of our home
businesses our cities our lives so when
we start thinking about how big is IOT
there's just so many estimates and you
can see on this chart that they vary
from 50 billion to 200 billion connected
devices one of the things that they
share in these estimates that I find
interesting is that every year tend to
make the they tend to increase the size
of their estimate so today there are
only about 15 billion connected devices
and that means that we're really just
getting started for us the key is not
just smart sensors it's a network that
stretches from end to end from any
device right to the cloud whether it's
from the mobile phone industrial plant
thermometer in your home we want that
connected and communicating up to the
cloud and back layered on top of that is
a system of real-time analytics that's
able to sift through this data and
transform a connected network into a
knowledge Network and we want to tap
into the power of Java and you the Java
development community to help drive the
Internet of Things so as part of that
we've been looking at what we need to do
in silicon to help provide smart
connected devices to the edge to the
edge through that we have introduced
cork that's our smallest processor core
from Intel in a compact package this
enables a wide range of Intel
intelligent edge devices but until now
we haven't been able to run Java
applications on these new edge devices
this is a real problem right kind of
don't want to come here and talk to the
java community and leave here with that
still as a problem thankfully through
our long collaboration with oracle we've
been able to do something about that and
today I'm happy to reveal that Java ME
now runs on Intel this enables Java
developers to create intelligent edge
devices on Intel processors not just
dumb sensors but smart devices connected
to the
out and enterprise Java ME brings Java
to intelligent as devices built on Intel
Architecture and with the addition of
the support of cork Java now runs on
intelligent edge devices all the way to
the high-end Z on servers everything and
everything in between now we have Java
from in the end this is very exciting to
me alright so we talked about extending
Java how do you the developer take
advantage of it I'm going to talk about
what we're doing to simplify that
develop the development of products to
help improve the speed that we go from
paths from ideation to product IOT can
be a maze of standard protocols tools
and products interoperability and
several other items and a lot of times
when you get started it's hard to
actually in with your product making it
to commercialization what we would love
to see is a simplified vision of this
journey or we just move the maze out of
the way have a direct path from product
from idea to product as a result of that
just two months ago at the Intel
developers forum we introduced the Intel
IOT developer kit and into a developer
kit has now about 250,000 developers
using it this helps simplify the past
the product we're evolving the IOT
developer program by adding Intel IOT
commercial developer resources and kids
the kids give developers a clear path
from prototype to commercialization by
providing additional tools for security
manageability performance as well as
scalability in addition to supporting
arduino development environment the kid
includes the latest yocto a linux bill
Eclipse IDE Intel system studio
optimization tools and much more we
didn't go it alone when we're developing
the IOT developer kit we actually worked
with developers to make sure that we
were providing a set of tools that work
for you but if you take a look at this
picture
something should strike you as odd and
that is where's Java well today I'm
happy to announce that we've added Java
to the Intel IOT developer kit we've
ported openjdk to run on our Edison
Galileo and middle board max products
with that what we're bringing is a set
of optimized libraries all with Java
bindings for i/o sensors making sure
that the open jdk 8 binaries are
available for Galileo Edison and middle
bore max also providing sample code so
that it could speed your path to
development basically everything you
need to get up and running now so let's
look at what one is firing developer was
able to create with the Intel IOT
developer kit now with support for java
when i was told in 2013 a flyer came to
our doorstep asking for donations for
the blind that for a moment i closed my
eyes and i wondered what would i do I
was blind I thought about all the things
that I would miss like my friends faces
a football game reading a book
I asked my parents essentially how do I
be blurry they're quite busy at the time
so this would go google it and that's
where I found out all about Braille
Braille printers you know the normal
cost for Braille printer is two thousand
dollars it just got me thinking there
had to be a better option that's what
inspired me to try and build a new one I
started with the Lego robotics kit and I
just went for it illus collagen cuz I
had to break down model was build models
it took some time
when I finished the LEGO version I made
new designs but Elsa needed by the brain
that isn't didn't cost too much which
was super important just made everything
work together perfectly and then I saw
the first words come up that's what
really motivated me so I felt like I
could do something and help people's
lives I want to make more of these for
the printers so we start a company
within a year we could just even we can
start making hundreds and thousands of
these you know that's where I think we
can start changing people's lives
invented in school 20 relieve me the
factory you don't have to be a certain
age you can be whatever you want to be
as long as you have the right tools to
do it the right people to seek out
there's no there's nothing you can do
game
so clearly we're bringing tools the
question is now what will you make this
is an expiring tell really of a 8th
grade developer his low-cost bro printer
using Intel Edison as he mentioned costs
around five hundred dollars without that
the typical price for such a Braille
printer would have been two thousand
dollars clearly an overachiever and and
clearly an eighth-grader it doesn't like
his kisses from mom we we now have the
capability to simplify the path from an
idea to creating a product so to find
out more about this go to a software
intel com and click on i OT so we talked
about extending java into new areas and
now simplifying the path to product with
Intel IOT developer kit now let's talk
about what we're doing to optimize Java
to make sure that it runs besa on Intel
and what we're going to do is follow the
data to the cloud and enterprise for
those here that write code that
eventually lands in the data center
performance matters as you increase the
efficiency he dropped you reduce the
operating costs and improve the total
cost of ownership and that bottom line
is very impactful running your software
and a current version of Java with the
latest Intel processors makes a huge
difference to the efficiency of your
data center so what we're doing now is
drawing on our knowledge of optimization
and performance gain over the past two
decades that helped design faster more
efficient micro processors and systems
my use expect GV jbb we can see that the
Intel Xeon processors were three point
six times faster than the previous
generation and Java 8 was about 2.4
times faster than the previous
generation of Java pulling it all
together just actually drives an
incredible performance gain of 8.7 x
nearly 9 x of generation to generation
performance improvement
we're hard at work as we've been hard at
work with optimizing Java 8 we're now
looking forward to continuing to
contribute through the OpenJDK community
community to optimize Java nine since in
todo and OpenJDK last year we've been
contributing code to open source and I
want to spend a little time getting into
the details I'm going to geek out just a
little bit let's start with compute at a
high level we've optimized functions
like Libya for to ensure that the basic
math functions that are used everywhere
are running as fast as possible and
we're already seeing more than 3x
performance on functions like math dot
exp for spring operations we
transparently leverage the best possible
versions of AVX instructions given the
platform that you're running on this is
seamless from your Java code and we're
seeing up to a 10 x gain in performance
by by utilizing our optimizations again
you're just getting this benefit
transparently when we think of memory
we're collaborating with Oracle to
improve stream density by helping to
optimize memory density on I platforms
this helps to more efficiently use the
space which is great for in memory
operations the next part of the system
will look at is storage we've given you
an I intrinsic for crc32 see which is
used for an example for check summing in
big data workloads and already with that
we're seeing we've measured 16x speed up
depending on the size of the buffer you
use but we're not finished there we
still want to cover the network these
days encryption matters one of the first
steps of security is just encrypt
everything but encryption comes at a
cost so it's important for us to
optimize these to optimize encryption to
make sure that we're providing that of
that security layer for as low cost to
your performance as possible
and building on our previous
optimizations in aes we've optimized RSA
and we're looking for optimization in
sha lastly we're now making it possible
for Java to take advantage of new
features in Linux to unleash the full
potential of the next gen storage and
network capabilities this has given us
nearly a 2x reduction in latency when
you put it all together what's so
important is that we're taking a
holistic approach to optimizing a
platform you have to optimize the CPU
the memory storage and a network you
have to do it all together if you don't
then any one of those components can rob
you of the performance that you're
seeking with the mountain of data that
is now coming in it's important that we
have a very performance system so that
we can deal with the big data challenges
and I want to bring someone on stage
they help explain how Java relates I
like the Welcome Mikaelson a thought
leader in big data and analytics to the
stage
thank you thank you for joining us might
a beer all right so Michael your founder
probably Dara alright home of the
easiest to use fastest most secure how
do you have patchy howdy platform new
yeah yeah we've been working with Intel
of course for some time to make big data
more consumable by enterprises generally
and it's been fascinating to watch the
spread of this technology across every
industry across every technology sector
we see big data is changing the way that
enterprises adopt and use new
technologies to analyze their businesses
their customers Java is really
fundamental to that could you tell me
more about why Java so fundamental to
Cloudera success well of course the
Hadoop ecosystem and Hadoop is really
the foundation for big data Hadoop is
built in Java all of the surrounding
projects for data in jest and data
analysis tend to be written in Java so
anything we can do to improve
performance on Java benefits the
community at large have you any examples
of how this is work to better the
performance of the platform yeah we've
been working with intel and oracle on
some great innovations on the Oracle Big
Data appliance so Intel and Oracle have
been collaborating for some time to make
job or run better on Intel Architecture
and that's been a really powerful
advance in the state of the system more
than that though Cloudera Oracle and
Intel have collaborated to make sure
that our software running on that big
data appliance performs better delivers
better throughput better speed than ever
before and we've as much as double
performance of the Big Data appliance
current-generation over what was
available before Wow twice as fast
that's pretty impressive it's been
absolutely great but you know i'm most
excited about the intel data analytics
acceleration laboratory i think it's
going to be really important for the
next generation of applications we see
on the system yeah we see it that
similarly
very excited about what we're doing with
Dell because analytics is so important
that we make it high performance so that
we can sift through this world of
information and turn it into knowledge
and what we're already seeing is three
to seven x performance gains on PCA this
is just the beginning though well it's
really important the original big data
workloads that came out of consumer
internet we're transformative we're
powerful but we're bash mode were slow
we couldn't see Big Data technology
spread broadly across the industry
unless we saw advances in those
capabilities real-time matters new
analytic approaches matter people want
instantaneous insight into what's going
on in their data we see an enormous
innovation in Apache spark in new
projects for data in jest and fast query
all of those are going to rely on high
performance analytics buildable and
spark applications on top of that
platform are going to enable great new
innovations while this is really
wonderful I just wanted to thank you for
coming out here and sharing how Java
performance really matters and actually
provides valuable performance to end
users Michael the partnership music
great deal and the work we've done is
going to be very important and we've
destroyed working with you and Cloudera
all right thank you
so you can see a lot of great
optimization work is already underway
for the next version of Java and of
course the fully leveraged the results
of this tremendous collaboration
download the latest version of the
software and run on the latest
generation of Intel Xeon processors it's
been an amazing journey that we've been
on over the past 20 years and we're
excited what the future holds we've been
delivering on OpenJDK across a full
spectrum of computing we've been working
to extend Java into new user areas
simplify the developer experience and we
continually work on improving the
platform level optimizations to such
that you get the most out of your Intel
platforms we'd really like people to go
out and try this code we're looking for
feedback this is a community effort and
we're happy to be a part of the
community and with your help we will
continue to extend simplify and optimize
java the java experience so in the words
of Robert Noyce Intel founder don't be
encumbered by history go off and do
something wonderful
