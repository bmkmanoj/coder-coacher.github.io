men start up it's um it's John meeting
in myself my name is Tony McCreary and
we're based in Detroit which is probably
not you'd probably not associated with
you know software computers too much for
more into the auto industry but there's
a lot of startup activity going on in
the area it's a pretty important
technology hub due to the fact that it's
the home of the auto industry and we're
working on some game development tools
that use Java and are built on the
Eclipse platform
you know normally you wouldn't consider
or normally Java isn't used for video
games right now the game industry is
going through a pretty big change you
may have heard of something nonsense
about steamos you know the proliferation
of mobile devices and a lot of the new
platforms that are out there it's no
longer a situation where everything is
you know windows pc you know it's less
Microsoft centric or it's becoming less
Microsoft centric and you know
historically Java hasn't been used much
for video games as much as a much
stronger presence in the enterprise you
know software industry but we think that
you know it's a great fit for video
games because it makes things easy and
with video games you know you're dealing
with a lot of fairly complex
technologies a lot of math and whatnot
in anything that makes things easier is
great you know I'm sure if you went from
like C++ to Java you know you know the
difference because it's it's so much
easier to do things in Java and you know
on top of that Java is a very mature
platform has great tooling you know
great debugging capabilities a lot of
support huge community a lot of know-how
and we think it's great for video games
so we kind of consider it our secret
weapon the technology that working on
it's called bling 3d which is a game a
set of game development tools that are
built on top of the Eclipse platform so
if you're familiar with eclipse as I'm
sure most of you are all of you are it's
one of the big three development IDEs
along with netbeans an idea and we chose
Eclipse mainly because it's very
extensible you know it's modular and you
can do a lot with it you know as we've
seen with all the different plugins and
I des that are out there so one aspect
of you know building tools on top of
Eclipse is the fact that games are an
artistic medium as well as you know you
know as well as having a lot of
technical requirements for programming
and math and whatnot so the thing that
we needed to do was you know start
working on some artistic you know and
design related tools for you know on top
of the Eclipse platform because really
we didn't need to do too much on the
development side you know because it
comes with such great you know
development tools you know awesome
debugger integration you
you know United you not to compile much
because it compiles on the fly is your
editing stuff so we've been working on
some tools for the design side and one
of the things we wanted to do with
blingee are with you know RIT bling on
Eclipse was create a cooler atmosphere
for development and you know you look at
all the different programming IDEs out
there and really all the different
development tools they kind of all
looked the same they work the same you
know and some of that's for good reason
because obviously you know you want to
be able to move from one tool to another
if you know you need to for some reason
but you know we wanted to do something
different and kind of push you know push
things forward a little bit as far as
what you can do with you know in a
development environment so we want to
improve user experience so with pulling
what we've done is we've rewritten the
Eclipse user interface so instead of
being rendered by platform widgets so
like for example with eclipse is built
in UI system swt which you may be
familiar with the standard widget
toolkit when you create a button usually
what it does is it goes to the OS and it
creates a button and then you know for
same thing for all the other widgets so
it looks very native which is which can
be cool but we wanted to be able to do
more with it so what we've done is
instead of having those widgets be
rendered by the operating system we've
rewritten the interface so that it
actually renders them on the GPU so it's
using you know geometry submission and
shader programs to actually do the
rendering and you know you may say well
GUI use all that 3d hardware for cutie
stuff which is you know when you look at
an IDE you're typically talking about
the 2d metaphors for the most part 3d
isn't you know is more of a niche type
of thing but um you know GPUs are really
fast these days and everyone has one so
why not accelerate that with what you
can do with the GPU and on top of that
it also gives us the ability to take
advantage of open CL for doing things
like compute and speeding up other types
of operations that aren't just graphics
up you know operations and so what we've
done is we've you know to help get
started we got lucky because there's a
really smart programmer from Germany who
is working on a library for doing you
know 3d user interfaces on top of a
three
graphics API called the theme of widget
library the guy's name is Matias man and
I mean he's really a brilliant
programmer and so we got the opportunity
to take that and implement SWT using
some of that technology so it's here you
know here in the diagram you can see you
know we have SWT on top of 12 which
actually renders everything using the
OpenGL interface on your computer which
is using vertex and fragment shaders and
then ultimately they get output into the
display device so now I'm going to
switch over to our monitor and so what
we have here is our new interface and
we're still working on the theme and
everything but you know if you've seen
it Clips before this is going to look
fairly familiar right like you haven't
really or you know it looks pretty much
like eclipse and that's what we wanted
to do is we wanted to make sure that
people even though it can do new things
we wanted to make sure that it you know
still is fairly comfortable people are
familiar with it but you know one of the
things are we're rendering it on the GPU
so that means that we can you know do
cool things that you normally can't do
with the UI or maybe only with the
current next generation the UI's likes a
job effects that's a technology that you
know can do some similar things so for
example if you've ever selected you know
way or the other display what's that oh
sorry okay so if you've ever you know
any in eclipse you know they have the
perspectives that you can see up there
like we have the design theming and
resource perspective and normally you
can select them a little modal window
pops up and you select one and you go on
so one of the things that we thought
would be cool is what if you know we had
kind of more of a mobile feel and we did
kind of a you know a little animation
with a width for the selection screen
and so just and so as you can see here
instead of just you know rendering it
we're kind of zooming it out on the 3d
and displaying the list of icons for you
for you to select from now that kinds
look kind of bad because they're not all
SVG some of them are SVG's like the one
on the bottom right is an SVG graphic
but the rest are the stock eclipse icons
and anyway this is an example of you
know one effect that we can do there are
others that we can do like II like here
for transitioning
between say you know the different
perspectives you know this in this case
we're rotating and I kind of a cube type
of thing so anyway that's what you know
some examples of some of the cool things
that we can do with the 3d interface
that test plug so I gotta fix outlook so
I'm going to have to get back
apologize we have like a bugger it's
getting out of order for some reason so
okay so anyways back to SVG graphics one
of the things that our implementation
does is it actually uses SVG as its
native image format so instead of using
like pings and things that nature you
can actually just give it an SVG graphic
rendering at a certain resolution and
it'll handle render in a rasterizing it
getting it into an open GL texture and
you know you can use it as an SWT image
or you know however you want to use it
SVG graphics I should you know explain
what they are they're you know obviously
a vector format it stands for scalable
vector graphic and instead of drawing
pixels you know they're drawn as shape
second drawn the screen so they can be
scaled to any size any resolution um and
sorry I got ahead of myself a little bit
and we also like I said we have native
support in SW T's imaging systems so
when you create an SWT image you can
just give it a SVG graphic and it'll
handle it another nice thing about SVG
is you know due to the dynamic nature of
vector graphics you can use things like
CSS so that means that you could have
your you know vector graphics change
depending on you know your style sheet
so you had a different theme or
something of that nature you could
easily have all of your icons change and
not just you know be the same as they
would for any other theme we also have
some support for different types of
effects so you can render an SVG graphic
and you apply like a Gaussian blur that
I'll get applied on the GPU and we're
also working on a set of replacement
eclipse SVG icons which are you know a
replacement for the entire set of
eclipses icon so that means everything
would be SVG instead of any type of
raster image it's a little bit hard to
read there but it's at Google code so if
you google for like eclipse SVG icons
it's the first link on google now
another thing that we're working on with
the IDE is actors actually this is kind
of out of order
padeen a switch over the engine or yeah
anyway I'm what actors are are when
you're talking about game logic in
designing games the typical the typical
type of design that you'd use with you
know the hierarchical object-oriented
design so you know have one class and
inherits from another inherits for
another it tends to become kind of
brutal with games because you have all
these little variations and things that
you know cause that make it difficult to
use that traditional approach and so one
thing we've been doing is designing
language called our actor framework
which is specifically designed for games
and it uses a component based approach
so instead of you know is this does this
object or is this object an instance of
a certain type you know it's more about
it does this object have a certain
component or you know does it have a
certain property and which makes it much
more flexible for game design now the
cool thing is you can either use it you
know our actor language which is built
on Eclipse X text which we'll talk about
in a second or you can also use Java
because it's available as a Java API so
if it makes designing game logic much
easier and this is kind of an example
that we came up with okay so say you
have your normal hierarchy and it's kind
of a little bit you know videogame ish I
guess you have your base type and then
you have two specialized types here we
have like you know air units versus
ground units and you know that's great
and everything until you come up with
something like you know like a robot or
something which might need you know
capabilities from both of those types
which you normally can't do in Java you
would have to like read architect a
bunch of things and redesign everything
whereas with oh sorry we were supposed
to have a graphic here that we had a bug
but um essentially what you know with a
component based design ones in there
what's that the components in it ok ok
so here we go so the component based
design you know each type or each the
features of a certain are the
capabilities you know can be applied to
different types or different instances
without
without needing to be architect your
type hierarchy as I mentioned is built
with clip sex text if you haven't used
XX before it's a really awesome language
for building or really awesome framework
for building languages you can you know
you can create something really fast and
you get detailed it generates your
compiler and ultimately it compiles down
into Java code so it makes it easy to
use it adds a lot of you know modern
features so kind of like with the lamb
to support in Java 8 and all that stuff
you know x 2x text languages based
language has already come with a lot of
those features so you can do lambdas and
it has you know like type inference and
a lot of other cool stuff and also X
text is built with the Eclipse modeling
framework so that means that it's easy
to hook into like visual design tools so
you can you know so looking at the
component based approach you can kind of
like drag and drop you could build tools
to drag and drop and it'll automatically
generate you know the length or the code
that would represented by that but the
visual model and then you know it makes
it easy to then write that back to disk
and have understandable source code and
as I mentioned you know exposes a Java
API so that means even if you don't want
to use that language you still can
access it from Java code and it's you
know no problem and this is our entirely
this is an example but it's like
completely on its little bit too small
it's on readable so apologize on the
next thing we're talking bout is our
scene editor we have some integration
one to get into the engine a little bit
switch over to yeah that's what's going
to do so yeah with the 3d scene editor
it's a technology that we're working on
which allows you to you know run under
things in 3d explore scenes and and do
things you know so you can design
visually let's see if I can get back
over to the
ok
um
that's where
so what we can do here we can show you
the sea editor which is rendering a 3d
scene and kind of doing like a demo as
it moves around you know this is a live
3d scene and you know we'll talk a
little bit about how it's actually
working but you know it's being render
this isn't some sort of overlay you know
it's actually in the environment and
this allows you to go in and like
manipulate things and you know change
features visually especially its which
is great for designers you know because
you know they like to work visually they
don't like to code usually so makes
things easier
Oh
okay so that's it for the visual are the
senior demo and as we showed also
there's a animation sequence or that
we've written of us a new SWT widget
which is down here now it's it's an SWT
widget like you'd expect you can it's
easy to extend and add new different
types of tracks you can easily add new
renderers and whatnot so if you need to
control something within a nonlinear
fashion it makes it really easy to do
I don't you want to talk or you go
through the engine at all we're going to
do it next next your arm and talk for it
yep um so anyways um the sequencer you
know lets you do like nonlinear editing
it's used for creating different types
of animations and you know things of
that nature so if you need to like make
you know one you know character in your
game move from one point to the other
you can visually you know move them and
it's really extensible and the API is
just like any other SWT widget so we
have another hard to read example of you
know how you use it but if you've used
any other st BTW widget you know it's
pretty similar this may our this problem
we will end up in nebula at some point
if you're familiar with the eclipses
nebula swt library which is like custom
third party controls and things for
eclipse based applications we also have
grids which are essentially spreadsheets
now you might say oh gee you know
spreadsheets that doesn't sound like
video games it sounds like accounting or
something or maybe project management
but you know the reality is video games
are based around a you know a lot of
mathematical models a lot of new numeric
models so it makes sense to be able to
model those in an easy way you know
spreadsheets or what have evolved as you
know great way to do that and so we've
integrated it with our actor system so
you can actually query from the grid so
you can go in and use any you know
formula or anything like that that
you're used to with like Excel or a
spreadsheet and and then you can pull
that into actors really easily with you
know a single query
slag is awful
so you can see here kind of the you know
spreadsheet type of thing going on
I apologize
anybody's getting sick just let us know
I'm talking about transmuter you want
time with the engine okay we also have a
set of extensions for clips that are
it's called transmute and what it is is
an asset pipeline so that way you can
bring in an image into your Eclipse
project and set up different types of
output targets and it'll automatically
you know execute code or you know
transformation on those assets so it
means you can bring in an image and say
gee I want you to generate you know a
file format this small in this format
for a mobile device or you know I want
you to generate another version that's
larger force a like a PC or a game
console or something of that nature and
so it's an extensible it's it's
extensible through the Eclipse plug-in
system so it's really easy to you know
add new features and you know if you
need to edit support for a new file type
or new output type you just kind of you
know right in Eclipse plug-in and it
makes it pretty easy to do and this is
kind of an example of you know like you
know a visual example of how that can be
done or you know what happens so it
doesn't just work on images it can work
operate on 3d models images audio pretty
much anything you know that you need to
process in some fashion you can you can
use trains me to do it
okay and then we're going to go over the
engine now I guess
big
um we've also written an engine that is
written it's you know designed to be
portable so it's designed to work on
mobile it's designed to work on game
consoles PC whatever it's the the core
is written in C++ just for portability
and you know keep it small but you know
we've added capabilities to do java
coding in there so you can actually
embed a JVM you can are in the Jerry and
you can you know write Java code for all
your game logic that's kind of where we
want to go you know use C++ for you know
simpler things that really need a lot of
performance a lot of control over how
memories manage and then use Java for
everything else because it makes
development so much better
um
and so we'll talk about how its put
together it's very modular the C++ parts
very modular it's kind of modeled after
osgi but it's a little bit lighter if
you're not familiar with osgi it's the
open services gateway initiative I don't
even know if that's the acronym anymore
but it's kind of like a lot or a high
level software module system eclipse is
built on it there's a lot of other
software out there that's built on osgi
I mean the great thing is it really like
deep or decouples all the different
components of you know your software so
that way they only talk to each other
through very well-defined interfaces so
you don't add just like huge you know
you know ball of yarn or something that
causes issues we may actually move to
you native osgi in the future which is
something that's currently being
discussed which is you know like Java is
osgi implementation but it's done you
know if native code now one of the
things that's kind of unique about what
we're doing is the engine process itself
runs out of process that means like when
we were looking at the scene editor
earlier doing the demo loop the you know
the engine wasn't actually executed and
running inside of the process with
Eclipse it was running in its own
process and then we were handling
getting the frame buffer and you know
all the displays rendering inside of an
open GL texture through other means now
the reason that we do this is because
you know frankly especially talking
about natives in native code or you know
beta or alpha quality code you're in a
lot of crashes and we you're dealing
with native code you know crashes aren't
an exception against own or something
crashes are like weird things happen
your app disappears you know you have
all kinds of really strange things
happening and so we can't run the in
process with the IDE so you know and
it's kind of it makes sense because you
don't think about it when you launch an
application in Java let's say you know
that's actually running out of process
as well you'd never run that in process
with your IDE but pretty much every game
you want to out there currently except
for what we're doing runs it in process
with the rest of the tooling and this
diagram kind of shows a little bit about
how it's connected in you know we have
you know I PC systems to get the frame
buffer as I mentioned over and also
communicate and send messages back and
forth between the end
so you know when you click the mouse or
you change a setting in the project or
something it handles you know
communicating with the the IDE and like
I mentioned the the engine itself is
very modular so that means that most of
the services don't really know what's
going on with any of the other services
we call services anything that does
something in the engine so you know
something that renders to the screen
something that interfaces with you know
input devices something that talks to
the network something that computes
physics values for you know simulation
or the JVM service that handles you know
running actual you know application game
logic stuff they're all separated you
know from one another and it makes it
easy to like pull one out so that means
you could have like one type of renderer
doing something and then in the future
if you need a different type of renderer
for you know say a different type of
hardware or a new technique so you're
going from different render to you
afford renderer you know things that
nature makes it really easy to swap out
components without issues then over here
we just have like an example of you know
the IPC surface we're using protobuf and
sockets to send you know information
back and forth so that means like when
you click a mouse or you know something
changes that's what it uses to
communicate with the engine and then on
the GPU side you know we can use shared
memory to actually you know copy frame
buffer information or we can use
different types of platform specific
fast paths so say for example your
vendor you know by vendor I mean like
the GPU vendor so like Nvidia or AMD or
intel or someone they can write
extensions to opengl that make it easier
to copy data between processes and if
those are available that those can be
used as well
so this one's should be zoomed in a
little bit this kind of talks about you
know how we actually intend on getting
the project information or your game
project from you know a developed in the
IDE to some sort of device and in this
case you know we have at the top you can
really read it we have game code so we
have code that gets compiled down other
types of metadata game code being jvm
bytecode good i like state it will zoom
in no sorry one second
ouch
lighten the master yeah my mouth side
too sorry one second
anyways here we have kind of an example
of you know how we can get some of the
or how we can compile the game you know
assets down into something that can be
distributed to you know different
devices like say for example an iOS
device not really Java friendly and in
general mobile you know once you have an
optimized java runtime environment
they're they're not always java friendly
so anyway what we can do with this is
compile your java game code ahead of
time link it into the native engine and
then you can distribute that you know on
an app store whatever you don't have to
deal with issues of like being able to
write two pages and things of that
nature you know that you usually can't
do with like a just-in-time type of
approach like Java takes
okay and then we have the theme editor
which is going to go back now
I apologize folks it's my fault
so now one of the things too with this
is you know because we're doing things
on the GPU we can you know it makes it
easy to rithi manned reskin things in
different ways and so one of the things
that we could do like I didn't show us
before I should've oops you know one of
the things we can do and this has a
little bit of a bug in it but you can
kind of see the difference here's kind
of an Android thing and you know it
still works similarly sorry the fonts
are messed up on some of the CTF folders
for some reason but um you know it's
similar you know it just looks a little
bit different and we want people to be
able to customize the interface and
really kind of you know change how the
interface looks and works and in fact
even some of these effects like some of
the rotations and different types of GPU
effects those are you know something
that you can provide with your theme
like new implementations in Java of
those effects and one of the ways that
you can do that and switch back
something that doesn't have weird fonts
um is with a theme editor and that's
what this is and so this is what this
allows us to do or allows you now say a
designer someone to do to go in and and
redesign the interface you know visually
you know because designers again you
know if you would say something like
swing where you know where it's kind of
hard to redo or to create a new look and
feel you know with this we wanted to
change that and make sure that there was
no there was something easy for
designers to just jump into and do and
so what they can do with this is create
a theme file they can go in and create
the artwork it's all SVG again so I mean
it scales to any size so that means it
could work on a Retina display or it
could work on you know lower resolution
like more traditional display and they
can you know it's going to edit things
and like for example this SVG file that
I've opened which is the same one that
were the IDE has you can you know change
the SVG on disk and it will
automatically rerun
in an update everything you can also
visually go in and change different
things so say for example you know this
is one you know you can go in here you
can get the real-time preview in the
theme editor and you can change things
to say like for example in the button up
state you know if I move this down a
little bit now it's overlapping so you
can see it automatically updated in the
key better so it's easy for designers to
go on and visually you know create their
themes and really make a unique
environment or it make it a unique
experience for you know their purposes
I don't need to go back to that one okay
um so I guess now we can you know if
anyone has any questions or anything um
well I mean it's java bytecode I'm it's
actually not too bad you know compared
to like say handwritten java code I mean
it's not going to be that you know maybe
not as good as that but it's still not
you know awful so for most game purposes
really you could even get away with
using like zero Jake JVM or something of
that nature because game code I mean it
depends what you're doing but most of
time game code isn't like the most
expensive most critical you know part of
your application so yep
note running oh yeah the engine and it's
displaying our presentation and then we
have rendered out a process the IDE
which is also projected into the scene
which is on the computer that you got
six slide in and out of this whole
presentation oh yeah its core stuff yep
yeah this is actually three separate
programs that are running so there's
actually that our main engine the IDE
and then there's the engine since that's
opening the scene editor they just
wonder if you had to get sick every time
you use the IDE it doesn't do that it
doesn't spin around and not maybe a
little bit
yep you know actually do one of the
slides that wasn't showing up that
talked a little bit about our maven
plugin which I guess I should go over
we've extended maven so that it
understands our engine and so and it's
also integrated with C make so what
happened I know if you're familiar with
C makes he makes a really awesome you
know native code kind of like multiplex
or kind of thing anyway so what Maybin
does is it understands our engine
components like i'll talk about engine
services understands the engine core and
it knows about the different
architectures as well so you've maven
build profiles and so what we can do is
you know we you can create a new runtime
project which is what we call like a
core you know like engine coil you're
talking about and you can say okay I
want these services you know these
components are required in my maven pom
and it'll go out and fetch those for you
know you're given target of build play
or profile and then you know compile
everything down so that way it's really
easy if you that as long as you
artifacts exist for your platforms to
say you you know you depend on some
renderer and there's only like a windows
build of its AIT's direct3d or something
then obviously that won't work on you
know mobile platform or something but
yeah so anyway with maybe we've made it
much easier we kind of were inspired by
Eclipse Tycho or sonatype Tycho we've
heard of that it basically makes it easy
to build eclipse you know products it
really changed for me you know building
anything with eclipse because it makes
it so much easier and so we decided to
go the same route with our engine tools
and other nice thing is it integrates
well between C++ and Java so when we
compile something we could have what one
you know maybe an artifact that's
actually a native component and then you
know a couple of Java ones like we do
with Java so say you know the Java
bindings the native bindings from the
engine to the Java code that stuff's all
on the same you know projects and when
you build the Java functionality it
actually compiles the native code sets
up the library compiles the java code
packages everything up and makes it
available for the engine
right now right now we are supporting
mac linux and windows and an android but
we're going to be supporting iOS pretty
soon and really want to support as many
you know different platforms as we can
at least all the important ones you know
we're looking at blackberry and Windows
Phone and some of the other platforms
but right now or just look at the heavy
hitters we're just a small company so as
far as the IDE though it's just really
the big throw yeah I'm sorry I should
say it I meant when I was speaking
earlier I was talking about the output
targets the IDE is only supported on
windows mac and linux right now linux is
probably best support it because that's
I prefer today's book it works
everywhere what's that um it scales it
depends on how you configure it you know
like the core is pretty small it'll run
on mobile or anything but the larger
components you know it depends on what
you're doing like if you have like less
support you know it's a little bit less
resource intensive than like the Fulani
opengl desktop and so forth so it kind
of depends on what your runtime
configuration is but i mean it can be
stripped down pretty easily so
well and um in this case the render
right now I mean I know that was just
kind of an example but um yeah i mean
it's it's more or less just like the
bigger monolithic engine components you
know or not monolithic but um the larger
engine components it's not you know when
you started getting into the smaller
software components is more or less just
using whatever the language and platform
support you know as far as modularizing
things making it you know kind of
separated so um this is Kepler right now
you know we do integration and stuff
with with newer versions as they come
out but that's what we're working on
right now they take over display again I
think my computer went to sleep actually
not currently I mean it's something that
as we because we're still you know
working on getting a lot of the base
components done and everything but you
know as we start working more on you
know more like design specific things
you know like things like that like a
narrative type of things I assume that's
what you mean
right right that's for sure one of our
goals with blame you really wanted to
bridge the gap between like designers
and developers I myself and come from an
art background and so I'm kind of more
of a designer and we found the need for
some of these tools in working together
on game projects and so we for sure want
and that's why we're the actors language
comes from is making it a lot easier
when you could just go ahead and write
your whole game in java but the actor
language makes it a little bit easier
for someone who isn't as advanced to be
able to quickly get in and get out you
know and and write some logic so we're
looking at adding as many tools as well
as we can well maybe not that but we
really want to make the experience for
designers very fast and that's also
going to make for developers game
concept in very quick to because you
don't have to get in to doing all the
little nitty-gritty work if you have a
wizard that's going to get you halfway
there you know yeah and because the
clips is so extensible you know it's
that's a great thing is you know we
built on top of that so you can add new
features and it's you know fairly
understood you could buy books on you
know how to do things that nature is not
some kind of art that you have to like
learn from someone or something you know
sure no yeah nope we're hoping for like
end of the year early next year to have
like initial release we're getting there
we're working on it yeah it's kind of
like now the tools are kind of a dog
fooding thing you know so we're like
working on the game stuff with the the
game it was were originated actually
what's that yep exactly the game you see
on on the website pixel Annie's was our
first endeavor there as leet and through
it we discovered that we needed a better
set of tools than what we had a small
company and so that's what really
brought us to bring or to build blink
bring bling yeah so that's that's why
that's up there and you it's been up
there for a little while because we've
kind of been both of us work day jobs
this is our we're trying to start up you
know and stuff and so that's kind of
where that's been left so we can have
time to work on the tools is that fixed
Alliance is not finished yet
yeah I mean it's going to be something I
guess it depends on what you're doing
it's like with physics Rex are using
bullet and we've learned a service you
know that uses bullet and bullets pretty
configurable but you could easily grab a
different physics library something as
well i'm going to plug in so it's very
tweakable just because you know it's a
really mature library it's been using
commercial games but at the same time
you know it's entirely replaceable as
well
any more questions all right all right
well I don't know if you can put it up
there but our website right now is a
leet labs com that's not l33t it sleet
for anyone who is having trouble with
that one blink VG is not up yet but it
will be within a week we that was our
goal before this but we had a lot more
stuff with that was on her plate before
have you said we're a start-up so we get
as much time as we can but sometimes
that's not enough so yeah I guess that's
it thank you guys for your time feel
free to catch us after if and you guys
have any questions we'd love to talk to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
