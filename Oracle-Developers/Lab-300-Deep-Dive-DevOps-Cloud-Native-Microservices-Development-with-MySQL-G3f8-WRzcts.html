devops cloud native micro services with
my sequel hands-on lab in lab 300 and
we're gonna assume the percent of Roman
boys and we're going to access my sequel
build a node application that will query
the product catalog and expose a product
catalog as rest services Roland's first
task will be to go out and drag feature
three into the in progress swim lane on
the page so we can get started that way
Lisa Jones will know he's working on it
at the moment and next he'll go up to
the project tab at the top and we're
gonna run a create a new repository for
his code so we'll click on new
repository here will give the repository
a name and then we're going to give you
a location of his code and github now to
save time so you don't have to write all
this code we've kind of written it for
you you're welcome to check it out in
more detail but right now we're just
going to import it into the project and
show you how it all wires together with
the rest services that have already been
done there's a look at our code itself
and next we're gonna go ahead and create
a new build job so we'll give it a name
the Alpha my sequel rest build this time
we don't have to set the JDK instead we
can go directly to source control and
choose git will select the repository
that we just created for the my sequel
rest that git repository under the
triggers tab we'll want to trigger based
on SCM polling next we're gonna want to
go to our build steps this time we're
gonna want to choose to execute a shell
script and we're gonna put an NPM
install command out there as our build
step and post built or when I want to
archive the artifacts including all the
target now we can hit save up at the top
and go ahead and build this at the
moment
now for the sake of time I did fast for
the video there that'll take a minute or
two but this is what it looks it looks
like at the end of the day once your
build completes next we're gonna create
a new deployment configuration so we'll
go to our deployment tab and click new
configuration go ahead and get our
naming right and we'll call it the
deploy my sequel rest service and the
application name will be the Alpha
office my sequel rest service we're
gonna select a deployment target and in
this case we've created this connection
before in our last lab so we'll go ahead
and just select it enter the password
and test the connection we're gonna
select node as the container we wanted
to deploy to we're gonna choose
automatic deploy and we're gonna select
the job that we just created from the
LOV the last thing we want to do is
include an ACS deployment profile and
this will just simply set the size of
the container we're going to keep this
relatively small for the sake of time
today one Giga memory total for the
application all right now we're ready to
start our deployment process and once
again this will take a few minutes but
for the sake of time I did speed it up
and when it gets done this is what it'll
look like what we'd hope for you to do
is go in and click on the title there
it'll take you out to the web page and
all we have to do to see the rest
services for the product collateral
catalog would be to put a slash products
this is a kit get rest service or return
everything and if you wanted to filter
based on a specific product you could
simply put slash product and then the
product number like one two one ten
twenty that would bring back just the
information for that one product
with our rest services deployed we're
gonna want to go back to our agile board
and Mark this feature creation as
complete so we'll take the feature three
and drag it to our completed swimlane
click Next till it how much time we
spent to create it and click OK and that
feature is now complete we can see our
progress by going up to the reports tab
and looking at the burndown report all
right now one of the things that may be
of interest is to see my sequel under
the cover so if you want to you can go
back out to your dashboard we pre
created this as part of the lab setup to
save you some time but you can mouse
down to the my sequel cloud service over
here on the left hand menu and if you
wanted to check out way this was created
you can click on the alpha office DB my
sequel database and see that we have one
node one oh CPU 7.5 gig of ram and 125
gig of storage to store the product
catalog itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
