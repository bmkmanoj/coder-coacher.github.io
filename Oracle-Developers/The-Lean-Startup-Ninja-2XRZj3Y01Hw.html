experience of of our start up on the
past 18 months they have been somewhat
ups and downs shall we say startups have
ups and downs what's up though the
people that are in startups it's all
been completely plain sailing right
everything's been great there have been
absolutely no problems right am i right
yeah the other thing yeah pretty much
that a little bit like being a parent I
think I think parents always tell you
how wonderful it is to be a parent and
they sort of this sort of cabal where
they don't tell you about all the awful
sleepless nights and and their children
running around trying to kill themselves
so who wants to be a ninja yeah pretty
much everyone that's cool now is it
quite worrying that everyone knows who
these guys are yeah I think we're
showing that vintage we are showing a
vintage right so who are we my name is
Martine I'm the CTO of Jay clarity I do
talks which generally wind people up
especially Oracle and we do a lot of
community stuff so at the bottom there's
two links which we really really hope
you guys get involved with it's about
having Java standards going forwards
being partly dictated by what you guys
and girls actually woman I should say
actually want write Java nine is two
years out Java e eight is two years out
the next edition of java mobile is about
two years out now is the time to get
involved follow that believe we're gonna
be bugging you guys a lot to get
involved with this stuff yeah because
we're starting to see some great payback
from from adopt i'm ben evans for those
of you they don't know me we've done a
bunch of stuff but the most important
thing here is to adopt yeah so so follow
those links come and see us come and
take part we need your help yeah so we
thought during this talk would be quite
interesting because we had to go deep
dive tech for our startup so we kind of
came away ourselves a little bit from
the boring java enterprise will love you
know spring hibernate xml JMS messaging
back to spring Decter soap back to an ex
illogic server back to an enterprise
service bus that got some more soap and
it's all just a bit said i think you
just put our entire audience to sleep
that sounds like day job right hands up
if that sounds like your day job yeah
for
so boring boy boring as net list of
technologies up their way cooler look at
it a jab don't suppose to work on these
technologies instead yeah way more fun
yeah right so what we're going to cover
kind of three broad areas we're going to
talk about how we sort of applied lean
and agile principles to make our startup
go really really fast with limited
resources the ninja part is kind of it's
a bit of an in-joke really lots of
people talk about ninjas and rock stars
please please don't use those
terminology seriously if you have if you
hire ninjas and rock stars what you end
up with is dead bodies and smash guitars
yeah that's that's really not good so
yeah heck and uses one of those places
where that quite often likes to
celebrate the ninjas and the rock stars
and we think it's a bunch of nonsense of
course it is and if your people aren't
already reading there's a lady called
Shanley Kane who does great stuff about
about startup culture and particular
latest post about the myth of the 10x
programmer came out just yesterday it
completely drives with you know with
what we will talk about though is that
was an absolute gift Thank You Shanley
yeah it's a great great debunking post
and then we're going to talk a little
bit about the technology we dived into
with some report cards on some of this
cool hipster bleeding edge tick yeah so
yeah sorry Trish already we're going to
be apologizing to Trish a lot today I'm
going to talk a little bit about the
culture or the culture at least of our
startup and other startups we've seen
especially in the London tech scene just
as a little bit of background we do come
from from London ourselves there is a
massive startup tech scene happening
there it's all based around an area
called the silicon roundabout because
you know we have to copy what's going on
over here and there's probably about
three thousand small tech startups in
the space of what two or three square
miles less than that lesson that show it
is absolutely buzzing over there at the
moment and so we've seen a lot of what's
been going on and so what that means is
we have vampires and sharks oh I'm sorry
vc's and lawyers that's a it's like
almost like a feeding frenzy it is like
a feeding frenzy yes okay but for those
of you that let that work in startups
you know you're obviously very well
aware that life is like this this is
what working in a start-up is like isn't
it who hears on a start-up in just
parties every night yeah one guy he's it
is any wonder how much visa I'm a
programmer do we have any programmers in
the house today Trish yes of course
you've caused your regular see huh so
too much yeah too much VC money equals
too much of this and i'm not actually
building business yeah so how can use
will tell you this don't believe the
hype so the reality is you know as i
hope we all know that most startups
actually fail inside the first 12 months
does anyone know what the status and one
hands up okay it's seven out of eight
seven out of eight startups fail in the
first 12 months okay so that's kind of
like the crashing halt you know it's you
know you're not out of fabric every
night what you're actually doing this
point is trying something which is
extremely risky and yes you know we
celebrate our poster children we
celebrate the instagrams and the ubers
etc etc but yeah the reality is most
startups fail and fail pretty badly
right and with all the celebration you
read in heck and use and in the tech
media there is also a lot of people who
have actually you know suffered quite
badly lost all their savings etc etc so
you cannot enter this thing to lately ok
so again don't believe the hype we
ourselves are now up and running for 18
months which means we've just beaten the
first level of statistics and we're
going to get work very very hard to
build to beat the next level so let's
talk about some of the things that we
think we've done with you know that
there is don't you know hopefully we're
going to tell you only truth today up
here we're not going to not going to lie
about some of the things that we did
wrong and some of the places we failed
but but also we want to talk about some
of things that we think that we did well
I just found that we're also being
recorded today so I hope our investors
don't have a sefer storm hahaha we're
gonna be in trouble so the first thing
that everyone should go and see is just
particular right this link down it is
absolutely amazingly awesome it is cool
not safe for work in the slightest to
dislike in other ways like it's called
the it is actually a talk called the
Lean Startup ninja talk as a cartoon
parody and it explains an awful lot of
what is going on in Silicon Valley
especially in the past five years and
what to avoid so everyone second the
photo of that I love people used to
write that down but everyone does get
civ
pick up the ipad player critically
village of what's on the screen that's
cool basic okay so I leaned in their job
in why do we do this okay well i mean
i'm actually at this point this is this
is normally the point where i embarrass
or shame Martain but hands up if you've
if you've done lots of outdoor stuff or
you wanna clear the principles okay who
can tell me what the one guiding
principle of agile is come on someone's
gonna feeling brave yeah okay so we had
this almost enserio yeah so it the
principle which is kind of analyzed both
of the things that you guys both said is
if it hurts do it more often okay
everyone knows that hands that prepared
that principle before yeah okay so what
does it mean why does why why is it
important why is it a thing okay anyone
anyone want to take a stab more
efficient but but why what is it about
that principle sure I mean that's true
it's about it's very efficiency but the
thing that it really is is that when we
talk about if something hurts do it more
often what we mean is the thing that is
hurting has a nonlinear effect it can
interact with itself and it produces you
know interactions over time which
increase the pain so by doing it more
often you your constraining the scope of
it too cause nonlinear effects you know
integration is hard we don't like
integrating because if you wait two
weeks to integrate with your your team
member you have all of this stuff that
you have to integrate so what's
happening is the scope of the changes
become nonlinear but if you're
integrating every few hours it never
becomes a problem the same the testing
the same with every other agile
principle you can find it's this which
underlies all of them so that's why lean
and agile is important I think yeah and
the person that told me that taught me
that if this guy seeing him operate a
team and seeing him produce know what I
can only describe as you know an OCD
level of attention to technical debt
Dutch
can't help it as part of a culture you
get brought up that way so and that's
that's what I think you know why lean
and agile principles work so well for
startups is if you can control the
technical debt you can control this
nonlinear things and make sure that you
embed that in your culture as you go
along I would say that was one of the
things we definitely got right yeah and
it does apply to enterprises as well
okay you can certainly apply all these
principles of doing the hard thing often
inside ginge price and typically today
that means deployment I bit you whoever
here is in an enterprise shop probably
writes a 15-page word document hands it
over to the operation stuff three weeks
later he gets handed back because it was
to spelling mistakes so on and so forth
an absolute has anyone has ever heard
this thing we are an agile shop but
because we're an enterprise we just need
to do some planning up front who said
that come on don't be shy here next year
you know we only look specifically at it
we're doing recorded values most of
these enterprises you know they want to
do the right thing but that's that's
what you end up with its agile just plan
everything first ok so we apply lean and
agile especially to startups because of
this this very reason right who here
thinks they have got an awesome idea
which is going to change the world may
be shy all the people who are in
startups what the hell are you doing if
you don't think you've got a world
changing idea seriously right so
everybody has an idea every human being
has a capacity for a willed beating will
changing idea the only problem is your
idea kind of sucks right so people
always happen about the idea and
especially we found in the London tech
startup scene that people are precious
about their ideas they'll hide them
they'll try get you to sign NDA's they
won't talk about me public okay but
you're not the real the real truth is ok
all of you right now I'm sign my NDA ok
here's what my NDA is ok I am a
professional so EU I'm perfectly
prepared talk to about anything which
I'm working on ok on one condition we
talk about it we work together that's
fine if you break my trust we never work
together ever again and I tell everybody
what you did right this is a small tech
scene
alright and that is really the only NDA
that you actually need because there is
the world of difference between an idea
and delivery yeah and you'll be told
that time and time again if you do get
involved in a start-up in particular you
will not be the only person with that
idea you'll have five or six competitors
starting up after you within weeks
because your idea will get out but but
not only that you will find that the
strangest things happen okay I'm looking
I'm not going to name the company in
question but this was an actual real
startup that someone told me about just
a few weeks ago and and when I say I
started what I mean is they have VC
money so it's excel on the web that was
it that was the startup liked it and
they got funded for that crazy crazy
stuff so where you actually end up as a
startup especially when you think you've
got this great idea up front is that
your idea is going to transition and
transition really really quick so we
came up with our original idea 18 months
ago two years ago and we thought we had
it nailed we wrote up a business plan
yes one way women start ability have a
business plan what a waste of time it
was so we've changed our product at
least two or three times we'd actually
moved markets two or three times
according to customer demand and what
crazy customers actually end up doing
with our products which we never
expected so the famous quote that a guy
we know bill Hewitt from collide oh he
spoke at MIT recently and talked about
their sort of startup graduate class
because I hands up everyone here who's
got a startup idea and they're all like
enthusiastically waving her hands up
who's written their three-month business
plan their three a business plan and
they're like well waving up their hands
and is easily like take out a lighter
and burn it right because nothing
survives contact with the enemy and you
are going to change you're going to
shift markets and you have to be
prepared to do that and that's again why
lean and agile principles are so
absolutely vital because you're stuck in
the waterfall methodology if you're
stuck with old legacy technology you
can't shift and you will die
so don't make my eyes bleed as anyone
has anyone read this read this post
about about how your visit business plan
should be structured when you make one
because the next best thing to not
having a business plan is having one
which is like a page long and if you
haven't read this post and you're
involved in a start-up where you want to
be involved in a start-up go and do say
so there's an example for us who is our
target market so our target market is
poor old bob sitting in the operations
room who doesn't know anything about
Java and that stupid crappy java
application keeps destroying his linux
box and he is very very angry wants to
uninstall Java when he then goes to talk
to Java developers they say no it's not
the job or it's something else and the
fight continues that's who our person is
right why why would they use our product
because we tell them in plain english
and then language that both him and the
Java developers can use of what the
problem actually really is and most
important thing which any financial
person will ask you is how on earth are
you going to take their money and we
have an online sales channel right you
can go to our website grab it pay for it
and you're done so the lean and agile
principles that really have helped us in
the past 18 months stay flexible move
markets move products so who doesn't
stand up wow that is mess of Lee change
from our again that's very good how many
people feel their stand ups are actually
the way that agile stand ups are
supposed to be done okay that's what I'm
talking about so who thinks that
actually the stand-ups go on for maybe
30 minutes maybe an hour reach morning
and it's such okay yeah yeah that's the
morning meeting what you see the breeze
to do those used to do those night of
the 90s days back in the nineties yeah
retrospective czar also a wonderful
wonderful thing we tend to be pretty
brutally honest with each other in our
retrospectives @j clarity sometimes it's
a little bit hurtful but it does right
the ship very quickly you know nothing
goes unspoken for longer than a week
even if people are feeling upset with
each other or they really feel strongly
about a technical decision but but at
the same time one of the other things
which we doing alright respecters which
i think is really important is we have
them so we did them at four-thirty on a
friday afternoon and then you know the
end of the meeting we have beer we
actually have the concept of punishment
beer
so so we have we have terrible awful
bear and the person that screwed up the
most badly that week has to drink the
punishment bit which is more than often
me and this is important because it
sends the message that mistakes are
going to happen and mistakes are going
to continue to happen mistakes are going
to happen every single week that your
startup is in existence okay and it is
not the end of the world and almost all
circumstances yeah you have to have a
culture of failure is okay no one wants
to fail no one wants to have to drink
the punishment beer but at the end of
the day it's just some bitter medicine
for this week and then you move on yeah
the other answering short up with the
question was what can you have an
example of what you're able to achieve
within a one-week sprint now I was
always very skeptical about the concept
of a 10x engineer and then I met this
guy if you really want a culture where
people are an order of magnitude more
productive the first thing that you need
to realize is that it's not necessarily
great it's not just about town yes
talent is necessary but the culture and
supporting systems that need to go
around that in order to genuinely
produce those repeatable results without
people burning out without terrible
things happening are very delicate and
you need to spend a lot of time and a
lot of effort thinking about the culture
so what can we achieve in a week we can
achieve a hell of a lot in a week mostly
because of him yeah you'd be spry so we
focus a lot on automation at the start
of a week in particular so if there is
any any barrier to us running tests
running continuous integration being
able to deploy instantly to production
that is what we tackle first we remove
all the barriers away from our engineers
they can code as quickly as possible and
technical debt detect the reduction of
technical debt is is you know it's
something that we're all obsessive about
yep I you reduce the technical debt down
to zero that is ultimately the dragon on
on development yet we have incredibly
short sharp design sessions usually
lasting no more than about 10 or 15
minutes on the whiteboard we have a very
quick discussion around that we allow
people to prototype often ok because
coding the final product the final piece
of work for that week it's the easy bit
it's just typing okay
it's a thinking about the problem it's a
prototyping maybe a new protocol or a
quick new idea that's actually where all
the time gets spent typically so we
always go for vertical slices so all the
way from a data store all the way up to
a UI so there's always something for a
customer to look at to play with and we
typically prototype even up to sixty
percent of the week and then deliver the
beast a piece of real production
functionality right towards the end the
job of the programmer is not to type
okay hands up your an environment where
your management think your job is to
type okay hands up if you'd like to if
you'd like to say that we don't feel
brave enough okay because too many
organizations especially too many large
organizations think that programmers
type we don't type we think and that's
what we should be spending the majority
of our time doing and but I don't see
the sting ship between the two the
question was do you have any any time
for architectural discussions I don't
see the distinction between
architectural discussions and
prototyping if you think that there's a
distinction I'd like to understand that
better we basically we prototype our
architectures as I think no
oh I see okay so so far larger
enterprise architectures okay that's an
interesting distinction yes yeah so my
argument has always been and there's a
fantastic website called coding the
architecture a guy called Simon Brown he
talks about even within the enterprise
all architects should be developers and
all developers should be Arctic's and
architecture should be built
collaboratively and not driven from top
down because you cannot tell someone how
to build something if you're not going
to go build it yourself that's just my
opinion so some failures because this is
this is this is different gonna be a bit
of a fail talk as well one of the huge
mistakes we made up front is that we
didn't validate our products against
real end users quickly enough right we
spent a lot of time in the lab during
R&amp;amp;D building up a really cool tool and
then after a quite a number of months
which is really anti edge are right we
actually started throwing it at real
customers and actually we only quite
literally only have ourselves to blame
with this because our first fact before
that we went out and delivered to market
we delivered that tactical product
because people wanted it yeah so we
literally have no excuse for this right
we know that you should respond to user
demand know that we should we should
have got stuff out there early and we
just didn't do it and that's that's a
very much fell in our part yeah yeah the
other key thing we learnt a question so
the question is how good does your
product have to be before you can send
it out I'm we're gonna talk about that a
little bit later we call it the Minimum
Viable Product and there are different
different definitions convenient
depending on who you are if you're a
cold-hearted capitalist as soon as
someone is willing to pay for it and
that's pretty much what you need to be
in a start-up actually yep so day one
you know drive revenue you know you can
hear this again in the game revenue
revenue revenue everyone's seen the
Steve Ballmer video about developers
developers developers well if you're
really a startup its revenue revenue
revenue yeah and don't let anyone tell
you otherwise because a lot of us here
are engineers and we've got we often can
come up with really cool ideas and given
today's technology and the right
methodologies you can actually build
those ideas and or something real quite
quickly i would say out of all the
startups i've seen in london
a vast majority of the seven out of
seven out of eight that Ben's a fail
fail because of some sort of business or
sales and marketing reason the
technology is usually good or good
enough the idea is usually good or good
enough they just can't get the damn
thing out the door and into the
marketplace or they don't understand
their marketplace or they have no
interest in revenue I mean I I saw a
business plan from the start up last
week and their business plan was get
bought by google that was it that was
that whole thing it's like you know we
don't care about the users all the
revenue or anything else just get to the
point where someone who's going to buy
us probably google it wasn't instagram
for pizza king was it oh god this is a
standard enjoyed that we have in the
company right that when you see a
start-up which is just you know a me-too
thing its instagram for dogs or and
believe me I've seen three or four of
these just in just the last six months
isn't so the other thing we talked about
a lot is cargo cults so can everyone see
what this is I actually not sure right
so can everyone see the system this
thing here can we see what that is it's
it's a bamboo aeroplane okay so cargo
cults for those people who don't know
about them are a thing which happened in
the South Pacific after the Second World
War so the Marines came in they took
over the island you know they had the
planes landed all this cool stuff came
they gave loads of it away to the local
people that lived on the islands and
second world war ended and the Marines
left but the people there on the islands
were like that was kind of cool planes
landed we got stuff so let's make the
planes land again so they did things
like they've built bamboo control towers
and you get and twenty years later
anthropologist came and found their guys
with like coconut shells over their ears
because they'd seen people with ear
defenders doing this to make the planes
land but the planes don't ground so the
point about a cargo cult is that it's
where you you have the outward
appearance of doing something but you
don't really understand what's going on
and you don't really understand how to
get the outputs you genuinely want and
so when that happens you end up with a
bamboo airplane so you are not your
users
we here are all developers we are all
people that deal day to day with
technology and for most of us we have
this horrendous tendency towards
cognitive biases to think that our users
think like we do and want the same
things that we do and that is generally
not true yeah no definitely not not
invented here is also a very popular
mean that goes on especially in startups
or if your google em and what you will
actually end up with is this the street
will find its own uses for things
everyone here presumably has read
William Gibson and we actually found
this so when we when we started we
thought we were going to be monitoring
production processes and then it turned
out that actually we're where a lot of
people want to users is in QA they don't
they don't want to monitor production
because what they want to do is they
want to use us to find problems before
they ever get near a live customer and
it turns out that actually our biggest
value for our product is indeed risking
go lives yeah so we're talking about not
inventing here we try to avoid this all
at all costs maven and Mongo have made
this a little bit difficult who likes
maven okay who feels that they have
Stockholm Syndrome where maven is
concerned yeah the rest of the room
who's been forced to pitch maven or
write their own plugin or circumnavigate
it somehow yeah we thought so right on
to the next Nick stage so perhaps it
would be being a ninja so this is where
we talk about some of the kind of
practical more technical tooling things
we've done to be really really fast now
start up with very few people basically
right because unfortunately the biggest
expense any startup heads and you'll
hear this term called run rates that the
biggest impact on your run rate is
always your people your staff right
there by a far and away the most
expensive expensive thing in your
operation and for anyone who's going to
be running a sortable is going to be
taking part of it track what you'll
start actually spend time on God site
yourself a really really expensive so if
they are spending time doing something
which they shouldn't be throw money at
it is often the way to solve that
problem yeah so the big big thing that
really changed things for us is automate
Shin it changes everything right as soon
as you see any of your engineers or
yourself doing the same thing three
times you need to go and automate that
ok it has become a major blocker not to
you necessarily technically but actually
to your entire organization ok because
it slows everything down so at this
point about pets versus livestock
because anyone heard the expression pets
versus livestock before ok Wow nobody ok
interesting there must be a UK thing it
must be educating and so pets versus
livestock is the idea that you know you
shouldn't handcraft your service the
idea of you know an artisanal server is
is totally bogus like your server should
not be pets they should be the livestock
you should be able to you know shoot one
in the head and then roll out another
one utterly trivially who hear names
their servers so I haven't meet you I'm
literally vegans of your names your
servers all the production services
named ok so you still have pits right
when you don't happen like livestock do
not have noms that's definitely a new
zealand farming thing as well so we
talked about automation you need some
skills you need no chef skills who
follows the other the devops borat
account anyone ok so you know that you
know that the essence of DevOps is
developers running ruby code in
production as root yep welcome to the
brave new world quite seriously though
that the skill set is quite orthogonal
to the average skill set of a Java
developer Alyssa a day to day enterprise
Java developer especially it is not easy
to pick the skill set up it is a mistake
so you only let one person in your team
do this right everybody needs to learn
to do this as part of their job because
having only one one person or a small
team that that's responsible for this
leads immediately to the antiparticle
throw it over the wall ok and i would i
would actually go further than this i
would say what you actually want to do
is to have the same process for
deploying to development ultra uat and
to production the only thing we should
change is a single parameter about where
you're pushing team and because what
that does is it then means because
people do at dev dev ops right so your
development over here and operations
over here in general I have seen the
operations people generally pick up bits
and pieces of development as they have
to so it's a mistake to think that it's
about bringing everybody at the same
point the operations people actually
normally are you know good ones they
want to come over here towards
development so it's about embedding I
would say more of the operational
practices into development than it is
vice versa in a practical tip on how you
can start with yourself when your team
is don't go and do this alone if you're
not familiar you know with being a
system administrator for a Linux system
or configuring IP tables for your
network that sort of thing go and sit
down with your ops team or your system
administrators or some colleagues that
you know who do know this stuff and
start picking it up right it's really
vital in today's world especially as you
build out more distributed systems and
things you need to know what your
application is actually running on and
how its configured otherwise you're just
going to build something really badly we
also talked about first-class citizens
everything you do technically in your
organization should be treated as a
first class citizen okay never ever ever
make a manual change to a box
configuration ever if you if you need to
change your configuration on a box you
make the change in the repository you
save it to a cm you push it you rebuild
the system because I don't see why
because you know what happens if you
make the manual change to a box you
forget about it humans are fallible and
then you redeploy that change is lost
and then you have an outpatient what did
that cost to your the last night you
were looking at last bank I worked there
had an outage which costs and three
million pounds every 24 hours because of
our manual configuration change that
person was no longer with the bank of
the following morning but when we talk
about tech as a first class citizen we
mean your website your customer
relationship management system even your
payroll everything you choose because
remember you're only as strong as your
weakest link so if you have a really
poor piece of billing software at the
heart of your startup and you can't
build your customers that's going to
kill you you might have the best product
in the world doesn't matter so we talked
a little bit earlier about technical
debt this absolutely kills organizations
does anyone remember Netscape Navigator
valuable lesson learnt there we could go
on and on and on but basically those
those so-called will leading products
just crumbled under their own weight
they weren't tied it up as as people
went along it's incredibly dangerous we
used to have a strict policy of 111
sprint every month would be purely focus
on technical debt we found that will
just end up forgetting what the problem
was after about three weeks so now we
just kind of go as we go along boy
scouting it's called ordeal scouting you
need to pick the right technology and
we've done this a bunch of times with
all the various little bits of
technology we've picked but little you
know take this with a grain of salt
because when you're researching
technologies which you don't know you
may have biases and viewpoints on them
which aren't actually born out when you
actually have experience with them and
you have unsuspected consequences as
will go into short mission yes come
Thursday what has everyone seen this and
this talk by Matt rival where he talks
about web frameworks I mean it's a
couple years old now but I mean the
principles behind it are still
absolutely golden you know you you you
you you have waiting's which you apply
to to your criteria so what do I want
this technology to do then you take a
bunch of things which seems work in the
space and you prototype as much as you
can yep so it's going to example here
I've met during one of his JV and web
framework comparisons this is about two
years ago I think so he's got things
like developer productivity what the job
trends are so you have both technical
and non-technical criteria right it's
really really important the degree of
risk does it have books published on the
topic that sort of thing you have some
weightings applied add up all the
numbers and generally speaking you try
and pick the top two and prototype them
at the very least at least the top 20 I
would say and the other thing about this
is that when you're when you're doing
this and the way that we've been very
successful to use this methodology is to
have the developers provide the numbers
put for how they score against the
criteria but we keep the right the
weighting secret and so we have only
management apply the waiting's after the
event so that way you avoid confirmation
bias next important lesson we learnt was
about usability so people are really
sport today right everyone's used to
either a samsung galaxy type interface
or a lovely iOS interface and everything
around us is getting much easier and
nicer and simple
to use right you expects to eppel has
just become something that people expect
right I don't know how many of you are
building really cruddy enterprise kind
of web apps which we've got default drop
downs and and just are really ugly to
use well unfortunately business people
don't want that anymore they want the
shiny and it's strange I mean it's
basically when I started working in
finance that's the people used to be
excited about coming to work because all
the cool tech were really shiny stuff
was at work and over the course of five
or six years that completely changed all
of a sudden you know with google and
apple and all the things which came out
people had better technology at home so
yeah we somehow you know the curve
changed and thing you know thinking
things are in the enterprise space
really starts to fall behind but as a
start-up you know we have to look like
shiny consumer tech we have no because
that's what people expect and that's
that's the state the world now yeah
running usability labs is absolutely
vital any usability expert will tell you
this they want to see the user in their
home environment and they want to see
that user using your product in their
home environment and only through that
can they really accurately gauge how
your products used and how it should be
altered how many people actually run
formal usability labs okay yeah that's
quite a few things okay yeah there's a
great book on this don't make me think
by Steve crew he's mostly talking about
web usability but but actually the meat
of it which is about actually analyzing
user behavior is extremely important for
anyone's building up you know and end
use of all right so we're going to the
third section now which is kind of the
the more specific lessons we've learned
in the past 18 months from our startup
life we're talking about the Minimum
Viable Product being a business for the
first time sort of culture we had to put
together the vultures the vampires and
the Sharks otherwise known as lawyers
and angels and VCs and of course some
technology because of course we are
actually at a technology conference here
so minimum viable product here are the
three definitions we have coldharbour
Kepler's give us money now how can use
look what I bashed up over the weekends
the perfectionist please don't ever do
this if you're a startup because your
competitors will beat you to the market
the ideal scenario is that you're
getting money for it and people don't
completely slam you on day one and kill
you as bad press well I think I think
the color of catalyst is always a good
one because if the answer is if there's
money in it sure let's carry on talking
about it yeah absolutely being a
business so one of the things we had to
learn very early on is that we're not
necessarily business experts right both
Ben and I've had some experience and
either running sort of business
departments or large departments that
sort of thing but it's still very very
different to genuinely running a
complete business and the truth of the
matter is is there are no right answers
now there's lots of wrong ones oh
absolutely to say that there is there
are no such things as right answers
doesn't imply that there aren't wrong
answers there are lots and lots of
romances all you need to do is to find
something which is satisfiable yeah and
again we as engineers love to focus on
technology we love to focus on our
product we have to build a shiny website
we don't care about the back office
stuff so much right I'm rich the
technology is very rarely the problem
the technology is very really the
problem and the reason why the role of
the the chief operating officer is
actually so important and companies like
Apple like Google like any any one of a
significant size and scale is they
ensure that things like administration
back office and how the organization
runs is not your bottleneck oh sorry
back up so but this this bottom point is
is I think you know probably that
actually this this bottom point should
be to be higher up this is definitely
most important point on the slide
because being a start-up is one of these
strange things where you have this
vision which you live eat breathe sleep
it's your thing but at the same time you
are small enough and nimble enough that
you can change it so it represents both
a constancy and a thing which is
absolutely essential to the life of the
business but yet at the same time it can
be very easily changed and it's okay to
do that when it's the right
circumstances so we talk about the
culture the culture of startups so at
all very massively from whether you're a
startup in Estonia and Thailand in
London and the valley here with your
spread out across sub-saharan Africa
all sorts of different reasons so no
startup team is like despite again what
perhaps Silicon Valley might might tell
you and the big real difference to start
off with is usually remote versus local
teams quite often startups i started in
two ways either by small groups of
friends or by groups of industry experts
now when you're a group of industry
experts you tend to be distributed all
across the world and it's actually very
hard to build a team culture which can
build product quickly when everyone's
remote in different time zones that sort
of thing yeah quick hands up who wants
to be a CEO whoa only a couple people
perfect the hands up okay hello who
wants to be a CTO right right audience
yeah excellence no no I was just going
to say so what my experience was you
know it's great you're the boss you can
tell people what to do you know what you
totally go and tell people what to do
pick they will do exactly their own
thing and they always will telling
engineers what to do is like telling a
three-year-old what to do it just
doesn't work so let's talk about sharks
Sharky sharks who hears had to deal with
a venture capitalist who enjoyed it
nobody yeah one person's gone okay you
got money didn't you yes fantastic it's
good to hear it could hear one success
story so as soon as your business starts
looking like it could be successful you
the sharks will come a-lookin and they
circle very very quickly it so it was
quite a surprise to us but also bear in
mind that you know they are herd animals
right no one cares no one cares no one
cares everyone cares yeah that's
absolutely true so once we're as soon as
we had one in this current student our
company all something Ben and I through
LinkedIn and other channels started
getting requests from everybody else
under the Sun and basically investors
just wait till someone else is willing
to sort of dip their toe in the water
and then they also jump in and follow at
least that's the trend we've seen so
especially when things are looking tough
you might have these angels come around
angels are actually devils in disguise
don't trust them either and they will
like you know just help you out just for
that smidgen of your company or just for
that extra billboard seat yeah also this
this is so lawyers are expensive right
they've obviously have very nice suits
and actually you should use this as a
litmus test okay if your lawyer is
wearing a suit which does not cost more
than your monthly run rate you are
talking to the wrong lawyers right these
guys are expensive but they're expensive
for a reason okay their suits need to
look immaculate their offices look
neater look great okay you're going to
pay for this later but they you know
that's that that's how you tell the ones
you actually want from the ones you
don't want yeah one of our favorite
things is actually go to our lawyers
offices and in London and just sit and
overlook Regent's Park and have a really
nice afternoon in the boardroom because
so peaceful and relaxing there with the
wildlife outside yeah the nice coffee
and things and I think I think they like
the fact that you know just a bunch of
bunch of scruffy geeky guys and t-shirts
and jeans Turner thematically yeah I
think they do have to keep stuff from
their other clients there yeah i think
we go to the to the separate board room
actually so there are good guys out
there learn about the space you can you
can these were our guys we recommend
them very highly especially if you're a
european-based but do your research you
know not all vc's not all lawyers are
alike if you're really serious about
this you really want to be a lean
startup ninja you know this this is your
bread and mutton it's knowing about the
industry it's finding out who's good and
who's not talk to people vc's talk to
each other lawyers talk to each other as
entrepreneurs and start at people we
should talk to each other as well so
let's get into the technology this is
probably hopefully the more interesting
bit for those of you who are engineers
and developers in the crowd we had to
choose a pretty modern text technology
stack to deliver what we need to do so
we do a little Java performance demons
which sit next to your application
server wishing reports back to our
dashboard which is back out in the cloud
right so we have to have asynchronous
messaging we have to be disputable we
have to scale across the world and be
resilient to us East going away going
away and then who knows what that
expression means yeah a few people who's
who's who's lost the weekend to that
before that's guy here okay sad sad
times and we have things like you know
the data protection X which applies to
the UK and Europe and a different data
protection act which applies to the
United States and so on and so forth so
it gets really complicated when you
build anything that is considered to be
a global service and here are some of
the tools we use to build it abort
bought bought bought bought so who here
knows of either puppet or chef right
excellent everyone is it again this is a
mess of difference to last year yeah
about five percent last year almost
everyone this year so we You chef we
believe that Chef is more friendly than
puppet in terms of delivering JVM based
kind of stacks of infrastructure it
seems to have more default recipes for
your tomcat server texts actually
installing java itself and all the
paraphernalia that comes with kind of a
java je viens deck so i mean it is it is
a bit complex you are going to have to
spend some time and effort across your
whole team getting into this stuff but i
think of the two things the two trends i
want to pick out most for things for you
guys looking forwards over the next five
to ten years performance and devils
those are the two things that i would
say you should be learning and chefs a
great way to do that yeah just one quick
point on the bottom one there you're
gonna be really careful ship it does not
actually delete infrastructure elements
that you've added previously via shift
so if you win an installed WordPress via
chef and you take WordPress out of your
cookbook and you apply that to the
machine again it doesn't uninstall the
WordPress it just leaves it behind like
roaches which places the point about
livestock not pets yeah like you shoot
the server in the head and you make a
new one yeah and that's exactly the
policy we're starting to go for now and
with again with modern hardware of
modern virtualization you can actually
get a brand-new linux server up and
running in about two minutes and on the
road for a quote from the potential guys
which i particularly like is that if it
doesn't have an API it's not actually I
as you know the 1990s called they want
their managed hosting back yeah so this
stuff should all be runnable and
implementable be about that you know as
an automated script yeah so thanks when
we use is a it's a new java based java
JVM based kind of application frameworks
anyway said we use vertex will know what
that it is yeah a couple of people
actually quite a few people cool it's it
was really gaining in popularity very
kind of you can sort of think of it as
almost like a JVM based version of no
George is enormously you know we have
the announcement of the avatar
project which is is actually no jay s on
top of that song but but vertex is kind
of a similar sort of technology it's all
a Singh stuff yeah and I think mostly we
were pretty positive on this yeah we're
pretty positive whatever we give it a
six because we've had some teething
teething troubles with it but it's
rapidly getting up to the 78 mark very
quickly it's an incredibly active
project Tim Fox the the lead for it is
doing a fantastic job and building a
truly large community of plugin authors
and things you can't recommend it enough
really and probably the best thing as
developers is that it's polyglot right
so we can solve some problems in Java we
can solve some problems in JavaScript we
can solve the problems in groovy Scala
whatever whatever the right languages to
fit the job and we can all do it on the
same stack which is fantastic does have
some negatives they did kind of put in
security as a bit of an afterthought and
this is kind of a common theme we're
going to go into today so vertex is one
of these things which can have a whole
bunch of hazel cast modes talking to
each other across the internet when
you're going across the internet you're
kind of on the open Internet so you've
got customer data traveling between your
nodes on the open Internet and
apparently customers like to have that
secured kind of important and when it's
not built in that's problematic yeah so
about yeah about that now we get on to
our favorite tool sorry Trish ah yeah
what yeah we using Mongo use among go
okay are you scared about my persecuted
by mom guy yeah so um manga is one of
those great things where it's a
technology that is almost there it
almost lives up to its promise but the
deeper you dive in to be on the hello
world case the more and more you get
caught out now there are obviously doing
an awful lot of work to to fix a lot of
issues we're going to go into yet and
will give it the report card here so
yeah it is a document model this is this
is great you can take stuff if you don't
really know how you want to store your
customer data that sort of thing which
we don't we don't know enough about our
customers yet we just dump it in a
document fantastic nice and fast the
Java API is actually pretty good and
Trisha's about to make a heck of a lot
better
however there are some problem where
there are some problems we talked again
about security so we kind of went okay
well we need to have replicated sets go
across our Mongo nodes because you know
we're no sequel and we're distributed
and we're all hipster again we're going
across the open internet and it's not
secured this is a major problem hands up
if you knew that unless you're playing
for a longer support contract you do not
have any level of security at all let go
out the back bear guessing okay who's
playing from long ago sport yeah yeah
you'll stops insecure yeah so I am
actually quite terrified considering how
popular Mongo is out there in the world
today how much unsecured traffic is
currently traveling between Mongo nodes
on the open Internet you might just want
to write a packet sniffer and see for
yourself I think the NSA probably
already happened tively the election
algorithms broken on us many many times
so in long ago you have this concept of
a single master and multiple slaves as
it were secondaries they call them
unfortunately sometimes they always
believe they're all secondary yeah now
you can only write to a master so if
nobody is a master you can't write to
your Mungo cluster this is problematic
and we've actually seen circumstances
where we've got three Mongo nodes that
goes oh my god there's more sir let go
guys no it's like why over there over
there goes now is this guy so you
actually have a site click set of nodes
each of which is point tutorial no no
he's the master it's almost like when
you have a production problem and your
manager know what his operations is
owning that dress they're all sort of
pointing at each other it's one of those
it's one of those ones again was really
interesting cuz we did the whole
prototyping thing with Mongo and again
in that first week of prototyping it
worked really well we just didn't push
it quite far enough and the real problem
that we head is that we didn't test the
rips it stuff in particular and we
should have added that as a use case in
our prototyping because it was a vital
component to our architecture but it's
it's like the dick cheney thing you know
sometimes you have unknown unknowns I'm
ongoing when we ran the report card it
you know it was it was yeah it came talk
yeah it's only with hindsight that I
think you yeah we're still going to
persevere with it I think because we
have good friends and the community who
are going to physically go to help us
with our problems right tomorrow three
o'clock is that right Trish
tomorrow at three o'clock turn up to
trish's talk on how she's going to fix
Mongo for everybody done groovy who here
uses groovy the language yeah quite
quite popular um so groovy for us was
kind of important because we just don't
have java 8 and Landers yet basically
right so we're doing a lot of
asynchronous messaging which means lots
of callback code we have a lot of
messages coming in which means we need
to do things like met mapping messages
we need to filter messages we need to
reduce messages all those kind of basic
functional programming concepts that
Java just doesn't do very well so what's
the score card I think 5 out of 10 is a
bit harsh I think it's mostly the fact
that it's two point naught and that
there was well static and pilot probably
should have worked a bit better really
that that's really learned a lot of the
things which takes place this scroll
down yeah does anyone here trying to use
groovy 22 points x 44 ecstatic
competition right so if people who don't
know groovy was a purely dynamic
language for a long time and because it
had to do lots of runtime interpretation
of Java class objects and lots of what
do you call it my brains my reflection
it was incredibly slow so they have put
an aesthetic compilation which is
absolutely a fantastic idea with some
annotations unfortunately it took them
15 releases to get it right so it would
crash our server it would crash our IDE
you we could one day apply to near
extent it was just horrendous so life on
the bleeding edge angular who's using
angular who likes angular yes yeah this
is the first JavaScript framework
front-end framework that I've seen in my
entire career which I could actually
pick up and use it had templating it had
a declarative language it had things
like fantastic interoperability with
things like sock JS WebSocket traffic
and I don't have to put in any server
side code into my UI layer at all for
the first time in my career I don't have
snippets of jsps or I wasn't trying to
generate it from from GWT doesn't have
PHP code in there anything else horrible
love PHP I do love PHP it's my favorite
come talk to me afterwards about my
favorite stories about PHP bring whiskey
if you're going to bring we bring
whiskey so angular truly is as a game
changer and there are a few other
frameworks out there such as in bjs a
whole bunch of them are coming out but
it really takes waters I guess quite an
ugly little language javascript and
turns it in something incredibly
positive so a Richard or John here
actually no our engineers have skipped
this talk because I would have to boot
us from the back but do talk to the
people who have used angular in the
crowd if you don't use angular and and
they will tell you you know that the ins
and outs as to why it's wonderful there
are some negatives to angular these are
all very small negatives by the way we
did give an 8 out of 10 for a reason for
a while it's testing framework was
called testacular right little play on
words some people find it amusing some
people took a little bit of a fence
we're not here to debate there either
way the problem is if you think God
search for how to test angularjs you
just end up going to Men's Health sites
and mins and oncology departments and
that sort of things I wasn't wasn't very
useful for that ironically for Google
all the documentation could not be found
via cuckoo the SEO for angularjs was
freaking terrible given the bag is made
by google that it's just kind of weird
and just generally speaking JavaScript
tooling still kind of sucks it's getting
better but when you're trying to
integrate it with I guess a Java stack
like we're kind of trying to do things
like we need to build a test a
JavaScript with maven fortunately
there's a talk about this later yes so
if you're free at four thirty this
afternoon i'm going to be speaking about
what we're doing with maths horn and
tooling is going to be a big part of our
so if you'll feel free comes in it so
Java onwards is actually going to go a
long way to fixing this problem which is
really really cool so those were the
kind of three major technologies we used
and we use a bunch of other stuff
especially in the JavaScript realm we
have I think about 27 JavaScript
libraries in our UI sounds ridiculous
but they're all absolutely tiny when you
compress them and minimize met cetera
performance is not an issue the
dependency management between them
however is someone said so JavaScript
having hit every branch on the way down
out of the technical Drake is now
massively climbing the social tree and
hoping to repeat the experience yeah
very much so so there are tools or
little libraries again require jeaious
as a fantastic one to try and manage
your javascript dependencies but
generally speaking that javascript will
doesn't have the robustness that we
enjoy in java with things like you know
the j unit test framework the maven or
Gradle build tool that sort of thing
it's still catching up so in summary
building on that job pick flexible tech
be prepared to change you change your
minds you change your text that you
change everything about about what it is
to be to be you to be to be you guys to
be your company you change that every
day we've actually had to throw away a
lot of technology as well or we've had
to throw away large chunks of our code
base and we're really not afraid to do
it so we do also try and build a culture
where individual developers don't own
code and we don't get precious about a
particular area code or an idea that
we've tried out okay everything is under
review anything can be swapped out in
any time in order to drive the product
in the business for its collar on the
code hard on the hard on the on the
ideas but always very careful to look
after the people yeah so and remember
always you're public enemy do not
believe the hype right this whole
startup ninja think ultimately is
bollocks could happen to use and and and
you know and Y Combinator and things
like that they have a vested interest
and selling you an idea but it is hype
do your own thing have fun it always
remember revenue revenue revenue review
and if we could have a chair to throw
around the surgery would and we would
but I think the author would like that
probably not very nice and one final
thing which actually is actually very
very important for people especially
people that are working startups you
will have days like this startups are
not all fluffy bunnies right there's a
great blog post out there about
depression okay I recommend you read it
especially if you're involved in the
startup industry and then remember that
it's okay not to have to crush it every
single day there were going to be days
where it hurts and it sucks and you're
gonna have a really bad time and you
should talk to your friends and if you
don't if you feel you can't which one
you want to come talk to us yeah so you
startups are lonely and they're
difficult and they're painful sometimes
they're also awesome and it's a
rollercoaster yeah but in the reason why
they're so awesome for all of you
enterprise people out there because you
don't have to work for this guy all
right we've all had this guy as our bath
before this is one of the big reasons
why Ben and I got into the startup life
right we were just sick and tired of
working for that guy so don't work for
that guy do think about startups
hopefully we've given you some some wins
and some fails that you can take away
with you and yeah we'll also take any
questions at this point yeah
so the question is do we care about our
competitors the answer is we keep an eye
on what they're doing but we Forge our
own path we have a vision which is quite
different to the way our competitors
deliver their particular products and so
we're just going to keep focusing on
that yeah and I think it's the best way
for any start up start up to be focus on
your own your own stuff first yep had it
how do we pick the right how do you how
deep it the right partners to launch
your startup so how do you pick the
right partners to launch with startup
very very very carefully don't for
example just get drunk in a bowl and
agreed to write a book together and then
start a company that would be terrible
that is really not a good idea so our
financial director always has started to
tell us as we've sort of grown up as a
business you do not go to the toilet
without seeing your lawyer on the way
there and it sounds really harsh sound
sounds anti a job but if you are going
to get to a partnership you really do
have to worry about the eventual or the
possibility of a divorce right and
that's what lawyers are there to protect
you against and you have to do it so you
had a question yep so ID support for
groovy was but sucky basically the
Eclipse plugin for groovy just didn't
work most of time or groovy would put
out a new language version which was
then not compatible with either and tell
EJ or netbeans or eclipse until they
then updated so the groovy guys and the
ID guys not talking not sinking their
releases closely enough
example and that's only about poetry
without being too user I've read using a
light board and using let me do that
yeah okay so how did we get to MongoDB
basically you're quite right we did not
model our use cases properly if we had
we probably would have gone for a hybrid
no sequel relational solution it's also
worth pointing out that when we actually
ran the numbers after after they were
weighted Mongo was one point above
postgres yeah so it was actually very
very close the great two features that
Mongo did seem to offer us at the time
was one that it was you an unstructured
document store which we really needed
because we had no idea what will store
and start with in terms of metrics data
or customer data and the fact that in
theory with its rips it it could
actually replicate across the world for
us which is fantastic disaster recovery
I mean I was always sensitive to the use
case that us East just goes away I'd
seen suit too many startups and too many
companies get bitten by the fact that
you just lose a complete amazon region
and add Mongo in in the initial use
cases we ran for it seemed to deal with
that like a swell and it actually does
right so mongos rip sets are actually
quite robust and stuff and we have had
some situations where us East has gone
down on us and we've been able to carry
on because Mongo was rip sitting stuff
across so it's so we probably make a
seem to be a bit worse than what it
really is how do we feel about startup
incubators so we're kind of in a semi
incubator ourselves I guess we were sort
of in a co-working space which does
share a lot of resources and shares a
lot of ideas we meet often we might try
and have an investor come in and talk to
the entire co-working space but we're
not a formal incubator I think
incubators are a really good idea the
only problem with incubators are
remember we told you about the shark
circling lots of sharks circle realm
incubators right and they're not there
for your benefit they're there for their
own benefit and a lot of incubators
publishing name names look expensive for
what you actually get yeah so so but
remember this is your company remember
that you know if you're going to make
this thing work and lots of people are
going to own a piece of you if you're
any good yeah the most valuable thing
about incubators definitely are talking
to people who are in the same position
urine and being able to share resources
like accountant
lawyers people who can tell you how to
build a CRM system that sort of thing
you don't actually need a formal
incubator for that though you really
don't you just need to find like-minded
people any other questions okay caching
so the quickly cushion about caching and
so um on our website we use a CDN called
fastly which is the best CD on the
planet without exception apart from that
we don't really need to use all the
caching for one foot foot foot for most
of the core I just realized we did
forget to mention fastly so if a stly is
the URL you want to go to if you ever
need to do CD in work these guys
absolutely rock especially providing
Akamai get rid of a can get rid of my
go-to fastly it just craps all over it's
fantastic you know the questions nope
cool thanks very much for um</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
