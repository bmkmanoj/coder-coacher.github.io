for Java effects team builder I'm based
in London you could probably tell from
the accent the good news is my jet LAG's
not too bad so I should make the whole
talk without falling asleep and the rest
of my team is based in Grenoble in
France and myself and on behalf of them
like to thank everyone for coming to see
the the talk today this is also my first
technical talk so you have to excuse if
I make any small mistakes and no
heckling please so first of all we'll
run through the program agenda and can I
just ask you to raise a hand if you've
you seen builder before if you're
familiar with a product okay so maybe
half you guys okay so the first part the
talk would just be to introduce scene
builder for those of you are not so
familiar with it and following that
we'll have a scene builder one pokémon
Showcase where were actually build some
stuff so hopefully we'll have less
slides and more building after that I'm
going to introduce scene builder to
point naught which is currently underway
so that might be more interesting for
those of you already familiar with the
product then we're going to have a scene
build a two point naught new features
demo there's lots of new stuff into
point naught so I'm going to tell you
about some of those things and finally
we'll have some questions and answers
while hopefully provide answers at the
end so if you want to ask me stuff
perhaps about your experience with scene
builder or if you have any suggestions
for new features or features you'd like
to see improve that kind of stuff that
would be a welcomed so what is JavaFX
scene builder well primarily it's a
visual layout tool so Java effects team
builder provides a visual layout
environment that lets you quickly design
UI for JavaFX applications and you can
do that without writing any code so you
can basically bust straight into scene
builder start dragging in components
from the library
making things you know if you have an
idea for an app before generating any
code whatsoever
and seeing builder generates F XML for
you so you guys might be familiar with F
XML it's an xml-based format and
basically when you save your layout
scene builder behind the scene or create
an F XML document for you and all that's
done so seam build or 1.1 was released a
couple of weeks ago and I think it was
available on OTN for a fair few months
before that so it was in a pretty stable
State so hopefully you guys have been
using one point one if you've been using
one point naught please grab one point
one and give it a test drive runs on
Windows 87 vista XP Mac OS X 10.8 ten
point seven and Linux and any features
Linux supports have just said so we've
qualified it for one to ten by four and
above there's a CSS analyzer in 1.1
which is a great feature which I'll be
showing you shortly
there's also usability improvements so
for manipulating slightly more complex
controls such as grid pane table views
there's view options for four separate
panels and there's also some document
templates so as I mentioned future
development team builder to pointe-noire
is on the way developer preview bills
should be available soon I can't give
you an exact timeframe at the moment but
certainly I would hope this side of
Christmas may be a little before so yeah
we'll also recently start up Twitter
account and so if you want updates on
team builder development you can follow
us at jfx UI so basically I art we
preview images of features and news
about the product so if you want the
kind of the latest scoop before any
official releases you might see it there
first so
and you also get like nice little
snapshots of how a designs going so you
can give me give me feedback so we use
Java FETs components basically the Java
FX library is available inside team
builder and you can drive and drag and
drop containers control shapes charts
and directly into your document and you
can directly manipulate these components
and edit any of their properties so
they're in line properties their layout
properties you can add methods and FX
IDs to these guys and the other thing
you can also do is instant preview so if
you've built some built started your app
started your layout inside team builder
and you can preview your layout and see
how we react to to resizing so Java
effects layout can be very dynamic and
fluid and it's important to see how
various controls and containers move and
resize you can also now apply CSS
styling so if you've added a stylesheet
to your F XML document you can see the
results of that CSS styling immediately
if you make edits those edits a shown
immediately as well so as I mentioned it
generates Java FX FX ml this is an
xml-based markup language and
interesting the scene builder itself is
built entirely from java effects so in
fact when we were producing one point
noir and for sum of one point one Scene
builder was a really good testbed for
the Java FX platform we had UI designs
and ideas and some of the Java effects
controls and didn't quite meet our
expectations or what we wanted so there
was a good amount of code development
going on
and you can also easily connect code so
if you've made your F XML document and
you started say a project in your IDE
say NetBeans
NetBeans for example and I know IntelliJ
have some already have Java effects
support so if you've made a Java FX
project it has a controller class you
can add that controller to your F XML
document and once you've done that and
any F XML variables that you've declared
and started our method seen builder will
go in and pick those up and we'll give
you a little drop-down autofill so you
can quickly connect up your your F XML
with your logic you can also generate a
sample controller which I'll be showing
you a little bit later also so sim
builder 1.1 Showcase so initially I had
about nine slides and I was just going
to build a load of stuff with you guys
then my manager got hold of it and I
have 33 slides and less time to build
stuff but hey it's the way it works I
guess so one of the great things about
scene builder is you can rapidly
prototype stuff and even if you're
intending in fact I was just speaking
with a guy earlier today even if you're
intending on writing your your layout
inside your code and you may not want to
use F XML you can still use scene
builder for prototyping you know you
basically bust open scene builder you
have an idea for the airport you want to
know how a certain container will react
when or a certain control will react
when the container parent is resized or
something like that it's really fast to
just do this prototype in scene builder
in fact it was even suggesting with the
chap who I was speaking with earlier
that you can basically make an F XML
pota type and he has a he has an
application he's currently converting
from Swing to Java effects and he said
that'd be a great idea because he can
basically take that F XML document and
give it to his one of his engineers and
say hey you know you're going to have to
replicate this in code but at least use
this as a
the template so rapid poet type-in is a
it's a good way of using the tool so in
least give you a quick demonstration of
that so let's open up steam build a 1.1
app and we'll make a new document so let
me just quickly run over the UI first so
in the middle here you've got the the
panel we use the most content panel in
the top left you have a library of
controls so the top there you have all
your containers and accordions anchor
panes that kind of start border pain you
might be more used to if you're coming
from swing and then if you have your
hierarchy as you build your your F XML
so that's for example drag in a split
pane and perhaps a toolbar as you can
see you can manipulate these things
directly inside the content view so you
can resize or move things around you get
some like very helpful guides and you
can be parent things so I'm going to
grab another split pane there put them
inside there you can also get rid of
containers quite often when you poet
typing you have a container that you
don't want so you can unwrap these guys
and you can also wrap stuff which is
very handy so I realized here that when
I make a new document generally it comes
with an anchor pain it's not always
useful to leave it so with this it'll
lay out what we really want is a V box
so I can choose a range wrap in grab a V
box and then say to the anchor pain this
using a contextual menu you get the same
thing up here on wrap
and I see just why I've been talking
we've made like a very brief layout
using a couple of split pane so this is
how fast basically similar is to make
stuff obviously you know I've been using
the app a lot but you get used to it
pretty quickly so the other panel here
on the right hand side is the inspector
so here we have a property section and
then we have a layout section which is
obviously all of the layout kind of
controls so for example if I want to
change the width of this guy I can do it
here and then you can see now that my
split pane here is kept its original
size so if I select it I can see that
its parent is a V box has some view box
constraints so I can say hey I want my V
grow to be always so go and we can
preview this guy and you get likely your
preview in a window you can play around
with it you'll see how things are going
to work now just the other day on the
forum there was a guy who was asking a
question about how to make he want to
animate a ship steering wheel in fact
but the only way to show the top half of
the steering wheel so I was reading the
the forum I was like oh that's an
interesting interesting thing so let's
just shut this guy and make a new
document so I thought I could probably
solve that with a scroll pane so I made
myself a little ship steering wheel now
dragging this graphic here basically
directly from the finder into the
content view you can say so you see it's
made a little image view for me and I
was thinking well I can might be able to
use a scroll pain for that so if I wrap
in a scroll pane and then perhaps set
the scroll pane height so looking at the
image view I can see it's 200 by 200 so
if I select the scroll pane and say hey
I want to prep I of 200 100 sorry would
be half of it
kind of guess what I want but you know
probably take off those scroll bars and
you have a handy search also inside the
inspector so even if you're one of
things about scene builder is that all
the properties are available so even if
you're unfamiliar with the JavaFX api's
it's a great way of exploring things so
if I really don't know what I'm looking
for here I can say okay well maybe bar
and rkh page bar policy so maybe I'll
going to turn these guys to never and
now if I go and find my select the image
view and do some rotate rotation so I
have kind of half an animation which is
what the guy wanted because you
basically wanted to be able to have the
bounds of the control so if I wrap in a
V box and then say put in some other
stuff like a button you can also drag
them to up directly into the hierarchy
here if you want things exactly in a
certain place and there are neat little
functions I'm using quick shortcuts here
but for moving things around so you can
see that it's the desired effect now
there's probably people in the audience
who can code a lot better than I can
who will be saying well you could have
done that with a clip and you're right
you could you could have override the
the set compute with compute height
methods and you wouldn't have to use a
heavyweight scroll pane but I've got
five points for this on the forum for
this answer so hey not too bad but you
know it's again it's another example or
very quick prototyping how can I
visually visualize an idea and perhaps
without writing any code whatsoever
so layout features now layout features a
great in Java effects and the controls
the amount of different containers you
get just fantastic for laying out stuff
and when you're making apps and things
need to resize you know you don't want
labels disappearing to nothing and you
know buttons disappearing out of your
window frame etc so and so basically
team builder is a great way to
familiarize yourself with the extensive
layout features of Java fest platform so
you can see all of the layout properties
for each node so let's do a little
layout features demonstration so I'm
just going to close that guy so this is
symbol 21.1 and we've seen build a 1.1
you can see there has a little bar here
above above the content view this is the
selection bar so I'm just going to show
you pretty much about that bar so let's
make a scroll pane and just throw some
things in very quickly ok so you can see
now the hierarchy buffer and contains
gold paint and claim blah blah blah blah
and I shouldn't be really showing you
the flaws in our product but when I
resize the window you can see that that
kind of that bar is not really resizing
very well it's kind of nasty the way it
does it sort of jumps about etc so this
even build a two point naught and I
decided to quickly mock up a new one in
NF XML so interestingly we use symbol
21.1 to build team scene build a two
point naught stuff so let's see if I can
quickly recreate that so we'll start
with a H box and just so obviously this
guy's a container it has no kind of
styling so he's invisible and you can go
to view and say show outlines then
you'll basically get an outline for for
all objects which is very useful
sometimes if you're working with a lot
of containers that don't have styling
but for the purposes of the
demonstration today I'm going to
actually just give it a color so inside
the
style property here let's make it a nice
light blue I have did that with no typos
that's incredible okay and then if I go
to the layout I can see that I have an
campaign constraint so this H box is
living inside nangka pain so I get ankle
pain constraints which is quite nice so
I say you know what I'll turn on the
left and right constraint and I'll give
them some values as say 20 pixels so
it's not right up to the edge there we
go and let's see the effect of that so
if I preview again I can now see that
that h box is growing with the anchor
pain so those little margins I set on
the left and right are kind of like
little chains they're pulling it along
so you can do that from both sides so
then we want to put in some labels so
let's make it okay an anchor pain and
then another label I'm just going to use
a little more land sign as a separator
and what copy and paste that a few times
now everything's a bit crushed up there
so again layout properties are going to
select that H box give me a little bit
of spacing in there let everything
breathe a little bit and there we go
you can see how well I did that
everything kind of truncated which is
all going well but it's not really
useful for a selection bar for a
selection bar the very least I need to
be able to see I'd like to be at a free
read the selected objects or the one at
the end of the list and probably its
parent also so if I select both of those
guys and go minimum width use pref size
and that's here I'm just going to put
this guy in the middle as well
and hit preview and you can see that
that's kind of a much more usable
selection bar now so again this is you
might actually you know decide in your
final project you want to buy this stuff
in code but just being able to explore
the properties really quickly like this
and to prototype this kind of stuff me
personally I prefer actually now to just
use FX ml and keep my keep my logical
code unpolluted we've layout stuff but
that's a you know a question of taste
yes not yet not yet not inside one point
one so for two point naught and we're
looking into it it might be a two point
something yeah it's certainly something
we're considering okay
so if it I apologize if all of this is a
little simplistic for you guys who
already know the product but there will
be some more interesting to point not
stuff coming up so you see here we go I
have to put in a pointless slide telling
you I'm doing a demonstration that's
fantastic
okay so feature tips and tricks so let's
let's build a little app we're going to
show some grid pane UI I'm wrapping and
unwrapping of nodes we've shown you a
little bit of that ready the fact you
can fit and grow nodes adding a craft
graphic component there's a little trick
for that and also showing you a sample
controller so I'm going to kill this guy
make a new document so the idea of my
little app here is I'm going to make a
remote control from my apartment
something called home remote so this is
just a little spoofing but we're going
to have some light switches for
controlling the lights and a temperature
gauge and things like that so first of
all we should probably put in a title so
I'm going to call it home remote and by
the way I'm just double clicking inside
these text fields that are enabled to
enables me to just directly edit inside
the content view you could do the same
thing both see by editing the text there
then I'm going to go and grab an image
so has a little logo I made earlier very
simple little logo and at City I'm going
to put that make that image as a graphic
component of the label so I can do that
by just in the hierarchy hovering over
and I get a little placeholder there and
I can drop him in and now you can see
that that label is as a graphic attached
and I'm going to because I'm a designer
and I want it to be on the right I'm
going to change it so I'm going to have
my little logo there on the right I'm
also going to use an accordion as the
basis for my app so let's throw an
accordion in
so would it be so we're going to have
we're going to have some lighting and
we're going to have temperature okay and
I'm going to select these guys and again
I'm going to use that rap in command I'm
going to wrap these guys in a V box and
again I'm going to go to layout and give
this give this V Box a a useful size so
let's make it 400 450 so we can see you
on the screen
and I have to do that little trick again
to make our V box always grow and again
I'm going to cut choose unwrap and get
rid of that anchor pain that we don't
eat in the root so we have kind of the
basis for our app that was pretty quick
just took a few seconds
so inside lighting I'm going to use some
checkboxes to control our lights now
checkboxes might seem like a strange
choice but you know lights pretty much
boolean unless it's a dimmer light and
we're going to do something a little
clever with these checkboxes with CSS
shortly
so let me chuck in one check box so
let's make this one we'll call this one
master copy and paste that a few times
so we want a little light for lounge and
maybe one for our kitchen
and maybe one for the bathroom now you
can see here that these are kind of just
dotted around so I'm going to use a neat
little feature I'm going to wrap these
guys in a grid paint to make them a
little bit more watered so again I can
go range wrap in grid pain and you see
that the wrap algorithm there arty
helped me out a little bit it realized
that the master checkbox was off to the
top left so put that in cell zero zero
for me which is very useful and I
realized that I pretty much vertically
aligned the other three so it said okay
I'll put those in another column for you
which is which is quite useful so now
I'm going to get rid of the anchor pain
that comes free with the title pane and
you can see that that that grid pain now
expands to the title pane so there's a
few little problems here first of all my
check box is right on the edge that's a
big no-no you know you have to have a
little bit of border makes things more
legible so I'm going to add some padding
to the to the grid pane and I'm also
able you can see this blue tray around
the grid pane here so I'm able to
actually select use that to select
columns and rows so I'm going to select
the first row here and say hey at you
want you to be aligned to the right now
that looks okay apart from my master and
my lounge there are pretty crushed up so
I'll select this guy and just put in a
little H gap maybe 20 pixels or
something there we go you can see that
that appears now I also have a whole
bunch of other features allowing you to
manipulate the grid paint directly
inside the content view so if you want
you can basically move columns and rows
around and you can also do if you have
another checkbox you can basically put
it inside a cell let me undo that you
can also if you're careful drop in on a
crack here and it will make you a new
row which is quite nice so so basically
well this is seeing bill 21.1 but this
is a kind of stuff for two point not
that we really want to kind of emphasize
on we want to give you these kind of
nice or drag-and-drop gestures and to
help you out you know without because
it's to do that stuff is a bit finicky
otherwise you know putting in a new row
etc and we want to do so this one of
these kind of gestures on other control
such as H Box V box toolbars allowing
you to put things in certain places and
so I was just realized I've missed out
the most important room which is the the
bedroom I enjoy my sleep so let me add a
row below here so I'm using contextual
menus just on these little grid pane
trays and I'll put in a little checkbox
there and call out the bedroom and
actually I think he's a little bit more
important in the kitchen so let's put
him we'll move him above so that last
little thing I did there if you're
laying out a big form grid pane really
does help you out right we have we get
sent in by customers by users huge
graphic forms they've been doing in in F
XML generally they have some kind of
problem with code or something like that
it's interesting that they've just
basically taken a whole bunch of
controls and throwing them in an anchor
pain so it just really doesn't scale if
you go and show that to your boss and he
says hey actually can we move the
address field underneath the credit card
fields or whatever you know you want a
grid pane so you can just select that go
okay I'll just move that otherwise
you're sitting there for you know 10
minutes at sea physically moving
individual controls around everywhere
which is you know not not really it
doesn't really scale in terms of time so
grip pain is a great way for laying out
forms which is really all we're doing
here so I I should probably save this
guy always a good idea
so I'm going to call em home remote that
affects the mail back to slides okay so
CSS tricks and tips now how many of you
guys use CSS in your in your apps
anybody wow that's a lot of people
that's cool okay so you'll realize that
you know you can basically transform an
app with CSS and the interesting dealing
with 1.1 is it's using the older version
of FX so the FX theme is Caspian in two
point naught the FX name is moderner and
it looks a lot more modern and actually
worked on that with Jasper pots and so
basically with effects the next effects
you know stuff should look a lot better
immediately out of the box but for now
we're going to do some some little CSS
tricks to our to our app that we're
making so the first thing I'm going to
do is select the root container I'm
going to go to the property section and
I'm going to add a style sheet so I have
one made in already now you can see a
little change already
my checkbox is change font and let's
just have a quick look at this style
sheet so I can open that guy up so this
is my little CSS editor a choice you can
see that I have some some fonts declare
but that's all of the CSS but you can
see I'm doing something called clever
where the check boxes or we'll be doing
so many surely so I'm making them into
light switches so I basically have a
light switch rule and I have a light
switch master ball and I'm just changing
some radiuses padding background colors
and some rather radical background in
sets so if I select this lounge now and
if I go to my style classes because
we've added a style sheet those style
classes will now come up for for me so I
can say
okay so I want my lounge it's a switch
light switch so let's make it look like
a light switch and so now if I hit
preview and I click this guy you can see
he's a checkbox but he doesn't really
look like a checkbox anymore so we're
going to make ad the light switch to
rest and we're going to have the master
light switch look slightly differently
so if we preview again we do some
resizing and we can see now that our app
starting to look slightly more Appy now
last thing I'm going to do is just add a
little style class onto my logo just to
bring in that custom font so title font
there we go
and I can also bring in that graphic the
gap between the graphic and the label
let's take that away and as he just
because I have a little bit of OCD let's
just take him a little bit off the top
edge so our apps starting to look a
little bit more like an app so I'm going
to save that
oh that was the CSS tricks demonstration
okay
analyzing CSS now in one point one one
of the major new features is a CSS
analyzer now as you guys have just
indicated to me a lot of you do CSS that
you're probably also aware that if
you're doing a quite complex app has a
lot of rules
eventually something doesn't look like
you expect it to and normally the reason
for that is you have some conflict in
your CSS rules somewhere so we made a
CSS analyzer panel where the CSS
inheritance is is clearly displayed for
each note so if something doesn't look
like you expected it to you can do some
investigation so back into scene builder
1.1 again so if I go to the View menu I
can show CSS analyzer now interestingly
here you'll see that this little icon
has now got a little CSS another fat you
can see that in the screen just about so
when you open a CSS analyzer we analyzed
that we put you in a different picking
mode so actually you can drill directly
into the skin of a control so for
example if I click on the label here
you'll see the stareable path is light
switch master in this case in brackets
it tells you that's a checkbox and you
can see that there is text there if I
drag in an ordinary label you can also
use this little star double path if you
click on these little guys here in the
middle you can say arc a box mark and it
tells you basically exactly how to drill
into stuff now for those of you know CSS
well you probably know that stuff
already but if you're learning CSS this
stuff's pretty useful or even if you're
working with a control you haven't you
know you're not familiar with and it's
nice being able to to do it in like this
and and get that that path then if you
choose the menu for for the panel you
can say copy style path and if I just go
back to CSS edit make a new document
they go you ready to roll so you know
now no you now concede that if you type
in any CSS there you're just going to be
interfering with the mark inside the box
of the checkbox so it's quite a good way
of basically exploring CSS because
especially when I was learning CSS when
I've been working on this product you
know these kind of things weren't
weren't easy to find out so you can also
see there's a little toggle here so if
you want to go back to the normal
picking mode you can and then
effectively it'll just be it's just
selecting the entire node again
so there's another really nice little
filter here so you can say okay
hi properties with default values and so
now I can see that I have some defaults
here on the left the next one is the
inspector column and I have some style
sheets and in blue I can see the winners
here so I can see that FX font family
and the font size are both being covered
by home remote dot CSS now let's change
something else here so if for example I
go into the properties and change that
see that's yeah find him here we go so
let's change the opacity to zero point
two so you can now see you have to
forgive my small screen then FX opacity
now is basically being governed by the
inspector and the last column is inline
style so he's generally the overall
winner so if I go to the inline styles
and I say oh well you know what
FX opacity 0.8 then you can see that
inline styles are now winning so and
hopefully this is just a very simple UI
to just check which CSS rules are
actually having a direct impact on your
node and it's a good way you know of
seeing if you've got yourself in a bit
of a mess or not yes sorry
sorry more than one style on oh yeah
yeah you can put as many as you like in
there yet
yeah but generally styling in in the in
line there I only really use it for
testing you know good practice I would
say would be put your styling and
external style sheet if you're doing
rapid prototype in that's a great way of
just kind of you know getting some quick
and dirty styling in there in fact an
inseam build a two-point nor we're
improving that UI so the inspector
section there has autofill for you and
is isn't laid out just using a simple
text area like it is here so so yeah
two-point not that the function will be
a lot easier to use if you have to style
classes yeah so you can put as many as
many classes as you like with you ah if
you have more than one style sheet it
will probably be the second style to get
read you mean you mean if you for
example you have style sheet one and you
set FX opacity our style sheets to new
shirts FX a pasty there it will probably
be but inside inside the little box they
will tell you which style she is getting
the style from okay
so I am a lost my way a little bit let
me just find out
so yeah if we click on one of the one of
the guys that we actually styled we can
see that for this guy if I actually
choose the box because it's the box
really where I've added the the CSS
styling you can see that the default FX
background color act is actually
provided by the FX theme which in this
case is caspian dot CSS but it's being
overridden by my new colors which are
gray as well but anyway my new colors
which is in-home remote dot CSS so
hopefully and you know this CSS analyzer
will help you guys out a bit if you know
when you come to styling your app
okay so introducing scene builder
two-point not I have to show you this
slide it's really interesting and that's
enough of that okay so the major thing
about seeing build a two point naught is
componentization so effectively we've
rewritten two-point not pretty much from
the ground up the software architecture
is designed to facilitate IDE
integration so what this means is is
that the two point naught you'll have
you'll be able to take scene builder
make an instance of any panel and put
that inside your own scene builder if
you want to make one or if you if you
you know if you have an ID or an
engineer on an IDE you can make an
instance of these things in the IDE we
have NetBeans guys people from IntelliJ
saying that they want to see scene
builder especially the content view you
know this to see it directly inside
their app so basically you're going to
be able to do this with two-point not so
each panel is now an independent
component exposed by the scene builder
kit API and when we come to putting
scene build a two on the Oracle
technology Network the developer
previews will it will also come with
some documentation on the api's and how
to use them so and the scene builder app
itself is really just you know two
together parts of these simulator API so
effectively the app is just the final
result of of our own api's at that point
the other thing we've seen build a two
point naught is that it's we've used F
XML heavily so each panel of scene
builder to is is constructed using an F
XML layout so the inspector panel has an
inspector dot F XML library panel IBFX
mail etc and as I mentioned earlier
scene builder 1.1 is actually we're
using seemly at a 1.1 to build the F XML
for two point naught which is pretty
damn useful
and it's also an indication of 1.1 being
a pretty fully fledged app so and the
interesting thing with the engineers on
my team is that they love this approach
because when they look at their logical
code that one team builder there's very
little layout pollution so okay maybe
pollution is not the right word but it's
just logical code so all of the layout
stuff is abstractly abstracted out into
the F XML so for somebody like me is a
designer that's also very useful because
it means that I can directly go in
manipulate these F XML files as long as
I don't remove any F X IDs or remove
methods I can change the SS I can change
layout and generally I don't break stuff
so you know that's that's quite nice
keeps my keys my engineers happier and
you know like mo you broke load of stuff
that wasn't me anyway so yeah it's very
nice to be able to just go into a class
and not see you know new button.this and
loose-lipped pain here and blah blah
blah and just see the logical code again
oh excuse me
it's just a matter of taste but that's
how we're working into point not so SEMA
build a two point naught new features
demo and I have to give a little bit of
a disclaimer here everything I'm about
to show literally stolen straight from
the repo so it's fresh from the oven
it might be a little bit buggy but
hopefully everything will be out we'll
be okay so to begin with we mentioned
the scene builder kit so we do a little
demonstration of these kit components so
if I open up NetBeans
okay so I've a little project in here
called mini scene builder so let me just
run in and there is now he's not
particularly interesting at first glance
he's a window with four buttons really
but we can open some F XML so let's go
to desktop and open the little app we
were making earlier and then we can say
well okay I want to see the content
panel and there we go here's the the kit
in action so basically I've just
instance the content panel there so that
could be living inside and you know an
IDE that could be living inside your own
scene builder if you ever want to build
one or something like that and I can do
the same with the hierarchy panel I can
even make an inspector so if I select an
object you can see the inspector panel
the hierarchy panel they're all updating
and effectively it's its normal
day-to-day business for scene builder so
hopefully that's a reasonable example of
the kit in action
okay the other big feature for seam
build a two-point nor is custom
components now I'm I love building stuff
I'm not very good engineer I do it as a
hobby but and I especially like
prototyping things and I'm a designer so
I'm interested in in UI and how to
interact touchscreen stuff all that kind
of stuff so there's a little picture of
a little thermostat I've been working on
recently which I'll show you in a second
but custom components are going to be
really useful
you guys you'll probably love building
stuff you want to be able to go in a
scene builder take the custom component
you built and just use it as a node
inside your scene so you build a to
point naught you're going to be able to
do that so let me just pop back to
NetBeans again and
a little water one okay so here's my
little thermostat application so it's
mainly a visual thing but you can click
and drag whatever the amazingness is on
the wall of your house this would be a
touch screen you can set it to almost 30
degrees if you're a lizard and you have
a little toggle for Fahrenheit and
Celsius you can also resize the guy and
so basically this works so we're going
to use this now in our little home
remote app that we were building earlier
so actually while I'm here as well I'm a
so I'll show you the the fact that this
little guy is built inside F XML so if I
open up the view you can see that this
is M opened up and seen with a 1.1 he's
just a bunch of regions a circle an arc
which I use for the animation a simple
toggle button and some labels in a
circle so he's not particularly complex
you can also see if I go to the code
that there are FX IDs and this one I
mean by autofill if I remove that guy
because he's in attach controller it
will it will suggest a FX IDs for me and
I can even give me a list of the methods
that are declared in the controller as
well so
so that's our little thermostat so
fingers crossed all going well we're
going to now open up to point naught and
show how we can import that guy so I'm
going to pop back into NetBeans again
and I'm going to fire open the single
builder app now this tape should be good
okay so this is now seeing builder to
running and let me just make him so
these fits on this screen now the
interesting thing here is there is very
little CSS applied to this application
at the moment the only things that I
added as I put little rounded corners on
the search boxes to make them look
searchy
and if I say select a container you can
see that a slightly smaller font inside
the inspector so basically this app is
just using the new FX theme which is
moderner so hopefully it's an example
that you can build something pretty
complex with almost no CSS and it looks
relatively good straight out the box so
you can now just add a light layer of
CSS to this you know for individual
flavors if you like but certainly it's a
big improvement on the original Caspian
so maybe just hide some apps
so if I go into the NetBeans folder for
my thermostat project I see a little jar
there so I can drag that guy and pop him
in my library you can see I get an
import dialog it kind of works and there
he is
like say okay that's cool I like to
import him and then we get basically the
thermostat view inside the library so if
we open up our little home remote app
from earlier okay this is the bug I ran
into before let me just quickly run this
again as I said it's codes fresh in the
oven so it's a little bit delicate so
let me open the home remote app that
we've built earlier now you see the
first changes that the grid pane looks
slightly different it's a bit crushed up
so we haven't finished a grid paint
support in scene builder too yet so
that's the reason why so if I open the
temperature and let's get rid of the
anchor pain inside that title paint and
now if I just drag in our custom
component here we go so that could be
anything really but I can now preview
and we have our custom component working
inside our app and the nice thing about
that isn't now we can mess around with
the properties that we exposed inside
our custom components so if you really
are lizard and you want to make your
house really warm you can say set the
max temperature for example and now with
a bit of luck though ah maybe it didn't
take the change
there we go
how about so now you have a range form
30 to 60 so it's a simple demonstration
but custom components can be you know as
complex as you like so being able to
provide these things hopefully for two
point not if the team gets time we'd
like to do a bunch of custom components
that we actually give away with the app
that would be really cool and so we're
almost at QA so I don't know if you guys
a familiar way of j-f extras so this is
a bunch of guys who made a bunch of
JavaFX
components if you like so I'm just going
to show you quickly
so here's the JFX searches jar so if I
drag this guy into the library you can
see there's loads of stuff in here you
get a little preview of everything so as
a calendar picker etc so I'm going to
import just the clock bring that into my
app and there you go these are
third-party custom components not done
by us and by other people so it's going
to be pretty exciting in the future
people making great stuff even you know
new kinds of controls containers and
being able to use them inside your your
F XML
so again can set properties on that
stuff so lastly I have a scene builder
plug-in prototype for NetBeans that
hopefully I can show you so I think I'll
close my other scene builder
and this just goes back to the scene
builder kit and here we have it working
inside an IDE now this is really really
pota type stuff we only just got this
from the NetBeans team like a few days
ago but effectively you have a source
for you so here's the FX and mail we
have a hello world dot F XML here here's
the r2f XML itself and fingers crossed
and I can go to work Oh or not okay I
click the design view and now you're
seeing scene builders content view
inside the IDE and for example I can
let's see it will do it there we go
there's an inspector so I'm expecting
the hello Java one button that I just
selected so that again is the the scene
builder kit in action so I think we're
at the end I hope you guys enjoyed that
I hope that wasn't too painful for you
first Tech Talk I'm kind of sweating up
here and any questions nothing too
technical remember I'm a designer yes
yeah so that's a great feature I like
that there's some times when I added one
component yeah that's true yeah there
has been discussion but the problem the
problem with that scenario is that on
the scene build a team we're really only
responsible for own product so we have
to basically wait for whichever ID say
NetBeans we were working with NetBeans
so we have to kind of wait for them
until we say to them that's the kind of
thing we want and then they have to
really kind of do development on their
side to get that to happen but one thing
I can tell you is in two pointe-noire
and one thing you will be able to do is
just I didn't actually show you in the
demo but there is a little cog button by
every single property so if you're
adding an FX ID you can just go to that
little cog button and say copy code
block and I've basically rather than
having to open up that FX skeleton
controller and find it in the controller
and copy out the piece of the block of
code that you want it yeah you say copy
Cole block code block tablets and
NetBeans and then paste it in you're
good to go so we understand that you
know a lot of these kind of little
intros I need to be improved and while
we're waiting for the real deal which is
what you're suggesting that's really
that's why everyone once
we're also trying to kind of improve it
as much as possible you know before them
so yes
so I think that's more question for the
platform rather than the scene build up
but if basically in the platform of the
minute is SVG fully supported I'm pretty
sure is it limited or yeah yeah so so I
use like SVG parts if I want to change
so you like the shape of my tick inside
my check box or something like that yeah
yeah so at the moment I know it's been
discussed but I don't know if we have
any fixed plans is kind of at the minute
we're really concentrating on this
componentization and you know custom
components etc so but certainly will be
it will be something that we look at in
the future so yeah
so no it will run on eight and it will
it will have a feature allowing you to
change the FX theme so effectively the
app itself will run on eight and but the
you will be able to choose whether you
want the the content to be Starwood
Caspian or with mana visit yeah of
course yeah
um I don't see why not again I'm
probably not the most technical guy to
ask but I mean basically if you can put
a node whatever their construction of
that no-name is valid F XML if it will
load inside JavaFX which it load inside
us and build up so we have like three
and three more minutes for you
yes that's I did you say the help does
it
okay M right well we definitely have to
work on that and my excuse tear is with
quite a small team so I guess but really
that is inexcusable if there's places
where we're you know help is is isn't in
a knock bitten that's kind of bad so
I'll look into that as soon as I get
back
yeah yeah
yes
yeah okay yeah so yeah yeah I totally
see that requirement so and that was
something I looked at probably a year
and a half ago with one point one and my
answer from the engineers was there's a
feature inside one point one where you
can say show sample data that's only
getting closer really to what you're
what you're saying there and the fact of
the matter is is that we don't really
have a way at the moment to say you know
to select control and say Oh what do you
want how do you want to put a whole
bunch of stuff dynamically into that
control it would be fantastic lead over
that's a lot of UI it's also it has an
immense scope you know what what kind of
controls you want to add how many or
maybe a mix cetera so my answer there is
that there's nothing at the moment apart
from showing sample data we could
certainly improve that feature and we
might be able to add taste and
preference to that you know I want to
show sample day or as checkboxes or
something and but I think we're kind of
tied as in to how far we can go down
that road so really it's it's about you
kind of accusing the right container to
put your stuff into and then you have to
kind of run your project for NetBeans if
you're really are making a lot of
dynamic content but certainly I'll raise
it with the team when I'm back so have
time for one more if there's no more
then we're done oh okay
ah no fortune not and I'm basically
Oracle tells me I can tell you within a
year how's that if you don't tell any if
you don't tell anybody I can tell you
that we'll have Oracle technology
Network Developer Preview on OTN this
side of Christmas with a bit of luck and
maybe a little bit before so I mean I'm
as eager to get you guys using it as
soon as possible you know and when you
do please make jurors and chukkers
feature requests and anything else yes
sorry the applause from the other rover
I did that's kind of the same question
as this guy just asked me hopefully so
but yeah I can't say for definite yeah
and yeah it's in the roadmap it must be
true okay
there's guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
