Sheriff Chander
haha
now this is a full room i call this
developer density right here what a
great turnout i think i met some people
from china india already someone's here
from Egypt I think there's a fax small
faction here from Brazil I knew I could
count on you for for that warm welcome
so welcome to Java one again before we
start I just wanted to take a moment to
reflect a little bit on the last 21
years on this journey we've all been on
if you think about it Java is still
Center to everything we do here at
Oracle and for you it's been enriching
your lives professionally personally and
many things you do we've bet our careers
on an amazing technology but we also
want to think about as we continue our
journey and our learning we're
empowering that next generation of
developers to join this family I'm
really proud to see what Oracle Academy
has been doing to invest in this area
working with learning institutions to
make sure curriculum is available so
they can have the knowledge and gain
that knowledge that you have now to
complement that investment we're making
in Orlok Academy I'm really happy to
announce a new initiative that we're
starting go Java using the top-level TLD
Java it'll be a place a point or the
next generation can get inspired get
started and understand it's not an end
it's a continuing journey because every
day there's something new to learn and
it's our responsibility we're putting
that learning in their hands I don't
think anyone disagrees with that and to
help you on that learning process
we're also launching a new portal that
ties all of our developer initiatives
together where you can learn about all
of the developer efforts at Oracle under
one umbrella so you can learn about the
other initiatives and programs that
we're doing in other areas and that they
can learn from you as well
cross-pollination isn't that what it's
about so I'd like to know just do a
little bit of housekeeping the level set
this amazing week this amazing journey
you're going to be on for the next few
days over 450 sessions you're gonna have
the opportunity to go into 10 sit in
learn think about what I have to relearn
but while you're there I'd like for you
to also vote vote with conviction about
what you like what inspired you I'm
really happy that our Oracle technology
Network is working again with canoe
canoe in the house there they are
they've set up our Java voting machines
so you can tell us what it is you liked
in those sessions and who you liked
what's also important is for you to
download the official Java one
application from the app store of your
choice and you'll also be able to
provide online survey information for us
and why is that important so we can
continue to bring better information and
sessions for you year over year so for
all those program committee members out
there that helped out slog through
thousands of sessions and and proposals
thank you it was not an easy job so
thank you
I think some of them are going to be
asking me for a beer later I'm on it
also while you're here between sessions
we encourage you to visit the Java
pavilion visit some of our customers our
partners our sponsors and our exhibitors
who are investing in new innovations
around Java but also come and visit the
Java hub this will be a collection of
immersive Java and Oracle cloud demos
for you to experience please find the
time enrich ourselves outside of the
sessions as well one unique aspect of
what we're bringing today is an art
experience so Oracle technology Network
is partnering with the gluon team I'm
sure the glue on team is here there for
one person he's doing all the work he's
uploading the code right now so there is
also a gluon app you can download from
the app store of your choice look for a
Java 116 and map over to the hearing
next art experience you'll be able to
draw on your device upload that image
into the Oracle cloud you'll be given a
QR code you'll go to the Java hub you'll
see a CNC machine printing out that
image that you drew and then it'll get
printed and be created into a sculpture
during the course of the week and you
can see that what that sculpture looks
like towards the end of the conference
so please take it opportunity to enjoy
this experience I think it's gonna be
pretty pretty interesting of course you
can't have Java one without Dukes cafe
that'll be opening up tomorrow to get
your coffee in the morning what comes at
night get your beer at night there you
go try to find the time on Tuesday where
we will be announcing again our annual
Dukes Choice Award winners and we're
lucky to have the java community null
pointer band again playing that night so
Tuesday put it on your calendars be
there I know where I'm gonna be one of
these days and that's at the Duke store
I need to go home and take some schwag
for my kids but if you're looking for
the store this year please no it's been
moved to the parc 55
much better experience more interesting
technology publications but also a great
collection of Java schwag to come home
with and then of course you can't forget
concerts tonight we have American
authors playing here on Howard Street
come and join us but then on Wednesday
night sting and Gwen Stefani will bring
it down the house I think all of us will
go over there and have a good time AT&amp;amp;T
