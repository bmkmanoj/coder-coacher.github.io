so this session is intended to be an
introductory session on MEA and the
overview on the the the platform itself
so I'm Robert I'm responsible for the
Java ME development team and with me
today is my colleague Shiva who's over
here actively developing his demo right
now so we can demonstrate that later on
actually Shiva's developed the robot arm
chess demo yesterday and I don't know
how many people saw the episode most
everybody yeah so Shiva worked on the
robot arm to any controller for that for
about the last three weeks or so it was
interesting this morning I was reading a
blog don't remember who actually posted
it but I was reading a blog and they
were talking about the robot arm and how
they thought it was really an incredible
advancement not because the cost of the
robot arm was was not not necessarily
very very expensive but the fact that
this person actually had developed robot
type technologies 30 years ago the
computer that they would have used to
develop that would have been a lot less
powerful than the Raspberry Pi that that
was deployed on yesterday but what he
would have done to develop that
application would have taken him well
over a year to develop that that same
application and so what java provides
for you in the embedded space is really
the ability to develop applications very
very quickly so how many people in the
audience are embedded developers so a
few how many are Java developers ok well
actually so you're all embedded
developers ok so that's really the the
key of this of this presentation is
really to show how with Java ME 8 or
Java in general you all can become
embedded developers ok so required to
show the
the safe harbor statement at the
beginning and end of each of
presentations okay so what we're going
to talk about is the drivers behind Java
ME eight I'll give you some background
and overview about me8 talks but
specifically about the components of any
at any eight which are the c LD c and
the embedded profile talk about the
device access api or device i/o API and
then as i said she was going to give you
a demonstration and the demonstration
that he's going to go through he's going
to have a couple different devices where
he'll show how you can create an
application using an emulator and then
actually run those on the devices
themselves okay so we'll go through that
so the drivers behind Java ME eight so
you're gonna hear a lot at this
conference about the the Internet of
Things and when we talk about the
Internet of Things from the Emmy
perspective we're really talking about
the explosion of devices that will be
out in the world and we are in the
Internet of Things now where there are
many many many devices that are
communicating in a networked fashion to
each other and what's interesting about
this is that the device is what that do
something intelligently okay if you need
to have some logic on the device that
makes some sort of decision like you
have a temperature sensor okay a
temperature sensor could be really
really dumb and just report numbers and
send it off but if you wanted to do
something like have the temperature
sensor detect when it's reached a
certain threshold when it's become too
hot and you want to take some action
that's when the Internet of Things and
these devices become interesting and
that's where Java as a development
platform really also becomes interesting
because you want to be able to write the
applications that are deployed to those
devices in Java okay so for the folks
that raise their hand when I asked you
know how many embedded developers are
out there these are the challenges that
you currently face as
an embedded developer so you have lots
and lots of different devices with
different operating systems different
device drivers different configurations
you have to worry about security
reliability privacy you have to worry
about how long that device is going to
be out there you have to worry about how
much that device costs what kind of
power that device is going to use you
have to worry about how you're going to
provision the device itself how are you
going to get application updates out on
the device you have to worry about how
the application I mean how the data
flows from the device to to back-end
systems you should let's get rid of this
little reminder okay you have to worry
about interoperability and standards and
then finally as I mentioned already you
need to worry about how long does it
actually take to get these these
applications that are running on these
devices in out to market so if we wanted
to create a platform for the Internet of
Things or for these many different
devices what would be the requirements
that we would want in that platform well
we'd want it to be modern we'd want it
to be efficient we'd want it to be broad
and it we'd want it to be based on
standards and we want these things so
that we don't have things like vendor
lock-in or or or specific ties to
vendors when it comes to what types of
platforms that you can write your
applications to okay so let's get into
Java ME itself so again so actually most
of you raised your hands when when I
asked how many saw the robot demo so
that means most of you saw the keynote
and and heard the story about how Java
ME is really the little sibling of Java
SE it's not an absolute proper subset of
any but it's almost an absolute proper
subset with some additional enhancements
but the idea is that if you take and
write a Java ME Apple
it should run in Java se you have
libraries they should be able to be used
interoperable across across the to and
when a developer is making a decision a
decision about whether they should be
developing to Java ME or or SC it's not
really a question that should come into
their mind they shouldn't really
necessarily be thinking about am i
writing Java ME or SC what they should
be thinking about is what device is this
going to go to which will determine the
actual platform underneath that runs on
that device okay so it becomes a
footprint footprint trade-off and a
feature trade-off for the the platform
itself okay and as I said when I when I
asked everybody and I actually you know
said well you're all embedded developers
and that's really that the key here is
that you should be able to take your
java skills and be able to start writing
embedded applications so Java ME it's
me8 itself is really a major step
forward in the the platform and the line
that with with java SE now actually i
didn't ask this question how many people
are already Java ME developers so so two
or three okay so good so very and and
are you developing any embedded
applications or mobile applications
anyone okay yeah so so what you'll what
you'll note is that that's based on some
pretty old Java technology okay so for
you you'll be very excited to see a lot
of the new features in the platform that
we are that we are introducing now of
course we talked about the alignment we
have a new embedded profile which will
run on top of the the new VM which the
embedded profile defines an application
lifecycle for applications that you want
to deploy to Java ME and what we're
trying to cover is small devices okay
and so if I go to the next slide this
gives a pictorial view of the types of
devices that we're trying to cover and
the sort of the sweet spot of where Java
any
eight will focus on and I mentioned the
the types of devices the types of
devices that we're targeting again is a
device where you want to do something on
it you know something you want to run
some application logic you want it to
have it make some intelligent decisions
and that's really the sweet spot so
we're talking about about as low as 512
kilobytes of ROM for flash storage and
about 128 kilobytes of RAM for dynamic
okay and that's sort of the the sweet
spot and we start at that low end and we
would move about to up to 10 megabytes
of of of ROM and you know up from that
in terms of a ram perspective once we
get above 10 megabytes then you might
want to start thinking about developing
in Java SE embedded okay because Java SE
embedded 8 the compact profile will be
about that size so it will be able to be
put on a ROM of about 10 megabytes and
then of course it still would depend on
the particulars of the CPU as well so if
you have a very high powered CPU then
you might want to move up to Java SE the
less power you're gonna go and move down
to Java ME and that's what this this
picture is showing now yesterday or or
not yesterday but the the Raspberry Pi
chess demo runs both on Java ME and Java
SE ok the jaw the Raspberry Pi platform
is very powerful so you saw the slides
where they showed the the the the
performance of Raspberry Pi compared to
you know an Intel Core i7 and it was I
don't remember the exact numbers but
like a hundred times slower but that is
still a very powerful platform from a
Java ME perspective and Raspberry Pi is
a very very powerful environment that
can run that can from both Emme and se
and the reason why we put any there is
really to open up the the availability
to developers to be able to develop Java
ME applications very quickly and easily
and cheaply ok so some of the boards
that that you would
develop Java ME on have some more
components like wireless modules and
other stuff and the cost would be like
somewhere between two and three hundred
dollars whereas a Raspberry Pi is only
twenty five so or thirty whatever it is
and you can get started quickly doing
development with Raspberry Pi so I just
wanted to make it clear that the
Raspberry Pi isn't really the target
platform for any it's really powerful
okay the target is something much
smaller like this ST discovery board
which I want to pick it up because I'm
going to mess you up
but like this ST discovery board right
here which has one megabyte of a flash
and 256 or 198 okay 192
maybe 192k of ram that's really more of
the target for for Java ME and that
board costs that development board I
think costs fifteen dollars so that's
that's the other reason why we made that
available the port of Java ME to that
okay so what is Java ME eight so Java ME
eight is a customizable platform for
embedded Java development based on a
bunch of building blocks and those
building blocks are the base VM which is
called CL DC okay and there's J SRS for
this so that's j sr 360 and then on top
of that we have the embedded profile
which is j sr 361 and i'm going to go
into detail on each of these through the
through the slides as we move forward we
have the the device access api which
gives you access to the peripherals on
the device itself so how many people
know what a GPIO is good okay so so
that's the kind of thing that the the
device access API is going to give you
give it give access to and again Shiva
will give you some specific code so you
can see what that looks like
so Java ME 8 is a service enable
platform and what that means is that you
can dynamically load both applications
and services into the VM as it's running
and this is different than traditional
embedded software development right so
traditional embedded software
development you have your target
hardware you have an OS you're gonna put
on it you write a specific app you flash
it to the to the to the ROM and then it
goes out and it's done
there's no updates being made etc but if
there are updates are made you have to
reflash and all that sort of stuff so
it's pretty much a fixed type of
platform with Java we're making it
dynamic so that you can add your
applications as needed and change them
ok so we provide tools to be able to
build applications with Java ME and they
are called the Java ME SDK we have
plug-ins for both NetBeans and Eclipse
and you should have a unified
development experience whether you're
developing Java ME se or even Yui and
again cheeba will show NetBeans
development so let's take a little bit
deeper dive in to see LDC itself so
again CL DC is the VM ok it's the
virtual machine some of the as I
mentioned early this is really the the
the the big step from the existing Java
ME to any age is really an update of the
VM itself from 1.1.1 to 8 which brings
in some key features from from java SE 8
let's see ok so I think I'll skip to the
next slide which shows the particular
packages that are part of CL dc8 and GCF
I'm not gonna actually talk about GCF in
this this presentation so there's a
another presentation I think it's at
11:30 here or and
the month I think should think it's here
where there's a deep dive into CLD sea
itself so we're going to get a lot more
details about what's in CL DC etc so do
you go to that session if you want to
get more details than what I'm about to
show here so we really have two
different configurations for CL DC we
have the compact and the and the full
and the the compact configuration emits
niño files and channels and is really
targeted at the most the the smallest
device possible okay and what we're
setting up with ml with with with this
is really optionality so as the platform
grows over time we can add things
optionally and that's really one of the
key features of Java ME 8 overall is
optionality and I'll talk about
optionality more as we move forward in
the presentation okay so there's a
feature called stripping which the Java
ME 8 specification allows for which is
basically if you have a sort of the
model of deployment that I described
just before where you have a specific
application that you want to deploy you
know it's not gonna be dynamic you don't
really want to update it and has a
single function single purpose you can
run it through stripping which will
basically take the components of the
application and any anything that it
calls underneath from Java and create a
smaller executable or binary that that
can run not executable or binary but a
smaller flashed image that you can put
on the device okay and that's about the
small as we'll be able to go all right
so some of the new language features
they're all listed here I won't read
give examples of each one but we have
assertions generics enhanced for loops
auto boxing enumerations varargs so you
can see that there are a lot of new
language features that we are adding
more language features it's catching up
that's right we're also making updates
to the library itself so as you can see
the list of library enhancements that
were that we're adding and this isn't a
necessarily complete list of everything
but it's a good a good overview of the
types of things that we've added to the
library we have new collections as well
so yeah and I mentioned a little bit
earlier about about service providers so
so this is also being added to the to
the base the base platform you probably
know service providers but basically you
can instantiate and load services
dynamically okay so I kind of went
what's been added into Java me8 and I
think it's also important to understand
what's not in in Java ME ok and this is
this is the list of things that are not
supported in Java Java any eight that
are in job SC eight and the reason why
these are not supported is not because
we didn't have time to do it or anything
like that we did careful analysis and
and and and determined that if we added
these features to Java ME it would bloat
the size of of Java ME itself and now if
we had this then you're just becoming to
the size of Java SE and then you would
just you should just use Java SE so
really these are about keeping Java ME
small okay
so anyway so the this is the list that's
not there in Java ME 8 okay so and we
have as I mentioned before we have
development tools and what we what we've
done for for or what we will do for any
eight is that we will have be able to
emit specific warnings if you actually
use some of these unsupported features
in in me8 when you're doing your
development okay so in summary for for c
LD c we're aligning the language with
with se we aligning the libraries with
SE we have two configurations and we've
also updated the GCF framework which GCF
is is the framework for it's called
generic connection framework and it's a
set of classes and for networking okay
so the Java ME embedded profile this is
an evolution for those of you who that
have some experience with Java ME
development previously this is an
evolution of what was called I am P&amp;amp;G I
am PNG was a profile on top of Emmy for
headless development or none UI embedded
development so this is really a ng was
next-generation but this is really the
next generation of the embedded profile
and it builds of course on top of CL do
you see it's robust it's flexible and
has a lot of option allottee and it has
a new security model and we through the
optionality we can keep the the
footprint as compact as possible so and
I think this just really goes through
some of the some of the benefits of the
embedded profile itself in terms of the
optionality in terms of being able to
right-size the the application and I
have some more slides that go into some
of these in specific so right sizing the
platform for example so this is a pretty
busy slide but what this shows is
is the different profile sets within any
embedded profile that you might use as
as a developer so the minimal set which
really defines the application lifecycle
so you would define a midlet which is
the the application which gives you
things like being able to start/stop
destroy the the midlet would be in the
most basic basic profile and this will
give you the minimum minimum
configuration so if you wanted to have
CL DC which is something and then this
minimal configuration on top of that
this would give you the ability to
deploy applications dynamically - this
would give you the ability to
dynamically deploy applications - to the
platform of course the the the next up
from that would be the standard profile
set which adds support for multitasking
actually managing the applications
shared libraries etc and also whatever
optional packages you would want to
include based on your use case so
whatever your use cases in terms of you
know if you need a wireless
communication you might want to add the
wireless API or package on top of that
and then if you had the full set would
be all the optional and this next slide
is the list of the optional packages so
the full set would be all all the
optional packages
I'm sorry I didn't hear the question yep
but actually just wanted to see it okay
there you go these slides will be
available online later in the week
you'll be able to download them too so
okay so device access API so I asked
earlier how many people knew what a GPIO
is and this is what the device access
API gives you access to the peripherals
on the system on a chip and it's a
generic API it also allows you to be
able to do late bindings so that you can
add new peripheral types as well so sort
of a device driver for Java this is the
list of out-of-the-box support that we
have for different devices so we have
support for things like a pulse counter
80 commands you are spy I squared C etc
so these different access points and
this is actually one of the things that
that shiva will show in the demo will
show you how to get how to get access to
the device manager and our peripheral
manager and use the different different
pieces and I think that is where we are
right now
so let's transfer over to the
demonstration and sure absolutely
yes there was no gnj and i-44 Emmy
yeah there's no a dove no native enemy
yep
so by the way these are developers on
the Java ME team so yes yes so we can
transfer over any more questions yeah
availability yeah so actually that
that's my last slide so Java any eight
early access is available now so you can
go to the the Emmy I have the the link
at in the in the slides but if you just
search Java ME you'll go right to the
OTN page where you can download the
early access the early access runs on
Raspberry Pi and the SD discovery board
that I mentioned earlier so available
now and any eight final will be we're
not allowed to give specific dates but
sometime next
not in their near future no any other
questions thanks before we move over to
the demo okay let's do that
thank you Robert never gave me okay
okay great yep so what I'll be demoing
right now is a very simple application
that is trying to just turn on an LED
using GPIO so you can just see that how
easy it is to just build an application
like this in Java so let's try to go to
the con so so I'm using NetBeans with an
early access version of NetBeans that
works with the early access version of
me-80 SDK so so first thing is we just
go ahead and then create a new project
so let's call and it's a Java ME
projects and then it's a Java ME eight
application just click Next just give a
name like flashing demo next then here
we basically choose what's the platform
that you want to run on obviously I mean
you could have multiple versions when
the future but right now it's eight o
hero a early-access then the next thing
you see is a bunch of devices that you
can connect to so there are two devices
like embedded device one and device 2 or
nothing but emulators that you could try
to run your program on your desktop make
sure that it works so we do have an
emulator that can emulate all the
peripherals that Robert just talked
about then once you're comfortable with
it you could actually you you could
actually choose the device embedded
external device as your configuration to
deploy this application on a Raspberry
Pi or a discovery or any other board
that you want to test out the
application with so just called embedded
device one I say next and you say
finished so now we've got a templated an
application
so there are three methods that this
basically I mean I mean if you're
familiar with Java ME that mean Java is
he has this model of you write your
application you have a main class that
you instantiate and then your
application starts running in a me you
have a separate class called midlet and
then there's a lifecycle manager that
basically controls a lifecycle of this
application so when the application is
launched your startup method will be
called when your application is passed
your boss app method will be called and
when the application is ready to be
destroyed your destroy app would be
called so there is a in application
manager on the runtime that basically
controls the life cycle of the
application so let's start writing some
piece of code and startup method okay so
I know that I'm targeting the device
discovery so one of the API that robert
mentioned was this peripheral manager so
which by which you could act go on query
the peripheral manager and see what are
the devices that are already connected
onto the system so we could do
manager dot lists
so it gives you back an iterator now
this is good now I can't change it's
just a Java class you can just rename it
anything we want we can just say Hewlett
doesn't matter
so so all I can do right now is I can go
through the iterator and list all the
peripherals that is available sorry
out dot print line
next
think I need a crew
let me come back to that later okay so
selects I think I can show you like how
do you create a GPIO pin so let's create
I know that on the device on the
discovery board there are a couple of
LEDs that are already connected to the
GPIO pins on the device so I might
actually go ahead and then open one of
the devices so I can say GPI LED
so
so the pin number one is attached to one
of the LEDs on the device
so it could throw an exception that the
device may not be there so I just
printed an exception now all that all I
can do is I can just say LED dot set
value true so this does all you need to
do just to turn on an LED on the on the
device so let's quickly go ahead and
then try to compile this app and run it
on the emulator first and then try to
run it on the device next it's a clean
bill so the application is built now I
go ahead and then
I committed it out right now
so it's currently launching the emulator
and installing this application on the
emulator
they try to run it again
there you go
so as you can see I mean it's very clear
but it's gone hi so so let's try to run
the same I mean now we can she make the
change so that if you want we can try to
run it in a loop that way you can know
that it is it does change the values I
already got some in the interest of time
I think I'll just cut and paste some
code that I already have
so so what I've done here is I've
already gotten a separate thread called
flasher which is going to just flash the
LED that is going to which I'm going to
pass it to it so I can do something like
new flasher passing one which is the the
GPIO pin that I want to open and then
then I want to delay it for one second
and then I want to start the thread
there we go so let's comment out this
code we don't need this you can see now
let's run this code and as you can see
from the emulator you can see that you
are really controlling some exceptions
okay there's some build compile errors
turn on LED
I hope I think I picked all the errors
there's one more
okay
there we go so let's run it again
I don't think we need to
remove this
let's run it again
so now if you look at it you could see
that it goes between high and low so
you're just basically turning on the pin
so it's actually we use a led one it is
connected to the ID one so you can see
from the emulator so you have this so as
you can look at it like I mean on the
emulator you have this bunch of these
emulator devices already available to
you that's what you trying to access you
have like eight LEDs and three buttons
this on an emulator device now let's go
ahead and then run this application on
the real device let's stop this so all
you have to do to just to run it on a
real device is so simple you just create
a new run configuration so you you say
customize then let's call it the
discovery configuration discovery and in
the discovery configuration all I have
to say is as I told you before like
install saying an embedded device one
which was start getting the emulator you
just choose embedded external device and
that's all it is so now I can simply go
ahead and then deploy this application
on the on the real device
so it launched this control I mean
emulator control application which is
going to talk to the device to install
the application it does take a while
because it's a pretty slow device but it
should come up in a minute
okay
let me let me reboot them the discovery
board and try again one second
so we rebooted the discovery board let's
try again
installing this application on the
discovery board
yep there we go
so face wish too
about it so yes
so there we go so it's a search you can
look at the codes pretty simple and easy
to build a simple hello world like this
but this is exactly not means the kind
of ApS that we provide is much more
powerful and we can write applications
as complex as the what you see on the
right is actually it has very pie
without bits it's something called a pie
plate so basically it's a pretty complex
device which consists of a board and a
GPA you expand your chip and you have an
LCD controller and then a bunch of
buttons that you can try to control the
the device with so unfortunately due to
I mean I cannot access the device but I
could show you code as to how mean how
you could very easily write these kind
of device drivers so on on using Java ME
8 so any questions before ok thanks
also there's a USB cable so currently
the discovery board needs to cables one
is one minion on a microUSB one for
power and one for we actually use PPP
over USB to communicate as you can
communicate with the device so sure so I
mean I don't have a demo to show but it
could I mean we could show it in the
demo booth where we could show in
Raspberry Pi controlling an LCD played
using the same me8 APs okay alright so
and I think that concludes the talk I
have one more slide which actually is a
pointer to this one working yeah so I
have one more slide that's a pointer to
the download of Java ME 8 early access
so you can start playing with it on
either Raspberry Pi or the St discovery
board
so please do download it and give it a
try and that's if you can yeah you're
gonna switch it over so we'll just leave
that up and open up the floor for any
more questions yes
sorry
I recommend you download it from that
site so the question if everybody heard
was should we use our own NetBeans or
download the NetBeans that we're
specifically pointing to from the me8
download site and yes you've specific
one that build has the support for Java
ME eight that's that's the only build
that that has it currently now if you
want to develop the application outside
of your connection to the the SDK and
the emulator and just deploy the
application straight to the device
without using the componentry that we
have you can do that but you wouldn't
have the you wouldn't have access to you
know the the quick connection between
deploying the application within
NetBeans you'd have to actually go
through the command line interface and
deploy the application that way so you
can do that too but it's a little more
complicated so definitely recommend
using the the NetBeans that we point to
from that site it's a 7 it's a 77.4
build so the the version of NetBeans I
guess we called NetBeans 8 when it comes
out will have full support for for java
SE 8 and java NE 8 when it when it comes
out so and again that would be sometime
next year yes we have both NetBeans and
Eclipse support yes yes so but for the
early access we own it's only NetBeans
but for the final we will have both yeah
yep
right so that's that would be a job for
the actual team that's that's gonna make
the VM run on on that SOC there's a port
yes yes yes right and that's why you see
that's why you see there's actually a
lot of announcement this announcements
this week about our partnerships that we
have with different sov SOC vendors like
freescale and qualcomm in fact we had a
competing session going on right now
from folks at Qualcomm where they're
showing how to develop Java ME
applications on their board which
unfortunately I think would have been a
great session for you to go to but at
the but it was at the same time yeah I
think again you saw at the the keynote
yesterday they brought up the developer
from apex apex labs who developed that
home light bulb application that's the
platform that they're they're showing
that they showed in that in that in that
other session it's basically a it's a
it's it's a development board with with
wireless modules on it so that you can
actually have it communicate wirelessly
more questions yep go for it
yep yep not not today but we have so
device access i io API specifically we
will be available for Java SE sometime
in the future yeah no it so so yes
you're right and and the the the
decision point today is really about is
really about some of the features and a
a size trade-off that you'll need to
make now in the future so we're Java SE
8 and Java ME 8 is really the first step
towards the the you know unification of
the two things so in the future Java SE
9 Java Java ME 9 will will get it even
even closer but so this is really the
first step and so you know I without
knowing the specifics of what platform
and the you know exactly what features
to decide on I mean that that's what you
need to look at to make your to make
your decision so yeah so if you have a
very powerful device like a gateway
which has you know great CPU and plenty
of memory yet you still want some of the
some of the types of functionality that
that ME provides some of those api's you
have to find some other substitute for
those but but there you can you can find
them if you look
yep
well it depends on the device so so so
you know Raspberry Pi you can do that
but on that the STM ist discovery you
cannot run se so there's no choice there
you're the only choice the end time
you're going to be making choices is
when you have a powerful device yes
that's a powerful device very powerful
yep
and I mean in in general if you if you
have the power in general I'd say if you
have the power you probably would go be
going with Java SE because then you have
all the all the all the language all the
libraries so in general I would say that
but again it depends there is no future
in CDC so CDC is being replaced by the
the SE what was called the SE compact
profile in java SE 8
so the question is what's the
performance of an application written on
top of this compared to an application
written in C or C++ right yeah
so I actually probably probably do you
have a an answer to that did you hear
the question okay so it's okay I know
you just saw you looking at your so the
or or like D okay all the go ahead
it does not have hotspot in it that's
right
yep show that device listing mm-hmm I
want to show the device no okay any more
more questions okay so actually super
wanted to show the device listing thing
that wasn't working previously so switch
back so all you do is thank you probably
so all you do is just create a list of
peripherals that are available on the
thing so you basically pass in the GPIO
pin and then you list and then all you
have to do just print the list of
iterators and then and you get all the
devices that are available there I can
say next configuration
yeah I think yet you can get back more
information about the thing so the one
way of doing is this will only give you
back information that is on the platform
so for example on the Raspberry Pi you
don't have any devices on there on the
PI so you won't have any of these
pre-configured platform devices so so in
typically in Raspberry Pi then you
typically control it using I mean
whatever your calculator is right you
see your SPR any of the buses then you
have to do you have to know it the
system will not tell you that these are
devices connected anything that we
expose it through the platform is what
you'll get through the peripheral
manager so in the case of discovery we
already pre-programmed those three
ladies to the 3gpp open so you'll see
them on the list but that's that's about
it it wouldn't go and tell you what is
there on the other buses thank you any
more questions okay well thank you very
much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
