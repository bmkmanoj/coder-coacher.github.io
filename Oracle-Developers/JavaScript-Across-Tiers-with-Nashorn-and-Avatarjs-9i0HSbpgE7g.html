javascript across tears using mass harm
and our touches how many people are
JavaScript developer already familiar
with JavaScript oh my god and how many
of you are not she is not it oh ok I
hope you will learn something and I
probably will learn something from you
guys I'm masti gara person yes there is
a pointer oh here it is a wonderful
wonderful thank you okay this is a I
mean I'm not selling any product here
i'm not going to do any product pitch
but usually when we talk about future
things you know we use this legal
document to protect ourselves okay so
this is the agenda javascript what is
the evolution of web application
architecture and then we look at an ass
on JavaScript engine on the JVM then a
very special example we're gonna run
JavaScript directly in the database we
can discuss you know why would you want
to do that and then i will look at
avatar JS a little bit of project avatar
it gives you what i know about it and
then look at a kind of more complete
complex table where we use avatar Diaz
application and access the database
using jdbc on UCP and it's a very
interesting case because you would see
that the integration of Java and
JavaScript allows you to reuse Java
libraries without
any effort okay so that would be very
interesting they mode to look at okay so
this is the latest Fred monk report and
you can see that the top two languages
have in most popular languages java
under a script java we know why because
you know it's a son and orca have been
investing a lot then there is a lot of
operation you know many most vendors
have you know pushing java you know not
only our concern my I p.m. in all the
big names and all companies have
invested in Java some have invested in
dotnet as well in the C sharp and
company what we know about that we know
that many developers web developers they
used to have a script on the can't see
it so I don't like this number is
because of client tiras JavaScript or if
this is also because javascript is now
going service on I don't know but bottom
line is those two languages are very
popular okay so we know that Java is
already available I mean you can use
Java on every tier you can use Java in
browser algo Java has kind of lost a
little bit of steam in the browser but I
combatives anybody here using Java
affects you and then we know that I by a
meteor no we all we all know Java here
all those containers in weblogic web CH
a burst of God and coping very few
people know that you can also run java
in the database anybody here knows about
it java in the database okay it's not
only uncle i mean i think some of the
databases also have java I fix Ibis
come early you can't run to have
anxieties I know that even db2 you come
on Java not the same approach but you
can run the other I mean the question is
why would you want to run Java in
database as opposed to a proprietary
procedural language and one of the
motivation is skills and reuse of code
if you already have to have a code you
can just reuse in database not that ye
but java SE okay so now the question is
can the other script accomplish the same
thing and that's the purpose of my
presentation so a little bit of history
I mean javascript is started in the
browser I mean most people are familiar
with javascript in the browser and so at
that time all the connectivity business
logic presentation building all those
back-end connectivities you know all the
heavy stuff where dot in the media on
javascript in the browser was just used
for local validation and playing some
sound things like that so we are all
familiar with that you know allows the
how web application were built in the
past and then note is not programming
model appears okay so this is an event
based programming single-threaded
architecture but even based on blocking
and some people say it is easier to use
you know I have the experience of Ruby
on Rails where people say Oh Ruby on
Rails you know it's easy you just type
rails on any generates everything for
you but the thing you realize later is
if you want to do more advanced thing
you need to go into the generated
framework and do a lot of tuning
yourself so i don't know if not yet has
the same thing if people say it's easy
because the first approach it looks easy
but later on when you want to do more
advanced
if you need to you know I don't know
people who are familiar if not yet maybe
you can speak up if you have any
experience what is your take on east of
development no tears is it even later
yeah always easy as you're working
equipment you get business there then
and we were right and we've heard that
some companies have even moves you know
from Java to JavaScript for service I'm
so I don't mighty reason I think one of
the reason is the event-driven
non-blocking approach allows them to
sustain more more concurrency on one
single threaded note instance I think
that's what I have anyway the bottom
line is we've know there is a large
community there are tons of frameworks
you know you can find bunch of
frameworks but the problem is there is
no standard for example you want to
access the database which standard
they're a bunch of frameworks but there
are specific drivers / database for
example in JavaScript there is no one
standard like in Java everybody knows
jdbc even though there are proprietary
extension you can use till standard ed
bc to talk to any database i don't know
i don't think there is such a thing in
in not yes javascript well anyway what
I'm trying to say with this line is
between no tears
javascript move of the browser and
become a serious contending for middle
tier and the evolution of web
architecture also is reflecting that and
you can see that more and more people
put a note yes as a front end for all
the back end operations of course they
do some stuff here as well for example
all the exchanges you know for the
WebSocket all the rest all those things
are now handled easily by notice and no
TS framework but the back end I mean the
connectivity and the business logic I
mean commonly still I mean people also
want to reuse what they already have
they are they have invested a lot in
Java or.net C C++ they want they don't
want to throw those away or maybe new
applications will be built entirely
there's a note but I mean the current
evolution is people will front end all
the existing services with no anybody
has any comment on this evolution of web
application architecture no is that what
you do today are you not already here
are there yet so I wanna email you ok ok
ok
just not practical step okay and then
you let me see it even at like the back
end okay this is something similar
Johnson okay thank you so that's
evolution and then there is a temptation
and perhaps it's going to become a
reality to co-locate not not no tears
itself but not API undef the avatar is
with java on the DVF okay so we already
have JavaScript on the TV and with masks
on okay so why not try to implement the
no DP is and this way we can host we can
co-locate everything on the TV m and the
benefit of doing that is as we said you
can leverage your existing Java
investment in Java by the same token
leveraging everything no TS can give you
this or not avatar TS is this attempt to
provide a node compatible API that will
run in the JVM ok ok so now that's the
evolution that's where things are
supposed to go i ha ok so now let's look
at that I script engine on the JV a
class project mask on and this is here
so it's been introduced in Java 7 and it
supports of course the scripting epi
which is common for all the scripting
and that's raw not be the gvm you know
I've heard about deer would be tight on
all the girls all those things can never
told this Jessa but also nos Han so now
Sean is there now and it is a
replacement for rhino I heard that the
reason they came up with not only
to fix some security and performance in
rail anybody here familiar with right
I'll have you seen any performance
between I mean I don't know if you
trying that song but have you seen any
performance difference which one is lot
faster oh really ok that's a good to
know ok so doubt how are the good
justification to do that project the
other thing is it allows you a similar
sentiment interaction between Java and
JavaScript so you can invoke JavaScript
Java you can invoke Java from there by
script and vice versa it's going to get
the benefits of all world ok so that's
an asshole it's a terrace whip engine or
the deviant ok to illustrate that I'm
going to show you a special demo which
is running JavaScript in the database
using mass horn so you might see why do
we want to do that and that the the
answer is for the same reason we have
been running java in the database you
know the reason are you have skills so
traditionally any database has they own
procedural language you know you take
sequel server DB to oracle has its own
PL sequel which is the procedural
language its proprietary the question is
how many collect crap is no PS equal
zero and how many of them know java some
number you know although now they don't
teach have an emo incorrect is they
teach PHP or some scripting language is
perhaps my script so that's one reason
the second reason is reused you know if
you have existing code you can just
reuse directly in the database we're not
talking about java ee java SE ok the
other benefit by running our in the
database and i can talk about it because
I've been doing product manual for that
for years a power law in the room in the
back there is the
manager for the Java VM in the database
so we've been shipping the rav my paw
report for since 8i the release aight
aight that many many many customers who
are using it because they understand if
you I mean this is my ruler from my run
some code in the database instead of
just sickle reform is if you are
manipulating more than let's say twenty
to twenty-five percent of the data it is
better to ship the function in the
database to do the manipulation and give
you the result set then we move the data
from the database to middle tier and
process okay so you cannot cash the
entire database in the media so it makes
sense to do java in the mid I mean queen
data in media if you only accessing and
manipulating you know twenty to
twenty-five percent of the data but if
you need to access the entire data set
it does not make sense that's called
data shipping on everybody knows that
ship is repairing okay so that's the
motivation after the reason I mean we
are not there yet it's just a proof of
concept okay so just to illustrate the
fact that we can run JavaScript anywhere
where we have a TV n and mask on that's
the that's why I was to demonstrate okay
so in order to do that you need a
database to FC why because only Database
12c is java SE seven in order to use
mass horn you need to at least half
dollar seven seven or eight so previous
releases of oracle database they do not
have se7 that did not even have sc6 they
have a c5 so by default when you insert
oracle database and you choose to have
java installed its installed version six
but there is a fair script a very simple
one-line perl script that you want to
upgrade to java ssf so this is not your
traditional jdk it's
built-in DVM so it is it purposely built
for the database so it's not like you
can just yank the JVM and move a dump
analogy TV no you cannot do that it
requires in a specific development okay
so you need the 12c database with java
SE a neighbor and then you need to load
the nuts home yeah fine and by using the
loop tabacum and that's how we load Java
in the database and you can load nasum
jaja now we want to invoke mass on from
sequel how to invoke Java from sequel by
creating a wrapper on this is the rapper
rapper is called an H so if I call an H
what's gonna execute is in fact this
Java and this Java Prague is the not
smash hard shell this is the shell that
with one of course you need to grunts um
permission to this schema where you want
to run this thing so you need to check
with your database administrator if you
want everybody accessing the database to
have access to that you can load into
the system schema and make public
synonym so everybody else can access the
same cook okay so that's how we're gonna
do it now I'm going to show you this is
the code i want to run this is the
javascript code and i want to execute in
the database and you can see here that
okay this is a purely javascript okay
but we are just using jdbc the
server-side tdb see this is the jdbc
driver when you are already running java
in the database you don't use the
client-side URL you need you use
especial con a URL this is the URL to
connect URL ok this is the sequel
statement we want to run so here we
establish a connection we prepare a
statement we execute the statement and
we recoup the result set
and we display we I mean we just recoup
the result set and I'm gonna just print
the result set on the concern that's the
demo so let me show you the demo this is
how the demo work you know and the file
the JavaScript I show you this
javascript file is stored in a file
named temp database 30s I'm gonna
connect to the database I'm gonna do
something to flush the buffer of the
database I mean the secret because they
to build up my show on console if I want
to see on console I need to invoke this
function and then I mean to call
Marshall and give two naps on as
parameter the javascript file so this is
the easiest proof of concept I mean the
best approach will be to load the
JavaScript inside the database itself
okay and not invoke the nass hon
interpreter bar invoke some wrong time
okay and return the result set as a ref
cursor which is the color ball stupid
when you invoke is stored proc in the
database you can return a handle and you
use the handle to retrieve the result
right right now I'm not doing that so
those are future enhancement that we can
do to the proof of course so let me show
you the table I have a virtual box and
virtualbox I have a database I have
everything show user if I say this
okay um if you look at the file the file
I can show you but I mean it's already
what is what is on this on the sniper so
you can see this is exactly what was on
this side ok so that's what I'm going to
execute so I quit here and I say set
server
this is just a way to flush the output
of execution of Java to the konza ok so
it does what it did run and the prod is
showed the result set you know these are
all user name password from the
employees table this error here at the
sorry Scott is zero which mean today is
was an error but the the reason it is
from here is that in the nation' one
time it invokes some exit internal code
that's why we have in that so it does
does not mean there is a problem okay so
they have any question on this
demonstration which is a proof of
concept nobody will do that in
production any question no ok so back to
the presentation
okay so that's why we just demonstrated
capacity move okay now we're going to
move to an OTS and habitat so that's the
idea the idea of avatar Diaz is to have
a no es compatible framework that will
run on the tvm and that will live for
java code using you know you can have a
threat you can invoke you know anything
you want in in the loop style you know
in the note programming style which is
event face so here we can have threads
because this is Java in the north cheers
and wherever you don't have threads but
you can scale by spawning processes and
also they use process to scale whereas
Java you use thread to scale okay but
this is it offers the same model which
is the non-blocking model so the
challenge here is when you invoke some
Java code how do you make this Java code
non-blocking because the way note works
is non-blocking otherwise you will
because it's only one thread if you are
not non-blocking you're going to block
the thread and everybody else will be
stuck behind you so you need to make it
not working so a vac ideas of Apache yes
is the implementation of no tears so it
offers ninety-eight percent of AP is of
no dhcp eyes and if you have any
framework which is built for Nadia's you
can run it on Abbott ideas if you go to
the Avatar tears page they show you all
the JavaScript frameworks I mean all the
no tears frameworks which have been
certified to run on top of Abbott ideas
ok it is it's been open source by organ
avatar yes it's been open source by York
it's being developed by Oracle bot open
source I don't know if many people are
contributing I think right now okay
the sole contributor to it but it's out
there and it's open source okay so there
is avatar is and there is Project avatar
in fact I wattages come from Project I
might have a project avatar has a big
ambition than just providing a node.js
compatibility and this is this slide
it's kind of a summary of project avatar
they would like to come up with a sort
of enterprise notice on the JVM so they
want to provide multiple event loop so
the traditional odious only offers one
node yes loop so we've about a
protective atty they want to have
multiple loops and they can have some
load balancer here they can have shared
sockets they can you know they can do a
lot of stuff you can invoke job are you
can invoke anything you want I mean it's
a more scale than one look one load loop
okay so that's the purpose of project
avatar and Oracle itself has the
ambition to do more integration with its
own product so for example this is the
entire stack you can see here that there
are integration with coherence which is
the data cache never data cache there is
a weblogic t3 thin client to do remote
invocation of etv or TMS there is
eclipse links there is the flight
recorder which allows you to interact
with vision control which is a kind of
manageability and monitoring tools for
weblogic so a project avatar is a
proprietary extension to make no TS
enterprise thing but I think that we'd
be making an announcement at javaone I
don't need they already deeper I'm not
part of the project I've attaching but
I've just told they will be talking
about the statement of two
action at during this javelin because if
you got on the web people say okay our
last year was announced on people's okay
so since then what is happening walk oh
where are you going with project avatar
what's going on what's going to happen
and there were no response and they told
me that they were given and said this
java one so i don't know if they already
did but I don't know if you monitor all
together a beta or gamma script session
maybe some of the session we talked
about what is the duration of project
habitat but the slide I'm presenting you
was until recently the original goal of
the project ok so now it comes to my
demo which is only focus on Avatar teeth
I'm not focused on have a tap project I
mechanical I don't know what's gonna
happen to that project but I'm focused
on Abbott ideas so I'll show you a demo
where we are using Abbott ideas and
invoking jdbc and invoking Oracle
universal carnation pool so why are we
doing that we are doing that because our
in in no tears there is no standard for
database connectivity if you want to i'd
say that the beginning if you want to
connect with it ability to have a
specific driver for that database well
as if you are using avatar tears you can
just use your jdbc driver ok so the demo
I'm going to show you it's been done
with zero development we did not ask a
single development from our tech team
you know we just pick the vanilla
televisi driver and we just use the
existing avatar death and that's it you
know we did some enhancement and I'll
described as an instrument to the upper
layers you know those
three files I built by us and if we get
all the approval we cannot publish them
so we took the abbot ideas we use nurse
horn library we'd use our jdbc driver I
probably have a condition full library
and that's it and with that shows the
power of the integration of avatar TS in
Java so you can just use any existing
Java library to compensate missing
pieces in no TF that's for me the great
benefit of the integration Indonesia so
let me show you so in order to do that
one thing we need to do is make any bc
invocation non-blocking jdbc is a
synchronous api blocking if we want to
use it with about ideas we need to make
it non blocking on the way this has been
done it's through those two functions so
this first function here takes a
function and return the result flu call
back you know i'm not very expert in in
otso don't ask me too much detail or i
can tell you is this meg execute call
back make your function return its
output through combat and the second one
will submit this function to the event
loop the post event loop post here will
post the function to the event so it
will send the event to execute the
function and we're gonna get the result
through call back okay so with those two
pieces I can now take any kdb capi and
for example we took execute query and by
using the make execute callback and
submit we make it non blocking and we
did the same thing for all the other 2d
BCT I know get ganeshan create statement
prep call as it could update exactly the
same
think the same approach you take the
function you use those two functional
make execute call back and submit and
you turn this into an unbroken this way
it will work in the node environment
okay so that's what that's what we did
by working with the people who are very
knowledgeable in in a bukkake yes and
this is the application on this
application ok so this application you
know you use the framework we have the
flop you know the jdbc 30s and
Connecticut connection provided at yes
okay so it creates a server Gary
carnation trip a statement and execute
and grab the result set into the
response object and the resource object
will be returned to the browser when we
listen to the server on power 4000
that's what the program does in fact
it's the same thing as for what we did
within the data is but in this time we
are returning the result set to the
browser so that are we did and I'll show
you the demo now okay so we come here we
go to the come here okay so this is the
this message and you can see that we are
using we are using I can make it bigger
if you are not you come at cinema you
can see that we are using Java 8 we are
using jdbc seven thats the TD bc driver
for me jdk 7 where it works also with
jdk 8 that's the connection pool that's
our tight ears and that so that is
server
and this is the our application the
application one dot J so if I invoke
this function now NYC prep start on sh1
it says 4k database connection ok i know
that it got a connection and I can go to
the browser and I can go to the power 4
thousand so i can get a new one here ok
so let me see what is if it says
database server ok i know that i can i
can ok so now i can go to the browser
and go to paw 4000 so it's recuperating
the results yet you know this is exactly
the result i wish you in the pretty
pretty in the first demo it's getting
this from the database ok now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna use apache ad
which is a load generator I'm going to
connect 10 at the time and I'm gonna do
kind of 1000 connection and I'm gonna
invoke I'm gonna listen to the processor
it's a HTTP so what is happening here is
that we are exercising you know hitting
the server with many many many many
requests and this is a way of using the
connection pool so the bottom line is
here is that with very little code I
mean no development by just some code we
were able to turn a an existing I mean
synchronous application into an
asynchronous which would work with about
ideas and that's what we wanted to
demonstrate you know which is you can
use the JavaScript in the database on
top of national simple JavaScript or you
can use nokia's compatible avatar keas
application on top of habit ideas Nash
on using jdbc UCP to access the database
okay so that's the end of my
presentation if you have any question we
still have a lot of time x squared
announced tomorrow our topic into their
know which is it's some sort of object
relational mapping here awesome awesome
yeah so I did not know all those detail
I mean I need there will be announcing
things and I know in substance but you
cannot see but I'm happy that you were
able to to convey that information thank
you very much so it did he say they will
open saucedo okay yeah that's the way I
heard that they will open source project
avatar okay yeah
you cannot use it in production
environment okay so okay okay so Alec I
can tell you what I know and people in
the audience can add more to it so what
I know is first of all from the browser
to the middle tier I'm into the server
side people have many secure
connectivity you know there are many
framework that many odds all those
things to ensure you you have a secure
connection to the backend so on that
front you know we're covered on the
server side you can use all the jdbc
authentication all the advanced jdbc
authentication you know in this demo we
were using the simple user name password
where we can use kerberos we can use
everything the activities to support so
did all the Java layers are production
proof I mean people have been using our
TD bc for centuries I'm killing now I'm
attached yes and you got a point I don't
know what is the quality of avatar tears
for production use but I think the same
thing is true for all the devil script
frameworks you know people just post
their bicycle frame work out there and
customer use it they find it good enough
they use it in production we know
big company you notice look it from ok
coming do that ok give me wipe down the
rich production company user elephant it
is right now I don't know any doing that
I don't know so we know to unite the jvm
is and that is co 47 years right now
also can you see this really successful
production when I wiki which episode
bank then all the food for Dennis's also
know I see so there are two things ok
there are two things to fix there is a
batatis middle tier ok and there is
simple JavaScript with NASA on in the
database so let's talk about database
and then we can come back to the
material for the database the JVM has
been around since 8i which is more than
seven years which is about 14 or 13
years I mean Paul can correct me if I'm
wrong but it's been around for a long
time and we've been enhancing that
followed and I can tell you that they
are me many many customers who use in
fact there are few companies where the
deaf ear is not installed on the way we
know that is customer voluntarily
provide log files to oak or you know
they allow Oracle to make sent back log
file and we can look at the loyola and a
funnel which features are they using and
we were able to see that you know a
great percentage but it's not only the
percentage it's in any company you will
find some instances of java vm
use inside the database may not be used
for you know critical production but
it's used to do something it because
it's the purpose is to do something
specific okay and i can tell you the
largest java in the database user its
public is the norwegian labor
administration they have more than 8,000
concurrent users those are terrorists
who pay pension funds unemployment
benefits and they have 8,000 employees
for the whole norwegian and they use
java in the database from 8am to 6 p.m.
every day so that's the largest
deployment we have in production ok so
if java in the database we still have
issues and we will fix those issues but
it is production quality and people have
been using it for years so that's
covered ah now let's move to the middle
tier so you saying that some companies
have moved to note yes that's true I
don't know anyone who is using Abbott
idea because that's new avatar GS has
been pushed I mean last year so I don't
know any company who is using in the
production that's true and regarding OTS
acha itself is developing a Pew she
bears no tears driver to access the
Oracle database so that's he working on
that but for me it took us few days to
use the jdbc who if our Tydeus and do
exactly the same thing they are trying
