to this Internet of Things architecture
session it's our pleasure to be here and
share whatever we know with all of you
guys thank you for coming I would like
to make a brief introduction about
ourselves this is Venetia changer we
have been working for several years with
the java community so members of the
soul Java user group since 2001 this is
the 13 Java one in each of these
participating has the beginning of
career as an arc when Sun instructor for
java we have been talking about IOT
since 2011 and got a Duke Choice Award
for Internet of Things so that's a
little bit about venezia singer a little
bit about myself and have also been
working with so Java which I am
president today for the user group I
encourage all of you to participate on a
user group it helps a lot I got the
title of Java champion some years ago
and I was collaborating on screen toys
project for a jsf 1 dot 2 and also as a
demo for a glassfish before changing a
bit for Internet of Things and also an
alternate member for the java community
process executive committee we both got
the honor of having the title as java
one rock star speaker in 2012 with the
evaluation of the public so that's a bit
of us the agenda today we'll talk about
IOT project and scenarios so there are a
bunch of different kinds of IOT projects
that can be made and different
architectures for each kind of project
the basis for architecture a little bit
of computers and boards the models for
architecture its will share some
experience we had on our own project and
show some demos
I'm gadgets so some years ago to talk
about internet of things here at javaone
it need to be carefully hidden inside
some Java EE so this changed a lot in
few years it's impressive on how the
Internet of Things topic have grown
inside the community and that's not only
for java community but for most
programming language nowadays so in few
years we change it from one or two java
one talks on this subject for almost
fifty percent of the talks on this
edition so it seems that it could be
just a hype but we can see lots of
business opportunity and believe it's
not only a hype when we talk about
internet of things in the beginning we
would be talking more about do it
yourself or startups and today we had a
very complex scenario for gadgets
creativity industry automation and lots
of fields and we had all the growth of
mobile mobile application mobile apps
and lots of people that wants to be rich
developing their own apps and now aday
we have we see and giant or business
opportunity that goes beyond the mobile
the smartphones so when we talk about
Internet of Things there are wide
variety of possibilities and monitoring
environmental and animals trees that's a
huge opportunity two days so you can see
on this picture how they monitors
turtles and dolphins and birds and lots
of species so how internet of things
could be applied to this to all the
environmental problems we have today and
all the humanity is looking for a
solution
we also have our famous james gosling
project most of you have probably know a
little bit about how they are monitoring
the ocean and all lots of real-time
processing for that giant use case and
success story for that we also have
things that I'm more on the front side
so when you go and you see this project
like tweet pea it's basically a humidity
sensor and it's showing when the baby
has done its work so they start very
early to tweet so and we have been seen
on do-it-yourself project tones of very
very fun projects that can be used to
learn and especially to motivate people
when we see this very simple project
this can be life changer for a
university or for students that can we
very simple technology see how they can
start and finish their projects so I
believe these things can be life changer
not for the baby neither for departments
so let's share a little bit about some
things some experience we have with
things several years ago
was why sorry so this is a very
interesting project we have been working
on several years ago this is a nuclear
reactor and we were using hardware and
software to control arm the arm of the
that holds the things that were being
analyzed on the nuclear reactor so yes
very was a neutron diffractometer in
Brazil the first neutron de facto meter
in South America so we have been using
that that was running on top of NetBeans
platform and that was way before all the
Internet of Things era that we are done
here to test this project another very
interesting project was the horse
telemetry so the idea was to show the
GPS the solano meter and the heartbeat
for the horse so this horse was were
being trained and they went to analyze
how good the horse was before buying a
horse so they were measuring everything
on the horse when the horse was jumping
and we know this activities this is
another project we'll be talking more
about that wetness day and we'll talk a
little bit about that on how we could
use Arduino and raspberry pi and Java to
make an automation on a sailboat so all
the automatic pilot and other features
that we were doing inside our own
sailboat and this is a very interesting
kind of problem to solve because that's
our own problem right everybody has
their own problem their own dreams and
your own things so it's very good it's
very rare when we developers we can work
on our own problems in general we are
solving our customers problems
and when we can stop a weekend or a
month or some days and work in our own
dreams on our own projects it's very
very pleasure to be able to do that well
the robots they were the very start I
believe lots of people when starts with
electronics and raspberry pi and Arduino
it starts with robots that's a passion
for a lot of people since we are
children we see the robots and all the
power and in in the way of learning
learning math and learning how to use
components it's very it's a very quick
and good start point so we have
developed several projects with robots
most of them very cheap robots and some
of them designed to teach kids and
teenagers on how to program so very nice
feedback as well another project that
opens lots of doors started with the
passion about coffee so how we want to
automatize our coffee machine and after
solving that little problem on how to
turn on and do automatically your own
coffee the abstraction we start to
evolve the abstraction that was used to
solve the coffee problem and apply that
for lots of other things at any house
and at any home so we started with home
automation and develop at the j home
automation project and submitted that
for a Duke Choice Award in 2011 and we
were very happy and lucky 21 the Duke
Choice Award with home automation and
one thing that is interesting is that in
2011 like a three years ago i was using
java ee for home automation and
everybody everybody from java community
you are crazy java is too much you can't
use Java EE to control one house and
everything and so now we have raspberry
pi and everybody running tomcat rest sir
and everything so it was in the very
beginning of international things and it
was three years ago yes and that was
very important the Java EE was a very
important requirement to be able to be
accepted on any Java conference so that
was a very important piece of the
political side of thing but it was more
than that it was the two that we were
use it to towards a language we know the
API as we know so they were very useful
on that moment so this abstraction the J
home abstraction as as we become
starting to go further than home
automation and all the Internet of
Things concept the same framework that
was designed for home automation was was
evolved to the things API framework
there's another important piece of that
we are using here so all the underlying
API is to make it easier to communicate
between the board different boards
another thing that it's very very very
nice is kind of the two satellites that
people used to butte in universities or
in high school or colleges so we were
working for public school in Brazil and
they were doing their own boards these
were very handmade boards before very
cheap and handmade boards that were
produced by 6th grade children so they
were using the tube SAT and this was a
derivation of Arduino something we call
ought to be no it's a very simplified
Arduino and the latest project that also
came from passion I believe most
interesting projects comes from
something we like we enjoy so the smart
helmet is a bicycle helmet that has a
Raspberry Pi inside of it and has the
ability to take pictures on a time
time lapse thing so you can set up five
seconds three seconds and it will take
pictures from all your height and also
has a GPS and connects through your
mobile phone connected on the Wi-Fi of
your 3g on mobile phone we'll talk a
little bit more about the architecture
for the smart helmet so let's give the
mic to Venetia so he can talk a little
bit more technical about each of this
project Thank You Yara so we have many
different profiles of IOT project this
is the reason why I love to work with
Hardware actually and when we talk about
end-to-end Java we have the this is a
kind of commercial is light we have the
Java me that everybody knows that comes
from the feature phones and now it's
being used to io te Oracle just change
the direction and I think that is great
for java me because it was very linked
it to phones as a accessible case so now
we have Java me go into a much better
direction than funds and we have Java
Sea embedded that is growing very much
so what is the nice thing about Java Sea
embedded is that any java developer can
be iron better developer in a few days
because you have all the java sea stack
running in single board computers so we
have arms arms everywhere as java but
arms is everywhere and we also have
boards coming from intel like Galileo
and Inter Watson and we have also Java
EE as a server side sometimes we have
those the server citing them better the
space also so we don't have anymore this
concept of client and server I think
that the architecture today is much more
about embedded cloud is the new client
server so then method want to reach the
the cloud and send the data to the cloud
and so we can run java ee like Tony eat
on catch or even more powerful java ee
containers in different types of ports
but but the life is not just java behind
a nice java code in an added space there
is always a ugly c code so ha and
sometimes we need to write C code and
fertile me so yeah we are talking about
Java EE and to end almost so we need to
write C code when we need a hard
real-time like a keeping that wrong
direction you won't do that using Java
Sea like airbags triggering the airbag
so this is hard real-time you must you
must have the answer in the same Maya
second and we also need to write some C
code when we are creating sensors you
are creating your own sensor or you have
analog sensor and you are using any kind
of computer that you don't have
analog-digital converter so you want to
create your own sensor so you can use a
microcontroller like p.i.c or 80 Magus
and you will need to write a sequel or
when you are fixing linux sometimes you
have some problem specific problem with
a linux distribution inside some type of
computer and you need to go deep to
debug and fix the problem or you are
implementing io gpio api for your board
like a robert did with pie for j x 4g is
a very nice java api for manipulating
the beans in raspberry pi but behind by
4j there is a lot of c code so one
information that we just had is that the
jsr for real time is being
reactivated so let's see the future how
it will perform and just talking very
fast about a real time is a very hard
subject but we have three levels of
timing hard real-time that you must
answer in the Maya second and you don't
delays are not allow it in the heart
real time so this case we can use C or
any other programming language or
specific operational system should
perform that and we have the real time
the just real time that is the real time
in the human perception what is that
it's like when you click in a button or
you center and qtt message to your
broker and you see the lights turning on
and you see well it's real time for your
perception it is but there is a lot of
delays between your click and the land
so invisible delays are allow it and we
have the internet timing this is the
marketing perception and making
something and delays are really allow it
so we for the first case we will not use
Java but for the rest we can use Java
end to end and we have different types
of projects when we talk about I OT like
legacy projects like the nuclear reactor
that we work it did already exist and
someone just can call me and hire me to
say I want to control I want to monitor
the nuclear reactor yeah through the
internet so this is some legacy
equipment that you are just adding
internet to that and you also have many
startups projects I think that is very
related to startups startup projects and
the people that are trying to make money
with IOT that's it we have to do it
yourself projects the people that want
to have fun with IOT solving like our
sailboat and we have the industry
projects that production projects like
gateways boards producing
modules and producing any kind of
product product in in large scale so but
for each type of project we we have a
different set of solutions and decisions
that we can take like we are going to
industry we don't want to use a
raspberry pi because you have a lot of
resources that is not useful for many
industry projects you are not using
Arduino because Arduino you have dddd
ftdi to transfer code using the USB port
so you are going to use something
different for industry when you are in
the do-it-yourself space have everything
is allow it and when you have the legacy
you have the the legacy restrictions
from the equipment and they start up you
are worried about making money with IOT
so it's different approach for each
scenario but we fought every iog project
we have five pieces important pieces the
computer the sensors the actuators the
energy and the internet connection and
protocols so we are going to talk about
a little bit about each of this topic
before going to the architectures demo
and we also have the abilities when we
talk about Java like Java EE
architecture we have scalability
security maintainability testability and
everything and in terms of IOT I think
that the most important thing is the
maintainability like how to make
continuous deployment in devices all
around the world that maybe they are not
all the time connected to the Internet
sometimes the internet is not full time
and you need you to update some firmware
like when you are working with something
that is not java the C++ C code and you
need to update film works for a thousand
devices you must write your own code to
receive the new code and update the
firmware and it can be very
expensive to make this engineer so
that's one of the reason that we like to
use Java to have over-the-air updates
and all the other features that Java had
for maintainability testability is also
very important unit testing stress
testing sometimes testing hardware can
be very fun when you are really putting
in their market like you did produce a
device at least in Brazil you must burn
you must put fire in your hardware to
see if the smoke can kill someone so
sometimes testing IOT can be very very
fun uh-huh and scalability we talk much
more about scalability in terms of
production how to scale the production
because the the power the computing
power you have enough it's just a
question of choosing the right board the
right thing but sometimes the
scalability problem is how I can't
produce I did five pieces of this helmet
and now I need to go to production to
sell the helmet so how I can scale the
production like the helmet that that
yarra just show is a raspberry pi so
using that prototype for scaling the
production would be very expensive so we
are looking for a different solution for
that because of the scalability so this
is the smart helmet is one project that
started as a do-it-yourself and is going
to production and so this is you have
many impacts in terms of architecture
and also the size right the size of
saris sometimes guillotine energy
consumption so it's totally different
when you need to scale the production of
the harbor and we have also some
witchcraft like when we are working with
hardware magnetic field haiku hand noise
is he
humidity and sometimes I don't know God
can so sometimes strange things can
happen i was in d'box for the first time
with my J home automation project very
happy giving talks about her motivation
and when I start to test the things in
the hotel the assistant just reset all
the time i was using arduino and so i
spent out the night looking what is
happening and so I decide to measure the
the AC voltage and it was 250 volts
which is far as in Brazil is 22 and Max
so in Europe is very seriously it was
250 volts and so I have the USB cable
very near from the power cable from the
AC cable and so I just give some space
from the USB cable and the AC cable and
everything start working again so so we
have some magnetic some noise happening
there I actually have many many cases
with a team agoura sets and noises and
well I OT computers we have these small
computers look here that I'm not taking
out the c++ for the basis like arduinos
or 80 Magus we have p.i.c is very
popular it's very old it's very stable
you have many professionals that work
with that but it's more rare to see
p.i.c in a do-it-yourself or ha beast
space we have this one that is not
related with Java and not related we've
seen but I think that is very
interesting project electric in p it's a
SD card size computer with an arm inside
and six digital ports and Wi-Fi enable
so it's Wi-Fi inside the same a SD card
that you use for pictures and for your
machine and this is very nice but not
java okay and now they just announced
that yesterday the Java ME support for
this freescale microcontroller and this
freescale they have a valuation board to
sell thirty thirty dollars and these
arduino-compatible the evaluation board
is arguing a compatible so by some way
we can now have one type of hard we know
not Arduino but arduino-compatible
running java me which is very nice
because for the community is very nice
for the industry does not matter but for
the community is very important and we
have the gym auto concept board this
board here using one very small module
with 3g support java me support and is
also arduino-compatible like a is a hype
being arduino compatible match and so
this board is very nice because you can
prototype and go to the industry with
the same module the same code and the
same thing this is a evaluation board
for the e AG s6 module this module here
but after you finish your project you
can buy just the module factory are on
board PCB and go to production very easy
we also have kill board and that is the
I think that is most famous for Java me
dragon board from Qualcomm that is for
Miss kind of new and raspberry pie that
you can run Java me and also Java Sea
yes when when we need to say is very
easily you need to remember that very
easily depends on the perspective
right so when we are talking here just
because this is a developer board so
it's use it for us to evaluate that and
probably you need a company specialized
it company to assembly this board for
you right it's not something that the
developer will be doing by itself right
but when you go for a scale you will
design your board according to your
needs with the components you need
inside the board in the size and
everything that actually we have here in
the audience ow our friend from Brazil
they are producing thousands of
computers running java me and running
java sea using geez module so if you are
really looking you have a project and
you want to go to industry this is the
guy that you can talk about press might
so our choice I like hard we do because
it's easy because you can take it out
the Arduino board and create your own
board using just the 80 mega
microcontroller and you can do real time
using Arduino you don't have operational
system so for me is perfect pairing
Arduino and raspberry pi Arduino and any
other board actually is a big tendons if
you look to Intel out the ports that
Intel is releasing they are our arduino
compatible if you look to you do board i
will be talking more about you do board
is also a very powerful linux with an
arduino inside a dedicated
microcontroller inside so it's a very
big tendency to have unix and linux
doing the tcp/ip the security server
message complex process and having some
dedicated microcontroller bar marrow for
doing the hard real-time stuff and we
liked very much concept board because
they are putting a lot of energy they
are very committed with the community
answering the forums and everything and
raspberry pi because at least in brazil
the we have very easy access to buy
raspberry pi and art
he knows h omega but it's not easy for
us to buy any other of these guys p i
see also is easy but we don't have like
a dragon board qualcomm easy to find in
brazilian market so that's our choice so
arduino very useful for create your
sensors hard hard real-time process and
manage power from other computers you
can have arduino turning on the
Raspberry Pi when you need more powerful
computing turning off I will I will tell
about this project later and easy to
integrate with Java you can use I
squared C or you art or you can create
your own digital protocol to communicate
but I square C is the most popular one
and it's very low energy consumption can
survive moths running with a single
battery if you have solar panel it will
survive forever comparative raspberry pi
or do you know I think that is many many
times less energy consumption so the
gemalto EHS module low power consumption
it has also a sleep mode airplane mode
and it can really consume just a few
energy is also are doing incompatible
you have updates over the air so you can
publish your new your new midlet in our
web server and ask to gemalto to grab
get the new film where the new midlet
and update your port so an affordable
price it costs the evaluation board 100
euros so it's not bad for a 3g and 2g
GPRS module and this feature updates
over there i don't know how important
each of you believe this feature is but
if we think about Internet of Things
installations like aboard in the boat
then the boat in the ocean it's very
unlikely we want to do
he's very likely have to go into the
boat to update is the best yeah but he
wants to go he wants to go to go that
much bad the idea is on this these cases
it's just because it can be hard to do
that or it can have an expensive cost so
maybe for some do-it-yourself projects
it's not that important but if we go
massive and think about ATMs or
environment monitoring having the
ability to update the code you are
running it's very very very actually
they are using here in US and in Nam in
Amazonia in Brazil they are using jeez
module to monitor the tree so they have
a sled o meter and they put in the top
of the tree if someone cut the tree the
tree said send a message someone is
cutting me so it's very nice a use case
for cheeseboard help me help me yes and
a classic user case even in our case
when we left from Brazil venetia's was
no way I'm not going to touch that
before our talk on Wednesday so he have
been using this tool each day right
update on what was running in Joe's
deployment in my boat from California to
Brazil exactly and when we are talking
about the technology like Java for for
this case most users are very use it to
do commend learning how to do continuous
deployment and they are they know this
and they want to keep the high quality
on project development so for adoption
is also very important that we keep the
good things we learned on the java and
java ee space and so we have here the
one is like to talk about the rebirth of
java me so you can now prototype using
java me and raspberry pi and choose
another board if you just have raspberry
pi you can also write java me because
they just part the
java me to raspberry pi so Java me is
about love yeah we use Java me because
we love job and actually Java me is
being the java SE compact profile so
it's like is dying java me because it's
been a change to a Java Sea profile so
much better for all the developers
because the api's will be common from
the Java C and Java me which is very
good for learning well it was the let's
say that we were talking about the edge
device the low low end devices so here
we have the medium size but medium size
is not that medium it can be like a
laptop powerful single board computer we
have different choices here Raspberry Pi
everybody knows has berry pie for sure
we have this one you do board using
freescale imx6 freescale imx6 is a dream
if you are working with priest k ym x 6
you are in the best company you have the
best job for IOT and we have pisseed we
know with arm cortex we have big open
black we have Intel Galileo and we have
Intel Edison they are all medium sized
computers you can process images you can
take pictures you can have business
intelligence running locally without the
need to go to the cloud computing to the
cloud to the server so our choice
raspberry pi because it is easy you have
a very large community and you have very
nice posts and blogs and etc I like you
do board for another situation you do
board is when you are replacing a laptop
for one another for some single board
computer you do board is a laptop
computer in a single board
and a big ol boney black because we go
Bonnie black is open-source raspberry pi
is not open source harbor big ol boney
black is open source hardware and we are
when you are doing Java projects using
big o bone and you need to go from the
prototype to production the support is
very nice for big ol born black so
that's our choice Raspberry Pi they
consume is not like an Arduino but it's
okay the energy consumption we have the
GPIO with 26 pins and now they just
launched at the B+ with 48 pins you have
a very good support for visual like when
you are doing a kilometer when you are
doing mucci media centers the most of
the people by a Raspberry Pi and do a
multimedia center with that and the
storage is based on SD card which is
good for prototypes but it's not good
for production and the JVM is very
optimized it they just work a day the
Oracle engineers work at a lot changing
the JVM for armed and they put support
for heart float and you can run javafx
directing to the into the graphics the
GPU so it's very nice how water co is
looking to Raspberry Pi beaglebone black
is also cheap so 45 bucks the energy
consumption is better than Raspberry Pi
you can really power your big open black
using your USB computer port something
that you can do using raspberry pi and
very easy to start it has a built-in
storage and you have a very rich gpio
very rich gpio two rolls of 46 pins so
that's a lot and the you do board it's a
dream single board computer the price is
not that cheap
but it has the power of four raspberry
PI's plus 80 plus an Arduino mega inside
the GPIO you have 72 pins is open source
and the power I couldn't find in the
specification how much power it it it
draws from from the energy so what it
means means that it's a lot if they are
not telling is because it's a lot the
power supply that comes with you do
board is 12 volts 2 amps is a 40-24
facts power supply so it means that it
consumes a lot but it's very nice ah you
could see yesterday during the keynote
they are using the you do board plus the
the freescale board a compatible with
Arduino to make the crazy car so is the
hybrid architecture that I told you
before so when you go from prototype to
production the best options Raspberry Pi
you have this guy by compute is a
Raspberry Pi in the memory format so you
just need you to factor your PCB to
receive the Raspberry Pi this way so
this way you don't have the internet
connection USB you decide what you want
to have in your PCB and a big old bone
black is the best choice to go to
production because his open source and
talking with my friend Leo he said that
they give a lot of support Leo he had
the experience of producing a product
base it on the same SOC from Big O born
black the winner so no winner this time
for do-it-yourself I would recommend
Raspberry Pi for production beaglebone
black and for high-end and better
devices youtube word if you have a
youtube bored and you need to do home
automation you do board maybe is too
much for home automation sensors so
in my experience I square C sensors are
always the best choice because it's easy
to to connect you just use to digital
pins to plug and I square C is a uppers
so it's very old I like IOT because I OT
is using all technologies to create new
cool stuff like serial communication
nice Percy is from ahs so spi is used
for high volume data sensors and you are
to have the serial communication many
legacy like industrial legacy using
communication rs-232 and modules like
GPS and Bluetooth they also use you are
communication sometimes a dedicated
microcontroller is required and I would
say by a very generic way avoid
communicating working in high a transfer
rate because the noise will be very
danger to that ok so avoid try to
communicate like if you are using cereal
you don't need a very high speed device
you don't have a very high speed device
so if you need high speed devices I
would like I would recommend to virtual
spi and forth that they just launched at
the device I yo API di OU di yo is the
standard API to deal with peripherals
and pins if you use it java and
raspberry pi probably you use it the pie
for j created by robert thanks for the
pie for j is he is here the other pie
for jcreator is for me is a big pleasure
to have you in the audience and and now
the problem is by far j is for raspberry
pi if you go to big open black you must
look to another set of api's or maybe
you need to write your own
api so they start to do this standard it
comes from the java me space this api
and it will be in the future it will be
the standard API for i 0 and peripheral
access so I'm already working with the
guys and helping to test I'm helping to
document and the project is just
beginning we need to wait like a to have
this really stable and compatible with
different boards maybe tube it will take
two years three years to build red and
stable and compatible with other boards
so it's being development they just open
the project two months ago so you are
all invited to check out the code and
collaborate so actually just finishing
an article an article device I yo API
for our core java magazine for the next
edition execution will be sharing
tutorials and all that for who wants to
to learn more start playing yeah i say
you'll call it ti yo yo yo and actuators
relays models leds speakers and no no no
secret behind the actuators i would say
when you are using release take care
with inductive current because if you
use a regular relay and you try to turn
on and off a big like a fan and when you
turn off you have some noise incoming
that can go to your secret secret and
can make a reset in your secret so is
you must use optical isolation to avoid
this kind of problem with release and if
you are using microcontrollers like 80
magaz avoid to use the same
microcontroller microcontroller they are
very poor in terms of resources if you
are reading sensors and driving
actuators with the same microcontrollers
you can find many different strange
situations so I would say
microcontroller 2k of ran just give to
this guy
very limited job don't don't don't try
to make a a big big things in this kind
of guys so energy for IOT we have
different profiles like when you have
home automation you have the food power
and houses building offices is marked
cds and but when you have but car boats
and other types of vehicles you have big
batteries so you are not bad on
batteries when you have like drones you
have medium batteries and you have when
you have very small devices you are
really you really need to take care
about the energy consumption so we are
using solar panel to recharge our in
Brazil the solar panel is amazing
because I was testing the Raspberry Pi
with camera Wi-Fi and I put a solar
panel and during the summer obviously
and the Raspberry Pi could survive hours
just using this casting the video camera
for me and I was not using a battery it
was the solar panel the five votes
regulator and the Raspberry Pi and it
will was like eight hours working just
with the Sun energy the solar panel was
kind of big but is very nice the
combination of solar panel and this kind
of single board computers and you can
measure the current are we used to
measure using this sensor so it's very
nice to know how much coolant you are
you are using in your secrets and this
is a very inexpensive sensor so you can
put the sensor all around your project
you know each one how much couldn't they
are using they are consuming and to
measure voltage you can use voltage
dividers circuits is very easy just with
resistor analog parts you can do that
yourself you find a lot of material for
doing that
a internet connection so the best
solution is the cable the turn at cable
is the best use case but it is not a
reality for IOT sometimes you have the
fool what I call for Wi-Fi is is Wi-Fi
but it's always turn it on and sometimes
you have the partial Wi-Fi with t3 like
the smart helmet we use it to upload the
pictures you must open your wireless
teetering and so it will use your cell
phone as halter and you can buy a GPA a
modern I specific model that will share
the dr GPRS connection through the Wi-Fi
and you can use GPRS modules like
gemalto or you can use boards like this
one SN 5100 this one is very nice but
it's very easy to start using this guy
but it's a kind of expensive i think
that is 60 bucks and you can use the
internet through the bridge like Ziggy
bridge Bluetooth bridge and the generic
radiofrequency gateways so in this case
you have you don't have the internet you
have gateways to provide the connection
for you the transportation we have many
options they are talking a lot about
different protocols for IOT I have those
means but rest is very good because
everybody knows rest so it's very
user-friendly good for humans but not
good for things and we have web sockets
is for its intended for fluid
communication in browsers and we have
MQTT that is kind of jns is a bus a JMS
burst like four things is very a very
nice protocol and co-op is a kind of
light HTTP so our choice is MQTT we love
em
your TT and I think that the people that
don't like don't use MQTT is because I'm
acuity is too much related to IBM stuff
and things but i really like MQTT and so
if you want to see more about it the
benjamin can zap from eclipse eclipse he
tweeted about this article if you want
you to check more about the different
protocols that you have for IOT this is
the right place so ok we have some
practical examples so that is marked
helmet we use it medium batteries
actually we just bought the the the cell
phone recharge your battery and mount
that that guy and put inside the helmet
so it was very nice because raspberry
PI's 5 volts and you can feed your
Raspberry Pi used using this kind of
battery and you will that already have
all the charger circuit for that we have
the camera and we change to raspberry pi
model b because it consumes less energy
compared it to model b d+ and we have
the Wi-Fi connection with 3g teetering
we have gps and leds as sensors and
actuators we have out your system and we
are just using java embedded if you want
to look for the basic code we have in
our github you can see this pipe picture
and i have a video on youtube telling
how to build a open-source camera using
raspberry pi PI forge a and a is a kind
of the same project and those videos are
on the java channel at youtube so this
another project was created by thomas
during the last devoxx he was
participating a challenging he created
IOT sandbox gateway poverty I a power so
full power you have raspberry pi Arduino
plus any sensor it was internet cable
and he is using a job
C+ akash camo and Emma qtt very very
nice implementation all the source code
all the source code is available in in
his github sorry the the pointer just
stopped working and whoops okay well and
we have our sailboat our is mart
sailboat so in our sailboat is crazy
implementation we have big batteries
like two big batteries for the boat in
general is not just for the system and
we have raspberry pi p plus we have
arduino and we have gym how the concept
board we have camera Wi-Fi out your
system so it's very nice when we are
sailing and the water pump start working
too much they both start giving us
advice water pump working water pump
working and if you are using the engine
you will not listen to the water pump
and so we have all the audio system
giving us all the feedback when we are
saving so it makes our boat much more
safe because it's very common to be a
crazy and the water pump is working
because you have some water coming
inside your boat and if you are too late
like five minutes it can be a disaster
for you so it's very nice the audio
system is very nice and we have many
many many sensors and we are using Java
Sea and bedded tongkat and we have a
MQTT server mosquito running and we are
using as API pie for Jay and thinks API
that is our own API to integrate things
together so that's the architecture how
they architectural work we have a let's
try again has maybe in one side we have
the gem auto concept board we just put
the Gemalto concept board two months ago
so
we are migrating many things to gemalto
concept board and we are testing infuse
the gemalto concept board and we have in
the other side the Raspberry Pi with
Wi-Fi router and 3g connection Gemalto
concept board can turn on and turn off
our Raspberry Pi so i can send text
message the Raspberry Pi is not turning
on all the time I just turn on my
Raspberry Pi when I need to do hard
process or take pictures so gemalto and
arduino they are making low-cost energy
process and if I need something harder I
can ask to turn on the Raspberry Pi so
that's for me is perfect system because
you have all the options and since is my
boat I don't care to expand like $2,000
to make my boat more safe so and most of
the boat's owner will not save like
money they will pay for that that's the
lesson so out the source codes I just
make the last push before coming here
all the source codes are available we
are using Arduino make five Arduino M
key is a very nice way to update arduino
code remotely so you can upload a new
film where I can sink the Gemalto new
filmer Arduino new firmware and
everything and I can update my sailboat
and fortunately because now I don't have
the right excuse tube to return to my
sailboat so here i have a small video
here we have this panel is concentrating
all the equipment inside this panel and
i have a clone of this panel here with
me and my boat is actually sending data
from for me liga chameleon
you can see here we have MQTT we are
adding two pontipines we have MQTT here
and you can see panel boat paddle boat
banner is this guy bought is my boat in
brazil saving masses in real time for me
here and i can ask to my boat to take
picture from from there i will do the
same here but i'm going to ask to this
guy to take a picture from us so you can
see how the process work so let me put
in my twitter account here last demo and
i will say here picture so i'm using the
IBM m qg g server iot dot eclipse.org
anyone could send could ask to take
pictures look that turn on the lab
taking picture in free everybody has one
i took a new picture
tweeting new picture tweeting your
picture and let's wait a little bit
three minutes perfect finish to send
picture okay refresh here we go yeah
it's very dark the picture here in my
screen is good but are all the pictures
for some reason there is very dark but
you can see that is a pretty new pekin
see the light there right so I said in
this time I send Emma qtt message to the
IBM server this guy is listening to the
MQTT queue and receive the message and
start the process and just with so this
is the real time in human perception
look that I will say picture and this
one is our self very advanced at South
Beach
taking picture in three two one I took a
new picture Saul tweeting new picture
thank you and talking about architecture
the same way we went to the couple
things using JMS and message queue
server on the Java EE space we want to
decouple the components here right so we
want to have this broker in the middle
and you can register yourself to receive
the update and all the information so
for the Internet of Things if you have
thousands of people that wants to get
this information mq it's very good for
that we unfortunately a lot of
information demonstration code and
everything so we don't have time for
questions but we will be here all the
time we are going to outside now and
thank you so much for coming thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
