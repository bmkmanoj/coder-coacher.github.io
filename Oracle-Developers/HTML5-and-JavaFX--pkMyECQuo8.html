presentation my name is Michael Flynn
Akira not Walter White or mr. Lambert
this is Ryan Kubrick we're from Daiso
Systema french software company that
does extensive use of java Ryan wrote
this great presentation on comparing
Java FX html5 so I'm gonna help them out
a little bit and this is actually a
first part of two presentations if you
come tomorrow there's a presentation
called moving from swing to FX so this
is you know well do I choose html5 or
jive FX and tomorrow is I've already got
the other swing how do I move it on to a
viable platform since swing is is more
or less dead so without further ado I
would like to say that we actually do
use both html5 and Java so we do not
actually have not actually picked either
one so I have quite a few slides to go
through today so Java effects the first
question I have is how many people in
the audience are using Java FX right now
okay how many are using html5 ok yep so
we're gonna go over a number of things
today we're gonna first put HTML 5 in
perspective then do a technical html5
and Java and perspective and then do a
technical comparison between both of
them followed by how do you integrate
Java FX and html5 together and then
finally a summary and actually in the
integration one of the things to look
for is I will be covering how you
actually debug the webview inside of
Java effects how do you actually get
debug information out of it and use the
WebKit protocol so the first one is Java
FX in perspective so both technologies
kind of actually evolved at the same
time sonna originally announced as
everybody knows Java FX in 2007 and
about a couple of years earlier html5
started or the specification
developments started solo it's 2013 and
html5 is the current tech you know the
current cool technology they've actually
been in development for a number of
years and as we'll see in some of the
subsequent slides the browser
implementations have you know only
within the last couple of years actually
caught up so some common misconceptions
since about JavaFX first of all is that
job
is irrelevant with the advent of html5
and we'll kind of dig into why that is
and see them along the presentation the
other thing is that Java on the desktop
is dead that is certainly not the case
there's many cases there's many
situations where a desktop app is more
suitable especially if you're doing
something highly or interactive or the
type of software that we actually write
that being said Java effects and html5
are mutually exclusive Java Java does
not have good graphics performance
that's not actually true with Java
effects now Java effects is only for
rich media applications not desktops
that's a common misconception if you're
building a complicated business
application job effects actually has
quite a few things to offer it's just
not a GUI originally they positioned it
as a Silverlight competitor and
something that you only put on phones it
is really the replacement for swing and
a much needed replacements as I'll cover
tomorrow and then the last thing is that
you never use Java effects in a business
application which is certainly not true
as I mentioned Java FX is a replacement
for AWT so unlike swing Java FX is not
built on top of a WT many people do not
realize that swing sits on top of a WT
and has many of its limitations which is
why you will never you know you will not
see graphics acceleration with swing and
why replace swing I'll cover a lot of
that tomorrow but there's quite a few
architectural limitations except for
incomplete look and feel so jump FX is
not is not really a competitor or we
don't look at it as a competitor to
html5 you can you could there's
certainly some overlap but it fixes many
of the limitations in Java and the Java
desktop stuff that have been kind of
languishing for a better part of the
decade you know such a support for multi
multi-touch etc and historical baggage
collection job F X you'll notice if
you've been going to the sessions this
week there's quite a bit of overlap
between Java effects and the other
technologies in terms of Java Java 3d j
ai and JAMF those are all dead now and
job effects actually supplants those and
unlike those technologies it's actually
included in the platform so it's not
something like in the old days with jei
where you had the you know you had
graphics acceleration on
you know the windows boxes but on the
Mac it was using the the Mac api's job
FX does not like these technologies as I
mentioned that's cross-platform
and it actually does include support for
common video and audio formats so you
don't have to go outside the thing
outside of the platform so some of the
key features of job effects and I'll
touch on this multiple times today but
the you know the first thing is retained
mode graphics it does have a scene graph
and it actually has a very integrated
scene graph in this years ago and I was
working at Kodak one of the engineers
over there was always pounding on the
importance of the scene graph and the
fact that the you know it fixes a number
of problems that you have with with with
swing so you allows you to do special
effects and everything else so if you
want to you know dim the screen and a
forms application or put up a glass pane
some of the reasons why you know I've
done some horrible hacks in the past
with using glass panes and other things
that are really easy to do with html5 or
that type of stuff
it also finally fixes the 60-plus
components and it has 3d tooling support
3ds tooling support with scene builder a
bunch of other things so the main
differentiating feature as I mentioned
before is a scene graph is at the core
the API the UI widgets are actually
nodes like any other node so you can
actually do transformations with them so
you can actually animate text fields you
know have them fly across the screens
you can do all kinds of special effects
the users have come to expect and you
know from applications like the iPhone
etc so that that's my brief introduction
to just job effects on the html5 stuff
since most of this audience is already
familiar with html5 L kind of hop to it
kind of fast some of the big things and
we'll be comparing these to Java effects
or the 2d canvas WebGL which is
technically not part of html5 it's kind
of outside of it CSS SEC CSS CS css3
yeah which includes web fonts
transformations and also animations
which to touch on briefly WebSockets web
work which finally allows background
threading which was a big limitation in
html5 although it's not quite up to the
threading we have in Java and data
storage as well as access to the local
file system so many of these features
are the reason why people are asking you
know why why do we still need Java
effects you know
you know Oracle should just the Java
community should just focus on the
server side and forget the desktop
because you know html5 is where it's at
that's definitely the case for many
applications the one thing that a lot of
people don't that that I've talked to
that don't quite understand with html5
is that it's a it's a different paradigm
you can build application can build
these you know using html5 is just not
necessarily the same thing as using the
new tags that come with it about a year
ago I had to do some interviews of
people and I would ask them what their
you know what their whether they were
familiar with html5 they would say yes
and I would say well what's the new
feature in it and they'd say well
there's basically the same thing as HTML
4 which is certainly not not true one of
the big things is that you can actually
do single page applications right so you
can you know have an application that is
a single page that's interactive you can
do video games that way you can actually
install them in the browser you know the
global store the clients the staple not
stateless so with JSF JSP is you're
always going back and forth you know
that the main logic resides on the
server so every time you you click
something it sends a request off to the
server comes back with html5 you're
putting it in the browser and that's
where the competition is with job on the
desktop because in the past you know 10
years ago you know you'd want to you'd
use applets for doing that same type of
thing because Java JavaScript or the the
API is on this JavaScript side weren't
quite up to it now with WebSockets we
have true asynchronous communication
with the server so you can actually you
know have the server do stuff so in our
case you could send the calculation back
to the server have it doing a lot on the
compute farmer then arrived back at the
client and also applications may not
have a back-end server you can actually
get html5 applications that don't
communicate communicate with anything
and you can also using things like
PhoneGap store the you know deploy html5
applications onto the iPhone via the
Apple iTunes Store etc and html5 many
apps today are hybrids actually so you
know they have a native application show
with html5 content so like a lot of your
local news stations you'll have a little
app that allows you to check you know
you know channel threes news those are
actually html5 like PhoneGap apps where
they're just serving up the mobile
website inside of something a little it
looks like an app so you don't have to
visit
page and in the development new the
native application development dominates
mobile
yeah because even if the mobile phones
are really powerful they're still
relatively slow right they're using the
equivalent of an i3 chip and they also
don't necessarily have lots of RAM so
the problems around garbage collection
and Rama tend to be limiting also most
of the development is still done in
native code C C++ like people are still
using the native development kit for
Android and lastly if you if you recall
last year Facebook backed out of html5
because of performance issues right they
had to redo all the their website and
all of the apps due to that and then I
thought of saying well what then why
wouldn't you know what what's the
trade-off between writing something just
in C++ or writing it in an html5 or
JavaFX well a native app you're pretty
much locked to a specific operating
system on you got to recompile for every
operating system unit of support and of
course you've got all that securely
quick cue there he's a building on a
different compiler and the flags are
always different you're also limited
limited tuning right once you've built
your native app you can't really tweak
the Java heap or anything like that
you're kind of stuck of course you've
got to have client-side installation if
I put physical code on the client
machine harder to communicate with the
container right because you've got to go
through GNI are some nasty protocols
moving to mobile means you have to
recode and recompile because obviously
the formatting should be different and
lastly of course the graphics library
you're going to be very dependent on the
library available on that platform
whereas with html5 or Java effects you
pretty much operating system agnostic
right you're just writing to at Java or
html5 spec you get better flexibility in
terms of we'll talk about it later but
you can play that the heap and Java
effects at least to tune it hands-off on
installation it blends into the web
environment the move to mobile is pretty
easy right you just change a couple
formatting seating we're done
and lastly WebGL makes it Universal to
do graphics 3d anywhere right it just
makes a more democratic so that's how
I'd compare the you know the benefits of
going one to the other so now I'll dive
into the technical comparison so I'll be
covering a number of
first off with an overview then dive
into the features support go over the
rendering API is a little bit in more
depth as well as multimedia multimedia
controls animation and then look at
WebGL versus Java 3d and also some of
the X the JavaScript libraries that go
along with it so the one thing I would
say with doing this presentation is
html5 is amorphous if whenever I say
well you know you'd pick Java FX instead
of html5 for this reason somebody will
point out a JavaScript open source
JavaScript library that solves that
particular problem with html5 so html5
provides a base set of technologies SVG
canvas WebGL WebSockets etc and then
additional functionality is added by
open source libraries most of us
probably use jQuery there's also three
Jas which actually makes the WebGL stuff
much easier to use than it would be
otherwise as well as tween Jas which is
a JavaScript animation library so those
are two big ones if you're trying to do
like WebGL and you know animation
there's quite a few more out there I
mean every time I do a Google search I
turn up a couple more so that's you know
that's that's one of the hard things
when you're arguing if you're trying to
argue for Java effects instead of html5
there's always something out there in
the JavaScript community because of the
commits because there's such a large
large technology base installed base
Java the contrast that Java if X is
fixed it's more robust in terms of its
core features in terms of you know being
able to get up and running easily with
the Java 3d stuff but it doesn't quite
have the power that WebGL has so that's
it's easier to use developmentally it's
a smaller ecosystem of components and
everything comes prepackaged for you so
you're not taking tween and three you
know three Jas etc so to kind of
contrast the two of it the html5 is
constantly changing there's new
libraries and there's a lot of
innovation going on there
but if you're building an application
that's going to last for a number of
years like say you're trying to build
like a CAD program or something like
that where you want it still you don't
want to have to change out your core
libraries in five years because things
have kind of shifted if anybody
remembers I mean jQuery is kind of the
the jot one of the JavaScript libraries
are using but several years ago there
was dojo I remember everybody
was talking about Doge on a couple of
other ones so in terms of html5
limitations the one limitation or you
know as Java developers does JavaScript
language is a little bit more limited
than Java it's you know there's several
different ways of defining objects you
know if you're working with the
development team you kind of have to
have pretty strict coding standards to
make sure that you know people are not
you know you can kind of result in some
conflicts and do things kind of
different different developers do things
differently so that's kind of more of a
challenge than Java we're a little bit
you know held in a straitjacket we have
challenges with the browsers in terms of
friends support all of the browser's
remember with one of our when we rolled
out in HTML in HTML application at work
in the QI department head which had been
used to testing a desktop application
says we have to install how many
different browsers so you know there's
you know custom also dealing with custom
browser extensions and although the you
know we have the web worker it's not the
concurrency support that we have in Java
we don't have the the library support
you know the synchronized blocks and
everything else so the concurrency
although they have web worker in there
you know if you're if you're doing
heavily concurrent programming it's
still much the Java still offers a lot
more tools than that in that area also I
don't believe this has been fixed yet
the the time zone detection so if you're
visiting a web site and you want to know
what time zone the user is in that's
just a little pet peeve of mine long
release schedules I've not yet heard
anything about HTML 6 so it's been from
2004 to 2013 where I'm basically HTML 5
so when are some of the holes in HTML 5
going to get fixed you also from from
JavaScript although I know that there
are libraries out there that allow you
to do this I've heard of a couple of
them but it's much harder to interface
hardware so if you're trying to write a
PhoneGap thing that talks to the native
hardware to do near-field communications
or something like that I know that
there's things out there that can do
that but they're just a little bit
harder tooling challenges you don't have
the you know the you're not told that a
method doesn't exist until he hit run
time so in many cases you have to test
all code paths to verify that it works
and of course since HTML 5 is just text
nothing prevents a man from stealing
your code right
whereas Jeff effects you can have
absolute of soup yeah I've skated a few
skate your code and
mostly since the code is just all pseudo
good after that it's almost impossible
to prove or to insinuate that you stole
the coaches somewhere else so you do get
a little bit more protection with job FX
than you would with html5 where it's all
plain text so they can steal your code
they can easily prove or try to prove
that you stole their code so yeah so if
somebody's developed you know you
independently developed an algorithm in
JavaScript and somebody else has
developed it and you have it up there on
the web and plain text they can just you
know reformat and say well hey you know
it has you know it hasn't same does the
exact same thing or if it's compiled
code is much harder to prove that
somebody's developed the same thing
- maybe as protector C++ we can strip it
but it's still you'd have to be really
determined to figure out what was going
on right yep so in terms of Java effects
limitations there's no smart phone
strategy right now which is a big
problem we're it's incomplete it's still
a work in progress as we've seen for
many sessions like the Java 3d stuff
doesn't have a picking API currently
although they're working on it core
features are dependent upon Oracle
resourcing so there's always the risk
that Oracle decides to go off in a
different direction and Java effects
because it's not quite in the community
process right now you know the 3d stuff
never quite gets completed like the Java
3d stuff we also still have missing
missing features such as geolocation
device orientation accelerometers camera
capture etc so we're still missing those
features from it that you get in other
api's and you can do elsewhere and then
of course there's the perception of Java
effects that you know after Java FX 11.0
came out where it was a separate
scripting language and was a separate
download and and everything else that
really you know it's kind of like it's
taken EJB is a number of years to EJB 3
a number of years to escape from the
history of EJB 2 so in terms of
deployment strategies Java FX you can
you can actually there are apps up there
in the Mac App Store that our job
effects as well as a Microsoft Store
although there are rappers there are
ways in fact you could use Java FX to
embed html5 stuff to get it into the App
Store so I've not I did not check that
off but I'm sure that there there's
probably technologies out there that I
haven't discovery that allow you to get
them in there like probably I'm wrong on
that Microsoft star apps are actually
the Android store you can use PhoneGap
Java FX does not obviously currently run
officially on Android
though I believe people have gotten it
to run up there as well as on the iPad
for the I know that there's there were
some development and somebody had
actually gotten something so that job
effects to start but of course that's
not officially supported then in terms
of operating system breakdown Java X at
last check if yes does not work on
Android or iOS and then I will quickly
go through this slide this is just a
breakdown of the web browsers in terms
of at what points different features of
html5 became available on which version
of you know which versions of the web
browser so this gets kind of complicated
especially if you're looking at some of
the newer stuff like you want to use
WebGL WebGL is not actually supported on
the iPhone or the iOS platform and Apple
has it turned off by default in Safari
so really if somebody wants to use WebGL
the best browser for that currently or
the one that I've used for everything
for that is Chrome although you can turn
it on in Safari and everything else but
they've not enabled it by default yeah
okay was a said that I 11 should have
support okay thanks
rendering html5 canvas element is a 2d
drawing surface similar to the Java 2d
Mac OS 10 quartz or quick draw from the
old Mac e'er era H the html5 canvas is
immediate whereas Java effects is
retained that's when you draw something
on Drive effects it's I don't have it
better describe it other than it stays
around you're not calling a paint method
every time where you can you know paint
something different refresh so and then
the html5 canvas in equals Java FX 2
they added a Java FX canvas which is a
2d drawing surface that you can have on
your scene graph so that allows you to
do 2d drawings on your scene graph and
the html5 canvas
at last check does not support hit
detection so you have to actually map
the Mouse events to your objects so in
terms of lining up the features if
you're trying to compare Java FX to
html5 the Java FX scene is basically
equivalent to SVG because scalable
vector graphics and I'll cover a little
bit more of what that means
SVG actually has better support than it
did 10
remember reading about it and trying to
use it back in 2001 and it's actually
you know actually now has decent browser
support so the scene graph is basically
equipment to SVG and then the JavaFX
canvas is equivalent to the html5 canvas
so basically the both of them line up
then in terms of the core features
between HTTP 2d canvas and Java effects
in the 2d canvas in html5
they basically line up exactly in terms
of features so there's really no
difference in features between the two
of them other than that you can embed
them in a scene graph and Java effects
so the similarities
you know the immediate mode rendering
API is an almost an exact match with
Java effects canvases can participate in
the scene graph as well as Java 3d so
you could actually do a 2d drawing
surface and then you know spin it around
and do things like that
JavaFX also supports SVG paths so I will
I'll do a demo later in the presentation
or actually have slides with the code
from the demo where I've used I pulled
out SVG code and I'm using SVG to render
so actually one of the things if we have
enough time afterwards I can actually
show it I have a sailboat that I
animated in Java effects I downloaded
the SVG file I had to do a little
parsing to take it apart but I actually
was able to load it in into job effects
now because very often you know I mean
although Java FX has nice API for
drawing things you know you want to read
it you know you want an artist to design
your stuff use an illustrator or
something like that and then html5 Lex
fill support for arcs and polygons and
then in terms of feature integration
Java effects is integrated where the
canvas the video the audio the 3d are
all integrated into the scene graph with
html5 they're on a web page so that
means that you know you have you know
the canvas is a distinct element SVG is
a distinct element video is a distinct
element audio is in its distinct element
and you arrange them on the page so
they're not you know part of the same
scene graph so trying to integrate the
technologies is a little tricky and I
try to illustrate that on this next
slide here where I have a canvas and a
video and basically what I'm trying to
do there some JavaScript code that isn't
up here but I'm
trying to I'm trying to I'm trying to
place a canvas on top of a video to do
some special effects with it to have it
like transparent and put up like you
know some titles underneath it or
something like that so you know you'd
lay it out here you'd use absolute
positioning and then depending upon your
you know whether you're on a you know
you can run into issues with stuff like
this when it comes to like retina hype
ads etc so the video and canvas are
integrated via layout in the html5 panel
it's much cleaner in the JavaFX side of
things in terms of trying to get this to
work and you know ok so switching over
to H SVG SVG is a 2d vector in is 2d
vector imaging so it's you basically you
specify that you know your lines and
then you can scale up the image it's not
a raster image so if you're doing
something like logos and stuff like that
like I talked about in a jug talk on
Sunday you know you want to do stuff in
SVG if you're gonna like scale the stuff
up because it's not a raster image that
you get distorted I'm so SVG was
initially released in one point one
point I was released in 2001 and the
next targeted releases for next year
which integrates more with html5
also since the files are fairly large
they can be compressed into gzip but it
kind of language there for a number of
years there's a lot of excitement back
in 2001 I remember looking into and
getting all excited and thinking this is
really cool but then you know my web
browser the plug-in didn't quite work
with it and stuff like that so I kind of
trade out lost interest in it eventually
but his back it's part of html5 and it's
got decent support so I eat it ie eight
which is kind of long ago now didn't
provide SVG support module is lacking so
there's some you know still some modules
that are missing when I was going
through the list of features of things
that were missing you include a SVG in
HD in html5 pages using the embed object
or iframe you do not want to include it
as an image because then you can't get
at it from JavaScript to integrate it
into your seem to do you know animation
so if you're trying to use I was working
on integrating SVG into a you know on
top of a canvas where I was you know
painting my boat going across the ocean
type thing and then doing the
you know some other painting with the
canvas animating and combining the two
that way so you'd want to use the iframe
or the other things SVG multiple tools
can export export to it like adobe
illustrator illustrator OmniGraffle
professional as well as CorelDraw I'm
sure what the second point was but it
can be manipulated from JavaScript so
you have a number of tools that allow
you to design stuff with it and then
export it so you can have and there's
actually if you go up there on the web
and search for SVG you can come across
tons of SVG you know you know pictures
that you can actually download and then
because you can resize them you can
easily you know get them into your
application or whatever you're trying to
develop so you're never you know you
download a boat from here in a car from
there and one if it's a raster image you
know once 800 by 900 and the other one
is you know 400 by 300 so you know if
you straight start scaling and you'll
distort it so and then in terms of
controls changing topic again from
graphics to controls html5 and driving
offense with have a rich suite of
controls
JavaFX of course has charts and
everything else but you know anytime you
point out like you know you're missing
you know job effects has this control
but html5 doesn't there's gonna be an
open source library that usually fills
that so there's you know you know job FX
does have charting but then there are
extremely powerful charting api's that
are javascript libraries that you can
get for html5 in terms of binding Java
FX has a built-in recently this week I
actually came across at another session
there's a knockout AAS that does I guess
similar type bindings so you can
actually bind JavaScript - you know bind
the controls to it so you can get the
data out of the controls and into your
data model without having to write you
know all that jQuery code or the code
that says you know get text get text
like we have used to have to do with a
swing one of the neat things that our
idea is when I get into the html5 web
view later in the presentation is you
could actually use html5 in an
application that's form based right and
you could collect all the stuff and then
using the JavaScript integrated support
in the Java platform where you can call
from the webview into your java code you
could actually submit the form to your
java application so it's a much easier
way in some cases for doing some UI's
html5 still lacks a windowing API
although it's there's I mean I've seen
virtual operating systems I think
is written in JavaScript but you know
you don't have layout managers windows
menu bars etc of course you know those
JavaScript libraries that allow you to
fill different things and depending upon
the library might be able to merge them
together into the same page and
hopefully have the same look and feel
you know although you know there's all
kinds of different ways of extending
browser control there's no way to
actually get out the code like at that
point there I was trying to make with
you know we're in Swing or in Java FX
where you can subclass the control and
change its fundamental behavior it's a
little bit harder in javascript in of
html5 land controls can vary between
browsers which has caused some
frustration and then there's no support
for internationalization that kind of
ties back to the layout managers in
terms of you know you really have to you
know if your application is going to
support multiple languages you kind of
have to design that in there whereas if
you're using Java FX with the with the
grid pane and storing stuff and resource
bundles it's all kind of nice there you
don't have to engineer as much of a
solution and then I as I've kind of
touched them before our Java FX controls
are all nodes in the scene graph which
is extremely powerful html5 there's no
native data grid component like a J
table type Excel equivalent there are
many different table packages out there
one particular project I was working on
I was trying to do something where I
would allow people to drag from one
table and I had you know columns and
rows that were joining it was a very
complicated table and I wanted to
support dragging and dropping a table
row so that they could rearrange things
and I quickly discovered that for
instance you can't drag-and-drop TR
statements that you know you that most
of the table packages out there use divs
and I was not able to find one that
actually met the requirements of you
know you know where I had table columns
and Road joins and I was trying to do
drag and drop between them and handle it
nicely there's no clean solution that I
was able to find at the time I could
find it could you know one would do one
very well then another one couldn't do
the other one and I wanted to have you
know be able to drag between tabs and
the web browser which you know obviously
wouldn't work and then issues with you
know cut copy and paste and everything
I'd get like text back where I needed to
know what object that was backing that
row was actually you know usually when
you're copy stuff or in the job land
it's the object the data that's being
copied so your object gets copied not
just the text that was on the screen
JavaFX has a powerful component powerful
table component especially in java FX
eight I've seen at least last year they
had sessions on it and there was some
pretty good posts on the JavaFX
discussion list about this of doing all
kinds of things in Java in the Java
effects table that you would have in the
past had to go on out and get a separate
table package on the Java platform to do
from like Jade soft multimedia support
so the codecs video codec support is
obviously determined by patents which is
the thing that makes this really kind of
hairy for JavaFX oracle has actually
licensed many of the format's that
supports html5 actually supports no
audio video codecs by default it's the
web browsers that provide them and some
of the web browsers i've the next slide
I'll provide a comparison of the
different web browsers in that
JavaFX provides a known set of codecs so
you at least know what you're going to
get that's you know probably the reason
why I like CNN still uses flash for you
know the the videos and everything like
that joke the JavaFX video audio support
is built on top of GStreamer so you can
actually go out there and build that and
I think you might be able to do
something with that to get stuff back
into Java effects so this is just a
slide here I'm not going to dwell on the
slide you can download it afterwards but
it just kind of goes through the
comparison of the different video audio
codecs in terms of try and figure it out
the h.264 is one that has the best
support I can't remember what the easier
name for that one is mp4 so video codec
support html5 includes a video control
or play stop progress seek volume etc if
you're trying to use the JavaFX you know
control for doing for playing video it
does not provide you a play stop it
doesn't provide you nice controls so
you're gonna have to write all of the
controls yourself so although you can
play back video you're gonna if you're
trying to do something like a simple
player app we have a pause and the stop
button you're gonna have to provide that
UI interestingly currently neither
technology provides access to individual
video frames so you can't you know
manipulate the individual video frames
so if you're trying to write like an
application where your minute minute you
know doing video editing or something
like that you don't have currently the
sub you don't have support for that uhm
and then just you know split down of the
audio codecs and then moving onto
animation which is one of the strengths
which is a strength of java effect
actually html5 animation is fairly
primitive if you're using just what it
provides out on the box if you're using
that's where I said it gets into you
know if you pointed out the you know how
hard it is to use the built-in Java
effects I'm sorry the built-in html5
support for animation somebody's going
to immediately put point two at tween
dot J s which has a ton of features so
it you have basically a request next
animation frame callback and it's just
like an event loop like back in the days
and I have those slight of cut the next
slide is a snippet of code for that so
you must either build a toolkit or use
one like tween J s JavaFX has an
animation framework built into the
platform all the nodes can be elevated
including UI elements and so it's got a
bunch of you know subclasses and support
for that and you can also you know that
ties into the JavaFX is binding
capabilities in terms of being able to
animate different properties on the
screen and all of the other if you've
been to any of the JavaFX talks where
they went over the binding support and
you know the fluent api etc so JavaFX
animation you have parallel and
sequential so you can say I want to do
this sequentially then I want to do this
part of the animation in parallel you've
got timelines and keyframes and tons of
transitions and special effects that you
can actually leverage in html5 if you're
not using a library to do your animation
and you're just using what html5
provides first of all the browser
support is not consistent so you still
have to do these different calls so this
is basically a polyfill to try to like
you know make sure that the animation
supports and the fallback down below is
window dot set timeout if the web
browser doesn't support any of the html5
animations depending on if it's in like
an older older device or something like
that
and the problem with that is that if
you're on a mobile device the the
browser can say you know no I'm trying
to conserve battery for the user so
you're not going to get the callback so
your animation will actually be slower
because you're on a device was if the if
the browser actually supports the built
in animation API is will be guaranteed
that your animation will still behave
correctly so you know if you're trying
to build animation I mean if you're not
if you're limited at work by you know
you can't use third-party driver files
etc you're going to have to do a lot of
work to build back that sequential
parallel and build all the
structure for that once again you know
you know that you do have libraries in
the html5 landscape that will fix that
in terms of 3d support job FX and html5
both support 3d now or at least with
Java fx8 it does so if the Java FX 8 is
built on top of OpenGL direct3d on both
platforms from some pretty good scenes
this week on how to how to actually use
it and they also have samples that you
can download and get up and running
within within 5 minutes they provide a
built in scene graph for you which WebGL
does not provide you to actually have to
implement that yourself and that's quite
a bit of work they also use the Decorah
DSL shading language I believe html5
Java FX does not so the and I just put
this down there's a caveat you can
render each the webview component does
not render WebGL and Java effects
so there are some limitations with it
that I'll touch on later in the
presentation but it does the the Java
effects html5 view does not render WebGL
Java FX 3d is really 3d without the
overhead if you look at depending on the
time at the end I actually have a thing
where the block of code to actually do
something in WebGL you know to set up
you have to provide your seniors your
vertex shaders you set up your cameras
you have to do a ton of work to get your
scene to actually show up up in WebGL
unless you're using like one other like
three J's which you still have quite a
bit of work to do it but JavaFX out of
the box will provide you with a shader
it will you know you know the first time
you set up and you know go you know try
to run hello world you know your your
stuff will appear on the screen
generally with WebGL I can't I spent you
know probably you know three or four
hours the first time trying to figure
out what I'd done wrong with the shader
and why it wasn't showing up so there's
a lot more knowledge of 3d programming
that you have to have in order to use
WebGL and I would like to point out that
if you know WebGL if you're building a
very complicated application in Java 3d
doesn't quite have what you want there's
always jog '''l which is OpenGL for Java
so there is a separate library this is
just built into the platform WebGL was
actually supported by Kronos as based on
OpenGL ES 2.0 and then because the
framework is so low level as I mentioned
and you have to write reams really
complicated code to get something up
there which if you're not a 3d
programmer that's going to be quite an
impediment
so you're going ahead you know you're
going to want to use one of the one of
the libraries up here my favorite one is
3j s that one's really easy to use and
there's some good documentation on it it
is not supported in all browsers as I
mentioned Safari requires the user to
enable WebGL it's actually in the
developer menu and shaders are written a
C like language so in terms of features
you know I'm just comparing it to 3j s
because WebGL out of the box all you
have is a triangle so you know if you
want to build up you know you want to
render a cylinder you're gonna have to
do a lot of math to you know to take and
turn that to create a mesh out of
triangles you had to test the latest
resolution so yeah so you're gonna be
you know writing a lot of code and you
know refreshing your math stuff so I
like to say that job FX is if you're
trying to provide like a 3d UI or
something like that
JavaFX makes it much easier to do that
or you want to render 3d content so you
know as I mentioned before if Java FX
API is too high level you have jogo
still 4 capabilities like that and Java
effects of course they're at constantly
adding new things so the core features
will get better as we go along import
formats this is really important because
if you look at the job FX api's if
you're trying to do you know build up
something you know a scene in 3d you're
gonna spend a lot of time you know
designing it you want to use one of the
export you know what you want to design
it in the designer tool that allows you
to play around with it because trying to
do you know you know painting and code
you know you know if Picasso tried to
paint his pictures using Java code you
know I think probably would only gotten
one so you definitely want to use a
design tool I look at the APIs and the
code samples for know like that that's
that's terrific that I can do it in code
but I don't want to write you know five
million lines of code to get my you know
picture of my house in Java so they do
support right now Java effects does have
you know several different importers
that are available html5 has a custom
JSON and I put a caveat there there's
probably some importers or converters
out there that I don't know about this
is just what I was able to find for this
as I said before there's always I'm
constantly discovering something new on
EML five you know another JavaScript
library that I didn't know about before
so and there's actually the web address
down at the bottom there is actually a
importer right now that's up there that
you can actually download for that and
for that we're going to do a quick quick
demo of it so here is our company desk
assistants we make one one of the
world's most popular CAD tools called
SolidWorks anybody heard of ours that's
us
so here is SolidWorks we created this
nice widget and 3d and all we had to do
was use that export of STL
through some code that you see here and
then where's our app so you can render
it directly in JavaFX so it's supposedly
coming up well I'll just kind of stretch
it this way which doesn't want to do it
up on the thing so that's the projector
it's not our fault it's a projectors
fault and it doesn't like the a
projector thing it's windows mac so
anyway the the point is that all you had
to do is export STL reading into this
rudimentary reader of JavaFX and there
was no code so this is the demo act a
demo app for interactive mesh that
demonstrates their readers so you can
actually give them a play and so here
you can see although I'll change my
fonts on me yep now so the lines up
there I have I create an important basic
aliy in three lines of code three or
four lines of code I read in that
complex drawing that was created and
SolidWorks
into html5 and read pressure plate does
sto mesh it and then Phung material set
the color so the material and and you're
off and running so that's you know so
you can reno simple code right it's not
the knr style so it's so it's much
easier so you can actually you know
that's that's actually how you would use
it you would use
that's not good no I'd hide that hide
that that's not it's called demos so
anyway so you can you know you can do
your you can you know write a Java
application that sa rendering you know
3d CAD drawings and that one's actually
fairly complicated one
that you have and in terms of a
performance - the primary difference is
that with JavaFX I still have some
control over the virtual machine right I
can change the heat play around garbage
collection whereas html5 it's just text
you don't have any control over the
container so it's really up to you to go
out and look for things like like object
pools on one of the HTML performance
sites and and mess around and try to
improve it but it's a little bit more
onerous - to get a performance
improvement out of that some we just
thought we'd write down a couple of best
practices one common thing it's you know
it sounds kind of obvious but if you the
person is complaining that it's really
slow are they running you know they have
16,000 tabs open with seven browsers and
they were also you know running uh their
email and exchange and everything else
and that's what's slowing it down I mean
you got to kind of isolate the problem
to where it is things like a hidden tab
that's got some website that's throwing
up 16,000 flash things that ain't going
to help you either right that's going to
kind of mitigate your results so you
want to make sure that you isolate what
you're looking at also another one is I
see many times as you know the backup
agent for Norton whatever starts up and
that's gonna kill your machine - so you
want to look at background stuff - that
could be impacting the performance
before you dive into it now the nice
thing though is that most of the
browsers like Safari and Chrome already
have tools in there so you can do some
measurements so even just eyeballing it
you can go in with these tools and get
time graphs of every single element that
you come into your thing look at all the
files being manipulated so it's actually
pretty instructive to go through the
chrome developer tools or the web
inspector of Safari and just start
playing around with it even before you
go into
deeper tools and so forth and with that
if you've been to any of the
presentations where they talk about JVM
tuning I mean nobody really talks about
JavaScript does I built in garbage
collection in Java world we talked about
which could drive a garbage collector
are you using how are you tuning it you
know are you doing premature tenuring if
you've been to any of the Jay clarity
tools how do you do if you have a very
large application that you're writing in
Java effects I'm sorry in html5 how do
you tune the web browser for that how do
you find out if you know you know you're
having a problem with garbage collection
and that's why the app is pausing
because you've written a large
application because remember of HTML 5
we're talking about actually writing
applications on it not just you know
doing a webpage for instance and the
next thing up is we're going to now dive
into the html5 integration integrating
JavaFX in html5 so the first thing I'm
going to cover is a CSS for skinning
components talk a little bit about the
webview I talked a little bit about the
webview for rendering html5 content and
the little snippet of code that will
help you debug it and then dive into a
little bit on the SVG path before we
wrap it up so the first thing is JavaFX
supports CSS for skinning and so the
first thing when I saw this I thought
well geez this is a really nice
integration point because I can take the
website that we know the corporate
website grabber CSS file and then use
that to skin the application so that
when the marketing folks come out with a
new look you know new marketing work for
the application we can say well you know
you know we've swap in the CSS file our
buttons will look like the buttons up
there on the web site and it'll be
really easy to match our application to
it well that's not exactly the case
you'll see that the comparison code
samples where I compare the two of them
so Java FX ES reader also is not fully
CSS compliant a graphic artist if you
have a graphic artist doing your CSS
right now they're gonna have to learn
the Java FX CSS properties and you're
gonna have to develop a workflow for
them to be able to test them so Java FX
and also Java effects skinning
properties don't support things for like
animation on the other day the aqua FX
folks were giving a talk where they were
saying that one of the challenges they
had and try to match the look on the Mac
was that they had to do some custom code
there to get the animation so it kind of
like the buttons would Paul say
so the first one I've created basically
tried to recreate two buttons to
demonstrate you know trying to get match
html5 button you know make the JavaFX
one look the same and I was able to
mostly get it there after about four
hours of mucking around with CSS so here
you can see this is the html5 code and
as you can see you know we had different
things had to be done for the different
web browsers so you know if you're
you're doing one or the other you know
you have to handle that on the next
slide we have the the JavaFX CSS file
and you'll notice that the properties
aren't the same right there they're
different there's f dash FX padding all
the JavaFX properties have dashes when I
was trying to get the the board or up at
the top there was no you know top of
border you know I was trying to figure
out well how do I set just change the
top border I'll at the bottom you know
the other three sides remain the way
they were without me mucking with them
and I spent hours trying to like you
know muck you know trying to figure out
how to get that to how to match the look
and feel and then I kind of created I
took that out and I've distilled it in
this slide right here just to kind of
compare you know I'm doing the back you
know the background html5 property the
value that I use for html5 the JavaFX
property and then the value that I used
in setting the CSS so it's not a
one-to-one match so though yes it is
using CSS you just can't take your you
know your website CSS and reuse it I
don't I don't work for the question was
whether whether was going to be super
full support for CSS support I don't
work for Oracle so I don't I don't that
that's a question for one of the Oracle
guys yes yes you're correct the question
was the last column I have mislabeled
and so forth I've been so webview
overview so now I'm going to get into
the webview component which if everybody
was familiar with the you can actually
render JavaFX sorry html5 content in
Java effects so it is a fully compatible
html5 web browser it uses WebKit
underneath the hood which is the same
thing that that's the back end for
Safari and Chrome so it's a you know
it's not like the old swing days where
we had that swing HTML
component that never seemed to you know
that only rendered HTML from 1995
correctly which was extremely
frustrating to use so this is a full
browser that actually is implemented a
native code behind the scenes to it it
does not have navigation controls so
just like the media media api's didn't
have navigation controls this one
doesn't you will have to do proxy
detection configuration etc so if you're
behind a corporate firewall like we are
where you're going out on a different
port and all the rest of it you're gonna
have to figure out how to get that
information out of the operating
operating system or prompt the user for
it and you have limited ability to
control page loading as I discover
because when you're behind a proxy
firewall sometimes things don't load so
with that you actually do have byte it
with the the Java effects web component
you actually do have bi-directional
communication so in this example here
I'm actually from within Java
within I'm setting an object onto the
page and then JavaScript code is able to
invoke it so your JavaScript code could
you know call messages you know so in
this case right here I'm changing the
title of the stage right so the that
object had a had a had a I should have
put more the code sample up here but it
had a set title method the object that I
pass in there with this and then you
know I can call it from the JavaScript
code which is the second line down there
I can call the Java code so you can have
JavaScript code calling JavaScript
observer Java Script code calling your
java code you can also go the other way
around where you have Java code that
calls JavaScript methods in the webview
so you've got complete bi-directional
communication there so it allows you to
build an application that is unified and
you know in some of my examples I
actually did have you know I use the
html5 the animations within it so I had
you know animating you know stuff that
was animating etc with it so I could
actually control the Java code could
call the code to control what
yeah no no no yeah this this is the go
back okay
so now one of the things I ran into was
that very often I'd end up with a blank
page when I was working with the webview
and this was driving me absolutely crazy
because it would take me hours to figure
out what I had done wrong cuz browse
other browsers can be very forgiving and
render
not tell you did a problem and I also
wanted to be able to find out how to do
you know get more information like
profiling information etc out of the web
out of the WebKit so it turns out that
there is a WebKit API that you can then
talk to that you can send the JSON
messages and it's it's what's use it's
the same API that's used to implement
the D the debugger and the in the web
browser right so you actually have full
access to it if you google what WebKit
debugger API will get the the URL and
the slide right and forgot to add that
to the slide but there's a complete
documentation for the protocol and
everything and it uses JSON messages so
in this case right here I set a callback
method so I use the debugger and that's
actually kind of a hidden interface so I
don't think it's an official interface
and will probably change in the future
but you can set the callback method you
know so that you know it gets called
every time you get a message and then
down below I said the bugger enabled to
true and I send a message over to WebKit
saying do this action so in this case
right here every action has an ID and
I'm telling it to you know do the you
know to enable council and to enable the
council so that every time I do console
dot log in the in the web page I'll get
a callback to my Java code telling me
that console dot log was printed out so
I can find out what happened I'll also
get error messages so I can find out
that I had a typo in the page or typo in
the JavaScript code so in terms of
integrating webview you can do hybrid
applications where you integrate a web
application into a desktop you know you
can do things like if you want to
integrate you know a forum into your
application so you know users can give
you feedback and ask questions provide
online help it also does since there's a
full html5 web browser you can play I
have not tried playing video yet but you
can render SVG contents so actually I
because it's because the html5 has got
excellent support for SVG better than
one job FX has you know I can pull in an
SVG thing into the web view and render
it and because the web view is just a
node you can actually put it into the
scene graph it's not just an atomic
component and actually stack things in
front of it do all kinds of things
limitations I was really months ago when
I said when I started playing around
with the html5 control I was really
excited cuz I thought I'd finally be
able to get geolocation support which
sadly if they do not
that feature so you know if you try to
try to do that it won't work using the
debug API in the previous slide you can
also set the user agent which which
hopefully I'll allow you to do in the
future but I had some JavaScript code
that I was trying to interact with which
was I think export which was from like
robohelp and it was not liking they had
no idea what this WebKit JavaFX web
browser was it just said I you know I've
ever choose to render and you know I
don't support in terms of SVG support in
Java effects you can actually you can
actually render you can actually create
paths using SVG so here I took this is a
code snippet from a little sailboat that
I was rendering a little animation that
I created so I downloaded the SVG file I
opened it up I grabbed out all the paths
and I take the the D parameter out and
you stick that into the content and you
look you parse the basically the style
there's some some people out there ever
and actually XSL XSLT spreadsheets that
will like convert it into F XML the the
XML format for JavaFX although I tried
running it on this particular sample and
didn't work but it would be very easy to
write a parser for SVG that then could
build up the stuff in Java effects build
up you know render the graphics and Java
effects so in conclusion external with
html5 external libraries are necessary
to make html5 viable otherwise the core
features you know would not you know are
fairly limited like with WebGL you'd
have to you know it's like going back
you know writing raw it's literally you
are writing raw OpenGL code it does have
a well-developed
ecosystem so you know every time if I
try to if you know when I'm playing
devil's F can I try to say well Java FX
is better than html5 somebody's you're
always going to get there's always going
to be a library out there in JavaScript
that will do what Java FX does you know
I mean there's other architectural
limitations so I would say that we the
weakness is the core language and
feature integration in terms of the
features are kind of separate there's
not like a you know in Java FX you can
see that there's kind of a consistent
design approach for everything whereas
html5 is more of a conglomeration of
stuff god of effects is well designed
with an architecture with excellent
feature integration it's not feature
complete yet there's gap some core
features
so you know the job effects 3d stuff is
nice but it's not quite there yet that
you could develop by you can do some
nice things with it but it's not fully
developed yet you don't you can't draw
lines you can't you know there's a bunch
of limitations with it it's necks
definitely as we'll see tomorrow it's
the next logical step for desktop
embedded device next logical step for
the swing stuff and it's also very you
know very useful if you're trying to do
like you know embedded device like the
Raspberry Pi where they have JavaFX
running on it so if you want to do you
know like you know control interfaces
anyone have a nice UI is much easier to
use that in terms of major concerns with
html5 of course there's the protecting
IP and patents type stuff longevity and
stability of the external libraries
because the ecosystem is constantly
changing you know if you're developing
an app that you know we have like 10
year cycles from some of our apps where
we have to support them you know over
the course of 20 years or something like
that so that gets a little bit harder if
you tell somebody well you have to
install you know ie 11 10 years from now
there's you know it's depending upon who
your clients whether it's actually it
can be a concern browser support in
tracking releases some of the slides in
here you know maybe the video support
has changed since I last checked it
I think Firefox is updated at least 20
times since I did start working on this
presentation
JavaFX concerns I was missing the mobile
support which is a big one there's
always concern about Oracle's commitment
to job effects in terms of the direction
that they're going with the technologies
and them being not fully on the desk you
know be made a database company and it's
not it's not technically developed yet
and then we thought we'd leave you with
a couple of websites that we've thought
were particularly interesting the HTML
rocks which is a really treasure trove
of code samples and performance
performance information dive into html5
beautiful site when the most beautifully
rendered sites out there
great JavaFX tutorials at Java code
