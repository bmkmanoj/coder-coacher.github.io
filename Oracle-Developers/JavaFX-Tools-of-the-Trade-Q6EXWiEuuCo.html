trade and I'm assuming that all you guys
like Joe effects is it true yeah yeah
let's get rid okay i know it's lunchtime
we'll try to make to the riddle me this
this presentation was supposed to be
present by two people Michelle and
myself but I don't know it looks like
the air condition is doing a number on
oh so we don't feel actually very good
today and I'm the only one that giving
the talk but we will do so the agenda ty
have that we have for you guys today is
try to get kind of like that the lay of
the land of the different tools that you
can make use of when creating
applications with Java fix now of course
they are the well established players of
what we like to call the usual suspects
because we hear about these tools over
and over and over and over all the place
they are always there there is no way
that you can think about John effects we
don't think about these tools you know
which ones i'm referring to there is
also the possibility to build
applications with a standard build too
so if if you are building an application
i want to build something in a CIS
environment then you can use any of
these tools there are few frameworks
that are already popping out is so you
know javafx is just a new i took it it
doesn't provide you anything more in
order to build our sanely build an
application for that you need a
full-blown and application frameworks or
there are several levels and some
additional extra projects that you can
have a look at all right so there will
be some demos so bear with me is
something breaks is because I'm doing
something wrong if it's not life if it
doesn't break it's not life but of
course it's going to be life if you have
any questions please ask them at any
time please feel free to do so and I'm
try to do my best to answer them as best
I can so without any further ado let's
go with this guy
yes you know what I'm referring to right
awesome for those of you are no I'm not
going to spoil the ending so we have
this guy this is probably the first one
that pops to mind netbeans there is no
way that we will hear about Joe effects
without netbeans was fun interesting
thing is that netbeans is a swing
application so the Oracle is using swing
to push out javafx not yet eating their
own dog food but the next tool actually
does it seem builder same builder is a
gel effects application for building
javafx apps now the great thing about
seeing builder is that it's a WYSIWYG
editor and it spits out f xml or at job
based class i'm not so fond of xml
personally but I get this tool is okay
considering that all you have to do is
just drag and drop and automatically on
the behind the covers the f xml file
will be created as okay the third tool
that i want to refer today is scenic
view you guys know what's in a big is ya
know maybe so a scenic view it's kind of
like an x-ray into your gfx application
once you launch any application and then
you connect this thing as any hbu to it
you can look at the whole tree component
tree but not just click and point to see
well here's my text view and here's the
panel and he's whatnot you can look at
the properties and you can also change
those properties while the application
still running so you can make some
tweaks and then go back to the code and
add the new values that you have just
played with and then continue going so
this is a nice thing to launch a javafx
application and then attach this java
agent and just play around with your
weird your application so these three
are actually
that's actually a 4 1 is the effects
experience tools from the JJ effects
team these are the tools that most of
the times you see being presented
whenever javax is there but of course
there's more both IntelliJ IDEA and
eclipse have added more support to Jay
effects Tom she knew from Austria he's
working very hard on a new thing which
is well kind of a new thing called EFX
which is the support for Jay effects
into the Eclipse platform he has even
created a rich text editor using the
Eclipse base api's and everything is
being rendered with Chavez which is
actually very cool so it's kind of like
the beginnings of its own javafx
playlist ID because I said something
about the effects experience this is the
tool that Jasper has created it contains
a spline editor and a gradient editor
and a color picker and another to that I
like to showcase and is this one is
called the FX g this is an FX adobe FX
FX ml xml insisted syntax file this is
the kind of think tanks that you get out
from adobe fireworks so any designers
can go crazy and create beautiful and
stunning pictures translate these things
into FXX G and then use fxd converter to
translate this F xml into this xml
regular xml into f xml you can even
translate this thing into java 2d or
proper javafx classes or even javascript
canvas so this is this quite useful the
author of this tool is called his name
is Garrett from well you mind not being
online as han solo on the score on
twitter he's actually giving 7 talks at
this conference he's right now giving a
talk with another guy effects guys they
come from Germany and they're they're
dressed in traditional German attire so
that's quite fun to see
you can run this application from web
start so that's the URL in case you want
to give it a try this is very
lightweight very easy and it allows you
to export the different if FX three
layers if you want to in this case it's
just one layers which is a one that
you're seeing right there on the top but
it's very versatile and then the nice
thing is that you get an the input is a
design product and the output is a
developer friendly product which is what
we expecting ok so far so good you let
me know you have any questions so this I
will say are the regular tools that you
usually use so let's jump into build
tools now I know there are several build
systems out there but perhaps the the
most well-known or the most used whether
it's good or bad is maven so turns out
there is a tough x maven plugin and
yesterday morning we had a presentation
right here in this this room in the
early morning by dino firma he presented
yeah the hand tools that come with a
standard jdk he presented maven and he
presented also the Gradle plug-in for
which he is the author and he's still
around so in case that you're interested
to know more about the Gradle javafx
plugin just search for Ford an offering
you it's very easy to find him so with
that in mind let's get into the maven
javafx plugin there's the there's a URL
the author is daniel selenski I by the
name I thought that he was living
somewhere in Europe turns out he's in
Australia this plugin works with jf x 22
that means jdk 7 and he also works with
jf x 80 during the latest vitas one
thing is that it will only work with
maven 30 X it doesn't work with million
31 if your latest maven you have a
problem the code is completely open
source is a license that on there apache
license to all like any
other standard maven plugin so you just
be happy and use it they currently
supported features you can build an
executable jar you can build native and
staler installer so just give a handful
of properties based on your project and
then you can create all those different
native installers this is one of the
things that Dino presented yesterday you
can also build a package that is
suitable to for deployment as an applet
or as a Webster application and starting
with jdk 7 update 25 and enforce it with
update 40 if you don't have a valid
certificate then when you sign a jar the
the java plugin will think that this is
unsigned so if you want to deploy a
javafx application on the web as either
as an applet and sequester make sure
that you have a right certificate the
correct one a self-signed certificate no
longer works there is one particular
issue in javafx 22 jdk 7 you know that
the JFX rter it's available in the
standard jdk but it's not placed into
the i guess it will be the bootstrap
class pad for maven so even though it's
there maybe would not be able to see it
so what Daniel recommends there is an
additional task provided by the maven
plugin in my vantage FX plugging that
will try to fix your class but so that
the JFX our teacher will be moved from
JDK home JRE live in to jdk home
generally live xt which is the location
where j jf x 8 now place at a chart you
can use that the thing though when i
tried it on my machine for some reason i
got a busted jdk after that but
basically what this thing is doing is
copying one jar from one place to the
other and those are the places so you
can do this thing manually and continue
to work so i'm going to show that
now let's go into demo time and all the
oldest code is available from github
let's go into lesson 1 I will let sure
that put the link somewhere let's see
here I have a very basic GFX application
I'm going to show the code there is no
effects ml involved yet here is a
bare-bones javafx app copied from
actually from the standard effects
documentation is just a say hello ward
you click on a button and then simply
preach sounds on the console something
ok now you can see at this level that I
have a palm file if I look inside the
pond file some basic properties and this
guy is making a reference to a parent
point file this is where I'm going to
specify the conditions needed for the
JFX plugin besides that just regular
metadata for this this application and
this is required or at least from this
case if you want to run and package
these applications as a real GF x
application then this property will be
used by the plug-in and curious actually
I guess I should have done this the
other way we need to see the common
directory so we're looking at Jeff X
here the the first one here's a pun I
can make it a bit bigger and this guy
refers to the common poem which is here
so really what you need is this guy this
plug-in the latest version is 20 here's
the property that was referring to this
how the plugin will know what is your
domain entry point for your application
it could be any value I just decided to
put this thing you know how maybe
properties work and in the case that
ours were to sell sign my application
which has a said no longer works with
the latest updates this how you do it of
course you can define more properties
for the native installers
but for the setup that I have for this
application I just want to be sure that
I can actually run it now let's go here
into the command line going to lesson 1
and let's clean this thing in case that
i have something previously compile
there we go now i'm going to run this
app and they go for that there are
several roll rock goes that you can use
but one of them is JFX colin run this
will compile the application package it
for for standalone and then lunch it in
I guess what is it doing GFX if I tap it
correctly it will work and runs and
there we have a trivial application and
say click this button we get the right
output so now you can continue building
applications with maven now of course
there are other build tools and my
personal favorite is Gradle you can
download the Gradle plug-in from being
trained the author as I said before is
Daniel fearing this works at the moment
with j effects 22 so just jdk 7 it is
licensed under bsd so it's more
permissive the code is hosted at big
bucket again just fully open source the
latest version is seared 31 if item is
taken so it's still in the early days
but it actually does the same kind of it
provides the same features type as the
maven plugin both Daniel and Daniel know
each other at least they changed
messages so it's just a matter they do
have a friendly communication so it's
just a matter of keeping both maven and
Gradle at the same level the
configuration for what some of the
configurations that you had to put our
platform dependent in the case that you
want to create native installers because
in the case of a native installer what
you're doing is you're em
then add GRE with your application so
when you double click on the app it just
simply launches without the clear the
customer having to have an installation
of the jb m you can also instruct the
boat at the maven and the Grail plugins
to not bundle a GRE in this case would
you double click this thing you will try
to locate the already installed jewelry
in the target machine so you get a
smaller bundle but in either case it
will work it also allows you to run a
scenic view as you are running an
application this is cool I believe this
is not provided by the by the maven
plugin so let me show you that let's go
back to the code and here at the project
level I have the standard build file for
Gradle and what I like about Gradle is
not just because it's a DSL for building
is that it's very concise this will be a
confirm for those who you guys are new
to grade 0 this will be a king of
telling the bill I want to reuse some
definitions like in the parent pump and
this would be I'm defining what is the
name of the main class and the the grail
jay effects would know what to do with
this particular value so let's look at
this work this guy which is the parent
of my build which is located here what
I'm doing is that I'm assuming that my
code my project will be java-based and I
can also generate idea and Eclipse
profiles and the next thing is i'm
applying the Gradle javax plugin I was
mistaken is the latest version that I'm
using is 0 30 there are many ways to
apply or to enable a plugin in in Gradle
the easiest one in the case of the JFX
one is this as long as you have network
then your bill file will download all
the required bits configure the build
and continue now after this thing is
done you have a new kind of a
configuration block available to you
which is Java fix and this is what I
meant by
I platform a specific things if I will
create a native installer that target
windows and I want to embed this GRE
this is how you do it or if i do it with
milk mac OS x then maybe it will be this
one or in the case of linux well there
are so many different ways to install
java on linux that well you have to pick
the one that is best for you in for your
particular environment but the way the
thing that you have to know is that you
can actually do this and then guest the
rest is your standard Gradle stuff is
that's not in related to j effects so
again what i like about this build is
that it's really really small there's no
more specified there that what is needed
so if i go back to the command line I
can call cling here so that we start
with with a clean bill and then i will
tell this thing to run but i will also
would like to run this application with
the scenic view and i'm hoping that it
will not crash the last time i tried as
some trouble I guess Dino mentioned
there were some changes down to a scenic
view that are related to java fix due to
the jdk version so let's see let's list
all the task there is a scenic view and
there is the wrong task that we need to
run this application plus a few other
more
scenic view run so it starts the ESN it
bu Jabba agent it's right there this guy
and here's my application there we go I
can browse the componentry which happens
to be a stack pain with just a button
and I can change the property I can see
the properties of this button we can
change this thing find out mistaken
hello javaone and there we go and if I
click it continues to work so I guess
it's a little bit of a sub-sub air
integration you don't have to store the
the agent in a separate process you can
do it right there when you need it it's
pretty cool so what about the XML I have
another example here not yet let's go
into the second lesson because of course
you can build the whole UI using Java
but it can get very verbose that's why
we have we see week editor's lesson
number two and besides the other guys
even though they are the usual suspects
that doesn't mean we are not putting
them to good use here's our main class
this guy will load an F XML definition
and then locate the root object and just
simply attach it to a scene and be done
this affects ml file define defiance and
dependency on a controller for those of
you have seen FX ml before whenever you
define a property well any component
with a name you can inject it using @f
xml and here's just some action now what
we're doing is grabbing the text of a
particular widget and if it has some
content
we will see will print it out if there's
no content then we print a different
string finally the F XML is quite simple
the root component is an anchor pain
that has that relationship to that
controller that was telling you about
and the children is just a label a text
field and a button the button which
whose action is bound to the say hello
method of my controller now one thing
that I so it's okay i think is fine with
f xml that you can define witches assign
names or IDs like this one and eject
them back to a java object what I don't
like too much about this approach is
that this guy is both the model and the
controller it contains both the data is
a data holder and it also contains the
behavior personally I would like to have
these things separated and we'll see
that in a moment with the frameworks but
for poor trivial javac space f XML
application I guess this is ok for this
a second lesson we have again the maven
version of the bill for which the only
change is the artifact name nay the
group name and the main class and we
look at the Gradle build file the only
change is the main class so is your free
to pick which way ever you like so let's
go into lesson 2 and the lunch Gradle
and here's the application so we saw it
was a text field here's the label the
text field and the button okay so if I
have no content and I click say hello it
should be say howdy stranger but if I
put some counter there should say hello
java j1 well let's fix that one good
okay so it doesn't matter if you're
doing plain job out of XML both maven
and Gradle will continue to work I have
another thing let's see this one is this
one already uses afterburner okay so far
so good yeah so this is these are build
tools now let's get it a little bit into
frameworks and the first framework that
I want to showcase ifs afterburner the
creator of after bonus actually here at
this conference is Adam beam you might
knock in a mr. bean his mr. javabean
after burning effects is a minimalistic
framework he relies heavily on
dependency injection so the jsr for the
pencil injection i believe is 303 so he
has provided an implementation of gfx
inject with our recording an additional
library and also it relies heavily on
conventional configuration so was i
speaking the other day with adam and he
said that the main takeaway of this
framework is that there are no
Singleton's you do everything with
dependency injection as we saw before
with F XML you defined your witches and
giving the proper IDs you can inject
those witches in two controllers so why
not extend continue going forward is
your rigs have some kind of injection
then continue injecting services or
whatever other collaborators you need
for your application to actually work
turns out that this framework is very
minimalistic bit
it is comprised of only two classes and
nothing more it's a very tiny library
just one small footprint of memory that
you can add to an application and boom
you get the the whole world of the
pendency object depends injection
working for you it is open source on
your Apache and you can use it with
either the maven or Gradle plug-in I
will certainly recommend you to use F
XML as much as possible and of course
there is a warning sign here it is so
easy to get started with this framework
that when you start to call into the
behavior you may not realize that that
behavior is being executed inside the UI
thread so just be aware of this thing
and let's see a quick example of after
born it's quite cool have it here so for
that first we had to define an
additional dependency so the maven file
why looks exactly the same plus an
additional dependency right there
afterburner nothing more the Gradle
build file just depends on the parent
defines what is the main class and
defines that dependency to afterburner
it's pretty much the same thing so let's
look into the source you need the main
entry point in this case is a lesson to
read of main and here we have the one of
the first classes from at the border the
injection provider this is the guy that
that knows how to load and instantiate
and inject the instances for us wherever
it's needed it's a regular Joe effects
application subclass this is our own
subclass here lesson 3 view and this is
related to afterburner we'll see that in
a moment but this guy contains all the
widgets you want to display attach it to
a scene and then you're done one thing
that you had to do
at least to be to clean up after the
application is that when the application
is a stub you make sure that the
injection provider forgets everything
that has created again so that when you
bootstrap the application once more it
will do the property objections but it
just was a little tiny thing there let's
have a look at the view it's empty you
will notice that exist n from F xml view
this is the second class provided by the
framework the rest of it this thing it
relies on conventions the remember that
says something about convention over
configuration so this thing expects you
to build the whole UI using F XML I can
see that and you also had to follow a
naming convention if my view is named
name is lesson tribute this guy and it
spent in in this package relation tree
then W or the whole afterburn inspects
to have or find a vanaf XML file in the
lesson three package with lesson 3 lot
of XML name let's look inside here it
looks exactly the same as the other
example the only thing that I change is
the controller class but the rest of the
XML is pretty much the same thing it has
the same ideas it has the same children
and the bottom reacts to the same action
so let's look at this presenter we use
at FX ml to inject the effects ml
components but we also use the standard
Java javafx inject interface why I'm
doing this to showcase that not only can
you inject FX ml components but you can
also inject additional collaborators in
this case I have something called a
lesson 3 service which is right there
and the action that we're doing here
previously we had the logic of if I had
some content or not then we'll do
something in this case I'm calling down
to the service execute
actually grabbing that value now be
aware that this logic will be still in
bulk inside the UI thread for this
particular use case there's no problem
because I'm just doing a string
manipulation but if I'm making this a
network call or making a database called
this is a huge no no don't do this make
sure that you use the proper training
constructs and when you need to go back
to the UI code platform run later so
let's look at the service it's kind of
like the same code that we have before
in the other controller but what's nice
about this thing as the whole logic is
right there and it has nothing to do
with you I so if I want to test this
thing just regular unit test I don't
need to boost trap-jaw effects in any
way whereas in the other controller I
was injecting effects ml controllers and
components and I have in logic and
whatnot so it can get crazy as your
application continues to grow so I can
run this thing with other maven and
Gradle ID and the last one I'd run it
with Gradle I'm going to run this now
with maven to show that there are no
favorites although I'll a cradle most
maven clean Jeff X run
there we go let's put here again jela
one say hello or I can say javafx and
there we go so the service has been
instantiated and it's working that's
pretty cool and again let me show
hopefully it's going to work maven
dependency list how many dependencies do
we need just one great all dependencies
and then sees I can tap today just one
that's it no more very very simple and
stick and to the point but let's reflect
back to this place here's what I don't
like that you still have to be aware of
these things you have to be aware of the
UI thread because if you don't do this
you might get a non-responsive
application it is my hbu it is my belief
that an application framework should
help you in this case that if you know
that you are creating some kind of
presenter or controller well perhaps by
default all actions should be executed
outside of the UI thread and if you want
to come back it should be easy to do so
or maybe the default is the other way is
everything is inside the UI thread and
you have some kind of construct that is
very easy for you to go outside and then
come back again so I had nothing but
praise for for Adam for Queen these this
framework but I believe that something
else should be done so after burnin is
pretty cool it gets you started pretty
free fast and you don't have to learn
nothing else just use the effects inject
and that's it quick to the point where
as with other application frameworks you
may need to learn a little few things
now here for the next one up in case
that the demo fail which that wasn't the
case here was a code that we had to use
with afterburner for the next demo and
definitely Barry by us because I am one
of the co-founders it's called Griffin
now Griffin was initiated five years ago
we just came over fifth year anniversary
back in September 10 of this year it is
open source you can find out a geek up
but Dino myself of course myself we're
here in the conference and we're very
happy with this framework because it it
goes beyond the the fact of giving you
conventional configuration and a
command-line tool and the plug-in
framework and well some of the features
that you can find here so we thought
that it would be a good idea to follow
in the idea the ideas and the know-how
of rails and grills and do this thing
for desktop application development at
the beginning Griffin was born as a swim
based solution but it supports J effects
a hundred percent so you can create your
FX application with this thing too I
have an example here that would be a
lesson number four you can see that the
layout is a little bit different because
Griffin comes with its own command line
tooling it's similar in this inner in
aspect well kind of like in the in
spirit to Gradle and the command that
you use is called Griffin let me show
you the configuration for this app it
says that is toolkit is javafx so we
know it's going to use Jeff xfered it
has a couple of plugins that are helpful
this is the one that is required to
actually run the application as a GF x 1
if you want to branch into groovy there
is this project called groovy effects
which is basically a dsl on top of the
JFX api you might remember JFX one from
the
days that we had to use our language
called JavaScript everything was done in
a declarative way personally I hated
that language I didn't like it because
we had the option to do so the same
thing with groovy so groovy face candle
brings back the dsl definition that we
had with javafx excrete without the
ugliness of the JFX script language well
at least I believe it was ugly okay here
we can look that the different
components that comprise our application
are segregated by responsibility so we
have models we have controllers and we
have views the view that i have here we
could have used f xml but i'm going to
showcase groovy effects it looks a
little bit closer to what we had before
right so we know there should be a scene
and inside the scene there is an ankle
pain with a label and text field and a
button okay what's interesting that that
this this text fields it's text property
somehow is bound to a javax property
that is delivered by this model object
will see that in a moment and this
button will react to something that is
called cell oh say hello action now I
guess you guys remember what actions are
in swing we don't have actions in javafx
why I have no idea but the groovy
effects project brings back the notion
of actions actions for which you can
configure which behavior you can
configure the took the tooltip icons
descriptions of one node this is exactly
what the gfx action the swing action did
for us now we have them back for java
effects let's look at the model of this
guy this guy should provide a list 1j
effects property and how many lines of
code do you have to write in Java to
create a Java fix property quite a few
so this is the back you feel the Gator
and the setter you have to initialize
the the property if you want to be
friendly let's say in this case it
should be on the string yeah I javafx
property that affects string property
class or type the convention is you know
a listing the the JFX api's is that you
provide a gator and a setter that takes
the plane value in this case the string
will also provide some access or for the
JavaFX property itself is usually in
this case will be named Katella capital
property without Gator and somehow you
have to initialize that property lately
well turns out that this this feature in
groovy called HD transformations will
generate all that boilerplate code for
you finally the controller this guy is
the one that has the logic we are
injecting the model and we're injecting
the service so Griffin also provides
dependency injection without using Java
facing jack or if you prefer to use
injection v8 juice or wealth or spring
you can just install a plug-in and do it
I mean I'm injecting a service so that
it has the same kind of like the same
example of the afterburner but one
additional thing that I'm doing here is
just after I have called the service I
get the message out of it sorry and this
construct that I have here is just the
way of Griffin saying i'm going to
create a dialogue do we have dialogue
supporting GF x to know do we have GFX
supporting GF x 8 is coming and of
course there are other open source
projects out there that provide the
missing dialogue classes that javafx
doesn't here creating dialogues in
griffin is currently the same thing I
showed three members
model-view-controller in a dialogue you
create a view like this one you create a
model and you create a controller for it
this in this case the estradiol
controller has all the logic that you
need to show and hide the dialogue
but it's tweakable ok so I can run this
app now you should go into lesson for
let me see if I think the network will
work yes so Griffin run app
it takes a moment to resolve all the
plugins that are required then compiles
and launches the application and there
we go so if I input something here this
value will be sent directly to the model
when I click this action the convention
remember that I say something I say
hello action here in the view say hello
action if i look at the controller hey
is the same name this could be a closer
like in groovy or it could be a method
is the same thing for grouper Griffin as
long as the name matches so when I click
that button that controller method will
be invoked and then I get a dialog with
that value what's it so far so good okay
are we doing on time good so in case
that a demo fail he'll prepare some code
slides there so that will be the view
again using groovy effects as a DSL this
will be the controller where we uh one
thing that I didn't say this is supposed
to be a service call so might be a
neighbor called database whatever are we
inside the UI thread or not who says we
are inside the UI thread because we're
reacting to a button being pressed who
says we are outside of the UI thread the
expectation would be I guess that
because we are reacting to the to the
bottom we are inside would actually we
are outside so we can we can go crazy
here and do whatever we need in the
logic without stepping on the UI thread
and when we need to come back we can do
something like this X sick inside you I
say we have an access to the model
property here that would be named if I
do this I will be updating this model
property inside the UI and because these
property is bound to the view I will be
sending the value in the right track and
there will be no mistakes you can do
this actually this will be inside you I
synchronously like in bulk and weight in
like we had in swing or in Bach inside
you I asynchronously that is the same
thing as a platform room later or if you
are inside the wire you want to go again
outside outside UI and that code will
not run inside the white red so this is
one of the things that I believe a
framework should provide it should do
for you I have another example 22 again
hammer on and bring home why would be a
good idea to embed
sometime in this framework because you
can start today with swing and then
migrate later to java fix the problem
will be is that what did you do with the
models well now you have to use GFX
properties instead what did you do with
abuse was you have to use traffic's
widget what what you to do with the
logic is the logic attached to the UI
toolkit or not it shouldn't so let me
show this example I have a jpa
application both implemented in swing
and job of X so let's keep going to
swing and let's change into another
shell into jpa javafx okay inside here
I'm going to run this app and on this
other side I'm going to run the app as
well this will be the JFX one okay
so just take a moment you will know
immediately which one of these
applications is the swing one because it
will look ugly okay that's still going
you can see some output there with jpa
and here we have this is the swing UI
and the JFX ape application will run in
just a moment also some JPA output there
we go conceptually they are the same
application what we want to do is say
some data into a database using jpa then
we treat the data again using JPA and
feel some rows in a table for the swim
version i'm using glaze list because
there is no other same way to create
tables on work with tables if you're not
using glaze list so you're still working
with swing have a look at plays list
you're using tables so here we glowed
everything remember we reacting to a
button and we clear the table again
changing things in the UI in the JFX
version we load here's the the
information we exactly the same and we
cleared that data no contest on the
table perfect okay let's look at the
code
let's look at the swing version the
controller the model and the view for
the javafx version we also have a
controller a model and a view so perhaps
let's begin with the view because that
is the most specific thing in this in
the swim view we have another dsl a swim
builder base dsl where we have the top
frame there with some properties the
toolbar scroll bar table what now this
is swinging a specific but you can
understand how the layout is if we look
at the javafx version that also makes
use of the blue brief xdsl well it's
kind of the same here's the toolbar
there is a table view with some
properties and that this is just a small
work around that if I try to set our
list of several bliss on this table view
this mode this node we actually create a
copy of the list it's not the light
object what i'm doing here is assigning
the life list that i need to so this
will this is actually already fixed in
the next version a groovy effects grew
effects for now 0.4 i'm using 0.31 so
this will not longer be needed you know
in the next release let's look now at
the models as i said in swim i was using
glaze list enjoy effects we already have
observable list so use it directly
shorter now let's look at the controller
so we had two actions load and clear so
there's do two actions load and clear
here i'm showing you can use closures or
you can use methods is the same thing
loading requires hitting the database so
this action will be executed outside of
the why and once we have all the data we
go back inside the UI and update the
list of objects which in turn
we'll update the table clearing the data
is just affecting directly the model so
inside the UI I do this change because
if it doesn't get this we will be
outside of the y now let me show you the
controller that works in the JFX view
did you see any changes and switching
within those two let's put that exactly
the same logic and that's the point if
you start with this thing you can begin
with swing and then later migrated your
whole logic is protected the whole
behavior is protected against UI changes
the only thing that you need to do is
make the proper instructions in the
model and then you will use the right
tool kit in the UI right here and you
can do this thing today this thing is
available I think yes I have some
numbers no I should say something about
numbers the jpa the JFX application has
I think that close to 90 fine lines of
code the swim version has like three
more let's see I think the JFX version
is shorter yes nada fine lines of code
with distributor feeding models views
and controllers we didn't see the JPA
configuration but as pretty standard the
swing version has five more lines of
code so that's pretty cool i will say
because we're using these dsl's now
there are some other extra projects that
you can make yourself testing tools at
the moment we had three options I would
say let's begin with Jamie effects
because it's the oldest one it is a
straight part of Jamie from swing into
javafx personally I don't like the Jamie
AP
I I didn't like it I prefer something
else you find working with swing is
called fast so the same design that that
came from jamie is now available in
Jamie effects so if that is your cup of
tea good but I will certainly recommend
you to have a look at two other guys
test effects and Marvin effects and I
believe that Henrik you're here he is
the author of test effects and the
author of Marvin effects is also around
in the in the conference I believe that
out of the two tests effects is probably
the most mature because already put into
production in a custom application
called lot you I said true so it's
already battle-tested I believe it has a
potential to be the fest for javafx so
the API is quite good and let's just
have a look at that Marvin effects is
also great but i guess that test effects
is ahead in the race there are also
additional projects like JFX extras labs
you might remember in the old GF x 10
days that there was this project called
GFX extract with additional components
and and shapes and some other things
well that project has been reborn as JFX
extras it's available on github it has
some additional components that may or
may not find their way into J of X 8 the
idea of VI effects esters was to serve
as an incubator for components that
could be added later there is now
another project called controls effects
that that provides additional components
their so called so open dolphin were
which there has been already two talks
earlier at this room the author of up
and dolphin is around I'm also a
contributor on that project open dolphin
allows you to communicate client and
server using a remote presentation model
approach it is javafx friendly we have
answer which is a
library of components it's only
available jdk 8 hand solo the author of
x FG also at the conference he is
putting a lot of effort trying to make
sure that these components are high
quality we also have Jade effects you
remember guide from the swing days well
this guy's got created new components
for effects and they're called Jeff J
effects originally some of those
components were open source and some
others were behind a commercial license
how every I am happy to say that every
guy defects component at the time are
open source free for use so just have a
look if java is this not your cup of tea
or you want to give a try to some other
JVM languages I'm a polyglot JVM man
myself well there's groovy effects for
which our ray showed there is a scale
effects they are very close to releasing
the 10 release one of the authors or one
of the members they actually have like
20 members Steven she is yo the original
author as well Reimers and peter pilgrim
all of them are here at the conference
and there is also closer effects that
you can use all the source code that I
show today is available at this link the
minimal requirements jdk 7 maybe in 30
don't use 31 because that doesn't work i
tried and it fails Gradle 17 and Griffin
1.40 I believe this is all that I have
for you guys I'll leave this you know
just this link so if you guys have any
questions I will be very happy to answer
them yo yes maybe well just remember
that besides the usual suspects there
are more tools out there and every
single week that passes by there are
more components more libraries and
there's bound to be also a couple of
frameworks that will
make your life easier we're creating
javax applications so continue enjoying
their conference thank you very much and
again thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
