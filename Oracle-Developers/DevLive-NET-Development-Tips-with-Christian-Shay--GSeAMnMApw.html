technology Network and I'm here with
Christian Shea who is in our product
management team at Oracle and we're
going to talk a little bit about what's
new with a dotnet and some of our
support for dotnet development how you
doing Christian right it's great to be
with you here with all the other
developers at the show one people this
is a really cool Roadshow we're almost
wrapping up our first city San Francisco
was a sold-out crowd and we we had just
the full range of developers we had the
classic database developers of sequel PL
sequel apex that was fun yeah we had a
couple of Java developers that was a lot
of good fun our our keynote well was a
well known Java developer as well and
you also had a great session that was
well attended of with some dotnet yeah
it's a lot of done that developers it
was a tips and tricks for performance
with for dotnet applications and also
how to get high availability out of your
Gannett applications as well so it was
really well attended a lot of great
dotnet developers there who use Oracle
on the backend or use other databases
Wow so tell me what's new that we have
included in database released 2.2 that
you know specifically sort on this yeah
yeah yeah well so - well - as you know
just drop today on premises and there's
a lot of stuff about that and so the the
key features that we're introducing in
the data provider for dotnet which we
call ODP net it's what dotnet developers
use when they're writing code to get
data from Oracle okay so anyway a lot of
the features that we've introduced our
surrounding features that have been
added in 12 - and exposing that to
dotnet developers so a big example of
that would be application continuity so
and I talked about that in my session
about high availability
so if you have an application and it's
running and you're doing transactions
updating data and such and then bang the
database goes down what do you do about
that and that's the answer to that is
what high availability is all about do
you get a whole bunch of errors as your
application die a gruesome death and you
bring it back up and mope and your
coming out yeah your users feel cancer
errors and what do you do but anyway so
that's what high availability is all
about you want to hide that from the
user you want it to be graceful so
application continuity allows the
application to basically gracefully
recover replay transactions that they
can against 12-2 database and so we
expose that to dotnet developers so
they're able to take advantage of that
and then write down applications that
that are able to fail deal with failure
right right and so a few other features
just since you were asking those
sharding my work will introduce sharding
and 12-2 and so we're exposing that to
users you know that's a vertical
partitioning and there's and there's a
key that you need to get to those
individual shards so if your dotnet
developer you want to use 12 to sharding
you can definitely do that we disposed
that to you so that's a really great
feature we added mmm-hmm
a few others I have to look here but a
few other things that we we added were
connection pool tagging so another
another thing I talked about in my
session which was again tips and tricks
for good performance is we have a really
marvelous connection pool that's built
into our data provider and it does
things like like we were talking about
application we were talking about high
availability when a database goes down
you don't want to be getting errors so
our connection pool is actually our
connection pool is actually aware of AJ
events coming out of the database the
database emits what are called fan
events fast application notifications
and they tell the application things
like oh the database is going down or I
need to do a planned outage
sure there's an unplanned outage so our
connection pool it's actually very aware
of that and does things like drain
connections out of the pool to make sure
that you don't get bad connections when
you're trying to connect so we've
already had that so that we've had that
for a while now but new to in the twelve
to release we've added connection
tagging so basically if you are using a
connection pool and you set certain
session parameters say language-related
or whatever you might do that's specific
to a particular user you may have a
heterogeneous mixture of connections in
that connection pool some have one
language some of another so with
connection pool tagging you can tag a
connection and say well this is in the
Japanese character set or whatever and
so then instead of getting a connection
from the connection pool and having to
do an altered session you can you can
just search for a tag and you don't have
to re-execute those those alter
statements so and a few other things
we're supporting database resident
connection pooling in in in ODP dinette
which basically puts the connection pool
on the database side it's great for
scaling and also I think that's a good a
good sense of what we did in 12 - mm-hm
so let's talk them in about the clouds
okay right right I'd love to use you but
you've gotten the store for our dominant
developers well not in store today
dotnet developers you know we're doing a
promotion where you can get excuse me we
can you can get some credits to use the
Oracle cloud for free right now so you
can run your dotnet applications in the
cloud today basically we have under the
compute cloud infrastructure as a
service we have Windows 2012 images r2
and Windows 2008 images so you can you
can fire that up and what we've done to
make it easy for dotnet developers to
take advantage of that and put their
dotnet apps up up on a computer out for
example is we've written step-by-step
instructions that basically take you
through setting up the windows compute
doing all the little things you have to
do to set up iis
and the app server and do some
permission tweaking and such but it's
very very easy step-by-step and so a
developer is listening to me today you
can just go out there he or she can just
go out there and use those free trials
credits fire up can compute okay and
basically follow our instructions on how
to set up a dotnet app server and try
out anything you want for dotnet apps to
run your night app server in there the
other thing I wanted to mention is that
if you've got a dotnet app on-premises
running and you want to connect to our X
data clouds service or a database cloud
service it's really easy we've the only
thing you have to take in mind is is
authentication because obviously you
know there's a tent ocation models
involved so we've written some
walkthroughs on how to set up for
example in the case of X data cloud
service you have to you have to set up a
wallet it's a gigantic technique right
it's and so you know people aren't maybe
aren't completely familiar with that so
we have walkthroughs on how to do that
and also you can connect the database
cloud service using an SSH tunnel and in
case someone's never done that before
we've set it up so bottom line is
someone today with those credits that
are offered can go out and they can
either use Windows computer upload their
net apps or they can run the mountain
premises and connect to our cloud
services for the database yeah so great
that's terrific you know your your your
Development Center on Oracle TechNet is
one of the best centers I mean Wow
yeah I think details the detail that you
have there but you know it's it's all
very practical but you know occasionally
is the the content really does really
empower your your dotnet developers it
feel like you guys really go a long way
to help dotnet developers really achieve
some some great innovation on the Play
well we have a lot of dotnet developers
using Oracle I mean no writing code for
achill so we hear from them all the time
and you know that's my job you know I
former developer myself I work with
developers all day long so yeah I used
to work at Oracle as a developer before
I moved into this role so but anyway so
yeah so I work with developers to find
out what they need and to help them by
going to events like this and game Rosie
I'll be in New York and Washington DC
and who knows where else but hey since
you're a developer before I have to ask
you so what is the first application you
ever wrote oh my gosh that was years ago
I think it was a it was on a teletype I
mean I'm dating myself I was in seventh
grade and my teacher had a teletype
computer a little one of those phones
that go into this thing I'm like oh yeah
and I wrote a a game that like was a
tank trying to that was stalking you and
you were trying to run away from the
tank what'd you write it in back then it
was basic for nothing else really okay
far out basic cheetah of all the people
I've asked nobody's mentioned basic I
mean I don't know weird answers I had
Fortran you know there's actually I'd
Pascal the funny thing is is uh is there
was actually a lot of Visual Basic
developed there's a there's a language
called visual basic.net yes so there's
actually quite a few developers who are
using using that to write to Oracle so
you'd be surprised it still lives can
you think if we had that application
here it's still run which one the one
from they did when I was I was great
oh I don't know yes I think it would
actually yeah you know something I
believe you yeah I believe you
that's cool that's really cool so okay
here's the next question I got to catch
up with you because these are questions
I asked everybody else and so why should
he be off the hook
so none okay ready oh boy okay
there's been a study about you can
actually identify how successful a you
know a professional is based on
their choice of browser on this beginner
this is real huh it was out on Harvard
Business Review so I have to ask you
what browser do you use uh I mostly use
Firefox but that's not that's a very
small percentage of people but that's
because I'd like to use the plugins to
customize the heck out of it so but yeah
so that's why okay so all right so what
they did was they they divided up the
the respondents and Chrome Firefox
Safari or Internet Explorer yeah turns
out that the people who use Chrome or
Firefox are 35% more likely to be
promoted oh yeah and that they are
overall much more successful in their
jobs and they figured it out they said
it was because these are people who know
what they want they express their
preferences and they are willing to go
out and get what they want
yeah there you go yeah so you you're in
for you're in for a promotion soon who
should we talk to you about that oh
maybe my phone talk to you can talk to
my my boss now now one last question
that is because one of the developers at
the last show I was in said you know
what Laura browser Suns nothing to do
that you should really ask what text
editor people use so what text editor
genius
you'd be surprised I'm always on notepad
just because which is you know
windows-based but I'm always on notepad
because of the lack of of stored
formatting yes when I tasted it I don't
have to think about whether or not
there's HTML tags floating along with it
there you go so believe it or not that's
what I use very nice mr. cut and paste
good well Christmas sure was great
talking today it was really a good time
yeah that was a great event we'll be
seeing you in a couple more of our
cities and we'll keep track of you we
can follow you on twitter you are at
oracle dot net spell it all the way out
yeah
Oracle do tnat all right well thanks so
much talk soon all right all right lie
all righty that was live didn't think I
was going to be talking about seventh
grade okay I just want to make sure that
we went live let's get out there and
check Twitter to make sure it went live
did you get a weird error or some I did
which would be unfortunate if it did not
go about docker there it is
no that's not it that's it's the last
one yeah darn such a good chat
- during learn it well at least I got it
well you actually did record it though I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
