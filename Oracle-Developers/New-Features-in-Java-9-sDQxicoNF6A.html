consulting training mentoring I focus on
language based training so I help
developers get comfortable with
programming languages I also do quite a
bit of Testament development test
automation training software practices
what I like to call a sustainable agile
development and I do that around the
world I'm also a faculty at industry of
Houston I'm one of those guys on the
other side of the picket line constantly
complaining that Java sucks and for me
to be here to praise Java and I truly
believe that it deserves every single of
that praise I'm a total convert from
going from hey Java is great to Java
sucks - wow look at this Java is amazing
and I can truly attest to that and and
part of the reason is if you look back
in history of programming languages like
we just tend to live for about 10 years
oh well sure languages live longer like
we say like Elvis lives forever COBOL
people still are using it C++ of course
but mostly you have primetime of 10
years but Java is way past that prime
time and and there are several reasons
that make it happen the first and
foremost is the ecosystem the Java
Virtual Machine is just amazing as a
platform it is insane that we got
excited about Java in the beginning for
its applets and it's kind of funny to
even share that history with people to
say this is what we thought it would be
but the real strength of Java is on the
server side and server demands are very
high very high concurrency very high
stability very high performance and Java
has stood it's time for all of those as
a ecosystem the second reason I would
say is the phenomenal community the open
source community I travel around the
world and I can tell you it just feels
at home it doesn't matter what country I
go to and that's because there is a
passionate Java developer out there the
world is is the home now with with the
Java truly has United the word and we
cannot just underestimate that it's just
phenomenal
so the community is just amazing and
third reason is I always say that Java
was on deathbed when it was in Java 7
timeframe because of our other languages
there
200 plus languages on the JVM today and
a lot of them have went on to provide
really good functional style of
programming and other capabilities and
Java as a language was very stagnant but
Java 8 really made a difference all of a
sudden you see this language which was
on the dead that bed suddenly jogging
and having a good time out there which
is really phenomenal but not only the
Java adieu that Java 9 has shown how the
language can be vibrant but with the new
initiative to make short releases for
Java and looking at the features that's
coming ahead in Java the Java as a
language itself is back in the game so
those are the three reasons in my
opinion why these are extremely
important and and the future for Java is
very bright both as a platform as an
ecosystem and as a language thanks to
the development in the language but also
the community around it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
