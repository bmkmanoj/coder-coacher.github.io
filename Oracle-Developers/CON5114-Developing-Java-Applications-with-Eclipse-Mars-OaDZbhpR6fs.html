entitled developing applications with
eclipse Mars my colleague donor and I
are presenting this morning hope you're
enjoying the conference my name is Wayne
Keaton I am the director of open source
projects at the Eclipse Foundation which
means that I don't get the right
software anymore I do try to sneak it in
wherever I get a chance my primary role
is to make the projects many open-source
projects at the Eclipse Foundation and
the committers that write the code as
successful as possible a lot of that has
to do with facilitating communication
and helping helping project understand
our rules of open source development
which are a little bit different than
many certainly we have a very high
emphasis on operating in an open and
transparent manner we'd find open as
being inviting so we are we look for our
project to accept contribution when it
comes in whatever form it comes we look
at contribution in the form of bug
reports or code contributions themselves
patches test cases even answering
questions on on our forums and
newsgroups so my job is to make sure all
that and all that that is successful I
actually have above last check I think
twelve hundred different developers
working on various projects at the
Eclipse Foundation the hard part about
it for me is of course I don't actually
employ any of them so I try to help them
be successful without
being able to tell anybody what to do
that's actually a bit of a misconception
about how Eclipse works we actually
don't employ any of the developers they
all are people that come to us from
various organizations some individuals
you just either love to do open source
or their organizations feel that it's in
their best interest to contribute to
these projects so what we're very
grateful to the many organizations and
individuals that contribute to our
projects that are joint reduce yourself
yeah good morning everyone i'm goona
bank next i'm one of those individuals
that that started working on open source
12 14 years ago when I spend a lot of my
day in Eclipse itself today I'm director
of engineering and Tasha Tasha visit
company basin in Vancouver I work most
of the time in Germany taking care of of
the engineers over in Europe and taking
care of our open source work we do work
a lot we have products based on Eclipse
and we do use Eclipse a lot we've
actually contributed we're working on a
project as Eclipse and so I spent a lot
of my time also with Wayne working on
Eclipse projects so I guess I take this
opportunity to to express most most of
you I assume are here because eclipse is
a Java IDE is that accurate duh who who
here actually uses eclipse as a job ID
who is just here to heckle me looking
forward to it excellent does anybody use
Eclipse software to build products know
what I mean I don't mean the actual
tools I mean you embed Eclipse code
perhaps like people developing
applications on the rich client platform
okay whew so the rich client platform is
basically the windowing system
model a lot of the infrastructure that
sits underneath the ide and and several
years ago organization started to
actually building applications on that
we also have many other sorts of
frameworks actually one more in
treasurer one of the interesting new
ones that we've just picked up is the GS
the goldman sachs collections project is
being moved to eclipse real actually a
lot of really cool stuff in that i'm
really excited about that project moving
over but we have lots of almost 300
different open source projects at
Eclipse about 70 of them contribute to
the the IDE so we have a lot of other
different technologies in fact we come
by our booth we have people
demonstrating some of our OT technology
Internet of Things is we've got a really
big effort going there so actually just
previously I was anybody here at the
talk yesterday good I just want to reuse
a lot of jokes huh the lucky we'll put
up their hands I think most people put
their hands if they use eclipse of those
people who put their hand saying that
you use Eclipse as a Java ID how many
people have an account in our bug
tracking system Wow ok so I'm I'm always
happy to see so many people in a room
never had a problem with eclipse
that joke kills every time you're
through yeah so you already mentioned
that Eclipse is a lot more than just a
job ID this picture is actually well a
little bit of of kind of the
architecture or the way eclipse is
composed is that you have you have a
core and that's also applies to the IDE
so there's a fundamental part that
that's in the core platform what we call
what we call the platform and then you
have a bunch of plugins extensions which
are available on the Eclipse marketplace
and can be easily direct and dropped
into any Eclipse installation but I
think the key here is that all those
plugins is a collaborative effort of
many individuals and organizations so
it's not a single vendor that is
specking this that's the school Eclipse
IDE so what makes Eclipse a jab IDE is
the inclusion of the Java development
tools code you can make Eclipse into a C
and C++ IDE by adding the C and C++
plugins on top you can add plugins from
both multiple for multiple languages
into the environment and it supports
those kinds of things there's also the
bird project which provides reporting
tools which are intended primarily for
business analysts and many other things
sometimes you might be a you might be
motivated to start building and oh I
just want to build this giant it
contains everything ID don't do it we
spend a lot of effort and making sure
that most of the plugins and and the
ones that are used mostly work very well
together but like if you have an IDE
with every plugin in it like you've got
a ton of you I and you're basically just
screwing up the experience having said
that actually eclipse is very good a
component model is very good at loading
janella t as you need it so while it may
not look great vegetable function
relatively yell until you try and touch
every little bit of functionality in
which case you need a lot of lot of RAM
anyway Mars is the current drop of our
what we call our simultaneous release as
we suggested on the previous slide and
previous inquiries to that there's a lot
of different open source projects
collaborating together any clips to
build the build build the the software
that we we ship and that you use we
coordinate the efforts of those teams
through our simultaneous release we
started doing this in the 2006 with what
we called Callisto at the time Callisto
was the name of his the name of one of
Jupiter's moons we started this theme
for a little for a little while of
calling the release their simultaneous
releases after the moons of Jupiter it
didn't take us too long however to
realize that they're only depending on
how you count them 64 moves of Jupiter
and we didn't want to work ourselves
into a corner it's also worth noting
that some of the moons just have numbers
and not names and we thought numbered
releases was kind of passe anyway so we
started kind of mixing it up and make it
heavenly bodies for a little while and
then Galileo because he observed
heavenly body so the theme was certainly
heavenly things until we got to me on
our next release in which Kate we just
gave up there's not really a lot of and
names that we could use Neptune
apparently had some trademarking issues
so anyway so neon is our next release
that scheduled in June 2016 actually
what I would really like for you to take
away from this is we have been shipping
on time for well actually longer than
this the Eclipse project itself the
initial Java development tools project
has been shipping in June since 2001
2020 shipping on time for a very long
time and we have big hopes for the knee
release to do the same so the slide
shows our our way of adding those
plugins or those components into a
running Eclipse installation so the
software dialogue that you see works
with an update side and we have update
sides for all of our release trains if
you just need to remember that you
actually don't need to remember that you
are all because it's pre-configured in
Eclipse so you just select the Mars
update sign and then you you get a list
of all the possible plugins that
contribute or participate in that
simultaneous release train and you can
add those easily into your running
Eclipse insulation so if you've got any
of those packages and say hey now i have
to do or i want to investigate some c
c++ development just go to the Morris
update site selected and install it done
we realized fairly quickly that the
update site installer was a dozen
solutely alright we we decided that we
needed to come up with a better way of
engaging the ecosystem and a few years
ago we created this Eclipse marketplace
client so if you go to the window menu
which of course totally makes sense and
select the marketplace entry would gain
access to the Eclipse marketplace which
does give you access to some of the
extensions that are available as part of
the Mars release but it also gives you
access access to the greater ecosystem
of plugins that we have available so
this is a vendor vendor plugins are
available here other things that other
people have made this is your gateway to
the to the thousands of plugins that are
available to extend your Eclipse
environment and we use this extensively
one of the cooler features of this is if
they actually go to marketplace
eclipse.org you can browse them in your
favorite browser and then you can
actually drag and drop install features
on to your
running miklos instance you can also
rate them right yes you can rate the
yeah rating the plugins is handy for us
as well sort of the social coding guess
the social can social networking aspect
of it so with Mars we've we did actually
some really big things I could talk a
little bit more about some of these this
page kind of a kind of a quick overview
some of them you probably aren't that
interested in unless you're building
rich client platform applications RCP
testing tool I think the four or five
people looking at that link might find
that tool interesting swt bought that's
about testing windowing systems based on
the simple widget toolkit that eclipse
is built on but we also have the Eclipse
set the clips fxo javafx integrations
for eclipse the EFX project actually is
pretty interesting it allows you to
build eclipse-based applications using
the eclipse framework but host them on
job FX and Tom Schendel actually the
lead developer of that is around if you
happen by our booth he he may be there
at some point Greg you want to talk with
the mac yeah so so 11 great improvement
at least pump for I person is he is
because I use eclipse on the mac and and
the whole mech experience got an
overhaul so that Eclipse is now probably
properly packaged as a mega application
we still struggle here and there with
signing because of the way it clips
works you sign it once and then as soon
as you started it we write some data
into the bundle that we still have to
figure out and that ruins the signature
but so if like if anyone knows someone
working at apple would love to check how
we can improve that the the besides from
from the mac experience i think another
what we'll talk of the major points but
one thing that I'd like to highlight
personally for me is the Java code
formatter and got a complete rewritten
so it was completely rewritten and Mars
to address a lot of the
colleges it had previously there are a
few new settings but most of the time it
basically reuses the settings just in a
different implementation to make it more
predictable and more reliable so what
actually so that that might be a bit
confusing for teams when they first
launched an existing code base with Mars
and they have formatting unsafe enabled
and you might actually get slight
Corrections in the source code the
Italian as a in my role as the director
of open source projects either one of
the things I love about that code format
for matters it came as a contribution
from someone in the community the
individual just sort of stepped up said
this is something that's important to me
and gave us a rewrite which was awesome
I want to wrap up this slide just by
talking briefly about the and more
project the Android development tools
for eclipse are being retired by Google
so we fork them we have a project team
that's working on on making some
improvements and that team knows Eclipse
very well so we're and Android very well
so we're pretty excited about that it's
not technically part of Mars but it's
some work that we're doing and we feel
that that'll be an important part of
neon yeah the preference recorder so the
reference recorder as part of the
project and the project is there for
helping with the installation of
provisioning experience of eclipse so
how many of you have more than one
workspace or more than one instance of
eclipse wow that's a lot right so and
how many of you have complained so much
about that you have to manually export
and import your settings from one
instance to another ok so the preference
recorder Ames Ames at helping you with
that so what it does is actually
it listens as a recorder that's why it's
called recorder in an eclipse incense
and anytime you change your preference
whether that is through explicitly
through the preference dialogue or by
configuring some other dialogue of some
plugin it records to change and puts it
into your user home directory and the
next time you launch a separate
workspace it automatically applies those
changes as well so it can be tweaked to
ignore some settings for example you
want to have different settings in one
workspace from the other but it's so so
far it's working i'm using emily and
it's working well because like i change
some personal preferences one of the
workspace the next time i launched
another workspace its reapplied
automatically you want to jump to this
so this this screenshot actually shows
one of the questions we got last time we
delivered this is how many preferences
does a capture and the answer is most of
them there's a few corner cases this
particular screenshot is what happened
after I created a new format or settings
so it captures that the fact that my
custom formatting settings and it will
now transfer that to every new every
time I open up a workspace so those
preferences settings will be transferred
to question that is an interesting
question how many people would love to
be able to share their preferences
across development teams I'm going to
show you something in a minute but I'm
awaiting our way to answer your question
how many people would like to be able to
have automatically share their
preferences o'clock across workstations
so I work here and I work over here and
I would like to be able to make
preferences changes here and just have
them automatically appear over there
okay of those people with their hands up
who would be comfortable with the
Eclipse Foundation servers managing
those preferences for you so that you
would upload what you want and then
download what you want okay cool
excellent let me good
we're working on that so so that yes so
this is so this is new technology where
yes question the favorites yes that's
included in the preference recorder yeah
it's usually if you go if you're in the
preferences preferences dialog and you
click a button to go to like some other
dialogue sometimes those don't get
recorded but it but not obligate if it
really depends on how they're
implemented and we're kind of going
through and trying to find the corner
cases that but we get most of them at
this point probably upwards of ninety
five percent yeah so the I I personally
think the UI is a little clunky but I
haven't been able to suggest an
alternative what it does is if you open
up the Preferences dialog and make a
change when you click OK it pops up
another dialog and says hey which of
these preferences would you like to keep
and share again I'm not sure I like it
but I'm not sure what else to do so I I
would love to have comments afterwards
quite yes question
same settings for everyone that way
let's say hmmm I understand I have I
have an answer but you have to wait not
long apparently I probably should be
more familiar with my own slides one of
the things that that I think is a big
thing and you know frankly I've been
working the eclipse foundation for 10
years and bit dumbfounded that we don't
have an installer but anyway we have an
installer technology that we've
introduced and it's again the oomph
project which is not really all that
interesting i'm sure to most people in
the simple mode the eclipse installer
brings up a dialog you say hey I want to
install one of these combinations of
functionality what we call packages push
the install button and it builds an
instance of eclipse for you one of the
cool things that it does is it actually
will pull the software the features that
it that it downloads so that if you
install eclipse a second time and maybe
a slightly slightly different
configuration it will reuse when it's
already downloaded so the footprint
overall is is reduced because we share a
lot of the software it also makes it so
you can instantly install a new
configuration so in the new set of
plugins with a new set of features I can
instantly install that without actually
even downloading anything new so you
could install the IDE for Java
developers and then install the IDE for
c and c++ developers and that second
operation would only download the C++
functionality okay what I'm finding is
with this technology I'm 10 I tend to
think of my work spaces as being a far
more transient it's very easy to create
an instance of every clips with the
configure exact configuration I need and
then just
destroy it and start over again next
time I need another one with a slightly
different configuration what's more
interesting however is the ability to
build more than just a installation of
Eclipse that's ready to start a new
project the this installer technology
also has the ability to completely
realize a development environment on
this includes preferences so I'm going
to switch over and actually do a quick
demo Leah ready so this is the Installer
in its simplest form on Windows eww
double click the exe you see this screen
unfortunately you still need to install
a Java Runtime environment before any of
this works I haven't been able to get
over the legal encumbrances of that yet
click on one of these combinations of
features the Eclipse IDE for Java
developers is our most popular download
you can specify where you want it to go
which JVM you want to use on Linux it
actually doesn't make a great choice
it's making a very specific choice which
is oops okay I think I'm getting messed
up by chrome here yeah all right it
makes a but it doesn't make the best
choice I probably should pick the link
that it makes to this directory rather
than the the the hard-coding the
specific version i have because next
time I update it's going to have some
trouble but anyway on Windows it works
brilliantly on Linux by the way if you
just on fedora dnf install eclipse dash
Java you're done you're ready to go
anyway installation folder click install
watch the pretty lights and eclipse is
ready to go in a couple of minutes as
long as it takes to download the
software more interesting though is the
advanced mode so in the advanced mode I
start off in a very similar way which
package which combination of features
you want to install and I'll just pick
the idea
for Java developers because well it's
the most popular it has this mentioned
down here of a bundle pool a bundle pool
is we called each of the features of the
week we we ship we also call them
plugins the more formal name for them as
a bundle it's a component it's a module
all these words are interchangeable in
our world it's just part of our bid to
keep things as confusing as possible so
the bundle pool is a place on your disk
where we keep all this functionality in
a place that you can share it and reuse
it so ever again if I do this a second
time it doesn't have to download
everything again so where this gets
interesting to me is I can now pick a
project and many clips projects are here
so if you want to do a clip that cut
contribute to the seidio model
repository project for example you could
add it to this list and it will pull in
everything that you need to start doing
development work on CDO let me remove
that there's also a handful of projects
on github so careful of other projects
have opted to make their themselves easy
to develop on eclipse and I've been sort
of playing with his open hab 21 a little
bit myself open have is home automation
technology we've been demonstrating it
at the Eclipse booth there's a couple
other projects some of them are directly
related to a clip some of them have
nothing nothing to do with our open
source projects if I add that to the
list click Next it gives me an
opportunity to specify information about
how I want to install when I eventually
get to my finish button make sure let's
try and encourage it to be as offline as
possible it has a list of tasks that it
needs to do when I click finish it
starts doing those tasks and you'll
notice that most of these fetching
requirements it's not to actually do a
quick look in the repository to see if
anything has changed or on our server
but it's figured out that nothing has
changed i already have all this software
downloaded so it's just installing it
it's basically downloaded in built in
Eclipse and
since and it's launching it now the
interesting thing here for me or many of
the end one of the many interesting
things is this configuration this open
hab requires a bunch of plugins that
aren't included in the eclipse ii thing
that I said I wanted to it install so it
actually goes and gets those plugins and
adds them to your Eclipse install
automatically then it launches Eclipse
and I'm gonna actually stop the you know
not only to watch the whole thing
because unfortunately it takes as long
as it takes to download so now what it
does is it's gone through and it's
actually me pin this it's gone through
and it has and this is the answer to the
question that was asked earlier that I
bounced around are the bad that i
deflected it actually sets a bunch of
preferences that we care about if you're
developing for open have to your
environment should have these
preferences set in this way and let's
see how it and those preferences they
come right from the project yeah so the
project is said these are what's
important right so that's that's the
beach though you could do that too it
set a bunch of settings configure how
the java development tools work I made
it and now if I just remove the scroll
lock it should ok so we've it's
replicated the clone pardon me the git
repository it's in the process now of
what's it doing fetching content jar so
now it's building the the runtime it so
it needs a target run time to build
against a bunch of jar files in this
case it's actually some osgi bundles it
goes and builds that whole configuration
that I need for compile time why is it
called a book interesting question
because the open have to software is
still building against luna right so I'm
running an eclipse but it's building
against some actual Eclipse software
that comes from Luna right so open have
is actually a whole bunch i'm going to
throw a bunch of words it may be
meaningless it's a bit an osgi
application that runs on top of the
Eclipse framework so it actually part of
the part of the project is
actually uses a lot of the Eclipse code
to for the run time that they deliver to
their their customers anyway so this is
going to run for a little while and a
set up a development environment and
when it's done and maybe we'll check
back later because it's still as long as
it takes to download is what we're
waiting for it will basically just be
ready for me to start coding run run the
unit tests start coding unfortunately it
won't be interesting because I don't
have any home automation devices to
connect to question excellent I we have
a great working relationship happening
here this is awesome I through
absolutely the question is will this
allow us individuals to build these
scripts and absolutely yes the open hap
project made their own script included
it in their project gave us a pointer to
it we included in our our list there is
also an ability let me go back and think
I still have the installer open there is
an ability to where we run your own
script right so you can today you can
build your own script we actually have
some tools to help with assembling the
strip if it's meaningful at all it's
Annie core model well well defined the
file formats in XML but you never have
to look at XML if you don't want to
which I know I don't but anyway you can
build this script deploy it to your team
and they can run the script easily in
fact you can there's ways to configure
it so it just appears on the list to
local within your organization the you
can write you're going to have separate
scribsy swallowing you can you can have
one for initial provisioning of the
projects that basically if you want to
just help your co-workers or coops
getting started they just take that
script install it into Eclipse and they
get the Java detour everything
pre-configured with the projects working
on or and then you can have a separate
script a second one that you just use
for sharing preferences or settings
among all the valuables of the team that
they
check once a day or two times a day for
updates and then just performs those
applies those changes in inner running
Eclipse instance yeah so there's no
reason why you couldn't just do one of
these strips with just preferences
version to which we are still kind of
we've done some proof of concept of it
is I built an eclipse installation with
the git repos that I care about and all
the projects and all the configuration
and i think is ideal push a button and
give you the script it generates the
script for you like I said we've got a
lot of this kind of we think we know
what we know how to do it it's just a
matter of writing writing the code at
this point and probably some oh I'm
oversimplifying it there's a little
distant there's some some challenges to
be sure but we're pretty excited about
that and then possibly the ability to
share them broadly right so if I if I
have a configuration that I think is
good for developing my project I can put
it on Twitter here it's just a link to
to my configuration or I can pass it to
you by email or whatever make it very
easy to share these configurations I'm
you see how are we doing we're still
still downloading a bunch of stuff so
I'm going to switch back to the
presentation any questions well yes
cousin
actually the Preferences recorder when
you when you change a preference one of
the options you can twiddle to say hey
put this into a configuration file so
either make this for me the user or put
it into one of these scripts so it'll
automatically populate a script for you
is a question this is only this is new
in marks this you Marzian uh yeah pretty
sure we pretty sure it depends on some
mercy things I don't think it would work
in Luna is there a guideline or
documentation on writing scripts yes but
offhand I don't have the link and
Chancellor it's not great but anyway no
there is it's on our wiki and if you
I'll try to include the link in the
presentation before I upload it there's
also the forum on um for the project
where I key is one of the developers the
lead developer on that tooling is
helping with questions so if you
actually want to investigate this for
yourself there's documentation on the
wiki and don't hesitate and reach out on
the forum right so Josh yeah if I had to
guess it would be wikidot Eclipse org
slash boom oh no big 00 mph apparently
humph is very funny and driven no Gradle
okay so what's which topic the next big
thing and in Mars is on for the first
time we got the greater tooling bait
right into the Eclipse packages so the
bill chip project is now part of your
clips and it's included in in every Moss
package that you can download for java
development it's it's a first version it
already has some nice support for
importing existing greater projects
materializing that into an
klipsch book space there's a there's a
view that shows that analyzes based on
the analysis of the grade of files the
parsing the view shows you the tasks
that you can execute an accreta file and
then it brings back the output right in
eclipse so you no longer have to fall
back to the command line for actually
building greater projects you can now do
that all within eclipse there is some
some some additional stuff a plan for
the next version for example the the
greater file editor currently doesn't do
syntax highlighting so it all comes back
plague and white but those implement
those enhancements will be will be
targeted by the build sheet team for for
the neon release next year what they are
actually currently working on it already
yeah so here's a here's a screenshot
basically and chose I have a cable it
shows that the the view on the bottom
for creating the tasks where for poor
listening the Gradle tasks and the
editor already is associated with a
greater files it's it's black and white
but soon once you have the syntax
highlighting it will be it will be a
breeze to did greater files in Eclipse
so actually I'm curious who today is
using Gradle for builds is anybody kind
of thinking about Gradle may be
exploring Gradle we think our sense is a
Gradle taking over how about maven who's
using maven today okay you just make
excellent and should be some and still
is still around yeah I'm facility we've
we we underwent a big effort to start
migrating most of our projects to use
maven and there's this technology called
taiko which builds osgi components which
were heavily invested in but maven maven
base is kind of we really invested in
and maybe we should have waited for
great oh but anyway we'll see how it
goes um the this is actually not new I
just love this and not enough people
know about it so I like talking about it
is anybody does anybody didn't hurt the
word Milan Eclipse Milan task focused
development so what's interesting about
this this is actually this is
interesting to me for a whole bunch of
different reasons first off this the
genesis of this project was a study done
measuring number of different studies
done by researchers i'm going to ask for
some audience participation again what
percentage of your time do you think you
spend as a software developer actually
writing writing code who figures they
spend like eighty percent of their time
writing code let's drive down to fifty
percent fifty percent of your time
writing code let's keep going twenty
five percent who thinks it's about
twenty-five percent okay let's go back
and straighten things is closer to 10 ok
so the these studies that we're done
this was actually some time ago and I
need to stop citing studies without
links but these studies were done at the
university level they did they
discovered that software developers
spent upwards of eighty percent of their
time looking for stuff
um and I'm sorry you if you poke your
hand for eighty percent you are so far
above average around average software
developer spends around ten percent of
their time actually writing code there's
probably with five or six percent that's
just like browsing the web I know I'm
assuming that that doesn't count I'm
assuming that in the study they they
were they were voting you're focused
development time so we spent eighty
percent of our time looking for stuff
and about ten percent of our time
actually writing code the other ten
percent probably talking to managers I
don't know so from that where do we find
the biggest time savings as a developer
you know sorry I'll answer for you if we
can make it easier to find stuff then
that's a huge win for in terms of
software development productivity so mad
what we have is this task focused
development concept in Eclipse and this
is actually baked in to into almost
every package that we we produce the at
the simplest level this allows you to
pull in your issues tracker information
directly into your Eclipse environment
so we use bugzilla Eddie clips you can
quietly snicker to yourselves about that
or out loud anyway so I actually have a
number of different queries that run
against bugzilla and pull all of the
tasks all the issues that are tracked in
that bugzilla instance directly into my
eclipse and then i used those tasks i
focus on those tasks and what you do
isn't in eclipse as you put you turn
that task on you basically add focus to
that task and then what happens from
that point on is eclipse watches what
you're doing and it figures out what you
are interested in and what I'm trying to
show in this this screenshot and it's
terrible I probably should have gotten
rid of the title of the toolbar um it
actually will filter views based on what
you touch so you use a particular class
you start making some changes in a
particular class it will show up in the
filtered view but nothing else will
right so I literally have work spaces
that have
thousands of things in them and I will
find I will spend minutes of my time
looking for a one of those things the
first time I find it it winds up in my
task context then when i switch to a new
task and then maybe switch back to that
previous task either than it later that
day or two weeks later or six weeks
later it Clips goes hey last time we
were here this is what you were
interested in it opens up the editors
that I had open at the time it filters
my views to show only the things that I
had touched and this actually goes right
down to methods so why she show you just
the class and the methods in The
Navigators that you actually put your
cursor in and made changes to over time
things will disappear from the list
because you're just not interested in
them anymore its kind of creepy how good
a job it does of knowing what you're
interested in any way I invite you to
take a look at it there's a lot of
really cool things that it does
including Garrett integration anybody
used Garrett say again oh go to the task
view there's a tasks open the tasks view
there's a Desilu perspective that you
can go to and you configure the
repositories the connections to let's
say your systems that you're using
bugzilla jared is another one Hudson
Jenkins is also supported there is a
connector for jira an open source one
and then there's also a bunch of
commercial connectors you can find those
on on the mile and wiki page there's a
there's a list explaining or having
references to them one interesting thing
is that you can actually share those
context with your colleagues right so if
you start investigating an issue or a
problem and you start browsing through
the code it remembers the classes the
methods the places you're in and then
you can attach that context to the jira
ticket order to the Box Allah ticket
you're working on and then the next time
your coworker is investigating that
issue or continuous investigating a
tissue or helps you with investigate
I issue he downloads the context
activates the task on his machine and
automatically also gets the filtered
view yeah so the Garrett integration we
use Garrett edit clips for code reviews
and also as a way of accepting and
welcoming contributions to do any
eclipse project Garrett is integrated
with get and comes out of the Android
project so what would the Garrett
integration in Eclipse does it allows
you to configure the connection to get
web server okay repository and then you
can set up queries and bring those
reviews like visualize them in the
Eclipse IDE so you can work on code
reviews without ever leaving eclipse you
don't have to go to the get web UI you
can actually view the files and compare
them in your workspace and you can put
on comments and you can reply and you
can vote you can all do this from within
eclipse you don't have to go to the
Garrett web UI similar is true for the
task like for the bugzilla JIRA
integration they all show up in the task
list based on your queries and then you
can interact with them right out of
eclipse and you don't ever have to leave
your development environment the key
here again is keeping developers focused
and not distracted with switching
context between different applications
because every time you switch to your
web browser to look at Gary you have to
check facebook to right or whether the
cool kids are doing today instagramming
I don't know thank you anybody use
Garrett internally Garrett is pretty
cool it's really we maintain a we
monitor contributions coming from third
people outside of our commuter committer
list they keep track of how if you know
how freaked out how frequent
contributions come in when we introduce
Garrett there was sort of a kind of a
plateauing effect and then everything
spiked right we are the amount of
contribution we received from the
community just increased like gosh it
must have been at least two times over
the period of a few months just because
contributing things to Garrett is just
dead simple that's how the Android
project works the next big thing in Mars
at least in our opinion is the error
reporter so what Eclipse does now it
ships with it includes a tool that every
time an arrow gets locked on your system
or appears on your eclipse instance you
have the you have the option to opt in
in a way to allow submitting those
exceptions those arrows back to the
Eclipse Foundation server so that the
project teams can then analyze and scan
through them you can put in an email
address and when you do that you'll get
notifications if the the problem you ran
into God fixed or if the development
team actually has further questions and
want to reach out to you yes oh please
the information that gets sent to the
Eclipse server can be anonymised in
terms of the log messages so we don't
even see the message in a case it
contains sensitive path that you don't
want to share and we also anonymize
package class and method names that are
not within the orchid eclipse or other
open source names brains yeah so this is
automatically in your Eclipse packages
that you've downloaded for Mars if this
dialogue does pop up it will appear in
the bottom right corner of your screen
we tried to be on it is not intrusive as
possible by default it is configured to
preserve your identity it doesn't it you
don't have to give it this information
it automatically on
Mieses if you could please say yes
please send this message that would be
very helpful for us we've already
managed to fix a lot of bugs that we
wouldn't otherwise have known about with
the because of this i'm going to just
not even a talk about the ring a little
short so i'm going to jump right into so
again code recommenders is an
enhancement to the java development
tooling so the way the java development
tooling is done it allows you to plug in
custom code completions and the code
recommenders team what they did is they
enhance the content assist to be smart
in a way that it scans usage patterns of
open source repositories and in public
available ap is so when you start
writing code it it has a repository it
has a server in the background where it
gets the data from it knows ahead of
time or it predicts it recommends
methods or even call chains or even
templates to you of what you might want
to do with the jframe
so yeah so look what what we're seeing
here at what you saw initially was the
full list of every possible thing I
could say to a frame
alphabetically-ordered because of course
that's that's helpful so as gunner had
said what happened to one of our project
teams that went out and they surveyed as
much software as they could find as much
as source code as they could find and
analyzed it and they found for example
eighty-four percent of the time when you
create a jframe the next thing you want
to say to it is get content pane less
often thirty-six percent of the time the
next thing you want to do is set its
title so get content pane well the next
thing at fifty i think is fifty-four
percent my my screen is not big enough
its crowding the the pop-up help the
next most likely thing i want to say is
this at run this ad to add a component
to my my content area i think the key
the key here is that you can see the it
recommends the add method with the
additional parameter which is likely an
indication that most of the time she's
using the add method business is not
sufficient you should take that as some
some some help in picking the right AP
is that you want to use for for ordering
coding so anyway that's all that's the
whole demo anyway I think this is pretty
cool first have access to all the
methods but again it sort of shows you
the most likely ones that you want in
the most likely order that you want to
have them and it is all context-based I
just get content pane the next thing I
probably want to do is set the title
oops
Oh fairly early next thing I do is
disposed so this is this is based on a
survey of code it may not make sense you
know a patent well actually thought that
I saw pattern which was disposed and
then rebuild you are in the main method
so it might make sense in a post it at
the end um yeah so still pretty good
right all right all right what do you
have next maimon yep maven so again this
is not new but it's consistently
improving in em I know there's a there
has been a lot of pain with using maven
and a passive in Eclipse there were a
few complaints and confusions and the
team is listening and constantly working
on improving the way the main
integration to m2e tooling works so yeah
among the the feature highlights the
improvements for Mars is the general
their small little usability fixes that
I rely recognized in the palm editor and
in general the interaction with with
memory loss and Tory's when you are
let's say on a train on the plane when
you're offline so that that that's
support improved as well and in general
the memory consumption I at least that's
my observation went down with using
tooling and Mars get integration has has
been improved the interactive rebased
view is makes base doing these three
bases riri bases that are complicated
far far easier there's actually anybody
assuming arose using get in some form
right who's using kid who's using eejit
who's using the the get integration from
eclipse interesting okay I'd be curious
if you tried it and didn't like it I
would really like to know why because I
switched from when they were first
initially we were initially developing
it I found I had to keep get to me
line handy I haven't actually opened
gimmick get command line for a long time
now it's pretty pretty pretty functional
with instant Eclipse now the especially
the the interactive rebase that's that's
a feature I highly recommend exploring
it's so much more convenient to do
rebase from within eclipse because you
can see when you run into merge
conflicts or when you run into conflicts
you can edit the Java code right in the
Java editor and then see if it compiled
and yeah I like the Haluk the history of
YouTube when you get lots of branches at
that lets you visualize the branches and
figure out figure out where you are wrap
up a little bit this is not not Mars but
I think it's interesting we are demoing
at the at our booth in the exhibit hall
our Java 9 support which is the start
we're really really very early in this
process to run it to today you need to
get the neon m2 builds off of our server
if you go to eclipse.org / downloads
there's a link there to developer builds
pull down one of the knee the knee on m
2 and into that you can install the beta
of the Java 9 support it actually needs
to run on Java 9 presently i'm not sure
if that will be true in the final
version today and i'm not sure again if
what people are aware of but you can
actually run eclipse on java 7 but build
java 8 applications or build java for
applications the the version of Jabba
that Eclipse runs on is independent from
the software the version that you build
on except for this version 9 beta where
you you definitely need you to use the
jab at nine underneath that so I
actually just got the early access
download off of the pajama page I think
it will stay that way because the 11
important change that is happening in
Java night as they changing the way the
GD case is laid out on the file system
so they now have and well I wouldn't
call it secret or proprietor but they
have a special format they no longer use
a jar file so we need the api's to be
accessible in order to
read those content out of the GRE images
and that's basically the reason why you
need the drama 9 for running this I
heard my process of getting this to work
out my my workstation and my blog posts
that be included in the notes that we
will post on the on the javelin website
the the point of this slide is we're
pushing hard who are intent is to have
Java 9 support included in our neon
problem it will actually wind up being
the neon update 1 release which will
occur in September the current release
date for Jabba nine is September 25th I
believe so we're going to 2016 whatever
that in that range sorry what doesn't
mean to be so dispatch 25th now should
be so dismissive that's just rude so
anyway we we plan to do a our regular
neon release will be in June our update
1 release will include the Java 9
support at the same time Java 9 is
released that's our current plan which
may change if java 9 changes its release
date so we're trying to we're going to
accommodate that as best we can with
that we are done the formal portion of
the presentation thank you so much for
your attention do enjoy the rest of the
conference
