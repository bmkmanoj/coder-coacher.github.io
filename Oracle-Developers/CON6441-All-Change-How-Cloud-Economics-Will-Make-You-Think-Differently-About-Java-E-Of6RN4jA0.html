to the session or change why the
economics of cloud will make you think
differently about Java this is one of
those talks where I'm not sure this
technical or not let's see how it goes
so before we start I have to give you
the usual pligg ritory thing from IBM
and I'll let you read that ok so me my
name is deep pool I work for IBM I used
to provide until about a couple years
ago work in the JVM team down in her
sleeve which is in the UK that's not
quite my office my office is slightly
this side of that nice building but I
change what I was doing because of a lot
of things that are coming out of this
talk so as a JVM developer it was
becoming more and more obvious that they
were interesting things happening in
this wider space called cloud and at
some degree you've got to go off and
just play with it so my current job is
leading a large team that's using cloud
technologies OpenStack docker you name
it and we're learning how to build
infrastructure and systems for our
product teams to make use of so they can
exploit it and out of that this sort of
talk arose because a lot of the things
that you discover which may not be as
obvious as you as you've you first think
start to turn up and then you begin to
realize what really is happening here so
this talk is about this sort of
measurement so this is gigabytes per
hour ok this is a measurement that you
may not will really really already know
but it's changing your life right it's
already happening some of you may
already be affected by it but it's
actually coming through so I'm going to
explore why this is happening so I'm
going to go through basically economics
of cloud provisionally and how that how
that pans out then we'll look a little
bit how Java today measures up to those
sort of new requirements then we'll go
through
another driver so cloud is one part but
there's another thing on top of that
called the API economy and that affects
how we think about Java and then we'll
wrap it up with some conclusions and
some ideas about where this may all go
so let's start with the first bit the
economic so let's talk about cloud why
do you want to do cloud right so the
main thing is your businesses are out
there going I need to get my stuff out
quicker okay and that's it that's the
drive i need to get my stuff out quick
and we'll explore that in a minute but
the first challenge to everybody is I
can't get my stuff out quicker because
the infrastructure that I've got which
might be less messy than you see there
has a whole bunch of history associated
with it so the cloud the cloud promises
something the cloud promises this
wonderful virtual dynamic environment
it's infinitely scalable it's always
available in the mineral upfront
investment you just buy what you need
okay so you take your code you host it
somewhere else and you just pay for what
you want any one bit and you can do that
as much as you want to scale as much as
you want okay so you can see that's the
attraction of moving away from your old
style environment to this new site okay
really easy so how how quick do you need
to be
here's a case study how about this so we
this is a I won't mention the company's
name so this is a real example so you've
got a company that says if I have if I
see one of my products turning up on
social media or turning up on TV or
anywhere right if i can get my product
my version of that so you know a fashion
house a and you're selling handbags and
all these things if you see one of
something that looks similar to what
you've got if you can get it out onto
your web page on your front end and i
don't mean it's in the catalog i mean
you theme it you had all the other bits
around it if you can do that within less
than an hour you make money right and
these people are doing that hit miss
sometimes but it's moving faster and
faster to be up to the point where i can
these guys are deploying that quickly i
need to get my updated website out
within less than an hour please right
and the thing is from a cloud technology
point of view we know how to do this
right it's real cloud is coming whether
or not you're using it it's there and
there are a lot of people using it right
and everybody is getting into the game
you saw you've seen SoftLayer Amazon
IBM's doing at you saw Oracle's
everybody is doing cloud right because
of the fact that it delivers on this
promise right and that's that
everybody's buying into this so that's
the first thing to take away here right
this is real but everybody goes oh yes
softlayer its amazon it's wherever it is
that's all external that's not going to
happen to me you may be going I'm never
ever going to move to cloud technologies
my company doesn't do that it's got a
big data center why on earth would I
want to push all that stuff I to Amazon
that's just wrong well the problem is
that hybrid cloud which is running those
sorts of deployment technology that
OpenStack docker you name them are
actually turning up in side your data
center in fact the biggest growth in the
cloud market is actually about taking
your data center and giving an
re envisaging it so that you can deploy
to your local environment just the same
as if you're deploying to Amazon or soft
layer or where okay it's coming and it's
coming to you so this new cloud birth
technology is what it's called the
ability to get some resources just when
you need it right is going to change and
is changing the way that you do business
is the way you develop software cross
the board all right you need to get your
head around the idea of the way that you
deploy machines and the environment that
you have available to your changing and
we just try and chart that out so on
this nice little chart try and imagine
time going that way and compute capacity
so in a traditional sort of model you
might go in my first version I use some
number of machines for some period of
time and then I do a second version and
I get maybe a bit more capacity because
the machines are got bigger and all that
sort of stuff and I go over another
whether it is you know whether it takes
you a year to do maybe you do it once a
year and every year you're you get
bigger right that's not what happens
that's not what's happening with your
competitors the guys room who are
embracing cloud are doing this what
they're doing is they're going I'm
buying the same amount compute power
that you've got in that blue box but I'm
gettin it over a shorter period of time
and I'm getting more of it so I'm not
buying 10 machines for a year I'm buying
300 machines for five minutes okay so
think about that and as you can see what
happens is it gets the the time period
that you buying these machines over gets
less so that has implications to the way
that you think about your applications
the scale is going up everybody's doing
this right it's basically this why would
you buy a computer why would you invest
capital expense into buying some bare
metal that you run when you can hire it
for a very short period of time and you
can hire tens of thousands of them right
that's what happens and if you look at
some of
pricing now you'll see some of the cloud
guys are down to charging literally
buying so many milliseconds right okay
and that's where we're going okay here's
what we always wanted we've been talking
about computing tap everybody's heard of
computer on tap I mean it's been one of
those things we've been promising the
industry so now we actually have it we
really have computer on tap it's not
perfect they're still of ways to go
that's one of the reason for this talk
is to talk about what that means for
Java but compute on tap really good turn
the tap get your compute power turn it
off pay for it used so the challenge is
that what you get with that when you get
a tap with water you get meters how many
people here have got water meters yeah
okay have I mean I didn't never used to
have water meters eyes to a flat rate
and then the water meter turns up
suddenly I think differently about how
use my water right I tell my kids off
get out the shower you know all the user
sorts of stuff right because I'm not
playing playing a flat rate i'm actually
play paying for what i use right and
that's what's happening here so now
we're talking about this Mercia ball
connection right between your money and
your complete resource right and now
your team's your about your business
guys will be looking at going I know how
much you spent on that product right
it's not like you've got stuff and yeah
okay I've got stuff now it's mine I went
out with my checkbook or my American
Express card and i bought some resource
okay and the resource that i spent will
get attributed to the success of your
your product or your software or
whatever right and its really close
right and it's actually even more scary
than that because now your business guys
are going to go I understand what
gigabytes per hour means because it's
about money so i can save by money by
making use less of it alright so back to
the water analogy the fact is is that if
there's any room for improvement
in the efficiency of your application
you're going to start finding yourselves
being pushed that way right somebody
will be looking at it they'll be doing
yourself because you'll be trying to be
successful but you will find that you
will get more and more scrutiny right so
this is really scary I had thought about
redoing this talk as a Halloween tool
but it's not quite right but what the
hell okay so let's talk about how a java
measures up to that so compute equals
money we understand that okay dollars
equals gigabyte hours and you can think
of it as a developer is going when I put
dash X at X egg MX on my heap size well
in one level now I'm starting to spend
money because I'm going to be deploying
my application in this new environment
where it costs money per you're a tram
that you use right now the businesses
like this as you can get right because
they're going any I'd get it so i can
just want five gig for 10 minutes please
write and they love that the question
for us is so now that you've got that
equation of i want to use ram how much
money do I spend well here's where it
starts to get a little bit complicated
so now you need to look at it from the
other point of view so your business
guys are going make your application
more what performant you know I'm not
better value for money please so now
this is what you need to start going out
learning a few things because the real
costs how much you pay and what you get
for your money well as you'd imagine
every cloud provider has a different
view on what those numbers are right so
this is just a a selection and it's not
meant to be comparative in terms of hey
we're better or worse than anybody else
this is just one slice you can go
through any of these cloud providers and
you can find different slices that will
get you different amounts of capacity
right so the point here is you can see
for some amount of money you get so many
CPUs for less amount money you
a more cpus I mean the combinations are
interesting the port important point
here is thinking about stuff like the
CPUs you get okay so what happens to
your application if you're if you find
that you're being forced down to just
having one core because it costs you so
much that may have a federal application
right and what happens when you're going
actually I can't afford four gig and
he's have one gig right and these are
the sort of questions that you need to
start asking yourself when i move my
application to the cloud and i said
before the cloud is coming to you
whether you like it or not it's coming
underneath so you've got to be starting
to think about how am I going to deal
with these requests how am I going to
reach in my application to actually make
better use of these these pits of
capacity so it's quite confusing what
the combinations are and it gets even
more confusion confusing when you start
to look at what you could do to your
application to reduce costs so depending
who you're buying the resource from
reducing your memory costs may not
actually save you any money okay this is
just an example right this is just you
know I mean this there is you can
calculate it differently and if I use
different combinations and get different
answers the point is you're going to be
choosing some configuration when you
deploy your applications so when you
choosing that configuration you need to
think about what the consequences are so
if you get our flat rate for four gig
then reducing it to three gig isn't
going to help but you might find that if
you're paying for every 500 make then
reducing it you know from one gig to 500
makes a difference right and you may
find that you can't reduce the money you
can't reduce across by doing the ten
percent save because that doesn't get
you dance the next tier all right but
I'll come back to you will get pressure
on you to be doing that and this is the
takeaways you need to be thinking about
how you design your applications to deal
with some of these new pressures that
you're going to get from your business
so the first thing is getting rid of all
that unnecessary baggage so there's
stuff coming in Java 9 that will make a
difference modularity is going to help
you think about it modularity will help
us reduce the size of the vm but it's a
start but you need to be thinking about
what your application is desire your
application is designed one of the
classics is things like Apache Commons
oh I just need a little string routine
so I'll do add an extra may even include
dependency and now I've got this
wonderful little piece of code great now
you've been increased your footprint and
it may be quite significant you don't
know about it but you're going to start
measuring these things and if you don't
measure them you're going to get a bill
saying hey you've just increased on your
run usage by some percentage right so
you to think now hard about not only
about how your application is configured
in terms of its dependencies within the
java space you've got an hour thinking
also about the operating systems you're
running on all right how fat is that
right so those are really big questions
if you got if you're how many guys here
have started using docker anybody here
using docker ok so again docker cuts
things down for you which is great but
if you pick the wrong base then you find
that your docker image is still 800 make
right now you may go how does that
matter because it doesn't having to do
with Ram well the thing is rhyme is just
one of the thing measurements here
bandwidth is another one how much does
it cost you to get your application from
where you've built it to where you
deployed it if it's bigger and you're
using the wrong provider in that in the
sense that they're challenging you for
that sort of bandwidth now you get
another problem right so you have to be
thinking about your choices when you
design your application on the
consequences of how big it turns up
right how much memory use is how many
CPUs is going to use how much bandwidth
all those sorts of things right so if
you're also looking at this from
microservices point of view
microservices another one of these
things coming around going we're trying
to do my why would you microservices
because everybody was trying to build a
scalable resilient system and we've
understood now they tried to get those
things down
small units make sense so small units
again you're going to want you going to
pay for those so you've got to reduce
your memory costs right but the other
thing that's going on here is that those
services don't live very long you'll
find in many micro service environments
the life of the service is measured I
don't know hours days minutes right
because they get started they get they
scale up they come down all those sorts
of things all right so how long is your
application application going to live
for it's going to change the way you
design it let's talk about startup so
how long do you want to wait for your
your service to start up you've deployed
a service it starts up how long do it to
wait how long do i wait for you may
think that's not really a big problem
but well we'll explain in a minute but
actually you're thinking about how long
does it take you from the deployment to
that service being available to use
right so what you see is those guys who
are there lots people using Java ring in
as micro services and a common factor is
that people have services on hot standby
they're having them already prepared so
that when the workload increases the
number as the scale out well because of
the startup times they go no I have a
bunch of stuff on standby but that costs
you so your decisions about the
programming languages you use and the
tools you use can have direct effect on
your kant's on your bottom line in ways
you probably weren't expecting so you
start to think about when you're
starting up your application how long
does it take can I reduce it right now
the thing is everything that happens
when you start at that service happens
every time every time you run a service
you get that startup takes place right
everything you do so we all know about
Java startup we know how lovely
expensive it is and how we've tuned java
to give you maximum throughput and to a
degree we've we've balanced that ability
by making startups late right and you
know you can go to Java you can do Java
minus client and get slightly
faster or Java minus server and get slow
but that was the choice we made that's
the choice that vm teams have made over
the years to deal with things like EE
where you're going this is long-running
service and it's going to run for days
and weeks and months okay and there
aren't that many of them so we chose
right the trouble is services
microservices don't work that way micro
services are short-lived and well mostly
they're short lift right okay so what
are we going to do about it so the JVM
well we're going to go three we are over
time going to be going through the JVM
and looking at places where we can deal
with this because there's always
opportunities to change this all right
ok so the consequences here of having
this sort of start up cost is you're
wasting money right so let's say it's
more than your application starting up
so I can say to you you need to do
something better about starting your
application you need to the end to do
something better so we could do that but
it's more than that there's jetting
think about how often you get something
all right so you get it and then we
throw it away okay think about that we
get it we throw it away you just it
you've got five services running you're
getting it you're doing exactly the same
thing you're throwing it away right so
we have to find ways of stopping that
right so we've got to figure out from a
vm point of view how we're going to make
that better how we're going to find ways
to share that right and we don't want to
be in the position that every time you
start up a service there's all this
extra stuff going on if we can't share
it right so at the moment what we could
say that we're wasting money wasting
your money in this space but you know
that's that's where we are and will be
working towards trying to prove that but
part of this talk is to get you thinking
about it because we don't know all the
answers right we don't nobody has a real
understanding yet of what's going to
fall out of all this we're at the
beginning of this story we're working
out how it's all going to pan out
over time so we need you guys to be
trying this stuff out now right even if
you haven't got to the point where
you're going I have a business reason
for deploying if you are not playing
with this technology now you're not
going to get your head round down and
buy you using it and feeding back to
Oracle and IBM and all the other guys
who are doing this development we can
start to decide what works best to what
we should be doing you heard mark at the
keynote talking about pain points right
well this is becoming the next biggest
pain point for java and as i'm about to
show you other languages ok there
they're better at this than we are so
this is a benchmark the n-body benchmark
so it doesn't really matter what it does
it it uses memory it uses CPU it's an
it's a crunching algorithm ok so you can
just use this as an example so I suspect
you know it's not as sophisticated some
of the jus big j vb spec type things but
have a look at how this works so here's
an example so how much memory does it
take to run this benchmark in different
programming languages right as you can
see as you can see sees on the end right
and closure at the other end and
afterwards even slower languages but you
can see where java is right now by the
way look at java versus Carla ok so
scholars running on the vm and it's like
slower than java he uses more memory
than if you've written in java ok so
that's memory footprint so if you were
to take this and run ER in amazon you
would pay more for the privilege if you
did it in java at about time how long is
it run so again you can see if you write
it in see if you see you can see you
write it and see it's slower ok Java is
still there right so let's let's balance
that out and look up sort of the amount
of memory vs cpu so let's balance it out
and go where do we sit in this
so you begin to see surprise surprise
the job is not the fastest thing here
it's nowhere near the slowest thing
there are even more slow languages and
this but you can see there's a couple of
languages at least on this chart there's
substantially faster right and so the
consequence from us from a java program
in point of view is and you probably
seeing this already is more and more use
of other programming languages and
native programming languages and we'll
come back to native programming
languages in a minute so what I want to
show you here is is that Java
comparatively is quite expensive and
this isn't this is taking a standard
benchmark so you're not saying hey I've
got a different application is what are
we going to do in the vm and in the java
class libraries to make that closer to
what you've got on the on the right on
the left but the basic takeaway here is
runs ram how much ram does your
application use right and the simple
answer is too much right this is the
pressure that is going to come down to
you it's going to come down to you
simply because Java won't be competitive
in this base unless we do things about
it unless you do things about it so
let's look at runtime costs so primarily
ram is the thing that you get charged
for the most is that most obvious thing
out there but it's not the only thing
but i think you begin to see that your
use of dash x dash x MX has a direct
cost right it was never there before and
now it really is right and you're going
to be tuning your applications and
you're not going to beach in your
application to fitting them out of
memory that you want your tuning them
into fitting them out of memory that you
can afford to buy right so you're going
to have to start thinking about your
dependencies so not only about OS is but
also about applications so when you go
off and make that choice about I go to I
go to me even repose and start looking
for options I go to github and find
things that's good that's great now
start thinking about how much memory is
that going to take all right because
it's important for you to start thinking
about that now
get that into your head all right okay
and again it's not with services
microservices you've got thousands of
these or hundreds of these things
running so ever you have every one of
your choices where you go i'm increasing
my memory for this service by 5% your
bills going up five percent for every
service that you're up right so you're
making is you know I suspect that you
can find you'll get situations where
your room VPO go no I'm not spend
another five hundred million dollars on
that please can you just reduce your
memory usage all right so what can I say
java applications are going running
remotely so we're going in one running
in a remote place it may actually be
your local cloud but you still have to
treat it as a remote it's going to be
constrained so the matter bandwidth
you're going to use the amounts of
memory you're going to use it's all
going to get measured and you're not
gettin you will not get to use what you
think you should you're going to get
you're going to get told use less right
there's always getting that equation
right there will be precise limits
really really precise limits right and
everything that you use somebody is
painful right and that person whoever it
is right is going to be going I
understand about money and I understand
about my bill you get a telephone
billing you get an itemized telephone
bill what's that then and you phone your
dog when you go what were these hundred
pound entry on my bill you know they
spot I mean I gained I don't care what
the conversation was what I care about
is is that I found part of my bill that
was more expensive than I was expecting
and that's what your businesses are
going to start doing right so nobody's
your application is going to have to go
on a diet right you're going to have to
start thinking about this counting the
calories thinking about what it where
you're spending them okay so I don't
have any advice on specific tools or
technologies that's not the point the
point is this is something you need to
start internalizing if it doesn't bite
you now it's going to bite you later
right so let make it even even more
scary let's talk about the API economy
has anybody heard
the API economy oh dear okay right so
the API economy people don't believe
this when they say this but this really
is true if your company has data it's
going to try and sell it right because
the API economy is about selling data
and the cloud is great right but when
you think about the services that you
see on top of that whoever is providing
it with is Netflix or anybody else they
have data and they will try and make
money out of that data and you'd be
surprised everybody's doing this so an
example is in Germany for instance where
they're actually doing this a lot
because of the way that they're there
that the rules are set up where they
don't they don't allow the monopolies in
the same way that you might find in
other countries so they're very careful
about keeping company segregated the
consequences that is that they share
data a lot and so for instance if you're
making plasterboard then there's a
supplier of cardboard as a supplier of
paper I mean a supplier of the plaster
each of those guys have data and they
sell the data because they then that you
get these aggregations and you get the
best prices and stuff like that so it
doesn't matter what you're doing if you
have data that's useful somebody at some
point your company will go I really want
to sell this right and it's just taking
up like anything this is where
everybody's going everybody's about
api's it's about the data you've got
right every is doing that so why am I
saying this well because this has
another impact on how you think about
what you're doing with Java but it also
says well let me show you what makes a
good cloud API so the interesting thing
with with these api is actually it tends
not to be the functionality so you guys
can come up the greatest wonderful
widgets and you'll find that actually
it's not top of the list when people are
trying to buy your api right
so what comes the top of the list is
that these api's are available okay
hundred percent so just think about this
so but roll this route we're going to
have cloud turning up in your data
centers so you'll have that sort of
measure you can have cut your company
saying I need you to be making the stuff
available and to make these things
available you have to start building
micro service solutions that have high
availability sis one hundred percent we
know that if you're using netflix or
amazon it goes down you know the world
stops so we don't have to happen so
that's first followed by actually do you
believe those metrics right because
that's always interesting then you worry
about cost what's unit measure has I how
does it affect me because that will
change what you do then can you diagnose
problems so now think about and we'll
come on to this in a second so diagnosis
so you guys maybe you're used to being
out to diagnose your application just by
logging in right well this an API
economy world the what we're talking
about is your developers your users of
your API wants about to debug things so
what they're going to want to know is
how do you provide all the information I
need not to talk to you right so this is
a selection criteria right Oh an
excitement is there a community around
this can I go find self-help right is
there a you know you see other user
groups or less also stuff and this is
the interesting thing is none of this
this all has direct effects on you that
you may not realize it but actually the
mark the least important is what the
functional to the API so as it does what
it says nobody really cares if it does a
lot more so this starts to all come
together so your code is going to run in
a data center or in the cloud and the
choices about where your code runs is
going to be driven by the cost and that
may change you may have legal
requirements with your putting data in
the cloud there's usual some reason if
it's you may find a particular
government has particular rule about
that sort of data not leaving the
country or whatever so you get all these
interesting things
and please your data your application is
going to become mobile and the driving
of moving that around is going to be
based on some legal things what about
cost and resiliency so I've got my
application running in North Coast I've
got West Coast I've got an application
one in the UK I've got it running in
China and it moves around ok this is
coming to you no it's not coming today
but this is coming to you and so you're
going to have to think about how you do
how you do this right it's going to be
really scary yeah basically sorry
basically everything you do is going to
get have to be rethought right so I said
it was a sort of a halloween thing this
is a picture hanging on my wall in my
office yeah it's not me right so let's
let's take a couple of these things ok
let's talk through a couple of these
pieces I mean I'm I could talk about all
of this stuff and how it's going to
affect you but this talk is supposed to
come to a conclusion so you know I don't
have that time so let's talk about
resilient applications so in this new
environment if you're running in cloud
everything's going to fail every to all
the time and that's really true all
right and in a micro service
architecture where you're making calls
between services what's going to happen
is it's not going to work and you may
have to retry it right you may have weed
things like I I service a can talk to
service be but service being can talk to
service a today and tomorrow it can and
really weird things okay so you have to
be dealing with that so the first
takeaway here is in terms of the way
that you design your Java applications
driven by cloud and economics because
it's why you're doing this is every
piece of it is going to fail you cannot
rely on the behavior you have if you're
running it on your your machine your
local laptop or on a server you know
yeah the file systems always there all
the data is there no problem at all in
this new model that's not true i doesn't
mean it's gone for good but it means
your ability to access it may be
temperamental so from that point of view
you
to start thinking about what am I going
to do to retry so what am I going to do
to try again and deal with intermediate
failures right now there's a thing in
DevOps which says about stop treating
your applications like pets and start
treating them like cattle and the Rios
has heard that but that primarily says
in this new world you don't have time to
treasure your application instance when
it goes wrong you just got to kill it
and move on so you'll find that on one
level this is quite good because those
intermittent problems that you've had
before you build resiliency in your
never after the problem with debugging
them because they'll go away right but
actually you'll find that you won't have
the option of digging into these
problems in the way that you've done in
the past so you've got to think about
how you're going to deal with services
that are running somewhere else the
short-lived that died and now you got to
go and debug them right so that's going
to be a challenge and some other things
there so every eye operation you perform
could fail so do as few as you can don't
rely on doing lots and lots of Io calls
to databases if you can do it all in one
change the way you design it is it time
for you to move from a database to a no
SQL thing where you can just move
documents around right these will start
thinking about the consequences of an
environment where what you thought was
reliable is now starting to become less
reliable right what happens if these IO
calls timeout or stool well you've now
got instance running that's not giving
you any value all right so now you've
got to start killing them so you've got
to start reducing your timeouts rather
than increasing them because if this
system fails big time you want to get
out that we want it out the way as
swiftly as possible because it's taking
up money all right and finally every
piece of data if you receive could be
bogus i haven't mentioned security as
much at all really but one of the things
that you should think about this new
world is your data is running somewhere
else there's a lot more potential for
people to be getting at the data and
possibly spoofing the connections so you
have to be thinking about validating the
data
you get ok you can encrypt it all my
stuff but you have to be thinking
something could have gone wrong between
here and there the service i'm talking
to may have corrupted it and it could
happen so you've got to start getting
into that defensive mode so debugging
how are you going to do this so my
classic example for remote debugging
goes as follows fine goes it's my mother
and she says there's something wrong
with my computer and I go okay explain
and we have a conversation and
eventually she says yeah yeah yeah but
it's got a blue screen and I go okay
I'll come down at the weekend all right
do you fancy having to have that sort of
conversation with your application
that's running in a remote applicant
site of course you don't you don't want
to be a you need to be able to diagnose
that application right so given that
these things are running in somebody
else's data center and under strict
controls you can generally assume that
your ability to debug that application
in situ is going to be pretty
compromised you have to assume that
you're not going to be able to log into
that machine right there will be times
when you can but you have to think about
this from the point of view that you
can't do that right you will never have
the luxury of being able to connect to a
remote debug 0 to an application right
you've got to deal with the fact that
from now on you've got to start
debugging your applications by using
other sorts of tools logging for sure AM
and core dumps and things like that
you've got to start thinking about it
from that point of view you don't have
the luxury of assuming that you have
complete control on the service that you
that's failing right so you've got to
design your application to do that so
number one is you got to get friendly
with logging if you aren't already
you've got to think about getting the
logs off the machine quickly because the
machine may disappear under you but
you've got to now go how do i debug you
should be looking at every application
failure that you deal with from now on
start thinking about how what I have
solved that differently now the other
good news is if you start using logs for
these sorts of things and you start
you can start analyzing logs you can
find trends you may be able to spot deep
problems in and so problems in new ways
right so this it's not all bad but it's
something that you need to really start
looking at so there is a slight problem
with debugging remotely beyond getting
access so your service starts and your
service fails to start what tends to
happen in those circumstances is there
isn't much in the way of a smoking gun
right so this is another reason why you
see things like logger I'm like docker
and containers turning up because you
can start to make sure the application
is as solid as you can make it before
you deploy it you really really want it
to start up it's the moonshot I really
want to make sure my application lands
on the planet right if it goes bang into
the middle of it I'll never know what
happened but if you can get it there
then maybe you can limp it along right
so you really have to start looking at
debug traces and and blog stores etc
there's a whole bunch of them I mean I
could list loads this is for you to go
off and start looking at these items
right but bearing in mind again that if
you store them in the cloud to be paying
for it and you've been using lots of
data you'll be paying for it right so
sometimes people go well why can't I
just keep that failing instance around
I've got saying that's failed I just
want to park it okay and the simple
answer you can push can you can do that
right but it's going to cost you so this
is a really cut down simple slice
through an OpenStack horizon dashboard
so if you've OpenStack is you know sort
of the common tool for creating VMs so
if you're doing real VMs rather than
docker containers then the common set of
technologies that we pretty much every
is open stack and think i can do
OpenStack is I I as a provider can limit
the capacity quantity of the air of CPUs
and RAM and all sorts of the stuff so
what's likely to happen in your new
world is that as an application
developer you
all be given so much resource to do
development in and probably even money
production because that's one way of
restraining your costs so that means
that if you've got a thing that you've
kept around because you're trying to
debug it well now you're taking up
valuable real estate that you need to do
something else as your choice but lots
of people go yeah just keep it around
and what happens in in reality is you
suddenly find its all full up because
once you get to the mode of I'm going to
try and debug it then you try and debug
all the failures and the next thing you
know you have no space right so this is
a bit of a whirlwind tour I'm trying to
get across to you two things really one
is that the world is changing and it may
not be knocking at your door yet but
it's coming right and secondly we need
you to be thinking about this we need
you to be using these technologies and
building your applications and and
feeding back because we don't know what
the answers are right we can see where
it's going but we don't know what the
answers are so let me wrap up a little
bit so I think you can see hopefully
I've scared you enough to make you want
to go off and read some of these things
but how you do development is going to
change right it's not driven so much
about micro services and containers as
architecture it's driven by cost right
the primary drive the primary reason
that your behavior is going to change
and the way that you do things are going
to change because you're going to get
charged for things that you would never
charge before and your businesses are
going to be in there right and we know
everybody knows that if a new tax turns
up you pay it so if there's money
involved and somebody holds the purse
strings and they change the rules you're
going to get affected right and it's
going to happen right this tonight you
can do about it right so primarily the
general guidance is you need to go off
and looking at logging tools and dump
tools and memory analyzer tools and all
those things that give you insight into
your application and also give you data
when it fails and you should be trying
to get yourself into that model now
regardless whether you're going to be
moving into this world tomorrow or the
day after
is the answer is you need to be thinking
about how you do this and how it affects
you to design your application right now
let me ask you a couple more questions
or more thoughts so multiple languages
on the JVM how many people here using on
a Java JavaScript or scholarly those
sorts of things on the JVM yeah yeah and
it's cool and wonderful JRuby whatever
it's great you've now got a good
connection well you saw from the
performance that a lot of these native
languages run better natively all right
so here's a here's an example where as a
as an industry so we tried very very
hard to get javascript running well on
the vm right and it wasn't good right it
ended up being the original work a lot
slower than the original and taking out
more memory and that's what the best
people working on this to try and make
this happen right so why do I want to do
that anymore because in this new world
of microservices my service is
short-lived it does small things I don't
need a fact the vm i could in fact go
off and write my little thing in
JavaScript or Ruby or whatever whatever
suits and wire them together right
because microservices share data we
don't share java objects it's not
there's no call bar all been this right
we're news type of a new type of API a
new type of architecture so the thing is
do we still need to do that all right so
I can argue the answer is no but we
would love to know whether you still
feel that these things are worth
pursuing right so so more thoughts do we
need Jay them anymore who's ready to the
JVM who loves the JVM that's a no then
okay so what does the jvm give you know
it gives you this ability to run code on
multiple different environments well
what happens to the number of
environments gets a lot less what
happens when you know that that
application that you've created is only
ever going to run on one right maybe
I love this stuff could disappear right
so modulus is going to help us reduce
footprint but what about reducing the
size of the image smaller make it
smaller by not having a GVM by going
taking the bike code and the class files
and compiled in them into native code so
these things are all possible is it
something you want to do it's worth
thinking about right so and also if when
you we're looking at short-lived
services there's all that cheating
taking place all this dynamic
recompilation is that going to be
strictly necessary right you put a lot
of effort into re compiling your code
over and over again unless we can find a
way of sharing that then it's going to
start to become expensive because you're
going to go I'm spending money compiling
something i'm spending cpu if i'm
spending cpu i'm using up memory it's
going to cost me right so from a javis
point of view it's comparing java with
other programming languages which become
more attractive right so what are we
going to do how we're going to change
those things right well the simple
answer is we don't have to do this right
we know what's happening here right we
know that you guys are going to get
going to get driven to adapt to the
cloud it's already happening right as
developers you guys have got to start
thinking about how you're going to adapt
I talked about some of these things I
could list a whole other set of staff
that are going to they're going to be
interest to you if you guys are very
interested in DevOps I suggest you go
sit on some of those talks because
they'll start to scare you even more
than I am about all the other pieces of
the puzzle that you will have as
developers in this new world you have to
build into into your head all right we
know your applications got to change and
we need your feedback all right it's
really important that you try these
things out and feedback because when is
Java go all right well you heard mark
talk about the next pain point you know
he picks the next one off well we think
this is the next one so this is what we
need your feedback as to what actually
is the most important part of that
because we're not so over all in one day
what is it really important you need
better debugging
you better I Oh handling do you need to
make them smaller right so the
opportunity to get involved in you in
the user groups etc start trying start
using the technologies out there and
start figuring out how what they mean to
your application right we don't know
what the changes are but we need your
help to do it so in summary your world
is about to change or is changing
dramatically right and it's all because
of this now your choices are you can
hope that we'll get it right you can you
can you can take the blue pill and go
yeah those guys are sort it all out
it'll be fantastic right but better yet
and we would encourage you to do so take
the red pill get involved in this start
trying out these technologies start
learning about what your what your new
challenge is going to be whether it's
learning you programming languages or
whether it's learning about security or
networking there's a whole bunch of
stuff that you need to learn it's going
to affect the way that you develop your
applications and then the course is this
whole thing about costing so I encourage
you to go off and play go off and take
your credit card or your boss's credit
card and buy some time on amazon and
fire / few of these things because you
need to learn it and if you learn it and
you figure out what it means for you and
your company and you can start feeding
back to us what it is that needs to
happen in the java space because without
that feedback you're going to get what
we think is the right answer right and
sometimes that doesn't work out so well
