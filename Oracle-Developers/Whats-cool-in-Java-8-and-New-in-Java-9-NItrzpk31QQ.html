stuff that's coming up in in Java 9 but
before I start who's actually using Java
late today
cool anyone using Java 9 Java 10 okay
anyone not anyone still on 7 or 6 3 well
you get two teachers okay so for many of
you will be familiar
um so like I will try and whizz through
stuff quickly to get onto the more
interesting stuff at the end okay Gus
come on in grab a seat while I put up
the boring legal slides so you're not
missing anything
so and it's not the Oracle makes makes
you put up on a deck but of course there
will be stuff I'm talking about there's
not release so then bang to your
business and some nice stuff usual stuff
so just a little bit about me so I am
what I would call a programming language
researcher and so I am I believe you
need to in Oracle which is quite a big
company so I'm kind of into two groups
so I both work for the Java platform
group and I also am a member of Oracle
labs which is the research division of
Oracle and so I kind of have a strange
split existence for according to my wife
I do two jobs for the price of one so I
kind of do pure research and I'm also
working with a product team my job since
I joined Oracle in 2014 is to work on
Java ten and beyond so I'm not
responsible for anything in eight or
nine I'm afraid and which may be a good
thing this is the picture I have on my
doll in my office in Cambridge this
small office in Cambridge Oracle office
so I kind of just tinker with languages
and if you wrote the keynote this
morning
you would've heard that you know now is
the best time ever to be a software
developer which is so exciting
for me as somebody who's interested in
designing programming languages that
means it really is a very exciting time
for me because we have these we have to
be providing new tools new exciting
features in their languages for
developers to produce the amazing code
that we want them to write before I
joined Oracle I was research senior
researcher at Microsoft Research and in
fact before then in a very previous life
I was actually a university lecturer so
I really uncon it not really a developer
I'm really more of an academic and I
have a bunch of degrees as you would
expect from somebody with that sort of
background so because of that what I'm
going to try and do a quote I've been
working on Java 10 and features that may
not even make in 10 might make in 11 and
of course I'm desperate to tell you
about those so what I'm going to try and
do other told not to do this but I'm
going to blog and try and do is read
through some of these slides quite quick
so why luck would have it at the end
I've got some backup slides about cool
stuff but a long way down the pipeline
but I'm so excited I'm going to tell you
about them I'm determined to get get
there so let's see what we can do so
let's start some job rates and many of
you using Java 8 is a nice quote but
really it was a huge update to the
language and there were many many
features Landers lots of allowing
interface evolution all sorts of stuff
data parallelism nice stuff
recollections coevolution with the VM
and the called libraries and Sonia is
really huge and changed to the language
which might well explain why it took so
long I could say that covers a number
the company at the time but it takes
these things take time because it's very
hard to get these things right and not
just tack on features the worst language
evolutions away you just glue on stuff
bolted on at the edge
nothing fits particularly nicely coming
from the research community whenever you
upgrade a programming language where you
research programming language which
means you essentially have three users
which is you and your PhD students
course you can break things and make
things incompatible but that's not the
java way maintaining compatibility is
very important and keep key part of the
language evolution story and that's
actually is huge constraint on evolving
a language in it and it really adds a
lot of complexity to to the problem and
makes makes these things go slow so
here's a snippet so it's not not all
these things that were added in Java but
there's a lot of stuff in Java eight
different varieties and of course I'm
not going to have time to talk about all
of that stuff today so I've literally
just taken a handful of things out of
this long list and I'll talk about those
all of this stuff is available publicly
so there's anything there that
particularly grabs your attention you
should be able to find it with a simple
web search so here are the things that
I've just sorted grab some water random
from from Java rate which I will classes
Gabon's highlights list so I'm going to
talk a little bit about lambda
expressions have been about default
methods and method references and I just
peek to sort of land and Jase or
extension which is the date/time API
which is something I didn't know about
before giving this talk and perhaps I
still don't really know about it but I
was quite struck actually it's really
rather a beautiful API so quite clean to
talk about it so the interesting thing
about lambda so why they called lambda
as well so here's my university
professor background so it all comes
from mathematical logic it comes from
this paper in 1931 by Alonzo Church and
he was describing logic and in this
paper he says all I'm going to describe
the function and I will use the Greek
letter lambda to denote a function and
that's where all of this stuff comes
from it's really rather than miraculous
this is predates any any notion of a
mechanical computer that we reckon
today and it was all kind of worked out
and indeed cheering words from the
lambda calculus as well so why on earth
are we talking about stuff from the 30s
for Java developers in 2017 and why is
it useful to us and really an incredible
thing given its background is that it
allows you to abstract over behavior so
this is colored the punch line giving
you a punch line then I'll give you the
stuff and I'll give you the punch line
again so lambdas are useful for
abstracting over behavior so Java itself
already has good tools for obstructing
over data for examples we have classes
and interfaces inheritance generics of
primitive types and so on so we're used
to dealing with those things as data but
what we haven't heard quite so nicely is
a nice way of actually abstracting over
behavior attaching over combed treating
code like data in a very simple way and
that's really the essence of lambdas so
what I'm going to do in the next few
slides is just work through an example a
few examples of kind of ways you might
come across the need for a lambda and
try and demonstrate to you why lambda is
going to clean up your code make it a
bit more beautiful now so really the
point is the power that they provide nor
the example so the example T maybe you
could code up a different way and ignore
lambdas and so on but really what I want
to get across to you is that lambdas
really provide you with very nice coding
style so let's take a look so here's a
simple problem right I've got a
collection of people and what I would
like to do is go through that collection
and then all the people excuse me
over 18 okay so I've learned some
advanced Java programming so I use my
nice enhanced for-loop so I go over the
loop I do my check to see if they're
greater than 18 and then I want to
remove them and if you just say I know
people don't remove unfortunately it
will compile but then you
an exception one time because then else
I thought there's a concurrent
modification exception here um so you
don't actually have our hand on the
iterator which is what we need to have
our hands on to do the remove so how
might we as a Java developer maybe in
Java 7 go about solving this problem
well let's imagine you work for Oracle
so let's imagine you have your hands on
the collection API so what might you do
to a collection API to enable people to
do this sort of thing so what we might
do for my donor oh yes sorry I skipped
ahead so how might I solve this problem
now
well I maybe have to actually get my
hands on the iterator and do it the
right way so now I'm actually taking the
iterator I'm not using my enhanced
for-loop
and I'm actually going to use the
iterator use the next method and then I
can actually remove the element but this
is not so nice so I really want to use
the for loop so what I might want to do
is say well let's actually change the
collection class first let me add an
interface called predicate so this is
now what I'm going to use to pass in
behavior and what I want to do is write
a method which takes their predicate and
behavior and executes that behavior on
each element of the collection so I can
do that I can say oh okay well is my
class collections and now I'm going to
add a new static method called remove if
which takes a collection and it also
takes a predicate and then it executes
the predicate only on the collection in
some way and don't don't worry too much
about how you might do that but it's
possible now so it's possible to define
it but the real pain is how to use it so
how might you use that method so we've
got our our collection here
and now I have I want to use my removeth
method and I have my people collection
and now I need to pass in an instance of
that interface so again I've been to my
father's java programming course I
remember oh yes I need an anonymous
classes I now start creating Nonna's
class so I defy I've got myself a new
predicate and I now build the methods
and so on but really this code is
starting to get a little bit unreadable
this is a very simple code more
complicated gets the worst it gets and
there's sort of a lot of accidental
syntactic clutter here if you look at
the actual code so hopefully I've got a
little slide here so really the kind of
business logical beings the predicate I
want to pass in is a test as if their
person is over 18 all that other guff
about the anonymous class and so on is
just syntactic clutter I've got no other
means to define myself as simple
instance about interface but it's kind
of unnecessarily boilerplate they would
just be much nicer if the language gave
me a mechanism to remove that
boilerplate and that's really the sort
of thing lambdas are for so lambda is
said of passing that anonymous class we
can actually just pass in a lambda which
is exactly the same thing in terms of
the semantics but this is now a function
which takes a P and just returns the
test of whether their age is greater
than 18 so again it's a function which
takes the P which by the wonders of type
inference it will have worked out that P
has to be a person and it returns a
boolean so it matches the interface
matches the behavior of the interface
predicate and it's much more readable as
as a piece of code now the real win here
is not just that your code shrinks but
it's actually that previously because
this code was so awkward to write people
didn't design their api's in this way so
they didn't design api's where people
stop were passing in
little bits of computation in it because
it kind of cluttered up the code but now
we have these sorts of features people
can actually design api's the way they
would like to so um here's another
example of how lambdas might help us and
indeed at the end we'll see that we end
up doing things that you really can't do
in existing code so here we've still got
our collection of people but now I want
to do something slightly different so
this is kind of you know my fake big
data application right so I've got a
whole load of data and what the big data
applications do well they kind of
aggregate data like I mean they could
have everything so Map Reduce thing
right so I want to map over my people
and I want to reduce it down to the
maximum weight of all the males in the
collection of course Big Data app so I
do this in this way now this code kind
of works but it's kind of still a little
bit cluttered because um it's kind of
not very declarative it's not really
telling you what you want is telling you
exactly how to do it which is loop over
the people do this test have a local
variable maintain this other variable
which will then work its way through and
it's really if you think about it this
program is essentially a query and I do
work for Oracle therefore I'm going to
tell you that really queries should be
written in the declarative language so
the efficiency can be determined for you
by a compiler and not written in some
low-level thing where you actually tell
the compiler or the VM exactly how to
find the answer what you want students
just say I would like to aggregate the
data that's what a sequel developer
would do and so using this sort of
abstract approach not only will lead us
to more compact code but will actually
enable compilers to use some neat
optimizations and we'll open up some
other new features so let's see how we
might do it so in this case now we're
going to use some new methods and some
lambdas to do the same thing
so I take my people and make a stream of
them that's a new API in Java rate and
then what do I want to do on the stream
well I want to filter out all the people
who aren't male so I have this filter
method I pass in a lambda again which is
a little bit of a havior
it just says take the predicate so it
takes the person and compares their
gender to male and then from that
resulting stream
I would like to map those people to wait
so I'd like to just get their weight and
then given that stream of weights for
males then I just want to find the
maximum value so now this is a much more
declarative piece of code it's not
saying how to do it is saying what I
would like to be done I take the stream
I filter and map I aggregate so this is
kind of Map Reduce so the cool thing
about this is the modern use the code
and more more readable and clearer but
we've abstracted away from the mechanics
of how to do things so really this is
kind of the functional programming style
of solutions for those you've studied
this will recognize it so essentially we
sort of know secretly converting Java to
Haskell without anyone noticing
so let's imagine that what I really
wanted to do was exploit some
parallelism because that collection
maybe I had lots of halls available to
me so maybe what I want to do is start
aggregating those things up in parallel
so how would I do that today
well so prior to Java 8 well we have the
full joint library which is very
beautiful very nice very powerful but
unfortunately requires you to kind of
produce a whole load of Goff's around
your code so here's how you would take
the code that we had before which is
kind of this bit here and this bit here
you kind of have to split it around and
write some other stuff but really that's
a real shame because if you wanted to
experiment and say well I wonder what
happens if I learn this thing in
parallel would it actually really run
faster or something else happening in my
work mode that would prevent that it's
kind of a bit of a it's a bit of a pain
to split up your code it's not just
boilerplate I have to split the code
across a couple of methods and this was
about the simplest example I could think
of so if you've got anything more
complicated quite hard to use the
libraries it's kind of to experiment
with parallelism and that's kind of a
shame it's good if your apparel is makes
pert because it makes your job kind of
seem amazingly complicated and you can
demand lots of money but it's kind of
more more complicated than it ought to
be so if we go back to our job rate
solution where we took the collection we
made a string we filtered we mapped
mints and then we aggregated the nice
thing here is that we can actually
exploit some other versions of streams
so there's another method on collections
called parallel stream and that's all
you need to do to paralyze your code
instead of taking the stream you take a
parallel stream and then it will
automatically paralyze it for you so
this is another example of how kind of
changing the api's giving yourself nice
abstractions over behavior
actually liberate cyou to write nicer
code and gives you the facility to write
code that would be extremely hard to
write in such a compact way before I
just want to mention one other thing and
he might imagine we take the earlier one
take this one he might go oh wow hold on
hold on he says there's something
there's something magic going on here
right he goes I took my collection and
then I filtered so I took our little
Asian through and then I took a whole
iteration through to madman twins and it
took a whole iteration through but the
wonder of this is that because this is
declarative we can the compiler can now
take this code and produce very
efficient codes and have the compiler by
the semantics of streams which are lazy
will actually only take one part through
your collection by the wonders of lazy
lip so which of course you couldn't do
if you've written everything that's for
loops the compiler wouldn't know what
you were doing and unless it had some
amazingly clever static analysis to work
out that oh I see they're making several
passes and all if I actually fuse them
all together as lazy lists and fused all
the intermediate structures together
I could do all in one part no compiler
will ever figure that out especially not
one for Java so but writing it in this
style kind of constrains you just enough
that the compiler can work out these
optimizations and and unleash them so
it's both produces more readable code
gives you facilities for trying things
like parallelism in a very simple way
they didn't add before plus you get some
optimization opportunities for free
without doing anything so what's not to
love it's really very nice ok
so default methods another question you
might have been asking yourself was hold
on
he pulled that stream method on on a
collection where the help that come from
what have you done have you change the
collection API have you broken it did
you it right so I believe long
before I joined on Oracle 30 you know
there was an i/o API we changed it
we called it ni because we can't change
anything because everything has to be
compatible so if you want add a new
method you have to completely duplicate
the API and say no everyone use the new
one please that's really horrible this
is a well-known problem for anyone who's
dabbled in in kind of object-oriented
programming it is very hard to evolve
apos and add new methods and maintain
compatibility and for obvious reasons
it's not compatible to just start
splatting stuff all over the place so
how on earth have we done this well
we've actually extended the language and
the infrastructure to allow us to add
some new methods onto interfaces which
is a very nice facility so what we've
done is given a different we're allowed
to define what we call default
implementations on interfaces you're
free to override them in your class but
if you don't you'll get the default one
for free so let's have a have a look so
here what we've done this is imagining
how we would implement it in the
collections interface we've actually
given an actual definition for a stream
method so all the classes that implement
collection now get an implementation
stream for free if they wrote their own
one it will override it and you will get
the one that you wrote so it actually
took me people refer to this as Public
Defenders which it took me about two and
a half years to understand what they
meant but this is because it's an
Americanism so I can say this in
and there's the idea that like in the
American justice system you know if you
can't afford your own lawyer you'll get
a public defender who will who will be
supplied for you so the idea here is if
you didn't implement stream yourself we
gave you one again worry about it so
this gives you a very nice way of kind
of evolving api's another thing which so
you know the funny thing about being in
the in the jarba team in particular
writing stuff the Java Sea you know
fiddling around with the compiler is
we're a big customer of ourselves so we
have a huge body of Java code and which
we know very well which is the compiler
and we're very keen to extend java to
make writing the compiler easier so so
when we started using lambdas we
discovered that we wrote particular sort
of lambda all the time and it was kind
of a bit annoying so here are two
examples so here I've got a lift and I
replace all and here the lambda takes an
S and just invokes the method to
uppercase on s it's all it does is takes
an argument and invokes a method and
here I've got another one where I'm
comparing and I take a person and I
invoke the get name and it's kind of
there's a lot of syntactic on the log
but there's some syntactic clutter here
because we do this arrow and then the
only thing we do is invoke a method on
the argument and that's kind of a bit
irritating after a while so we provided
a convenient shorthand for this you
don't need to write it instead of
working that lambda s arrows I start to
uppercase we just say it's the to
uppercase method on strength you know
what I mean so this is called a method
reference and where we use it in the
place of a lambda the compiler can
insert and replace it with the lambda
okay
so just to summarize lambdas are
functions we've read a fight we defined
lots of new api's using them using
functional interfaces which is a known
notion it's just an interface with one
method so that's that's how you speak
about LAN des and we've given providing
two full methods and method references
to make programming and make using
evolving to use lambdas easier so and
you will expect these are some
screenshots from NetBeans but whatever
your favorite ID is I think all the IDS
now have very nice tool support to
enable you to migrate from your Java 7
code to job great to hear it's a snippet
of NetBeans saying you're creating an
anonymous class here and I think you
could use a lambda expression there
would you like to just click this button
I will do it for you and IntelliJ will
do the same thing so you click the
button in and replace that with a with a
lambda and as you might expect and again
here if if you have a simple lambda
NetBeans also you know you could rewrite
that as a method member reference and it
would do the right thing and you know it
does all cup dates you can say replace
all of those things as everything in my
project replace all that all the
anonymous classes in these two lambdas
and so on and so there's a lot of Tor
support to help you move your code to
using lambdas which I would recommend
all those recommend you use them slowly
and so you understand what they're doing
ok date/time so reason why I mention
this is quite an interesting and J's are
and now with lots of good lots of
goodness in it and the interesting thing
about this Jos are is that it actually
is external to Oracle's this was Steven
Colburn who drove this API
so it was was came from external
externally from from Oracle so it's kind
of an example of the vibrant and and
open world around Java was very very
nice
and I think in in a nutshell you know
day times the one of those things which
intuitively feels easy until some pop
quiz question reveals to you that
actually it's all really very old and
the cool thing about this API is it
suddenly looks easy again so your codes
suddenly looks quite quite
straightforward and there's a number a
range of types depending on your
circumstances so there are types like
local day local time local date/time so
grouping them together definition zones
day times and all the sort of stuff that
you would expect about mod supporting
different forms of calendars and so on
you can do automatic conversions between
those and so on so let me let me just
show you a few examples so local date is
just a very simple year-month-day piece
of data and you can instantiate them
very straightforward ways and you have
all the expected methods on those
classes as you would expect the vey
simple notion of local time which is
just a minute second nanoseconds and
again is very simple to create values of
that and operate on them and so on and
of course you might expect that we have
a way of gluing these things together at
a time on a particular date and we've
had note there's also notions of
instance which is quite useful for
logging so as in standard in big clients
always take the start of the Big Bang to
be the first journal in 1970 and it's
quite useful and there's support for
time zones and so on so I love you I
mean with through some of this stuff is
there this is let me see the very nice
very nice API that actually makes it
pretty simple to to write very clear
coat referring to date and time
in punjab life this is just one of
dozens and dozens a very night api's
comfort that came out in JDK 8 the table
again and again all of this is available
obviously with lots of documentation and
examples you to take a look at in the
web I should say that all of this data
was all of these slides were stolen from
other people as you might expect and you
can read their their write-ups and also
if you look at the job rate launch event
if you just Google for that that there
were talks by strong marks on lambdas
plane I still buy brine on on an
overview of lambdas and and all their
language and their library features and
there was a very nice talk by Stephen
Colburn explaining that the new date
date/time API if you just search for
these you will find all the videos all
the slides and everything so let's move
on to what's coming in jd9
and as you would expect with another
fairly long gap between releases it's
huge this is not quite everything about
9090 jets I think in JDK 9 there's a lot
of stuff and here I sort of categorized
them in different ways so those that
relate to behind the scenes changes just
goodness don't need to know about it
everything's going to be better
specialized things new standards that we
now have to support and so on
so the lots of stuff that's that's
coming out and JDK 9 and indeed if you
research from the MJ DK site you will
find all the Jets all the write-ups but
pretty much while we are at feature
complete now everything is there so
there's no jk9 is not quite out yet and
be out soon and all the all the
information is available so I recommend
that you
take a look at that I'm not going to
take a sort of flying view over some of
those jets I'm not going to list all 90
otherwise would be here all day
so here's is just a couple of fair good
changes which are kind of like fine the
team's improvements you you kind of
proposed what I mean by that is you
don't need to do anything you just get
this goodness for free so for example
again something I didn't know about both
there turns out the term there's a jet
for slightly more compact representation
of strings internal representation of
strings so roughly speaking anyone you
apical third roughly speaking will need
about half the amount of memory to
represent to store strings than we did
before so suddenly things are going to
get better so very nice very nice thing
twenty years later from javadocs
you can now search in Java dog oh wow
but it is quite smart I tried it one and
it understands camel cake and all this
stuff so it's quite a smart search so
you generally get exactly what you want
so that's that's so overdue one might
say but very welcome change so some of
the other Jets call so new features new
functionalities so the first one which
is a huge problem by a huge thing and
I'm very grateful there's a talk this
afternoon entirely on this topic so I'm
going to say very little about it now
quite complicated but we are
modularizing Java so those of you who
done a degree in computer science will
remember that it's an old notion of a
modules a package that actually quite
information and which job has never had
and is now going to have so that there
will be a notion of the module and we
have in Java which will be respected by
the compiler and also by the runtime and
combined with that and in fact what
turned out to be untold I've met the
guys who did it
I almost the harder problem was actually
taking the in charge driver API and
modernizing it so now all of the Java
API has been split up into into modules
the problem with that is of course you
get when you start doing it you realize
how badly designed your your packages
are so we had circular dependencies and
all sorts of stuff and this was
extraordinarily hard to unpick and and
so there's a JEP about the module system
to Jeff about how we split up the JDK
into modules is obviously a Jeff about
how module system relates to source code
and also Jeff relating to how one how
the module system relates to one time
unique is and there's some other stuff
as well there's link codes in the
sources map notice a there's a whole
talk about this this afternoon try
thinking about quite more hands-on which
will walk you through what the module
system might mean to user as a developer
so clear his an interesting one
so why did we deprecate things well lots
of reasons right we've got something
wrong we've thought of something better
we've got a better design all sorts of
things but yet we had no way to annotate
things differently and they just had say
deprecated so now we've got enhanced
identification which enables us to give
different reasons about why things are
being deprecated and the one you need to
know about is condemned equals true if
you see that is going to die so that's
the one to watch out for and we've got
there's at all I think J debts debt
proscan that will walk over your your
class files and have a look at to see
what's what's about to happen so it's an
interesting one puts in very nice
factory methods for collections so now
want to build a set there's an old
method alright that's a very simple way
to write a three element set and we've
given you I think up to 10 10 argument
so it's over loads up to 10 parameters
so you can build a set up to 10
things in such a simple way if you need
11 sorry okay there's a rebel so those
of you who secretly shame on you
white stuffing dynamic languages will be
very familiar with Red Bulls and finally
Java is having one so it's very nice
it's a very nice tool so you fire it up
you're suddenly in you're suddenly in a
level you can write Java you can hit
return you don't need a semicolon it
knows what you're doing
absolutely fantastic all the goodness
that you add so now you can give up
writing all your JavaScript and Ruby
code and come back to Java the only
thing that was keeping you in that and
that world I'm sure and so the very nice
thing has been very well engineered so
nothing else play with apps quite cool
oh yeah multi release jobs so here's a
very nice thing so typically in a jar so
this is the classic problem of evolution
right but you've got a job with some
class files in it want to give it out
and what you want to involve things but
how do you do it because I need to give
you a job and there's any one version of
C and I want to result that but oh yeah
those people using it it's a Java 3
you're using yeah three yeah so you know
I can't do it because this guy is on the
tree and I'll break his world and so on
finally we now have multi release jobs
that the idea here is if you're using
pretty JDK 9 you will get the classes
here and for that's what you will see
but more recent versions magenta will
now actually start getting delivered
different versions of the classes so
finally we can actually people will be
able to just distribute jars with
different versions in so and there are
new standards you expect you can write
your favorite emoji JDK 9 it's going to
be there Unicode 8 will be supported
10,000 new symbols very nice things
about of the standards like HTTP evolved
and we'd like to change
please my mention this is that this API
is going to be in in a picture beta
module and what we this is a very slick
way of trying to evolve this problem
that if we give you an API and we change
our minds because we're not quite sure
about it we can never retract it because
we'll break everything that you relied
on so with the event and module system
we now have the ability to write to be
able to put things in the module and
just say this stuff until for now it
won't be there in the next version tell
us what you think so hopefully we got it
right and we'll put it somewhere else in
the module system and it will be there
for good but if we didn't get it right
well it was in an incubator module so
what did you expect
so it's a very nice nice way for us to
kind of try things out without kind of
ruining everybody's life and some
housekeeping stuff oh you know this
one's like a head to tail light above it
you all know that there were all these
and horrible internal api's from you
know java one day and that Sun we're
telling you don't use these they're just
for us but especially internal one from
this one safe and so on don't use them
because everyone uses them so never been
able to get rid of them and we are going
to slowly evolve you off them in a
particular way I know this is a
religious warfare tribe area I don't
want to stray into a sort of probably
split on land one already and so some of
them are not going to disappear because
everyone would really hate us if we
removed everything but lots of stuff is
going to get involved and will be
replaced by other stuff as soon as we
get it sorted out and yeah if you're a
person who really cares about this I
know this is a little bit distressing
but it's it's all good it's all going to
be good and yeah we're with clipping the
Java collect the garbage collector so
turns out that's interesting for that
from a researcher perspective right then
you know you kind of do things like
produce a god
collector which is very good for now
very good for trooper door or whatever
because you kind of think that that's
what people are going to do and then it
turns out as architectures and so move
on wasn't quite the right call and
workloads are a little bit different
than you expect so we're actually
flipping the what the default garbage
collector is so it's now going to be the
g1 garbage collector and the old one
will still be available to you I have to
actually ask for it specifically and
that's because the g1 is better for
limiting from reducing poor science
which turns out to be thing that people
really want yes so it's a somewhat
potted and rapid tour through through
some of the new features in Java 9 I am
going to flip through the next things
other than say please you know we all
open
please join join in there's lots of
stuff online find out about what's going
on in Java 9 get involved and ask
questions as long as no one's off that
question before and and help us get it
get it right I'm going to of course as
promised talk about few things that
we're going to sneak into the Java 10 if
we can get them done new URL how many
times sighs need to say new our URL and
here when I've got a connection and so
on and so forth wouldn't it be better
indeed contain every other language
apart from Java
just remove the types and write far or
something similar right job already had
type inference in lots of places
wouldn't it be cooler if I could write
that so yes indeed
hopefully control the tone you'll get
something like that yeah this really
approached out isn't it isn't it often
the case that you write a class and it's
really just a dumb data close right so
here's my approach typical dumb one
I've got a point with two final ins
that's all I need to say oh god yeah
I've got to write all that other stuff
why I'm a good programmer so of course I
write my own hash code into strings on
so forth
why do I have to like that what if I
suddenly realized I won my points all to
be 3d burn and a third one and I forget
that and the hashcode thing now all my
methods get out of sync
I don't want to write this stuff right
that's what I want to write I just want
to say it's a dumb data class we're too
infant and you work everything else out
you know what it is I'd be cool
it meant hopefully coming think I'm
working on so we often write code like
this I've got a here I've got some
constant and I'm looking I'm doing it
lots of instance of test to see what it
is and then I'm going to change its
formatting strength so I check if it's
an integer oh it is okay so I want to
use injured value
oh god that cocktail integer that's
define it to it and then I have to use
the string format and so on and I keep
writing these long chain of things you
know this is really tiresome tighten
code right got long chain of
if-then-else it's much it's slower than
some sort of switch like operator that I
might want to do I did an instance of
why do I have to cast I've already I
already know it's at that time why
suddenly types it could be more helpful
happy to do an assignment in every arm
well what if I forget one of them how am
I going to know that and not because it
was the time to unknown at the top so
I'm only going to know that from testing
that's a shame
you know that's a whole load of code why
do I have to write this step right well
what if I changed the switch statement
of Java so instead of just doing case
labels
what if actually now I can put tight
tech in so here the idea is I do a
switch on the constant and if the
constant is an integer called the value
called the integer value I and then in
the body of the case Clause I can
actually just use I so that's that's a
lot cooler code is starting to look a
lot better but would it be really cool
if I have an expression version of
switch so I didn't I just need one
assignment we push the switch in as an
expression
okay so now I do the same switch but I
just returned the string that I want to
format at one assignment and the switch
is an expression that's so much cooler
and although I would thought if I miss
something out because the compiler
mistake or one you forgot a case and a
beagle and if I also use the data class
stuff that I mentioned wouldn't that be
cool if I could use those in the
patterns as well so now what I want to
do is so imagine I have an expression
node and I have several subclasses what
I like to do is switch on the node if
it's a subclass called constant node
okay that's the cause but I want to get
myself the value I out of it and use
that in the body and this is all the
code you need to write to write an
evaluator for expression nodes instead
of using vista patent and all that class
i can do it in a few lines wouldn't that
be cool and we can do the sorts of other
crazy stuff why not switch and say well
if it's a point on both values with zero
here's what I want to do I can nest
sameen what if it was a list of points
containing zeros I can write that as a
pattern wouldn't it be really cool if I
could actually write generic types that
ranged over anything have primitive and
a vehicle so
not committing to any of those but it's
a little glimpse of things that we've
got in in the pipeline beyond beyond
nine innings 10 now that I was slightly
over ranked so thank you very much I'll
stop if anyone's got a quick question
huh I'll take it now okay
very soon you know let's let's talk over
a beer maybe yeah don't hold your breath
yeah hello yeah yeah
that's a good question right not that
I'm aware of that I hope I can let's
talk later and I'll try and find that
out for you yeah yeah okay yes so
everyone here is now going to go
everyone go to the outlet thank you if
it's shameless plug excitedly okay great
okay any other questions they've done
you want want a coffee okay right thanks
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
