Washington DC I'm Bob Rupert with the
Oracle technology Network and my
interview has been hijacked by these two
gentlemen introducing so this is what we
do we hijack interviews with M keynotes
M King right so this is no meaningful
fields engineering it ca technologies at
Al Gore link on their internet and this
is Barroso the Gorske chief evangelist
at J frog head at a prodigious promoted
me to be chief will inform your
management later all right all right I
can work with that
all right in so we hundreds not only
this interview but only oh but also the
keynote this morning you guys have been
busy we are well right here if you if
you're gonna hijack may as well go all
the way right right exactly and so in
our talk was about the office of scale
and we have a pro here who actually took
one routines on this journey of both
scaling and being DevOps on the way so
yeah and in the talk we we talked about
the DevOps being cast in in the
traditional way which is development
operations and QA as well as a different
lens that we applied to the conversation
which is process people and tools which
is often forgotten as well in that
evolution and we not going to give the
talk away completely there are more
events coming so hopefully you guys can
see us somewhere else but really we
talked about the three key stages every
team has to move through to achieve
DevOps at scale and you start typically
like you typically start as a fire
brigade where it's constant fire
fighting you move to a second stage
which is reactive improvement or the
smoke alarm installing and then you go
to proactive improvement which is you
know we call it Smokey the Bear and we
talk about how long you should be in the
stage what are the key elements of each
of those stages what what processes and
tools you should be thinking about
instituting at every stage and how to go
through that evolution and this talk is
actually
except of being entertaining just
because this is what we do in actually
based on some very soon as that's what
we heard we do from others all right but
just that there is some jury's out on
the entertainment factor yeah yeah well
through but but I think there is a very
serious research that is kind of an
invasive of this fund that we need some
of the foundation and while we do strive
to entertain while educating the
foundation for this has come out of the
very detailed research we did at CA
Technologies as we were studying
companies as they move along this
maturity curve like we finished the talk
was the slide scale of scale and talk
about moving along that continuum and
how to get that and we find out that
majority of the companies are squarely
in that middle which is the reactive
improvement where we spend most of the
time talking about the processes and
tools that you need to be successful
they're not only about five to ten
percent achieve that Nirvana of
proactive improvement and we actually
did we stock number of times already by
now and we end up asking people they
recognize themselves in one of those in
one of those phases of this journey and
it actually correlates very well to the
findings of the research people do
correlate to one of the one of the
phases and usually a the numbers are
aligned with what you found in your
research like an evolution you know if
you stay in reactive improvement too
long like you yourself selective of out
of the research because you rarely
survive so bar let me ask you a question
so we talked about this this new lens we
are blind to the conversation the people
process and tools but can you talk a bit
about the key tools that are relevant
for each of the stages because sometimes
too much tooling is too much right
because it requires people
sophistication the right amount of
people around it and not enough tooling
is also a potentially disaster situation
so in this is this correlates to the
other term that really today with mark
golf in our solution our integral jet
frog and it was the research to Devils
bottlenecks
and the really common ground between ad
maturity model and the bottlenecks are
those in 3a tools crosses and people and
we come to tools there is a set of
features that are required from any tool
that curves
should support your DevOps journey and
we are talking about automation we are
talking about being Universal and we are
talking about scriptable so automation
include rely are kind of the natural a
two ones because DevOps is a lot a lot
about automation if you want your
developers to be able to take their code
from development to production by
themselves you have to supply them with
tools to do that and as being software
engineers they do it through automating
their processes right starting from
servers creation all the way maybe to
data centers creation and deploying
their code automatically on those
machines that they create by code so
that that's the automation aspect Script
ability going in exactly the same way
and the ability to express what you want
from this infrastructures code from this
software as a hardware if you wish is
done by writing code by by scripting
around those tools and the universal
effect is sometimes forgotten but it's
not less important because we are
talking about explosion of technologies
we are talking about every couple of
months there is new and interesting
incessant technology pops up and and
developers being developers of course
want to try that want to start playing
with that and they bring it to the mix
and when they bring it to the mix this
m2 stack that that you have to establish
invent DevOps pipelines have to know to
support those tools as well so
expandability right being able to adopt
and expand to the new technologies that
that's being universal that's being
whatever you've thrown us we can support
in our tool chain that supports levels
so like a polyglot toolchain almost and
becoming polyglot is important based on
what we call ego we we call that
Universal but polyglot is exactly the
same right it's supporting languages but
polyglot talks about the development
side of things it's supporting multiple
programming technology perspective right
right but but it usually coming with
languages just because of the term right
but but it's also for the operation side
of things the provisioning tools the
hardware is a server automation the
infrastructure is good automation all
those have their own tools that your
infrastructure have not only to support
just to simplify the process but also to
establish those connections between them
right we are going through the from the
code all the way to production
everything have to be interconnected and
to the support all the fact along the
way are very very important all right
right nice nice plug of your second talk
today yeah yeah and that's actually what
our our second talk was was about that
it was about tools it was about building
trust in in the process it was about a
quality how can we trust our products to
be rapidly DevOps is tightly connected
with continuous deliver and continuous
deployment and and this process of
releasing software our path is why
DevOps emerged and and we asked a lot of
industry leaders and very like high
level technology people that are in
charge of these technological stuff are
you very yet can you go and deploy your
code to production without fear that
something goes wrong and in this set
sorry or maybe not destroyed member
maybe the good story is that the
majority of the market are not there yet
so it's interesting you talk about the
fear because of the head of engineering
of
here's my job is to take risks
calculated risk and this is their and
how it ties to the story you guys talk
about when it comes to trust right
because in order to take the calculated
risks you have to trust your execution
ability you have to trust your processes
and if you're taking those risk you
possibly moving faster than you
otherwise could have right and if you're
not taking or if you're taking the risks
that don't pay off which means you don't
have enough foundational support in your
process you're probably not going to
survive her so you'll self select
yourself out but like the ability to
take risk is extremely important and
it's interesting how the trust ties to
automation and tooling right now rather
than rely on humans yeah and and I think
we a trend naturally to trust automation
and tooling more just because as
engineers we trust technology more than
we trust people well which is an
interesting subject and now Kenneth will
talk about the role of like what what
used to be called traditional QA and
what now is called exploratory testing
just invent a name for money okay is it
though that's the question because
there's a lot of methodology on how do
you test the application and much like
the headlines you and marketing you talk
right with DevOps Ops teams will
disappear well quality assurance
professionals haven't disappeared they
may have evolved in what they do
absolutely they probably code more than
they used to but there's no replacement
for modern than exploratory testing in
addition to like the best practices
around TDD around continuous testing
continuous delivery but the real
question is do we try to get rid of
those people right as we as we got rid
of a lot of other in a I wouldn't say
positions or professions but other
aspects of software delivery we don't
have release engineers anymore we don't
have IT system administrators anymore if
we're talking about companies that
already embraced Devils
so the question and and they've been
replaced by robots right robots are
taking our job all this story they are
exactly happening but I don't think they
have and
interesting again in your talk with Mark
you talked about the the Venn diagram of
development qn-- operations being
blended right and then mark has this
awesome analogy it's not a puree right
it's a chunky soup like you still have
people that understand a particular
discipline whether it's testing whether
it's DevOps where it's development what
you've done in this blending is you
brought them together and possibly early
in the process like they're the
exploratory testing all the QA teams
used to be involved at the tail end of
the process now through this chunkiness
write them closely embedded into the
development process and so I would argue
that they're not going anywhere the time
in which they get involved in the
pipeline gets changed and the degree as
well as the how they get involved in the
pipeline changes as well and that's
exactly what I mean right the people are
still key elements of this of this
process right we still need the ops
teams they do something completely
different now instead of setting up the
servers and expecting once in the end of
the information to get the package with
the software and then somehow install it
on those production servers and ensure
that they run they do something
completely different
they now prepare the infrastructure and
then advocate for the right processes in
their organization so the old system
administrators done and I don't mean
like people were fired I mean they're
this position disappeared and it's been
taken by robots people still set up
those robots right and it's probably the
same people but but this take the
package install it on a live server down
by robot and and my question is and I
don't have a good answer here is do we
see in our forcing future robots take
over all the aspects of quality
assurance so the interesting there's a
lot of research happening and like
things like design by contract meua
mutation of data in testing fuzzing etc
etc a lot of the techniques have been
researched and have existed for a while
personally haven't seen anything that
brought that to large-scale adoption and
technology and deployment yet and I
think until it's happening right it one
like we see in new test methodologies
and technologies coming into the testing
pipeline and the deployment pipeline so
service virtualization is one example we
talked about in in the keynote is
ability to mock third party API is like
you today mock Java objects when you
when you write code because you don't
always have a test system we talk about
things like CA is blaze meter right
we're like one of the most difficult
things to do in load testing is you need
enough hardware to generate load testing
now that became democratized and you can
access that type of capacity on demand
right so the tools are becoming more
accessible but I haven't seen anything
that makes the the intervention of the
human and the analysis of what to test
for and where to look obsolete well that
I guess every driving cost of driving
cars and other exciting technologies
that we hear about we'll wait and see
we'll wait and see okay on that note
