hassles but I think we're more or less
set up welcome thank you for coming to
the session normally when you come to a
session where you see a range of
technologies in the title you assume
that you're going to a shootout and
instead what this session is about is
the realization that most people don't
know all the ideas and tend to stick to
one IDE so what we want to do is give
you an overview of each of the ideas so
that you get a perspective on what
you're missing in the various other
ideas we're up front and saying that all
the idea is pretty much do the same
thing have very similar features are
better in one way or another way but
basically do the same thing so the point
is just to give you an overview in a as
far as possible non-competitive style
with the with the aim of just educating
you about what you're missing by not
using one of the ideas that you're not
using I'm Claire Jian I'm from the
NetBeans organization max Anderson
working for a hat around some not
related to any idea vendors so we start
with with max okay well basically yeah
he said the thing is that most IDs are
all has today kit SVN maven Europe all
these general features so we're gonna
highlight the things we like and we're
gonna start with eclipse so first of all
eclipse is open source and completely
free it's probably the most used at Java
ID in the world meaning that if you pay
on our team you probably all know or try
it except in some way so you can share
experiences it has a huge ecosystem of
plugins so inna if eclipse the dog
doesn't provide the fitti you want you
can go and download it that's of course
both good and bad so therefore there are
more than one that's what people tend to
not realize is there's more than one IDE
that is called Eclipse Eclipse are org I
think they have like 20 or something
distributions
but all there are also other vendors
like Red Hat who's doing table studio
and SpringSource doing s SpringSource
tool suite and that's company like my
eclipses that do their own distribution
and a groove my thing about this yes you
get choice but of course it gets
confusing sometimes but I think that's
the important thing to know about v that
you shouldn't just compare it to the one
that it's on Eclipse at work so I'm
gonna show you first the most critical
picture I think there are any clips or
not cook first of all just to compare
there you have the Eclipse editor there
were ders you know Co completion editing
as you're used to also thing those two
people think that block mode is cool
that I need to remember to do it
correctly
there we go so editors are you know
powerful you can do all kind of things
one of the features that people don't
realize is to have this thing called
command 3 which it's a quick access up
here so even if you are a new user or
old user and you go like there's
something I want to do let's say I want
to import maven I mean you can just type
it in and it will give you the result
and you can use this to jump between
views and perspective or editors and
that kind of thing ok
otherwise um here's a little demo just
creating some members and then iterate
over them and if I run it you should see
an output up here yes you know yours
with a bunch of emails so the cool thing
one that the clips have had for ages if
I go and add a compilation error you
code not only am i getting feedback
instantly so it's incremental compliant
incremental compilation and when I run
it
you've got assembly that's error I'm not
gonna care because I'm in a debug and
trying to figure out what it's doing
it's still working
so what Eclipse does it tells us an
error but of course you code is not
touching it it can still run all right
so this is awesome when you're you know
in doing unit tests that are you trying
to make you know part of stuff work you
don't care about this over here and just
run that part and of course if I
actually go and change this to use the
O's that hologram instead it's gonna
tell me oh there's an error baby techne
what eclipse compiler does it's an
inject in that method body and exception
so it compiles you can run it and load
it but only if you hit it it's just
exception you can click and go back and
fix that error and you run again so that
that's a thing it's immoral powerful
feature of the eclipse that it's
underestimated compared to the other IDs
okay and otherwise yeah you have all the
stuff you know you used to in the most
at ease actually love this stuff come
from Eclipse originally we were
fracturing converting methods etc but
what I'm going to focus on is that it
gives you a full gamma-d basic from
eclipse org but if you want to do more
like using Java EE 6 CDI hibernate other
technologies you can get a distribution
from eclipse a dork but you don't get
the full experience so the feature I'm
gonna show now is gave us the mobile
studio and then so what we have is this
thing called Kaiba central that allows
you to get easy access to
you know existing songs like Java EE
html5 you can use maven it's in their
spring it's in there you don't have to
go and install these things you can just
have it
outer-box like NetBeans and then
tailgating some things
so if I create I want these projects
like the Java EE over here it's actually
gonna use maven to create the project
meaning that this project can run either
in Daddy on the command line or in a CI
pill system many people think that MAME
supporting Eclipse doesn't work but it
actually it's gotten way way better
especially in the last place so I'm
missing my page where is it right so
what I have here is the Java EE app is
using tsf so there's actually a visual
editor that allows you to navigate
between the source part and the view
part and I can even you know I have Co
completion for these that's interesting
here's a member it has all these type no
email id name so what this is doing is
it's do it providing completes for CDI
something that's not in base eclipse and
you can navigate you can see here it's
navigating to an adding check point
again you can't do this plane except you
can with for example develop studio and
if I go and do this where's my remember
do get name so there's a shortcut
Eclipse called ctrl shift G which find
references and it will search and find
well there's the demo I just showed but
it also shows that actually in the
insect index.html that's reference to
this property from a DSF expression and
it didn't want to show that awesome
well do it again
Oh have a bug awesome ignore that okay
so the other thing is that we need to
apply an application from eclipse to a
server so here I have a EP setup I can
deploy and I don't have time to show
that but basically when you do is say
it's gonna incremental update the
deployment so you no need to trigger
maven or and a groovy it's going to
deploy directly you see the updates it's
there
the last thing I was going to show is if
you have plain html5 so here's how it's
with a five map I'm gonna open this it
will be called live reload let's see if
we make this bigger
so anything I'm gonna change over here
let's see I'm gonna detective title
costliest at job one I save it it's all
I matter reloading on the right side and
I can even go to the CSS and say I am
like I'm a very good designer so I'm
gonna add color and Fuu shirtless
awesome there we go
alright so you forget get a better sign
it by using eclipse or maybe not so
there we go
at least you can see very fast that
you're bad at and this I mean go further
that this page is actually backed up by
C Java scripts and if I go and say sleep
less instead and save it's gonna refresh
and running that one and a lot last one
which I can't do because we don't have
the right connection but I'll just show
you the effect of it I can actually go
and say external device and now I'll put
a phone or a tablet and take a picture
of a QR code and have it next to me and
the browser will be loading that page
and serving from this machine when you
save something it's gonna reload all the
browser's so it's a nice way of
debugging across different browsers that
requiring a plug-in it's just pure
JavaScript ok I'm already spending more
time it's awesome so that was like a few
highlights and I'm trying to get back to
my
so yeah so just the one key feature I
think that the people like what Eclipse
is think compilation it has the world
fastest Java compiler and not only is it
very fast it seems too fast I think
NetBeans are using it and IntelliJ but
somebody's none I'm gonna add the
feature that you can actually you don't
have to have all your code compiling you
can still run your unit tests you don't
have to have everything perfect which is
great in development
the default is rooftop eclipse is
focused on whatever the Eclipse
Foundation had put in there it doesn't
cover all features like CDI JSF other
extension on you 6 and there's things
like live reload I showed you in fact
that maven it actually is default in
eclipse at work now this released
because we help it happen but when
you're using geostudio or order
diffusion out there they actually
provide even more more smoother
experience so that's basically what I
wanted to show about it clips in the 12
minutes ahead so up to you and we need
to switch this oh and I'll move I need
some powers well yeah
one two three hello so I'm the only guy
who is not related to any idea then
they're here I actually work on
shareable the topology and Java
developers but I'm a huge fan of
IntelliJ hence I'm here talking about it
and I just wanted to have a few really
nice highlights of the ID not really
covering all of it so I think that
IntelliJ is very opinionated in terms of
how you actually use it compared to
NetBeans and Eclipse so not all the
people like it but this is the way it is
and mm-hmm I would say that IntelliJ has
very advanced editing capabilities so
probably the editor is like this central
thing and the things that actually
support it is the analysis features and
the index that IntelliJ creates on the
store up for your project and also very
navigation friendly UI so I would say
that the focus there is that you don't
touch the mouse look ma no no mouse
right so I will just switch the ID now
and start coding and showing you the
teachers along the lines right all right
so so this is the default look of the
IntelliJ but once you start mastering
the shortcuts and navigation you
actually start feeling that you have too
much space taken by the toolbars and
everything and what I actually end up
ended up with is switching all this
stuff and basically leaving all the
editor area to be used right so this is
nice and clean and nice and start coding
any nothing distracts me from from real
code let's start with a little example
you would read in the
line by line and then try to sort it and
write out some output so I'm using live
templates here to quick type faster and
get the all the assists and let's start
with the like typing from left to right
so we can type just a few letters and
get the auto completion per type
instantly and the outer suggest can also
suggest us to name the variables
according to the type so we get that
after the echos mark we can actually ask
IntelliJ what can we assign there so if
we use smart accompli out of auto
completion you can suggest us from the
context what can you actually assign to
this variable there or we can do it the
old way if we start typing new it can
suggest us to the real type right so
from there we either can again ask from
the context if we need another variable
there or we can start using it again the
old way and get the file reader in it's
the front is too big probably so and you
have some file in txt whatever so now it
tells me that I should actually handle
the exception that might be thrown so I
just automatically add it into the
signature so we have written this line
from left to right but it's also
possible to write from right to left so
next line we probably would like to have
an array list that we are going to use
to read the file in and if we extract
the variable from there so we get the
left-hand side and the outer suggests
also automatically suggest the real name
for us so it will be the list of string
or strings right so quite quite a good
variable name now
we'll probably start
reading the lines and let's let's have a
buffer variable to store the line and
start reading light by line into that
variable while line and then you
probably need to know the API but if we
use the smart autocomplete we actually
get the alta suggests that okay you can
you are using the reader you probably
want to assign it to the line and we
know that usually you would use read
line to do that right so not now
and we can also to complete the block
here also it tells me that okay you have
to have to handle the exception its IO
exception so it actually will replace
the signature so now we can just use
simple Auto completion we should put the
line into the list of strings so if I
type s dot add I actually get the
correct completion here and I'm getting
the line right there so imagine now
completely something different
max comes to me and tells me oh I have
heard that IntelliJ has has very cool
HTML editing capabilities right so and
I'm in the middle of context I don't
want to know to lose the context here
but what I can do now is save the
context save context as game in Java
River and then okay max I will show you
HTML so let's have let's take a look at
how the HTML has handled in IntelliJ and
switch back to the same context where we
worked so intelligent has a thing called
Emmet it's actually built in all the IDS
but it's very cool and I think that I
should show it here pretty much
everything that you type in the
structured document can be converted
automatically into real elements so if
you expand
the element right here you get the full
the full tag but normally for divs you
would write you would need a to define a
class you would need to define the ID
maybe so we can do it in expression like
way type after dot the class name and
expand it to the real element and the
same way we could assign it an ID and
get the ID there or we could write table
with a few rows and a few lines as well
right and also the the code editing or
tone or editing this is something great
though okay let's let's switch back back
to our real example so I'm using the
shortcuts which is the shortcut go to
action I don't remember all the
shortcuts load context main Java and I'm
back to the place where I was here so we
have all the lines we have to close the
reader close and we have to we have
everything in the collection maybe you
would like to use an array instead and
there is a life template which is which
can convert the collection right away
into the an array of elements of the
same type and we can just use that or
instead we could write type in the old
way and say that string string array
array because and then ask for the outer
completion to actually suggest us the
right thread or right hand side so I
don't have to type this long sentence
there I don't remember that
next out of completion for static
methods maybe we want to sort the array
sort but I don't remember which
which class it was in and I can ask the
ID to suggest me what kind of sort
methods do you have for me
right arrey good so and at the very last
moment I can just iterate the sorted
array and print out the stuff so there's
plenty of wipe the plates which can be
used to iterate collections but you
probably wouldn't remember all of them
and there is also like a search search
window where you can go sorry where you
can get all those shortcuts basically
the names of whitening plates and let's
say we are printing out stuff like this
so I'm I was using a lot of
auto-completion I was using a lot of
templating to write this code right now
now completely something different again
hm come to me and ask if if there is
like you seen some weird statement in in
the code then it was instant self check
which was for a null statement as well
and we should actually find it and fix
it
when I'm trying trying to find the
instance of a statement in the code if I
search for it the way it is I might not
get oh sorry I'm searching in a project
I'm getting like tons of results not
useful for me at all if I start trying
to figure out what is the regular
expression to find this statement I
might be very proficient in that and the
regular expression might be too
complicated
so there is a nice feature to really
search the syntactical trees in the
inside the IntelliJ so I could find real
construction there in the code this code
this is called structural search and
replace basically you can use it
as a search and you can also replace
structures in your code so we could find
real instance of check in our code and
here it is we have some some weird
statement which checks for for null and
instance of and and this is not really
the code you write but as I said there
is a structural search but it's also
structural replace which can be used to
fix this kind of things automatically
and let's let's switch it on structural
search inspection which can detect these
kind of things
basically there you define the structure
of the expression and what what what is
the expression you want to put instead
of that wrong one so if I enable this
inspection right now IntelliJ will tell
me hey you have something wrong here and
I can just hot fix it and get the real
normal expression here so there are some
other interesting analysis capabilities
for instance if you have a variable name
of or a parameter name in in the method
right here I have owner but I would like
to know all the paths that could lead to
this usage of this variable from from
somewhere from from other Co sites I
actually could use the thing that is
called a data data flow inspection which
is called data flow to here and who tell
me where this variable was used in the
previous course so I know that this this
variable was provided by this method
right here in the a donor form class and
somewhere else as well
so as you remember I have switched off
all the navigation things from from the
beginning and now you wonder how to
actually navigate of course there are
shortcuts to to quickly navigate all the
menus and actually there are there is
even even special pop-up that can be
used to navigate the project and
actually not only navigate that also
create stuff from there so if I need to
create a new class or a new file I can
invoke all the menus from here as well
so if I need an input txt which I was
actually expecting in my example I can
create it right from here and all the
tooling menus are accessible quite
quickly I think I'm pretty much done
with my example so it was all about
coding it was all about quick
inspections and navigation and there are
of course a lot of more stuff actually I
should show one one more example spring
support this is a spring based project
and I actually have one beam defined in
my spring XML for instance and I would
like to out to wire it as a field and
there is a special quick access template
that again used to inject the field
quickly and say that okay I want this
beam to be in my context or to be used
by by the controller and it can suggest
me and generate it for me into my code
and of course I get the the navigation
capabilities to check where this beam
comes from so all this nice stuff is
there okay so there is support for
multiple languages so it's it's very I
would say language agnostic of course
it's the Java EE bit but it has a lot of
capabilities for other languages also
frameworks Java EE supports spring
support all kinds of support for web
technologies not
the other conclusion for HTML stuff but
also other things database based support
is there and Android is right there in
in the free version of the IDE even so
thank you very much
okay so I'm not sure if I'm audible okay
so the Knitting story to provide some
initial context free and open source
very strong focus on the out-of-the-box
situation so what
NetBeans tries to provide is as soon as
you download an aversion of the IDE and
you started up you can immediately do
basic development you don't need to go
looking for plugins for basic
functionality is of course a large
plug-in ecosystem but for basic stuff
Java EE development maven usage no
plugins are needed at all it's all part
of the initial download it's also quite
famous for support for the latest Java
specs since it's always been closely
aligned with Sun and now Oracle its key
feature is Java and lately new features
have been added for html5 development so
I will show you similar features to what
next ananthan have shown but the the
main story as James Gosling points out
is the integration it's really about the
range of tools that are automatically
available to you as soon as you start
using NetBeans and the ease of plugging
in additional features when needed
hopefully that'll work yes okay so to
get started some basic Java coding as
Max and Anton did so creating a new java
application let's call it customer
manager and in our customer manager we
have our main class but at some point
we're inevitably going to actually also
have a customer let's say that our
customer has a name and copying lines
and so on is available as you can see
here also block mode so for some reason
name and set you suddenly become not
strings but ends then those kinds of
changes can be made and very easily next
let's add a constructor
so the code generators built-in
constructor specify the parameters that
you're going to want to work with
genders and setters it goes to C equals
hash code so all the standard basic code
that you're going to need for basic Java
programming so once you've created a
basic class and you could at some stage
decide you want to move your code but if
you do standard moving so I have shift
and alt selected and I move into some
other method you can see that there's
going to be a couple of compilation
problem of course
so there's also semantic moving so this
this this method is not moving
semantically and it's not going to cause
any compilation problems when it's
around so we're you're moving it to
so as I might expect everything can be
configured options window with many
options code folding code completion
templates and formatting so in the
formatting section in Java there's a
long list of various items that can be
formatted so the order in which members
of your class are generated when you use
code generators ordering with import
statements comments spaces blank lines
braces and this is constantly being
enriched and enhanced and new features
being added their window system can be
configured so you might want to have the
tabs along the bottom of the IDE and
that can be done here another useful
feature bookmarks so you want to
bookmark this line you can see we get a
bookmark in the sidebar but at some
point we want to move back to those
bookmarks that we've bookmarked it and I
also have some other bookmarks so I can
switch and as needed to ever going to go
and or it's actually a bookmarks window
so here all the bookmarks that I have I
have uncollected are stored and where I
can also name them so I might want to
have some more information about this
particular bookmark a this is messed up
some kind of reminder to yourself that
this is where you need to go and what's
useful as well is you don't need to go
back into the class to to see the items
your bookmark you can actually switch
between the two
in this view and then the this navigator
pane on the right and gives you
information about the item you've
bookmarked
so in a way you can build up your own
and project view in this way speaking of
which there is a logical view structure
that you can see here so multiple
projects can be shown at the same time
so let's add another and this one for
example so we have
for projects support so I gave you see
all the files that you normally want to
work with the files view shows you the
actual files so including the build
folder for example this is not something
you work with but this is something
that's generated when you compile so
it's hidden from you but if you want to
see it you can have a look there's also
very useful a favorites window which is
essentially a file explorer for the hole
for your hard disk and you can then find
items of interest there and say hey okay
this one I want to have a place to look
at and then add it as a new node in this
window and Explorer in here so you have
full access to your to your disk and you
can include it and in your IDE like this
okay also in the same vein there is a
services window where you have access to
all the services so databases are all
listed here and you can view them and
you can get hold of a particular table
actually pass an SQL query and see the
result so a client on top of your
databases within the IDE the web
services are here the servers are here
maven repositories Hudson Jenkins cloud
issue trackers Bugzilla here are both
supported and there's a new task
management and a window for organizing
your tasks for either Bugzilla or era in
the latest release okay so let's now
look at some code analysis and we can go
and inspect and run our analyzes which
includes find that find out the built in
see what what comes out of it and we get
some findbugs results and also some
generic missing Java doctype and
comments what you can also do is run
right across our codebase a number of
inspections or there's many categories
and bugs
and braces that are not according to
your Styles and so on and select these
and then run this and across a
particular scope which could be all the
April projects but it's a current
project for example convert to JDK 7
this case we don't have anything found
because we need to set this to get 7 and
then we can run our inspection so then
in the latest release you have converted
Java 8 and again you can see for example
in this case that the catch blocks can
be combined and so without even going
there
you can see in this preview window and
in Turkey do the refactoring yes the
label support is really quite special if
I creates a maven based project if the
web project and I say what I want to
deploy it to and so on the project is
created with what's really cool about
this is that NetBeans works directly
with the pom file so if I look in the
folder structure so this is the logical
view again but in the files view I see
all the files that are part of this
project and there I see nothing that
NetBeans added in order to make this
project a NetBeans project this is
purely a pure maven project that you can
open inside any other IDE so this is
really convenient if you want to work in
a team with multiple IDs to use maven
because our idea is understand maven in
some way but in the case of NetBeans you
get no special property files or
proprietary or files were even worse
thrown into the project that you need to
maintain or think about checking in or
not and similarly about cross our new e
you can quite easily switch to different
key map so if you use to eclipse or idea
or Emacs you can switch to those key map
profiles and then you have the key map
to you familiar with so built-in is
support for subversion mercurial and
gets out of the box
immediately available or ready to use
and there's a final thing I want to show
okay aside mentioning very briefly the
profiler it is built in very advanced
profiler and a debugger that we won't go
into it right now but just very quickly
as a final thing show you the html5
support so I create a new sample here
this responsive rapid sample and I can
deploy this to various browsers when I
run I could deploy to Chrome and it's a
special netbeans plugin for chrome that
lets you via WebKit interact between the
ide in the browser but the same
functionality is also for an embedded
browser which is based on top of a Java
flex webview and now when I run this and
okay so here the internal browser is
shown what I can do is say inspect a
NetBeans mode which means I can click on
the items and see information including
the that the live Dom tree you just buy
it again okay see the live Dom tree I
can click on items and see where they
are defined and vice versa as well so
inside this navigator view as I move my
mouse I can see in the browser which
could be the Chrome browser and where
things are defined so let's say here are
this particular images and so exactly
what I wanted to be normally you have to
go on a treasure hunt through your IDE
finding where that's defined where that
size is found but here you can do it
directly inside of the IDE and you can
jump from here directly into the source
and inside the source you can also make
a change and the cool thing is I haven't
pressed save one so far I haven't
pressed saved so this is really nice for
fine tuning and web apps that are HTML
based and similarly in the latest
release you can
this onto an Android device you can
develop in JavaScript HTML CSS and
deploy to Android or iOS because their
support for PhoneGap and Cordova so you
can let the IDE add those files that you
need and then call build on the project
and then under the hood PhoneGap is used
to create your Android files and you can
then deploy them directly into the
browser because their support for that
as well I think I've covered everything
I wanted to say and I'm probably almost
about out of time as well so we should
switch to the slides
oh yes okay so this was the the first
part so the the main points I've made
it's open source and free from focus on
out of the box story support for Java
technologies Java editor and you can
very easily work with HTML Javascript
and CSS and you can integrate that
front-end onto a Java back-end very
easily as well if you want to use rest
and JPA on the backend you can use html5
technologies in the front end and that's
that integration is there too right
awesome so sorry for taking difficulties
but now we've done it's our little
show-and-tell about the feature we'd
like that you guys should know about and
we have 10 min 15 minutes left we can
ask anything and anything goes we won't
hit in one but that's 1 lakh
okay so the question was not try and be
courteous and gave a response that says
what are the thing you don't like about
that we're going to basically be putting
that into practice no no no greeing on
being oh you're seeing things about your
own ID what you don't like about your
own ID yeah
what's the bad thing oh okay okay so you
will ask you skip start so this is where
you then you know it's like when when
your future employer asks you what then
can I can make yourself and you say I
work too hard
you know I can okay okay you see I have
two things you know actually I wish
NetBeans had the the fantastic language
switching that intelligence within the
editor that that you have as syntax and
card completion support for multiple
different languages within the same file
yes I mean that's you know fantastic
that's the missing thing with it oh it
the bad thing is we don't have it okay
for me the bad things about IntelliJ is
the very mediocre support for Gradle and
and the other thing is that is really
annoying is in maven projects when you
switch the language level it has to
reload the project to apply the language
capabilities this is one day I know it's
probably the most annoying thing in
intelligence but I think greater was
failing unique things doesn't the clips
have natively built into it Gradle
plugin
exactly oh okay they the Gradle plug-in
did the greater plans
well for me the biggest problem with
eclipse
the thing is being too popular and we
have to be compatible with the whole
world but yeah so one thing is the Maven
support the way eclipse supports
different languages is an add-on it's
not built into the system so i'm
tailgate has it's basically architecture
is built with the language that's why
you have to look forward
NetBeans a thing you're getting you have
similar things
Eclipse is missing that so everything
you see like if you have a the crater
plug-in or the Scala plug in Salem
plug-in or the maven plug-in it's all
kinda you can get to like 85% and not
much further especially when you're
looking from what comes from eclipse or
because Eclipse an org has limits on
what they are allowed to distribute with
the distribution and that's why we come
back to the choose a and not a disputed
environment it's a horrible to get a
better experience and then the other one
I think the one that people bitch about
notice is that the Eclipse has this very
opinionated
that's correct approach that everything
has to be one project so a multi model
main project is not a much more main
product it's a each individual marginal
that knows if something else is
depending on and yeah we've been working
hard on getting a fixed that takes time
so yeah so that that's the downside of
the question okay hey what else
well I mean the question was it's a good
source for how to go from eclipse to
NetBeans this is no it's for me so
actually this this this is just three
things to be to to know in that context
one is make sure that your produce is
built on maven you can simply I put into
nettings or IntelliJ
that the biggest problem with converting
between IDs and we've actually talked
about this at some point in preparation
is formatting rules if you have
company-wide formatting rules each of
the IDS have different formatting
settings and the cool thing is the
Eclipse this is what I realize about the
Eclipse for matter is that they have a
public API so there is a plugin for
intelligent where you can convert a Java
class to the Eclipse formatting rules
and the same this also now plug in for
NetBeans so if you have this is
typically the blocker that that there
are four machine rules in Eclipse that
aren't supported in NetBeans and so you
can plug-in that make use formatter
internet beans and then you can do your
formatting so first is maybe in the
second point is the format and the third
point is you have the P map options
which you can switch so that you have
your keyboard shortcuts from your clips
that you can use in NetBeans so that
that's all that's all you need that's
not much to to do that is one upon one
thing that actually changed over the
last two years is that maven hit the
curve like it came massive top tip not
just by users but also by the IDs so in
depending that some of different have
different level support of maven maybe
part of is maven migrating from one idea
to the other is easier but even when I
think it's better because I'm I am an
IDE is that you can have to use
most bodies on your project
what's much easier than it could let's
say three years
anything else in the back yeah so the
question is is there an ree performed
based on your OS yeah okay I think
that's what do Mackey you don't really
care
the old IDs like quite quite nicely
rendered but on Linux probably swing
support wasn't that great
well I use alone to almost permanently
yeah and I making this finally so I
think if you use the Nimbus look and
feel then you have a good looking ID
yeah I think that that had also have won
a thing have changed the last three four
years so even a Mac we had problem with
the swing the earlier version of Eclipse
was way better as is way better faster
on Windows because the SWT
implementation they had there is way
better than they was on Mac and Linux
but that's kind of faded out now maybe
because I'm your teen is fast enough but
also on but I think yesterday it is not
working bottom line is that you don't
care yeah I don't not today no that's
the details but not please tell us more
yep
okay so you're saying you have sibility
problem is equips large projects it's
going to be a child you have challenge
with a large following clips so I've
just be honest yes that follow the exist
especially in you know but just to make
sure is it maven projects and many of
them okay so that's the key that so I
just say maybe it's great so if you're
using Eclipse you know so I consider
Eclipse do you know like the windows
2095 yes Windows Vista of Eclipse right
that was not the best thing happening
Kepler is way better and I'm not
all he pumps not there but definitely go
from do unit except there's some base
there's a huge set of changes going on
any tips you know that was just not
taken care of and I it's person about
that many times but don't use do you
know use Kepler I'll use indigo that so
just that's a general thing independent
maven and the other one is to make me
support so I notice I'm putting a
personal pull it for for gave us is we
were super super hard on getting some of
these problems solved some em solved in
Juneau I'm sorry any Kepler there and
those performance overhead in Kepler and
as Prompto ahead in mtoui was handled at
helling itself but it still not sold
fully and Kepler but I know like let's
just last week the guy who's working on
into II summertime has it so it uses
like one one-fifth of the memory on
that's in development in to eat so I
expect within
a few months there's gonna be some huge
improvements there yeah this party's
like a double you can catch me off line
for doing it but I must say yeah that
the if you look at it right now
the main sport in IntelliJ and in
NetBeans when you talk about import of
the product is better than it is in
clutch we read fixing on the wreck you
mean I'm a tease well he says rival the
one but the good one there so again the
my eclipse guys took the Matisse builder
and this I haven't heard about this for
years but basically they took it four
years ago
so if you can they took the one that's
in letÃ­s add a bit to it and I think
it's still in like lips I haven't used
it but that that will be the way to go
if that's the kind of development you
want and you think about the swing UI
builder or the swing right actually
what's actually also interesting is that
that Matisse GUI builder is now also
officially in Jay dead so we've yeah
yeah so we have we have no Oracle J
there's representation here because it's
barely not used in the open-source
community because for many good reasons
but the Matisse Kiwi builder and the
profiler from NetBeans are not part of
JDeveloper because JDeveloper is based
on the stuff of the same framework is
making that you know because it's the
same oracle behind both so we have the
same infrastructure and making it
possible to exchange features yeah so
that's one other place where you could
use the one that kept this gets
explosives is there's a window builder
an eclipse which is I guess the second
best I'm not saying it's going to be the
best but it doesn't have some but
now that's one thing that means that
they win out is the swing UI builder
yeah I think there's just no competition
basically there's nothing in it so much
it is so much the winner that I don't
even bother to show it because it's
that's why I acted when I did a good
swing you either wanna what I did it was
I use NetBeans for the swing UI and it's
worth it yeah okay anybody else wonder
about what's what's the server of choice
the server yeah my with NetBeans Tomcat
and glass which are bundled with
NetBeans Chambers's
so if you install NetBeans you
automatically have those two and it's a
better same with oh so it cups doesn't
have their product they actually have an
itty Diddy bundle so you can do basic
HTML web war but again this comes back
to so what the question is what's the
best serve use Eclipse has generic
support for all the servers but like to
gave us support us in eclipse of art is
very very fat not that old old compared
to what's in give us tools so stuff like
in 20 compilation
hot reload and other things is not in
Eclipse at work not even for Tomcat but
if you gave us user I definitely go to
the stuff we have in game of tools a
treeless to do if you are what's that
called spring so skies to have a tomcat
and she said TC server their server
after there is doing better with Tomcat
and a normal Tomcat in Eclipse and I
think you guys are pretty up-to-date
gave us it's also supported yeah
actually and there were a lot of people
asking for J Buster fortunate things for
J both 77.1 which wasn't supported and
in the in the 73 one release their
support for the first time in jail for
Java 7
and I think the Antonius assembly table
it has just they adapt their servers it
doesn't bother one no the runtime it has
all the adapters so there's a lot of
poplar one start
yeah you should okay I think we've done
so it's thank you for coming and sorry
for taking difficulty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
