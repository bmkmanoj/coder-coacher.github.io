of um I guess you call schemer on read
or flexible type schema changes have
come in in eighteen so we've explained
it Jason with enhancing the
functionality there we've got anyone
who's come from a sequel server
background will probably love private
temporary tables so a table table tables
that literally only exist in your
session but I think my favorite one is
probably inline external tables so
rather than actually have to create an
external table you can just create have
a query and define the external table on
the fly so it literally doesn't exist
this is particularly useful I think if
you've not got a straightforward CSV
file it can be really tricky to figure
out you know how to get the columns to
line up or how do what the terminators
are and it you can just prototype in a
single query and so I think I think
that's pretty cool so Geraldton with you
oh the question came up and a month ago
as well and back then I believe my
answer was primary temporary tables as
well I changed that off every feature in
eighteen one obviously in the canopy but
no one thing that I like a lot and I'll
tell you why is that we now have the
sleep function in DBMS session mm-hmm
and there's a couple of reasons why I
like it so much so number one this was
come this came from the community on the
database idea forums out out there so if
you don't notice yet if you google
Oracle database ideas you get a forum
where you can put an enhancement request
and so forth and this was something that
actually also bucked me years and years
ago when you know I was still working
outside or toured with eight nine ten
well it's like why is the sleep function
in DBMS lock right inside and I only can
grant through our execution rights on
the package not on the methods of
package all I want to do is you know
pause for a second or whatever or a
minute whatever it may be right but now
I and we actually have this really in
the scenario where you know we needed
execute rights on DBMS lock because of
the sleep function that we used in there
and our customers didn't like it at all
because
other methods hinder that you know you
don't necessarily want to expose to
everybody or to applications to use and
so this came in from the community we
took this feedback and the Deaf team was
immediately yeah makes perfect sense
aside yeah why did we no think of the
Sunnah writers like there since ages
obviously um and they literally just
gave you a DBMS session sleep that calls
the same underlying code of stillness
Locksley so a nice thing there uh it now
allows you to or you can easily migrate
from DBMS law sleep to DBMS session
sleep because it's actually the very
same code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
