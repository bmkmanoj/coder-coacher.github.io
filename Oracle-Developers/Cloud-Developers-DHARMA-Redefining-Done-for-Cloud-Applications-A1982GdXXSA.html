Daniel today I'm gonna be talking about
and redefining done for the cloud how to
best leverage when you move to the cloud
just rough you ought to expect we're
going to be looking at some sort of the
things I've seen when I've lifted in
shifting applications we're going to be
looking at sort of smashing down
monolith a little bit maybe a little bit
of micro service type stuff I'm also
going to be looking at techniques for
developing new applications for the
cloud they're all kind of wrapped in one
i'm going to give you suggestions on
where to focus tools and techniques I've
done this talk a few times and I
appreciate there is a lot of information
here so I've talked quite fast I'm not
careful as well so I'm going to go
through it the slides are available
later online my ID really is give you a
high-level overview of the problems I've
seen in my 28 day job and what I do is I
go into companies as a consultant and
help add your transformations do a lot
of DevOps tough at the moment I'm
working for a company called open credo
we're actually based in the UK we do
some work on the East Coast as well and
we're looking to expand all the time so
if you're looking for a job come see I'm
fully buzz we're compliant I do micro
service i do DevOps you know like to get
my see me fully packed but this is
really what we're seeing our clients are
moving to and our clients are everything
from startups to massive organizations
so across the way everyone is really
interested in these things I also am a
leader within the London Java 3 and T
settle of work there and I work with the
openjdk crew and the dr j sr crew and
the JCP as well so I'm passionate about
Java that's why I'm here as well and
when I go into companies typically
they're looking for three things at the
moment they're looking for a move to
slower microservices you would be dope
know what it means they're kind of
looking for it they're looking to
leverage cloud-based deployments they
heard it gives us flexibility Gibbs you
know increased deployment times
performance you name it I've heard
everything and they're looking to
instigate a DevOps culture some of them
know that some of them don't some of
them have heard the words and whatever
and but these three things are really
popular in the consulting field that I'm
engaged in at the moment now i'm going
to talk primarily about cloud-based
deployments today and how to get things
done right for the cloud and i will
necessarily go towards some of the solar
stuff and some the DevOps stuff because
in my mind these three things go hand in
hand particularly for a successful
cloud-based migration or project and
twitter than great story on the actual
journey from their mana
el hermano if to so uh so I won't talk
to you much about that great link there
and I've talked couple times about
DevOps the top one is about the benefits
of DevOps second one I think was more
about how to actually implement a devil
Sculptra what even that means as well so
you want to look at those links later on
you can have a look at that so common
cloud problems fart primary one it's not
respecting the underlying hardware and
the analogy I like to use is people have
got their formula one car their
application and they're trying to put it
onto a dirt track and the cloud is the
dirt track most of the applications are
built for data centers are built for
smaller you know enhanced deployments
the Formula One car does not read drive
well on a dirt track and all I've tried
it but I've seen the video and it didn't
look you look kind of cool but it didn't
go very well anyway people aren't used
to monitoring their applications big
problem when you've got a monolith or
something in a data center any kind of
problem you know where to look straight
away and with microservices so crowd
it's a bit different so we're going to
look at some of that stuff and the joke
beings even if you don't do good
monitoring I'm sure the NSA do
monitoring for you so no need to worry I
think bizarre failure modes in the cloud
I've been doing quite development now
for 34 years and yeah a whole bunch of
things actually I like the blue screen
of death now it gives me comfort yeah
all these crazy pheromones which I'll
talk about later and are quite
frustrating tilly if you're new
developers of the cloud and people work
it often split up their architecture
when they move their cloud so there's a
can be a lot of confusion so I'm really
big on my documentation these days and
don't shoot me at all I'll talk about
documentation in the moment but yeah so
your love difficult difficulty in
understanding the architecture the
deployment platform that kind of thing
and the biggest thing which I've totally
been guilty of as well in my career is
not testing in the cloud and if you
pause for a second and if you're
developing a software system and you've
got you know target deployment platform
and you haven't tested on that
deployment tired of that platform along
the way of the development how can you
actually expect it to work but I've seen
it I did it myself for the start and I
see in all too many organizations build
for the cloud and right at the end they
actually deploys the cloud and it
doesn't work and they wonder why I'll
make lots of money of that which is good
my company does i jus de verte
also net I was performed at and we have
that back in that be alright so cool
awesome so that guy's am I gonna I like
to move around but it's gonna be a bit
of a problem with another stuff down
here so and we've created a cloud
developers Dharma checklist I don't know
if you guys have heard the word Dharma
but I got introduced to it a few years
back when I was really good ism those
kind of things and it's about sort of a
series of cosmic law and order rules
those kind of things and as much that
the Dharma this I think it's a great
definition of what we've kind of come up
with it nicely leads into a series of
rules a bit like the solid mnemonic
don't if you guys have had uncle bob's
solid demonic so we're going to go
through these today unconscious i think
i'd be looking at time quite a bit but
we're going to try and cover these in
the high level and then you can always
come to chat to me afterwards or I'll be
around the conference if you want to
know more on specific things as well and
so documentation first thing we get when
we walk into companies and I starts Jeff
achmet documentation is this they're
like wool we're agile we don't document
yeah i started my micro actually in a
government contract and that was like
fifteen years ago whatever and the mat
documentation there was crazy but over
the years we've gradually come down and
so but i think think documentation needs
to be like that the primary purpose that
i write documentation is to provide a
map is a good analogy I like to use
provide a map for my developers and I
want to if I'm breaking up into the
monolith and the cloud I want to show
what each component does at a very high
level I want to perhaps yeah talk about
its contract I want to also talk about
its initialization instructions because
this can be different when you move to
the cloud because the client can be very
different than developing on your local
machine so we often have to do things
yeah some documentation walk through
there and it for the for the ops guys at
highlights areas of operational risk but
also for your developers as well when
you move things apart put them in the
cloud there might be increased latency
so these kind of diagrams documentation
can be really helpful in communicating
some of that risk and a lot of my job is
about managing this risk and pointing
this risk out our big fan of Simon
Browns worker i think is based in jersey
at al island off the UK and he's got
some amazing work coding the
architecture calm and he's got a blog
he's got a book it's awesome but like I
know something quite well and I'm really
no buying into stuff and he talks about
four views of your architecture which
I'm not gonna talk too much now but
they're really useful to look into
or it's you know half a day's worth of
reading really but I appreciate this is
quite small on a big screen but this is
kind of documentation i recently am
worked my system where we had a monolith
in the middle there when we started
teasing bit silent and move to the cloud
and and a long list we were this diagram
kind of grew and people could see you
can see here the different services were
pulling out how they talk to each other
there's a queue there so you need to be
aware perhaps some a synchronicity and
things like that and silent Brown talks
about how to do this in a very sort of
sync very useful way so appreciate isn't
it's not so easy to read here slides
will hopefully make it clearer later and
Simon brains website is awesome as well
we typically back these things up we do
a lot of work in bitbucket github so we
have like typical open-source style
readme responsibilities for the
component initialization instructions
will you spring a lot so we say like
spring profiles if we're mocking out
various things and we often let the Ops
guys often we do lot work on AWS so they
translate that diagram I had before into
an operational diagram so we can see
where firewalls are going to be where
virtual private clouds firewalls but all
those kind of things are so keeping the
nsync is a bit of work but it should be
minimal work and the value you get it
get from it from onboarding and just
day-to-day work I found immensely
valuable rather than how community
obstacle munication having conversation
is key but my mind the documentation
should trigger those communications
those those chats so yeah highly
recommend getting that in a couple of
brief bonus things i'm not sure if you
guys aware of swagger but if you're
doing rest like api's swagger is really
awesome and there's a couple of
competing things Google I've got one
masher ease got one but we see you
spring spring boot quite a lot and you
literally build a kind of an interface
if you like onto your API by just
including a few annotations by API
operation there on these are the
controller at endpoints in a spring and
boot controller and then there's a UI
that and you can run some stuff at the
build process part of maven build
process generate Jason files that
represent the endpoints and then there's
a swagger you I where you can actually
give or we can deploy i should say give
the URL to your clients they could be
internal clients or even external public
clients and they can test against your
api and it's all kind of free and the
beauty is because the documentation is
so close to the actual code it's easier
to keep in sync so every person i
integrate with and always recommend
swagger pics
up it is really cool swagga tues just
out as well I was working on some of the
stuff around that and it's definitely
worth a look there's a lot of talk and
I'll move into it later but contract and
Martin Fowler was talking about this
ages ago has he typically does he's
usually ahead of the curve but there's
this talk to kit called packed it's
multiple languages I primarily use it on
Ruby on Rails and on Java and it's about
creating sort of a contract between
supplier and consumer so that might be
different services or it might be
fronting back end and it's got a really
cool kind of fluent interface dsl thing
for generating a mock service so your
consumers can test against the mock
service but it also generates a contract
which the provider can test against that
makes sense so you're this thing in the
middle like a Java interface arguably
you've got this interface that you can
sort of mock out things to your clients
testing and the server when you're
building a micro service you can
actually run as part of your build
process validation against a JSON file
that this produces to verify the
contract is correct I talk more about
that later but it's a really cool and
bittick it so moving on now to the set
of the second thing highly cohesive
loosely coupled I'm sure many of you
aware of this notion of Uncle Bob's than
a great job most of you heard of solid
those kind of principal software sort of
sing responsibility a high cohesion low
coupling and my experience and it's very
easy to see this in code people are
really quite thoughtful when they design
code but not so much in architecture and
the move to the cloud often lat it does
bring about exploding things or at least
moving data stores around or
distributing data stores and thinking
about this kind of notion of cohesion
coupling is really valuable and
something I recommend a few good books
here just to kind of get a feel for a
missing a particular sign Brown and she
recommended is really good and it also
is really important for API and paypal
great story there how they talked about
their API is how they've evolved I don't
know if any of you use the paypal public
API is but for a while they weren't very
good they were very and the sort of
loose loosely loose Couture loco Heejun
I should say and they've kind of they've
done a lot of amazing work which they
talk about in an info q video here which
is well worth checking so it's kind of
the phrase Turtles all the way down
think about this high cohesion loose
coupling all the way down your stack and
we often do as part of Clyde migrations
a lot of Smashing limon left
I call it and and I've come up with this
is a talking itself which I'm working on
actually but I just want to briefly
mention it today there's four primary
ways I think of breaking apart our
monolith and there's the kind of
business functionality you can tease out
a shopping cart shopping cart service
you can tease out a check out service
for example and that's quite easy from a
technical point of view you look for
your seams you get your interfaces and
it gives business value so the people
higher up the chain like that bit easier
is pulling out through a technical chunk
so just pulling out say an email service
it's easier from a technical point of
view I found and compared with the
business functionality but it's not so
easy to sell upstream the management
like you're just going to pull out
something and rewrite it and that's
often a harder sell but it can be easier
from tech thing there's two approaches
here which I've got into recently one is
that the vertical slice so picking a bit
of your application say just moving that
bit to the cloud or pulling it out and
Groupon I've got a great talk they've
done recently about how to do that and I
recommend doing this if you're looking
to a proof-of-concept you know try to
sort of get your your company your team
to move to the cloud move to so er this
is a great way of doing it it's not easy
because you literally cut a hole seeing
the whole bit down through your
application stack but it's a really
strong selling point and David actually
from IBM and talked about some stuff
last night so as a talk 5 30 last night
might be worth their checking out on
parlays when it's released as well about
this and the horizontal slice great book
by sam Newman from thought works
microservices early access but check it
out and he talks about doing a
horizontal slice so pulling out sale
repository rather than just having a
data store if you're moving to the cloud
you might want to do some distributions
and clustering that kind of thing but
you might want to put almost a facade on
top of that data store so then you can
change things at the back end and your
clients aren't affected so these are I
think I say this can be talking its own
right but this is this is basically what
I do on my day job mostly is it's a
figuring out how to break up monoliths
in the mood move to the cloud so
automation is that is the third of our
list today and we're doing for time and
so yeah how many of you to practice
continuous integration quick show of
hands awesome that's really good do any
of you do continuous delivery in
deployment brilliant last nitee yeah
because that's definitely something on
the continuous integration a lot of us
you know it's about pushing your code
down
pipeline and making sure any code you
commit is production ready that's the
idea and continuous deployment and
delivery is the next evolution of that
not just that you every piece of code
you commit gets tested and validated
down this pipeline but it ultimately
gets deployed into production and you
look at the likes of Etsy and netflix
and amazon and they do it amazingly but
even a company i'm working with now
quite a small company in the UK are
doing it and we're doing about 10
deploys a day and there's still a little
bit of manual testing involved for some
of the UI changes but it's really
powerful I've seen companies get this
working and it's a cliche but it's a
game changer in terms of being able to
react to the market and Amazon are the
primary example of this but it's so
tempting to look at amazon as a huge
thing and think they're unicorns
sometimes but I've seen this working in
smaller shops and if you can get it done
this book just jay-z's book awesome
start to this and there's lots of cool
talks budget and Dave on them on info q
if you want to learn more as well Justin
we use Jenkins quite a lot when I go in
nice if we let using Jenkins but other
things do exist bamboo if you're a
lasting shop that kind of thing and it
some really cool and pipeline them and
plugins parameterize builds web calm
moted builds allows you to promote from
each stage so you might have like unit
tests if it passes unit test it gets
promoted to integration tests and so on
typical pipeline we do this is from a
couple of contracts ago example and we
did we had and we use may even for this
and we had unit intuition test being
running by surefire failsafe as part of
a maven build on Jenkins and free slaves
when they pass the unit when a component
i should say pass the you know
integration test it got pushed out onto
the cloud and we used em python scripts
because and we use the amazon sdk at the
time the python SDI was the best one and
when you shift vision up the boxes as
well i'll talk about Chef a little bit
more in a minute but basically the ideal
as soon as it passed the local test we
pushed it out onto the cloud and we
tried a QA environment mimicked the
production environment as much as
possible as we could we verified
successes using other successful
deployment using Python and some SDKs
and there some other cool em tools and
serve a spec that we're using now to do
that we kind of we've moved on a little
bit from this but and we also once we've
put it into our QA card we run an
acceptance tests on it we use things
like cucumber little bit of selenium
I've moved away from selenium to be
honest
test more against the api's now and I'll
talk about that a little bit more later
we got burned actually on this project
and now we put in performance testing at
the end as well because it's very easy
to develop a component to push it into
the cloud subtle things you're doing as
a developer actually the performance is
going down you don't realize it because
you're testing on your local machine or
looks good and one of our components hit
the critical path and basically the
performance dropped off so much that the
site fell over be embarrassing obviously
so then we put in this MJ meter and a
Jenkins performance plugin it gives you
graphs which is really cool we only pick
a few key things if you keep critical
path things for each component so the
checkout thing is you know can you
actually check out for example I'll talk
about the notion of something called
synthetic transactions a little bit
later and but then when we benchmark the
actual and time taking to do these
things and you can spot that the worst
thing is the subtle trends that's what
got us you know usually if something
goes badly wrong you can spot it as a
developer when you're testing but it's
the subtle trends they've got us so it's
really cool to get this in your bill
pipeline if you can live deployment I've
worked on more gigs that don't do live
deployments and I have gigs that doodoo
and continuous deployment so people get
bit nervous at the end sometimes they
like to give it that a final seal of
approval I don't have a massive opinion
on that I like automation but I totally
appreciate the business value in
business risk it sounds sometimes it's
hard to mitigate I've got a few cool
tools and you can actually chat to me
offline which I discovered at the
conference which I might be using to
help with this now actually taking
snapshots of websites for example and
comparing and other websites of altered
things like that so automating Q ways is
actually really hard part I think and
there's the intra component testing and
the inter component testing on the cloud
so the intra component is just your one
component and testing through it we do a
lot of embedded data stores and
middleware so using h2 to simulate
databases that kind of thing we've
created a mock rabbit we're doing some
rabbit mqp stuff and and we use a lot of
Cassandra so it's a great tool by a guy
lund actually called stub to cassandra
because a lot of people i chat to want
to know how to test cassandra without
having a cluster and chris has done some
great work he's created a you basically
the idea is you can test all the fairly
modes of cassandra in the
of your own home that's his pitch so it
really cool tool check it out and I
think more around this as you move to
the cloud and you do lots of different
service integration there's this notion
of service virtualization which is
becoming increasingly popular when
you're developing locally how do you
test against all these other services
you probably don't want to spin them all
up so you might want to virtualize them
and it's a really cool tool kit called
mountebank know if you guys have heard
of but it's an evolution of Betamax and
vcr which used to allow you to and
record a basically of proxies they sit
in the middle you make a request that
records response back and then you could
then put that into a gamal file and you
can test against that it acts as a proxy
even when the service isn't there when
it sees the requests coming in it knows
it will respond back with a canned a pre
canned response a mountebank takes that
to the next level and it's written a
note so you can mock out different ports
different wire protocols and allows you
to kind of fake services to be honest
we're still playing around with this
we've not fully got it into our build
pipeline process yet but we're quite
impressed so I wanted to pitch it out
there see what you guys think of it as
well into component testing is the
hardest part of so er so you put stuff
into the cloud you know you've got
different machines different VMs running
things and how do you test that it's
really tricky at the moment we tend to
do a lot of testing at the component
level we define our use cases our
business value at to the component level
and then we do something called
synthetic transactions at the macro
level and again sam newman in his book
his microservice book talks about
synthetic transactions they're
essentially fake transactions across the
system so it's almost like like live
monitoring you push your system through
into production and then you can run
synthetic transactions for example in a
ecommerce shop we used they call it a
polynomial nagios we use nagios today on
web webdriver think schooled in there
and you can basically make requests
against the the actual application so
you know browse for products put
something in a basket go through the
checkout we've got like a fake credit
card for example that doesn't test some
external stuff but it tests our process
and then the idea being is there any
part of that synthetic transaction that
fake transaction fails we know there's a
big problem because our critical path as
an e-commerce shop is allowing people to
browse for product
put them in their basket and buy them
and if at any point they can't do that
that's like a you know Code Red
situation so this notion of synthetic
transactions people are moving more
towards this testing at the component
level which actually validate the
correctness of the whole system is
really hard using something like
cucumber so synthetic transactions are
worth more of a look brief talk and
infrastructure I'm sure many of you
heard the all the hype oh yeah chef pub
it's all stack but you really do need to
do this kind of thing and you need to
choose really where they will fry or
bake so baking is like what Netflix do
they kind of literally spin up a an
application put it into a target
deployment container if you like or vm
get it all up and running that then they
dehydrate it and then when they want to
scale up their services in the cloud
they'll if you just so a load an image
if you like better doc file or whatever
you wanna call it and then they hydrate
it in production the baking is very fast
you know it takes a while to build it
first off but when you're actually
scaling in a live environment it's very
fast and that you literally just spin up
images and add them to your load
balancer the frying method which is more
poppy at the moment is similar but you
literally spin up an instance then you
use something like chef and everything
to configure all your infrastructure on
that instance and then you deploy your
application for example from nexus if
you're using Java or that kind of thing
so choosing whether to bake or fry is
interesting i think frying is easier to
get started with and if you're not
familiar with chef puppet and all that
lot i think it's easier and the baking
though is more flexible ultimately if
you're working and with very elastic
traffic right you know in terms of
demands like ecommerce is very typical
with that kind of thing and it's really
cool tool by the Hashi corp guys the
guys I'm vagrant called packer which is
really nice Packer allows you to create
images for and all the different VMware
a virtual box and Amazon I think a few
other different and cloud providers now
as well Cynthia you can build it locally
test it and it's kind of like a a docker
type approach doc office is a container
it's not an image but it's kind of
similar once it works in your local that
target you should be able to move it
into production as well a lot of people
with infrastructures the code say that
you can't do proper development and the
gas is runs actually some stuff in
London and the dev ops ii runs a few
DevOps use group
sessions and he's got a DevOps with Liam
newsletter and he did a recent talk at
chef comp which is really awesome about
how to do TDD on infrastructure code how
to do TDD on puppet as do TDD on chef
and it's really cool so check it out
gasps really good guys you see around a
lot of conferences it's not here
unfortunately but any talks about how to
use vagran and darker to do these kind
of things locally so definitely check
out that videos is really good so
resource awareness yell on this one I
would like to I think no presentation is
complete with that cat picture i like to
say and the analogy i'm going to use
when I go into companies a lot of them
that this is their deployment platform
their data center Tiddles comfortable
reliable bit slow not so agile but I
think they want is a cheater they want
to upgrade their their data center to
move to the cloud and yeah sure cheater
here is much more agile flexible
powerful faster than tittles we saw
there soaked like this is the data
center moving to the cloud what you can
remember the cloud is fundamentally a
different animal and enca demo here and
it can be it can be quite a shock
definitely myself when i first moved
towards the cloud it was it was a real
change of mindset in terms with
everything being distributed all these
kind of things and so you really got to
be aware what the underlying fabric is
you're deploying on to Amazon I've done
a little work on AWS actually so I use
them as my reference point a lot they
recently changed but their block store
their hard drive if you like is in
elastic block store EBS used to do a
hundred input/output operations per
second so you could do 100 I owe you no
impact operations per second at my mac
kid has 49,000 at the box so one project
I am I was working on geez Mongo and I'm
not blaming Mongo but i was using Mongo
for postings and feeds and i'm actually
at 20 million of these items through my
feed a day on the mac or so chuffed
showed the co-ceo the company he was
like hi yeah you guys are awesome put it
into the cloud and it but drop by a
factor I think it went down to like 1
million a day oh man what am I suddenly
realized like Matt 49 Barisan compared
two hundred you know this is like two
years ago is a massive difference Mongo
is doing so many of rights and it's not
long as far as that's what's designed
for I was using it wrong and that I
didn't kind of herbs testing so much on
my local environment that I wasn't
looking at the bigger picture the actual
fabric I was going to be deploying too
so I got burned their tail between the
legs learn future going to contracts not
to get quite so cocky until I've
actually put it in the cloud nothing
you've gotta remember in the cloud a lot
of beer passes or introduction service
typically have one gigabit networks now
you can buy bigger ones grafton but if
you think about it one gigabit network
the max transfer rate you're going to
get as 125 Meg's a second now my map
does 400 sequential would write in
Tucson a state drive and you gotta
remember this this 125 over the network
is on a good day no contention so you're
basically a vm you're operating on
making assumption you there's no
contention the average I've seen on
Amazon is probably around fifty so again
it's a factor of a difference here and
you're going over not just your services
but potentially your datastore but EBS
is effectively a San a storage on the
network if you're using their RAM or any
kind of providers and database it's all
going over network and you're probably
used to that when you're dealing with
databases but there could be increased
latency but definitely am it can be a
real trick when you're pulling services
apart there is increased latency there
and you've got to be aware at particular
amazon and so forth about noisy virtual
neighbors i'm not sure a few words of
the concept of steel time with in linux
but again when you're running on a vm
platformer on a hypervisor platform the
actual bare metal is being carved up
into a series of VMs and if you go to
amazon's micro instances for example and
they I think they have likes 100 micro
instances on one box and there can be a
lot of contention and obviously is very
clever algorithm it uses but you can get
cpu time stolen from you and they've
really advertise that they freely say
that with their microservices that's why
they're so cheap or their micro
instances sorry but you've got to be
aware of these things that you're not
potentially going to get a stable use of
cpu you might actually get a burst the
use of cpu and again i was burned in a
previous application where i was making
the assumption that the cpu time it's
going to be constant but it's constantly
getting cut and it was causing some very
strange problems and so that's something
to be aware of as well you need to call
to it what's called mechanical sympathy
there's someone over in there in London
and Martin Thompson a tox this actual
blog is called mechanical sympathy he's
real low-level JVM stuff but his notion
of mechanical thing sympathy is really
good in that you have to be sympathetic
to the platform you're deploying on to
you need to learn about virtualization i
think in
even if you're using things like docker
it's a similar kind of principle
containers so you need to whether using
VMs docker bare metal whatever it have a
read about this stuff techtarget got a
really cool link actually it's worth
checking out and I'm big fan of it's
quite a boring book it's not bedtime
reading by any means but there's a great
book and I've got a reference actually
on the next slide a thing yeah it talks
all about linux and a lot of platforms
in the cloud or linux underneath if
you're using it something like an eye as
later amazon you can actually get down
to the bare mother the OS for using
something more like a pass you probably
can access but the logs and so forth
might be quite similar to there might be
exposed in a linux format so learning
but I've definitely had to learn a lot
more about linux as i move to the cloud
and which is a good thing last I've
enjoyed it a lot as a Java developer
I've learned a lot more about MJ p SJ
stat j map tools to figure out what's
going on and to go on on the actual
operating system level I've learnt a lot
about vmstat it's very easy to get io
bound in the cloud and things like VMs
that will show you what's going on many
times I've been diagnosing stuff you
know using my traditional java tools and
it's haven't been able to make sense of
what's going on but in combination with
what's going on in the operating system
cpu being stolen io being you know I
being i/o bound which is very common and
that kind of thing these are really
useful tools I've had to learn a bit
more to add a few more tools to my tool
kit if you like for actually diagnosing
issues this is a great book em as well
by Karl ranking is quite thin book it's
a no weekends read and it gives you a
obviously buzzword compliant but it
gives you a really good idea of some of
the tools for the cloud about actually
debugging and obviously I find it useful
to grow a beard any good sysadmin needs
a good bit i preciate the ladies in the
audience that's not possible but as in i
do believe it is very useful as a little
joke there so moving on to em to
monitoring and monitoring it is vital
for sure and i don't if you aware of
things like naggy are sands a becks but
that they're really good in terms of
actually checking whether things are
alive and alerting if they're not those
kind of things and if you've got a lot
of money appdynamics is awesome but it
is very expensive and particularly not
so good for the cloud because they
charge on a per vm model so if you
imagine one company i worked at we moved
everything to the cloud we had 150 VMs
working in the cloud everything was
small taking advantage of of you know
dish being workloads well
chapter appdynamics they were like yeah
we'd love your business how many of the
m's have you got 100 whoa they were
really like my look at the actual price
I was like that's not practical so
Twitter I've actually got an open source
and thing which is similar to wrapped
and imax obviously not as well polished
because it's an open source thing but
and they're not that's not their primary
em actual where I put but it's called
Zipkin so check out zipkin and those
spring you're doing a lot of work to
integrate these things into their and
frameworks as well so we've actually
integrated zip get into spring boot to
one of our projects and Zipkin allows
you much like app dynamics have
distributed tracing so a big thing in
the cloud is you might often have lice a
performance issues like I've mentioned
but if you've gone to a sower model
you're not going to be sure where the
performance issues are whereas this
should be a tracing my lines you just
see you can see here hopefully there's
like so this is the the journey of a
request the users request comes in goes
by our load balancer might go to service
a service be serviced see and here we
can see that service you know d is
taking a long time to respond so you
need to implement something called
correlation ids to make this work it is
it's not a new concept JMS and
everything we've been using it for a
long time but in the Microverse world
it's still not used enough actually and
it's really hard to do this kind of
thing after the fact a couple of
projects ago I worked on and we have the
same mentioned we had a similar problem
where we four months was drop him off we
weren't sure where in the stack it was
so as a request came in it got found out
went to multiple downstream services so
we had to retrofit correlation IDs using
a young these filters in the end and in
spring but it was really hard work
where's now first thing we do we move
the micro Service Cloud things we put
the correlation IDs in straight away and
we're moving more towards so I say
Zipkin because like they've done some
great research Twitter and they've got
quite interesting information around
that to do that so appdynamics we've got
lots of money Zipkin if you haven't is
really good key thing as well is looking
at centralized logging and what I had
one class example where was and bringing
up something in the cloud and it was
dying and it was literally killing the
vm it was so bad my bad and so and the
problem was we had logs on the box so it
was like the perfect crime you know the
person was bitter the instance has been
killed logs would disappear you had no
idea of what's going on so then we move
to centralize logging we were using a
log stash of that
actually and there's many different
they're sort of competitors splunk and
so forth but logs actually really cool
and that you can sort of soon as an
instance comes up you point the instance
say all your logging do you know send it
to here and you have like a centralized
cluster collecting more logging logstash
she's got cabana which is on top of
elastic search which is really cool you
can do cool graphs and you can do cool
searching and if you've got your
correlation ids it allows you to also
search by a correlation ID and see the
lifetime journey through your stack as a
request comes in so you said I know this
coalition this ID went wrong why did it
go wrong and you can follow logging if
you imagine in the cloud and you're
spreading lots of things out you know
law s is aging into every box and
getting the logs it's just the killer
I've been I've done it and a sam newman
i didn't one of his recent talks some
people like use it ssh multiplexing you
guys seen that you are not a badass if
you use multiplexing it's not cool you
need to move some to centralize logging
it's really valuable and log stash is my
recommended to actually the current
thing you need to think as you move the
cloud exposing like i mentioned earlier
it's so easy to monitor a monolith but
when you go into the cloud and you
typically spread things out even if
you're not even if you're just working
with that monmouth you want to monitor
what's going on within your services and
i'm a big fan of cody hills metrics
awesome library and i know spring boo to
actually got it in there with their
actuator now so again i'm big fan of
spring spring boots and it comes sort of
for free within that which i'll talk a
bit more about a minute but i'm really
big fan now when i'm actually doing the
user stories when i'm working with the
business creating user stories i say not
only for the tech people but i also nast
the business people what kind of things
do you want to monitor and now that tech
people often say i want to monitor the
throughput of my cue i want to monitor
for services up if it's down the
business people often say or can we
monitor things like you know dollar per
minute on the checkout service can we
monitor basket sizes and obviously
there's a million different ways to get
this information you can use it your big
data approaches by analyzing logs
afterwards you can use google analytics
to note schattner do traffic and stuff
this is just another approach and but
there is a cool thing I'll show in a
second which kind of comes off this but
i definitely recommend it's a bit of a
paradigm shift but we found we do a lot
of them BDD type stuff now either 3m
egos and part of that process we often
say as part of your business you know
your function you want here what kind of
metrics what kind of key performance
indicators would you like as part of
that and definitely moving towards the
cloud i find this even more valuable at
a tech and a business level ed you've
also got their stats d and netflix got a
servo not be found a netflix server
there was talk of combining it with job
wizards metrics but the api's are so
different that one's kind of pink and
now so with ruby stuff we often use
let's see but and java stuff i typically
use em code hell stuff and spring
bootless a comes with that it's that
question we find that easy as tech guys
we discover is it's really good go back
to the business and say what's the
product was the actual engine user using
yeah yeah yeah yeahs that come you roll
up those those monitors that that
product actually uses those components
and now you provide one number free up
time
that products of how is this actually
affecting the end customer yeah that's
really really available yeah now based
one is that the product uh yeah yeah
better decisions totally totally yep
yeah there are this deafness is you know
terms of actually getting metrics and
things you can feed that back into your
decision-making process can you is so
valuable no great comment thank you and
definitely arson again it's one of the
game changes once you expose metrics
thinning in real-time and so forth or
even push back up is it's really
valuable to help the business make the
right decision health checks a vital
teen years ago towards the cloud some of
the clients ducting cameras and stuff
can be quite a femoral in nature amazon
rotten recycle instances you get a
warning you get an email for example if
they're going to terminate an instance
but some just even day to day stuff
things can go wrong but you need to know
if an instance is alive or not might be
say a low bouncer checking you know
whether the components alive and again
metrics comes with this health checks
out of the box really valuable stuff the
wii u's lost the Flies the gauges came
to the meters following on point there
in terms of a great things up and got to
find it what's actually happening in the
code so are you as a developer half-mad
these things in and add them at the
right points and expose them obviously
on a service in the quiet but it's
really valuable with this kind of stuff
so definitely few haven't looked at
kodells metric stuff check them out
later on and we kind of we did this
stuff and so when the business kind of
go into the whole metrics things we
started creating dashboards i can't show
you a real dash but i'm washing because
it was confidential information but and
we use I've forgotten what this is
called now here's a couple of contracts
ago but it really is PHP driven and it's
really cool it's kind of Microsoft the
look and feel which the business we work
with its I'm liked and we actually had
live stats kicking off in the company we
put them much like your build monitors
all around the office and the guys are
really loving this so I'm when we
actually kind of added stats you know in
almost real time we adding them to the
code and then pushing that out for our
pipeline and then you can actually see
new stats appearing and all this kind of
stuff it it triggered very much this
fast feedback loop and a fast
experimentation loop which ultimately
ads you know can add value it was a
start up at the time as well so they
were kind of still exploring their
business model so this
is really quite valuable for them and to
rule is about graphing is often the
start you thinking shall i graph stuff
I'm not grass stuff I've stolen this
wholesale from etsy etsy other leaders
in things like graphing a B testings if
you want to know more baby testing in
the cloud ezio awesome at that but
they're all that stuff from other guys
wholesale @ q con was if it moves graph
it if it doesn't move graph it anyway it
might just be taking a break so and it
often people too worried about
performance issues with graphing but you
can turn things on and off so I think go
heavy at the start of my recommendation
obviously its case by case basis
sometimes but i think you know go a bit
heavy and then you can always turn
things off and later on but having a
visibility at tech level in the claddagh
what's going was really valuable you're
kind of your operational overview if you
like and also from business view it is
really valuable as well right so aunty
presidency here we're doing then that
and this is the interesting thing with
the cloud i'm not sure how many of you
aware the concept of Angie Angie
frigidity in the UK were talking about
it quite a lot actually at the moment
but Adrian cockcroft has been talking
about from from netflix fame he's
actually moved on now but he was the
cloud architect in netflix and he's
doing a lot of talks all right in the
world actually but and there's a book by
nacim time and he's a prolific author
and it's not a tech book but it's an
interesting book he's done a couple
other ones called the Black Swan and
fooled by randomness he's kind of a
modern-day thinker but he talks at this
notion of anti fragile a team and an
agent is kind of spun it from a tech
point of view when you ask people and
what's the opposite of fragile they'll
typically say robust so if I stress
something it holds up its robust that's
good but actually they think about it
the opposite event of a fragile should
actually be anti-fraud shell if you
stress something it gets stronger now we
see this in nature all the time is in
honor of a keen runner when I go out you
know when training from a thought about
I've trained harder break my muscles
down so they build up stronger this is a
common thing you see in nature and it's
kind of the same thing with with Adrian
was pitching with the clouds it
shouldn't be enough that your service
just hold up when they're under heavy
load and you know you might be dropping
some connections but the whole thing
doesn't crash that's good really you
should be scaling to accommodate that
extra traffic and that's what the clouds
can give you this elasticity and its
really it's an interesting book it's
going to get the ideas you don't need to
really if you don't want to i quite
enjoyed i'm at half there's quite deep
towards the envelope still quite an
enjoyable read you the concepts netflix
are best in class
with this stuff so check out what
Netflix are up to and if you're gonna
look at this whole notion of antigen
fragility you do need to make your
system robust first and that's really
key and I don't know this book I saw
actually David in IBM yesterday talked
about this book it's an under red book
in my opinion it's about 10 years old
now so it's not particular the cloud but
Michael Nygaard here talks about how to
make production-ready software and he
talks about design patterns like
timeouts retries circuit breakers this
kind of thing now we're all familiar
with the strategy pattern the MVC
pattern we all use design patterns in
our day-to-day work but not many people
use these on a highly recommend reading
this book it's nigga it's not a thick
book by any means the pragmatic
programmers book so it's really quite
concise but very good and and I'll talk
about more about what those things are
in a second but there's also check out
the couple of slides here one from chris
richardson is very interesting last year
and month of netflix are out so that the
work they do around this thing so
retries i use something called guava
retrying by Ryan holder I'm sure many of
you might use google guava really cool
tool kit obviously a Java rate coming
out now some of those things have not
been not so useful anymore but I still
like Google guava and / till you when
i'm developing on java 6 or 7 its is
awesome and there's a fluent interface
for for building retries so if you were
on the cloud and you're talking to
another service you might want to retry
on certain exceptions if it's an i/o
exception retry five times and it's a
really nice fluid interface for and
defining that you know exceptions you
might want to retry on the stop strategy
you can exponentially back off retries
all this kind of thing and it's really
cool first point of call if you're
looking to get things and into this kind
of the cloud notion of services because
often you might be packaged in guava
already so it's very easy to package and
this this thing with it if you're going
to get more sort of brave flying it can
be a hard sell sometimes hystrix is
really cool and I'm sure many of you
have heard of the netflix open-source
libraries netflix have got about 40
projects or so forth now they've open
sourced as they've moved to the cloud
and there's some really cool stuff and
hysterics is one again the talk last
night was about this and but it's really
cause basically a circuit breaker
pattern so if something's failing say
it's an expanding here it's very easy in
the cloud you have lots of upstream
service is calling down to it and making
threads can block things can go horribly
wrong the
I deal with the circuit breaker much
like a circuit breaker in your home if
something electrical blows up it trips
the circuit so it doesn't blow up
everything so kind of isolates what's
going on and hysterics like it's really
useful as an extension to equal javanica
which is not very well-known but it's
really cool it allows annotations so
we've plugged in Java Nico with spring
boot and actually what some guys really
about how to do this and we're actually
writing a blog post on this as well it's
definitely worth checking out this blog
post using spring boot or drop wizard
that kind of thing you can now put
annotations so for example you have all
the benefits of a historic circuit
breaking it pulls threads if there's a
lot of cool stuff which I won't go into
too much detail but it also allows you
to have fallback methods so if something
over the wire fails you can sort of fall
back to something local say and now it
used to be based on the command pattern
so it could be quite verbose / ticking
in Java pre Java aids and but with the
annotations you can see here I've got my
top method there if it actually fails I
know it's it's a bit sort of loosely
typed the way actually works but it is a
fullback method here which is this
method so this method over the wire
fails or the circuit it stripped open it
will drop back to this one if this one
fails then you see it drops back this
one and you can have kind of hierarchy
it's quite good we'd use this a lot on
recommendations that's kind of a
canonical example we'll try to get em
customized ecommerce recommendations for
our current user if that fails we'll try
and get generic recommendations if say
popular items if that fails we'll just
return some random items so we use that
kind of thing quite a lot and it's quite
a find it quite valuable the hardest
thing is choosing what to fall back to
often and it's a bit of a mindset shift
when you do that but definitely you go
into the cloud is stuff is really
valuable because things do fail all the
time and you need to have some kind of
fallback mechanism also mention Adam if
you many of you developing a spring but
spring I a month ago released something
called spring cloud and it's an effort
to integrate the netflix open-source
libraries with spring spring boot and
it's still in its infancy there's still
a few rough edges to be honest a lot of
us have in the community of written
things on our own before that came out
but i'm definitely going to imagine a
lot these things will come together i'm
certainly certainly keen to contribute
as well and so i think there's gonna be
some standardization the netflix tools
for moving to the cloud are really
valuable but they don't they're built
with obviously netflix in mind so a lot
of people now are helping to make them
to the actual general use k
so I'm keen to get involved in that as
well and hopefully some of you are as
well so yeah check i'll put these slides
up but check out the links there for
those and so you'll remember in the
cloud and it's all distributed computing
and italy live a lot of young developers
just coming to the scene don't think
about this together used to developing
on the mac or whatever everything like i
mentioned earlier on is is so you know
nicely in case than the mac it's so
performant that when you move to a
distributed cloud-like environment it
can be a real shocker and there's the
classic article i think the eight
fallacies are distributed computing
which is like central reading in my mind
and it's referenced on this link here
and it's the classic things are people
forgetting about latency people are
forgetting that bandwidth all these kind
of things so yeah definitely rate you
know as part of a boot camp process
while i'm going into companies i'll
teach some about sort of distributing
computing principles and it's very often
you come a lot of problem problems when
you're developing in the cloud that have
actually been solved before in other
distributed computing problems so if you
know about sort of the background are
the fundamentals if you like of
distributed computing it can be really
valuable when you move to the cloud so I
think it's saying where I learnt more
back to the fundamentals of Java that's
really helped my day-to-day job
development think that's quite analogy
there for that and that's this is talk
about robustness but you want to go to
the whole anti virginity the next level
do check your business goals and what
are you looking to do what is the
business looking to do is it a simple
lift and shift no an Oracle of talking a
lot by this for their keynote earlier in
the week about the shifter pass and it's
not going to be as easy as perhaps
pitched I think you know that's my
opinion obviously not non-employee vocal
wisdom the lift and shift is tricky I've
been involved in some of these and some
people want to a client hybrid thing
where some things are we in the cloud
some things will be in their data center
and people like the startups and the
netflix of the world are going cloud
native and then proper taking advantage
of the actual underlying platform but
you need to check what your goals are
and how far down you want to go some of
these and these things there's lots of
interesting things around the whole
designing for distributed computing an
archive and with the time left i'm
fortunate can dive into it in lots of
detail but again i put some reference to
hopefully they're kind of pointers for
yourselves to go in and look later
there's this whole notion it's very
tricky when you're used to developing on
the data center you're used to
transactions you're used to acid
Tomic consistent I sled durable it's not
so easy in their cloud people are
pitching the acronym base which is
basically available soft state eventual
consistency as it kind of as a yeah
almost an opposite or opposing thing
with with acid and it's a real mindset
shift you know you so often when you
want to do a whole group of things
together across all these services in
the cloud you you want to do a
transaction and then you start looking
at distribute transactions XTA and it
just gets really complex my advice is
don't do that have a read around some of
these articles here and think more about
how can I make these things eventually
consistent does it really matter if
things aren't done in one transaction
sometimes it does some of the money
stuff what I deal with for sample must
be done it transactions then I try to
bring it all into one service but if
it's across and it's a bit of a mindset
shift yeah moving more move more towards
eventual consistency so you're not
guaranteed if you write something you're
not guaranteed to read it back
necessarily straight away typically
though my experience you do is in with
the latency delays but having a look at
the soft state within the base there is
clever caching is really valuable but do
read up on this lot of problems I go in
to fix are the result of bad caching so
you need to monitor your cashiers as I
mentioned earlier in terms of monitoring
your the turnover because the classic
thing is you know there's two difficult
problems in computer science cash
exploration and naming so caching is
really you know you need to monitor it a
lot and get a feel for what's actually
happening because it's so easy to have
stale data which can throw off the whole
application but you do need to get good
at cashing if you want to do that hole
in the cloud you want to save services
the dying still serve cache responses
back you need to think about that quite
a lot elastic scaling is awesome when
I've actually got first time I got at
work and I was like yeah we got to work
in an Amazon project hold team normal
kind of claim credit for it was whole
team of us go to working and when we saw
traffic increasing on our monitoring and
we saw boxes spinning up and we saw
traffic being low bounce there's boxes
we were all just like whew this is super
cool is the whole we know proper and
rigidity in operation there and but
things we learnt about was having
stateless components we had a couple of
comedy incidents where and things were
holding state so it was I think it was
5050 and when you put something in your
shopping basket when you came back to
site would you see it again that's like
rolling the dice every time because
we didn't we made its ludmila stateful
and you can even do tricks like you can
you know do I was it session affinity
that kind of thing but I wouldn't
recommend that if you can make things
stateless there's lots of tricks to that
cookies you know passing cookies through
into the back end loading state from
data stores but there's a whole bunch of
blog posts out there around designing
stateless microservices which I think
recommend you have a look at if you want
if you're doing that kind of thing and
do Schmidty caches are really good again
I had another comedy instant where we
people having their own cash for it so
they spin up lots of instances low
bounce across all those instances but
every instant hat instance had its own
cache of course there was that every
instance had to be born with effectively
whereas if you have a distributed cache
doesn't matter if things that are in the
front here come up and down the cash is
always going to be hot so that's one
thing we learn quickly move the caches
off the box we put them on the on the
box thinking it'd be fast in terms of
the application can talk with cash
really fast and some cases that that's
actually a valid use case but in ours it
wasn't it and typically the ones I've
looked at we actually move the caches to
a cluster memcache d we like reddish
quite a lot they read it is difficult to
cluster sometimes and but it keeps the
cash is constantly warm and you can grow
that cash as well and in the cloud
dynamically which is nice have a look at
things like asynchronous communication
and i'm not sure if any of you heard of
seek urs but i'm really going to seek
urs lately and an event sourcing as well
be fully buzzword compliant but NC QRS
fundamentally just a fancy term for
splitting your reads in your rights and
the commands basically say would be
rights and the queries are obviously
your reads but if you have a look at
lots of documentation out there as a
cool framework called the axon framework
which is really really questioning we're
using that and a current project
actually as a java spring based
framework which you can leverage great
we're at the box and it does the cqs
things but the only being is commands
are going to be asynchronous and but the
queries you might actually the command
my trigger an update say and then
asynchronously you can note notify
several data stores so we for example
have a neo4j graph for querying
recommendations we have a used nailing
my sequel postgres for normal things but
we have several data stores keyed to the
query so we know that the wreck
is really good with neo we know that my
sequel is give the workload the
workhorse kind of thing but this this
this pattern allows you to split and
sort of modify the query separately from
the commands I probably haven't done
that justice and in the full talk there
but check it out it's worth having a
read and the axon framework is really
worth having a look as well is something
we've got into recently but it's really
cool so that's it I think no we didn't
bring it on yup so we been quiet you
know cloud apps or the last like three
or so years we've come to think that
this is our guideline now when we're
starting a new project when we're
wrapping a project up we just run
through have we documented things have
we got the architecture right you know
people coming on board later on will
they understand all the operational risk
as we've split bears things out and are
we highly cohesive and loosely coupled
all the way down through the stack right
from the API you know the entry points
right the way down through to the you
know to the data stores at the end and
have we tested it is it automated from
commit to cloud as I like says my buzz
word there and when I you know when
something when a change is made is it
verified that it will work in a cloud
like environment it's really valuable
the whole notion of containers
integration if you want to push it to
continuous delivery I think awesome and
I think it is the future but it were not
all ready for that yet so the continuous
integration up to up to that onto the
cloud it's really cool the actual
deployment alive that's your choice you
do need a bit of an education program in
terms of the next to making developers
aware of the resources the underlying
fabric you're deploying on to you know
the I ops I mentioned the network
throughput when you're building your
systems think about that the caching all
those kind of things you need to make
sure it's monitored and that this is
more price for your ops people but it
definitely influences the depth as well
as MZ you can expose now metrics as
you're splitting things up as you're
going to the cloud and even if you're
not splitting things up if you're
lifting and shifting I highly recommend
getting more monitoring in there because
the cloud is a bit more fickle my little
tiger my cheetah joke you know the
client is a bit bit more fickle so get
some monitoring in there early and it
will it'll pay dividends later and this
whole notion of aunty for agility that's
really where the power of the cloud lies
in my mind but it comes with a different
set of rules so as developers we need to
learn those like I mentioned a few sort
of tips and techniques hopefully around
that but have
read because it is a new platform it's a
very powerful platform but it really is
a paradigm shift and there's some really
cool things up and coming at you end the
micro service and domain is a chemical
may sauce which is really cool cool
which I'm looking at more an hour with
this notion of servant efficiency plays
into that I think the future is
definitely going to more towards the
paths and the kind of you know just or
even a little bit like a dupe with the
yarn you have a series of resources and
you might say just deploy a micro
service or a data store onto a platform
and it gets resource provisioned
automatically but this notion amount
rigidity is really important how your
design and how you connect those things
together so thanks very much for
listening thanks for time appreciate I
am competing with lunch as well and
obviously on the one talking up here but
the team back home back in the UK open
credo there they're awesome like about
40 50 of us we constantly challenged
guidance our feedback and so much so as
much time the one taking all the glory
presenting as an awesome team behind me
and I really appreciate all their effort
and helping me do these things and thank
you very much if anyone's got any
questions feel free to like chat might
now or come and find me out but i'll be
around the conference as well so you can
tweet at me or whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
