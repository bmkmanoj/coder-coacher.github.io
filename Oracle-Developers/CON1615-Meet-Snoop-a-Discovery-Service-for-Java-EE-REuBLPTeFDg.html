snoop discovery service for Java EE it's
pretty cool to be able to come to Java
one and present your own little pet open
source project but it's it's going to be
fun so Who am I I've been coding Java
since 1995 I done it professionally
since the 98 I work for a company called
Cybercom in MA rumor in Sweden I do
consulting there and speaking at
conferences like this one and I see
these photos are starting to get off
updated so if you take any today just
tweet into me or something so I can
optimal slides from new photos that we
appreciate it I'm a member of the JCP
and in the experts group for JMS and
embassy and also security API for Java
EE so the agenda for this presentation
is first to go through a little bit
about service discovery just to make
sure that we're on the same page and and
so we can talk the same language and
then I'll introduce snoop with some
slides and a couple of code samples and
if time allows we'll dive into the
internals of snooping and see how it's
actually done so if you're going to
remember one thing from this session it
is at an able snoop client that is the
single most important thing I'm going to
talk about today it's an annotation as
all of you need to get started with snip
so remember this one I'll repeat it make
sure
but before we go into details of Snoop
let's talk a little bit about discovery
and look up of micro services and and
everybody talking about Mike services
does some kind of definition about Marco
services so we're talking about the same
thing and in my view Mike services about
designing an application as a sweet or
small services that build around
business capabilities or serving one
domain in short and Marcus service does
one thing and it does it very well and
it's often exposed through a REST API to
the application or the other services
that come to consume this micro servers
so what's the other way of building an
application limp if you don't do
microservices then it's probably a
monolithic approach and it's nothing bad
about monoliths and a month left is not
only one big chunk of code like this
figure here it could be layered and it
would be structured in a good way and
you can have services and everything and
but it's all tied together and deployed
as one unit and in most cases a
monolithic approach is probably the best
way to go and and there are several
people out there recommending that you
actually start with the monolith and
then we factor it into Mike services as
you go if you need it so to contrast
this and look at how is microservices
then the in this example you have a
service a service be and also we see
that does typical things for these
services and then you have the
application that calls these services
but by doing this approach you actually
haven't received very much because you
still are pretty tight coupled to the
services you you have to know where they
are and how to call them
so that is why we introduce a discovery
service and as you see in this animation
the services AP and see registers
themselves with the discovery service so
that the discovery service were know
where to find it and then the
application can do a lookup for for
example service aid with the discovery
service get a reference to it and undo
actual call to service a and the same
way it can do a lookup to service be and
then do the actual call to be a known at
all and if one of the services should go
down for some reason like like service
be does here then when the application
calls discovery service 22 says give a
reference to be it won't get in a
reference to B because b isn't there
anymore and it won't call it and it has
to handle the situation when the service
isn't available and that is where snoop
comes in we've established that micro
services or an architecture based on
micro services requires some kind of
look of service where the services can
register themselves and look up other
services so if we dive into snoop and
look at the background how do I come up
with this idea actually because it's
nothing the discovery service mechanism
is nothing new and it's nothing i would
take credit for any way but if we look
at a service from the spring cloud
services that is donated by netflix to
the open source community is service
called eureka and I'll show demo of your
rig afterwards and in Eureka it's
amazingly how little you actually need
to do to get the great support of
discovery mechanism and and I thought
that Eureka was so cool
originally just created snoop as a demo
for a DevOps presentation and then it
involved into a separate project so if
we look at the Eureka discovery service
in spring boats you simply annotate the
application with at enable Eureka client
and then the magic happens and then what
that was when I thought that wouldn't it
be cool if we had this in Java EE and
there it's where soup comes in so snip
does exactly the same thing that Eureka
does for spring boot applications only
for java ee application and it only uses
the existing Java EE technologies who
don't need to add any extra dependences
you're running in the Java EE ecosystem
and in future releases of snow but
probably wanna make it possible to build
the applications up on other
technologies that isn't necessarily java
ee based and and provide a rest
interface for these to register
themselves but that is future it's no
functionality
sorry if it go into the philosophy
behind snoop and there are four key
words is lean it's non intrusive it's
intuitive and it's configurable and the
most important in my opinion here is the
non intrusive I don't want my
application to be dependent on which
discovery services actually uses so I
want it to be as simple as possible to
just add snoop support and then have it
there without having to rewrite how my
application doesn't look for services
and it's lean as you'll see Snoop is a
such as two artifacts which is actually
a third one I'll show later but there is
the the core functionality of Snoop is
in a jar file which is its 9.6 case so
it's not very big all right and it
relies on java ee r web idea so it needs
to be run in a java ee container
otherwise you would have to provide that
functionality for it
so how do I do this new service
registration them yes
the question is if Snoop must run in the
same container as application or if it
can run separately and the answer is it
run separately otherwise it wouldn't
make very much sense for the microsomes
approach so thank you let's get the
service registration I suddenly
mentioned there is an ad enables new
client annotation and it hasn't had to
be called service name so you just give
your service a name in this case hello
and that's it none of the Becker
mechanisms of smoke will register this
one with the the snoop registry based on
a little configuration which I'll come
back to a more complete example is or
this is actually a totally complete
example a typical place you put your at
a naval snoop client annotation is in
the application convey or the
application class for Jack Soros since
most likely you will have a rest service
and you will have this closet in in your
application it doesn't need to be there
it just has to be somewhere in your code
base this is a place to put it
so service registration is pretty easy
but we also need to be able to find them
again to do look up I'm surprisingly
enough it's just the same way it's an ad
snoop qualifier with the service name
and you just name the service you want
to look up and the complete example is
that you have an injection and you
qualify with it at snoop service name
hello and you have a client for your
service this isn't enough now we can
register the services and we can look at
them up but we also need to be able to
call them right so that's where this new
service client content and if you
remember from the the injection worry we
did look up the thing that is actually
returned based on this qualifier it's
the snip service client and this snoop
service client can be used to do the
calls to the actual service and you may
choose the the more low lower level
approach and just get the service root
of your service and then do the jacks
rest client as you normally would do and
I've also added a couple of a
convenience method like simple get it
just takes in the path to the service
you didn't get on and again an optional
response black it requires java 80s and
and since it returns an optional
response that means that the response
may be empty if the service isn't there
and only the application can handle it
very nicely but if you don't want to
like do this and you want to do the the
more low-level approach you just get the
service arisen undo the injector as cold
as you would do
because this these simple get put and
delete methods comes with a little cost
because they actually do a look up and
get the config so it implies an extra
call but you also get the security that
is actually validates if the service is
up and running and you can handle it
that will not be supported at the moment
but that is something I'm looking into i
also want to have the question was was
if what happens if you register multiple
services with the same name and
currently that is not supported but my
plan is to add support for to have
multiple instances of a service but the
same name will just mean that if you
have multiple instances of the same
server side yeah it could be versions as
well so versioning could be a future
thing to add no it the last one the last
service registers will answer so a
complete example of how to use the
simple get method is that you will just
do the simple get hello resource and in
this case are just filter if I get a 200
back then I'll read the energy which is
in this case as a string otherwise i'll
just write goodbye but this will this
will depend on how your service actually
is yes
yeah the question is when is the actual
lookup Tom and and look up is done at in
the action but if you do the simple get
method you will do a you will get the
configuration again so you don't do the
same look up but you'll get the changes
in configuration if it's put another
place
the question is if this service requires
some kind of alive api and i'll show how
it works basically live when a service
registers is registers with a socket
connection and just the things that i'm
a large every 10 second or it's
configurable powerful so yes so but to
get this tied together there will be
some basic configuration and this
configuration is a pretty flexible and
I'm thinking of doing it more
dynamically in the future on can get rid
of some of the properties but as you see
there aren't very many and currently I
support if you add a system property
that have profit preference over the
others like it minus D something when
you start the job process all right well
if it doesn't find it there it will look
for environment variable and it doesn't
look there look in a a configuration
file and a configuration file would be
perfectly fine if we run it in your IDE
for example for debugging an environment
variable is perfect if we weren't in dr.
and then if you run it as a standalone
javed process you probably have system
properties then we can configure it for
different environments but but I will
look into how this configuration is
working you know I probably should look
at the Apache tamiya project as well so
so we'll see what you can do the
configuration that Snoop needs this is
exactly only the Yama file let's for
four parameters is a host where the
service is running a support is running
on and it's the root for the service it
exposes and also it needs a host for the
snip service where it registers is
itself
that and that's basically the four
parameters and some of them I should be
able to read dynamically and so the
route changes in the future business
service is the actual service the
discovery service and this is back to
your question adverts that the the
registration of the services registers
over a WebSocket protocol with this new
discovery service and the lookup
currently is done over HTTP and then the
calls to the different services don't
know also after rest calls over HTTP yes
it's going in the service that it needs
it or in the application that needs to
look it up but I'll get it on the next
slide actually because now it's time for
a demo so first I'll just
this
first I'd like to just show you the
Eureka so we have something we can use
as a basis font so a Eureka client
typically I know there is a bug in that
means when you enhance the fonts you may
get problems but let's see if it works
so
look bad Rika first
a typical Eureka service would look like
this it has the the enabler rica server
annotation and that's all you need to to
run an irregular in the same way it's a
client to eureka will have this enable
rica client annotation and this is where
I got the inspiration from so if I start
up this the Eureka service it takes a
while to start but that's pretty fast
and you say what what ring guys like is
the ascii art most important so let's
see so when when you Rick I started this
windows killing
we can do the same with the the Eureka
client if you look at the Eureka server
you'll see that there are no instances
currently available with Eureka default
it has a time out of 30 seconds so after
30 seconds it should be able to register
itself Eureka offers more functionality
than than Snoop you can do all kinds of
information about the services so it's a
more mature project so if you're doing
anything in production you probably
should go with Eureka but if you want to
do something for fun you should go with
Snoop so there it's a says register so
just reload the page and you see here my
application has been registered so
Eureka is pretty flexible it's just a
couple of annotations on the cell phone
working so that's more or less the
inspiration I had for grading snoop
so let's go back to the snip code
so if you look at a typical snip service
it will have the provided java 7
dependency and it have the slim person
is using and i also have a doctorate the
second pillar docker image from my maven
bomb and in in dr. i set the environment
variables so these will be environment
variables and they will override the
configuration that is built into the
service so if you're running in my ID
I'll probably run it on localhost with
these properties here but if I run it in
docker all you see the environment
prophetess will override the please
we're going and just start the service
it also runs in docker and this is a
docker image built on glassfish for
actually for up one but it runs in while
flying any other java ee 7 complaint
server small and as you see I've got the
ascii art it's important so as I say now
snoop services up and running and there
is a simple web interface for it and it
runs in my docker container yeah and as
you see there are no registered service
yet and that's because I haven't saw
anyone right so if we go in and take the
the hello service that I showed you and
start it then I also run out in docker
just just because I don't want to mix up
all the ports I'll run something locally
so that's all and here we say there are
some it's not easy to read that's it
there are some green message in saying
here hey harem I and and if you
recognize these these are the
properties that were actually sent from
the profile and in the snoop service you
can see that hey I got the service and
now right now we set up to do a little
pink every 10 second so it always knows
how this up now if I go into the service
you can see here is my hello service so
it's registered with smoke
ok
and but so now I have a service register
up and running and I have a Mahalo
service that registers itself there then
I want to have an application that
actually consumes this a lot of service
and that is why I have a Hello service
and this one is also a job is Evan
application and in this one I'm actually
using the new embassy framework for the
UI and I have the the new client then
here we see it's not the only this new
contention is this new client which is
even lighter than the snoop because the
client is included in a snoop but I
don't need this one to be able to
register yourself it's just going to the
lookup I full look at the code where I'm
doing it um having the application
config file he doesn't have any snoop
configuration is all because this is not
a snip service right but the the hello
world does the injection of the snoop
services and here you can see I inject
one hello service and I want world
service and then I just create a
greeting where I concatenate these and
just return it to the hello world JSP
and it is a this is a controller class
in the new MVC framework to run this one
run this in netbeans and I'm running on
pyara the latest which released
yesterday I think you see it returns a
lot and if I look at the actual page
showing this
here's a hello Paige was it just
displays the greeting
and if I now take down the hello service
say that out it went opened fire and
this one read right goodbye and that is
why this one says if I don't get it on
your back or the service is down or for
some reason I don't get a response or
occupied
then a you're screwed so you actually
want to have like multiple instances of
Snoop servers as well and a feature of
Eureka which is pretty cool is that if
you reeka sees that it's alone it will
give you a warning and say hey I'm alone
give me another of me and that's
something I want to be learning to snoop
as well so you have alternatives if it's
not oh sorry yeah pillow so let's start
up the hell of service again under i
think i forgot to show you the code for
the hello service so you'll believe me
but the hello actually configuration is
just this enable so client and it just
has a resource that returns a lot
there's no magic there i also have a
this world service which is exactly the
same actually it registers itself as
world and it has a world resource that
we don't world so if i start both the
the hello service and also start the
world service these are running in
docker avoid fly images so i'm i'm
running the hello sir reason dr. bot fly
9 and they hope world service in in what
fly aight just there's something
different and if i look at these nip
service now you'll see that I both have
hello and world and all these are
communicating with Snoop all the time
and it gets this hey I'm alive message
every chance again
tiff and I'll go and call the hello
world service it was hello world magic
but everything can't be run in docker
containers and everything doesn't need
one to be run in in application servers
so I thought it would be cool to support
something like wine flights floor I've
been very used what was for more her
about it yeah cool then i just added a
snoop swarm or effect and that is
actually just a palm file that takes in
a couple of the premises it takes in the
the snoop and it takes in the stuff from
java 7 that it actually needs and then I
can have a swarm example that text in
the superstorm pom file which is just a
collection of the premises and also add
jax-rs because it's a rest service and I
usually the swamp log in to package it
and say here that I want to run it on
board eight and nine three I can also do
that with system properties but Hera do
it in palm phone and the actual code is
exactly the same as the the hello and
world service I have the added naval its
new client and I just returned business
javaone and I don't know if swarm if a
swarm of wild fly up with that sound
anything or if it's if that quite would
think bees or something so
so and if I want to run this valve a
swarm I just run I'll just clear return
I just run it and in this case I
actually give one of the parameters
listen if service where it should
register itself but it doesn't give it I
don't give the other parameters because
they say these are red from the default
snoop yomim file which is in the
application and it happens to be the
same port and everything so I can mix
and match where I put the proctors we're
here i use this the system properties to
make sure that it's this one that is
used you see if i look in the the
configuration file in this form this
could actually have been a local host or
whatever it depends on where i run the
service in that particular environment
to start on this one it's a simple java
jar and I point to the hello swarm with
the swarm network yeah slowly it says
dash swarm at the end of it so so it
differed you can see this swamp log in
it creates a war file so it's a this
would perfectly run in in wildflower
wherever I could just dump it in any
application server but he also creates a
jar file which packages this work
together with the stuff from wildfire
that a nice run and that's the file I'm
running here I haven't been able to get
this green nice outfit for the
registration here yet but we'll see if
we can do that so it says that it starts
up and let's see if it has registered
itself here you can see in log sent
message it gets in something from swore
i can see in the web interface that this
won't services there as well so if you
want to run in in in stuff like what was
warm you can run
like that and as I said the plan is to
support spring booth and spring
applications and other kinds of things
as well and you can see that it
registers itself at locals while the
other ones runs in dr. but I need to do
to call their service because my low
service doesn't know about this yet it
just right in the world and that is a
simple ass for going here I could change
the Anita injected at the new service
this is done for just copying and it
call it swarm and collect swarm service
and then I can do the call that I need
this war I think the resource was hello
there as well and i'll just add it to
the response
but as y flye say if they don't save is
something else keep it ample empty all
right a couple of dashes then I'll just
rebuild this one
I notice that everybody is using
intelligence talks down on netbeans but
the netflix guys we don't bother we just
know it's better so and here is it
returns a strong responses all so it
wasn't very many lines of code that it
actually had to add I just had to make
sure the service was there at knowing
what it's called and the culture it and
here I'm using these simple convenience
methods the configuration for the client
is simpler than the for the services
registered zones because the only thing
I need to know about here is where do I
find the snoop service where do I look
for my services and then I need to know
the name of my services
so how is all this done them how can I
just by adding a simple annotation
gather everything over this open working
well let's have a look at the snoop
internals what Snoop uses is something
called CDI extensions and that's a
simple class that extends extension
which is a part of the service provider
in faith for CDI and there I have some
code black methods where I observe
events and this is where the magic
happens I observe the with the
annotations add an of naval snoop client
and I just pick out the the name it's
registered with and that's it then it it
has a registration client but when when
that will start up it's a single done
and it's a WebSocket endpoint a client
I'm point for this one at initialization
gets the service name that has been
discovered by CDI and then reads in the
properties ensure that it's pretty
simple i'm using optionals all the way i
see it do I find this the system
properties if I don't find it get the
environment prop this if I don't find it
get it from the compression file
and the other stuff is just to register
itself with send a WebSocket message to
snoop and have a timeout but it senses
health update and the timer is set to do
that every 10 seconds so that actually
is these two classes are everything
what's new bit so the coral Snoop is
actually they see the I extension of a
couple of lines Center and this is a
pretty the i discovered this last week
when i was doing this demo because
nothing would work and when jdk 8 after
sixty came it revealed a bug in weld so
if you in line less and just do it
rightly here it won't run so you
actually need to assign this local
variable first and then really call it
was kind of hard to find on an airplane
with no Wi-Fi but as soon as i go to
hotel it was pretty easy and they client
side of snoop it's more or less the same
these are color coded properties aren't
use anymore but what there is is there
is a producer for the snoop annotation
it's nicole fire so when you do the
injection it will actually get the the
configuration from from snoop and just
injected aim
and unload the properties from the
property file is actually exactly the
same called us the other one and in
innocent of service clients it will the
get service root method just gets a
route from from the dexterous client and
there's simple methods actually do they
cost it's not very much do it
working on time
so that was the code mo all they all
point to the URL or can find the
examples if you want to do that
afterwards what I did was to run a
smooth discovery service it runs in da
koranda glassfish for dot one I had the
hello service which I rani also in dr.
and wide by 5 &amp;amp; a 9 and I had the world
service in dr. Anwar plate I tried to
get get it running in not in other
application service as well but I didn't
have time to get it work so stick you
were offline and also did the swarm
visit service in what was warm and then
I run the hello world application in
pyara for loved one so his sermon up
the important thing is how to get
started with snoop and first of all you
need to just add the moment dependences
so you have have it they have a stuff
available and currently its version 1 30
it was released this morning it's
available in maven Central's who don't
have any don't need any reverse
reconfiguration just to add the
dependency and it will fix it for you
then you need to snoop enable the
service that you want to be able to look
up and that is the enable snoop client
and rotation with the service name I'm
just put it somewhere in the code but
somewhere you can find it again so
doesn't matter where it is and then you
need to configure the service and if we
run it locally do it in the yomim file
other words within the doctor
configuration or in this is the
properties when you start your
application and you need to configure it
the application so he knows where to
find the Sin observers
and all this documentation and the
samples you can find on the github repos
the sample applications docker images
are available on docker hub and also the
snip service is available there so if
you go to the Y it up rapper you'll find
links to the how to run the docker
images and it's I just have to remember
to upload the latest version later
tonight but they are running examples
that out there so if we want to just
tetra try it out just download the the
the example hello world application
someone running and dr. so remember the
outer naval snoop client that's the
important thing that's actually all you
need to get started remember how to name
a new client just google it or we go to
get up and you'll find it
the what's the advantage of this new
client
it
yeah okay so the question is what is the
benefit of this new client you can use
it during the i right yeah yes you can
use at Jenga if you're running in the
same application server but if you're
not running in the same application
server and you won't be able to do that
and this is this is to decouple the
services from each other but
microservices is more complex than doing
it in a as a one application so it
solves the the coupling you don't have
to hard code where the services are in
your application you can use a look of
Maximus
yeah ok so the endpoints don't change
but what if you scale up and you change
your IP address or you want to have a
new version and a new deployed in
another machine or you go through the
cloud or whatever so so having a
discovery mechanism is also also it's
always good thing to do don't rely on
that this IP address is actually always
answering ok yes
yeah so so the question is regarding if
snook should be a load balancer or not
actually or how would we be solved done
and I don't think snoop should be a load
balancer I think you should I haven't
thought about it very much but I think I
would do it in some sort of way that it
if a client comes in and asks for inhale
of service and Snoop knows about it and
it's just return it and if one other
service happens to be down or it doesn't
answer us or a maybe some priority
parameter animal
I'm not sure yet Eureka doesn't do this
as far as I know they use other spring
cloud services so i will probably have
another load balancing service in front
and just just used as a snoop as a
simple lookup service and that is all it
should do actually I don't want to build
load balancing entered
ok I think that is more of a problem how
to develop your services it's not
actually the look of mechanism
yeah the question is how will snoop
handle multiple instances that register
yourself and right now it doesn't
support it and and the implementation
today is actually it will just take the
last one and that is not a good approach
and but it's not final
I
the question is if it will work as a
register for web services and yes it
will actually do but you won't be able
to use the snoop service client because
that only support the rest but if you
want to have you can inject it a hand
and have the service rhetoric or
whatever but in my personal opinion I
wouldn't go the the subway anyway so but
yeah yeah yeah yeah but but it shouldn't
be that hard to add so so you're welcome
to forget then we can work together on
it okay so regression is using hazel
cast for replication of snoops over say
oh that's interesting I haven't thought
about it yet
okay so the question is why Snoop at all
because there are so many other good
services out there and yeah yeah
basically I did it because I thought it
was cool I liked Eureka and I wanted to
have something the same way in Java EE
and so I just did it I would never at
this point recommend anyone to do this
in production because it not production
ready but it's a pretty cool thing to
play around with and with some effort
from the community and and if we put
some effort into it we could make it to
face all dishes you've mentioned today
and make it production ready but right
now it wouldn't be this latest version
is not operable with Rica I did have a
version previously that actually
interrupt the could communicate with the
Eureka as well because Eureka has a
pretty decent rest api you can use to
register services with so it's pretty
easy to register with Eureka just use an
arrest so I actually had a unable to
Eureka client annotation that did the
rest registration but I've taking it out
because I won't just have snoop doing
snoop stuff okay
no more questions so that's all i had
today and I thank you for coming and
it's a pleasure and good discussions I
like these in formal presentations work
and actually have questions it's a good
thing thank you and I'll be around for
the rest of the conference and just
contact me if you want to have any any
questions or comments or anything and if
you want to do some development using
snoop in the haka garden I'll be happy
to set it up as well thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
