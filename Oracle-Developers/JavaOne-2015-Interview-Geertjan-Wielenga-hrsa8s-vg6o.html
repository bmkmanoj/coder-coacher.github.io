us today for another job of 1 2015
interview i'm david lopez and i'm here
today with your job who is among many
things a product manager for netbeans a
writer and a java one speaker Lujan
thank you for joining me today thanks
for having me excited to be here excited
to have you so could you give us a brief
overview of NetBeans for those people
who might not have heard of it before
maybe a little netbeans day and is that
a certain type of vegetable there what's
going on there well only things is a
primarily a development environment
originally forgot her increasingly
assertive crypt and all about as soon as
you've downloaded it and installed it
you can do as a development correct
other applications and now can also
create complete sites there's lots of
tools for JavaScript and HTML and so on
and what's new is that in the next
release netbeans ide a top one the focus
is on edge is back-end JavaScript
development which you can now also do in
netbeans and you can use the Express
framework which is commonly used with no
Jas for front-end development on top of
them and us back in so that's really the
main focus of what we working on
fulfilling this release and so yeah your
question about NetBeans day so every
year at javaone we start off with
netbeans day and we've been having a lot
of nikki's mean time between last year's
net means day and and this one in
different countries so we had one in the
netherlands one of the UK there's been
some in germany things like that and so
nipping stays kind of the big event be
or where we get together and present the
latest features and we meet the
community and community members talk
about what they're doing with netbeans
for example people from NASA come and
talk and NATO and the kinds of
organizations and the show a large
software development projects that are
correct so it's going to be a really
good good event again this year also
partly because we have a new book about
NetBeans to be published by a press and
it will be available by the family and
we have to have one so it'll be a good
yvette it's a prince es a year of java
so
to be a you know one of the highlights
of the of the jackhammer of the past few
years well sounds very exciting and I
know you're actually presenting in a
number of sessions of this year's Java
one could you tell us a little bit about
some of those yes well um what I really
enjoyed getting is getting people
together and presenting together with
them rather than one person speaking for
an hour on their own so there's a bunch
of sessions where I'm basically the
motor with was four or five other people
so yeah I'm doing a session with a bunch
of people from Nessa about advanced
space and defense operations driven by
Java definite beans age so this is calm
3739 and so this is sean phillips and a
bunch of nasa related engineers talking
about their projects using javafx and
netbeans ide and then that means
platform and another topic where there's
a whole bunch of different speakers is a
common 708 moving enterprise data from
jeff rita j feature to javafx charts so
here the focus rear is on a specific sub
string so instead of doing a session
talking about mutants vintage javafx
kettle focus is on data related and draw
for late such components that are
typically done in jfreechart in swing
and how to use that kind of data that
kind of gooey components to to jakarta
sex charts so it's really very specific
and narrow topic within the world of
migrating from soon to jump FX then
there is another topic con 7047 what the
JavaFX so again a bunch of different
people talking about their experiences
from from moving from swing to javafx
the personal experiences and lessons
they've learned and tips and tricks and
insights and lots of demos so all three
of these are ready different judge as
that's gone 373 9700 8 and 7 l 47 I
really enjoy the desktop type talks and
that's kind of what I'm focused on
myself a lot on I'm collecting large
enterprise application
geospatial met defense for aerospace
applications on top of the NetBeans
infrastructure but aside from that and
there's also a bunch of topics that are
giving about the new JavaScript
ecosystem with in the enterprise world
so basically asking the question doesn't
make sense the JavaScript development in
the enterprise and is JavaScript only
useful for very small application for
small mobile phone type apps or can you
create real enterprise applications and
what does that mean and what are the
requirements how do you do magic with
JavaScript how do you do all kinds of
things what are the concerns that you
have in the enterprise world and how
does someone coming from a Java
background map their existing knowledge
and their existing frameworks and skill
sets and the Institute to the
JavaScript's equivalence and is of
course a lot of solution so for these
typical problems like modularity and you
know it's a repeating CSS you can use
JavaScript Philip body you actually
don't need to use CSS you can actually
use other script even for your styling
and unhiding and loading of content so
these kinds of interesting new questions
is what these topics will be focusing on
so in particular i'm doing a common 77
67 html5 and JavaScript clients in an
enterprise application world and so so
they're these kinds of these kinds of
topics will be discussed and I'm looking
forward to a lot of discussion as well
there's also another session coding for
desktop and mobile with html5 and Java
and a session at open world called
embracing JavaScript and so so in all
these different topics were purposely
really focused on Java developers
fermenting with angular and different
frameworks in the JavaScript space and
the kinds of questions they might have
and different solutions for that well
thank you so much for sharing and I know
you do a lot of conferences but to kind
of
take us out here could you tell us a
little bit about what you like
specifically about javaone what keeps
bringing you back the other one is
definitely the main conference of the
the Java can literally experts are there
a lot of reese's of different software
products including F beans are really
geared around net agree and around Java
ones when javaone happens you'll find a
whole bunch of different software
products being released also books being
released like the NetBeans book for the
first time and because everyone is there
I know its massive and you know it'll be
a speaker that you know about very
expert in what if java like you've never
heard of is going to be there and it's a
great vibe and of course not selected
sessions themselves which are a very
high quality but also meeting people in
the in the corridors as you're going for
one session to the other that's more
valuable even that in sessions
themselves you know people that you meet
in all the bars around the Moscone
conference center are filled with Java
programmers during that week in the
evenings as OS parties on different
topics different organizations set up
parties there's a JCP party that's a
much desired hot party to go to hell and
but this is how much of parties going on
and you gather and you see the people
that you've been reading books by and
give been using their libraries and
things like that and it's been 30 people
randomly as your ordering a drink and
you have great conversations it's really
the value of any conference of course
but Java one is the place where big
announcements are made as well you know
this big Oracle key notes where oracle
announced is the latest stuff in the
direction for Java in combination with
with apt for the coming years so it's
really a deep place to be well thank you
again for joining us ubuntu mature sure
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
