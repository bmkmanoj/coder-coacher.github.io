this talk and just play it remotely so
have fun with that now actually it's
much more fun if I i'm going to talk so
the race of the machines are you afraid
that machines will take over our jobs in
future doing our software development
now ok let's see but first I want to
start with a little bit of this claim or
what this talk is not about just to set
expectations here because this talk will
not be about you will not see any any
scripts so not writing down how you can
automate stuff so I won't show you
scripts and go through them that's not
what this talk is about um it's not
about you will not learn about chef and
puppet even though this is a some kind
of part of my talk so but it's just so
so I won't show you any any puppet
scripts or chef scripts or recipes
that's not that's not part of the talk
also the talk will not cover any any
better build pipelines or whatever you
do you want to call it so it's not about
actually so if you think about
automation you all obviously think about
continuous delivery continuous
integration well they're good talks
about that here at javaone go to them
this talk will not were just everything
besides it even though there is
something with with continuous
integration in this talk so what is this
talk about that well so what I want to
give you is some ideas so I talked to a
lot of people from different companies
and also inside atlassian what they
actually automate for the software
development become more effective and to
become to get more time for for coding
so and these are some examples that are
that I gather together in this torque I
wanted to show you and their experience
in automation they are software
development so we're the Rice's of
machine is about to come so if you if
you look around us in in our normal day
lives there are robots everywhere we see
robots everywhere I mean I like this
thing and I want to convince my wife to
buy it but she says okay we can work him
clean on our own but I think it Robert
would put do the job that's that's
right or if you think about the nest
automating your home that's that's a
great thing and we become that we see
more and more from this coming or
self-driving cars i mean obvious I think
we're not there yet but we will be there
in a few years so we see robots are
coming more and more so where are we
with cars right now well so Volvo
actually they have this human detection
so if a human jumps in from the car the
car stops automatically and this is a
there's a demonstration of this cool
cool new technology from Volvo oh my
well maybe we shouldn't trust the robot
sad but nobody got hurt I to their the
guy that took the video nobody gets hurt
actually so no damage but rays of the
machines yes but not totally um okay so
we see robots are everywhere nowadays um
but what about software development what
do we automate in software development
how do we how do we can become more
effective and I've been a software
developer for for a long time my name is
Sven I'm from Germany that's my German
accent and I work for for atlassian as
an evangelist so I travel around speak
at conferences and talk to people about
not just about automation but how to
become more effective in software
development so I want to share my whole
personal story with automation in in
software development with you so this is
my historical view when I start studying
I was writing some some make build
scripts so kind of cool 1996 actually
then 1998a I become where I first became
contact with GUI builders I think we're
still not there yet I don't know why but
anyway so there was a c++ GUI builder
the bad thing is i clicked together
something that was working pretty well i
couldn't edit actually edit the code i
don't know why i couldn't edit but they
wouldn't allow me so then j unit 2001 i
was blown away that you can write out of
my test very simple very simple
but it helped so much I become a little
late in the game then changing from Mike
stripper to aren't but and later maven
but this is also something where you can
automate a lot of stuff it clips when so
i went 2005 i went from jbuilder ball
and jbuilder at that time to eclipse and
that was there was just just a new thing
new universe actually so you could
reflect her and it's renaming everything
automatically so I had made small coding
pots running around and changing stuff
or imports you can just import it
automatically if I had a header had a
list important I awt list but I didn't
wander the collection list but I don't
know if they have figured that out right
i'm not using eclipse anymore so but
then two thousand fix this was really
well was blown away by hudson at that
time um when Hudson so I just just
installed Hudson pointed it to my
subversion directory and then showed him
I on script and it was just on every
check-in built my code Wow there was a
font that pretty cool too sup Niner
played around with whispers puppet so I
didn't use that really you didn't use
that in production but we played around
with it and then 2013 around I started
to use darker and more tests there to do
with automation I would also show show
you a little bit later so where are we
use automation right now well we can
automate something like our deployments
probably you do that hopefully you have
automated your deployments yes okay good
I'm builds and tests of course that's
what we're doing blood the last five
maybe longer years small scripts so
you'll probably have some small scripts
running around that can also do some
stuff but this is actually just the tip
of the iceberg so there's much more to
automation what you can do with
automation in software development and I
would talk about how you can automate
your support your stand-ups well not
really stand ups but can help about how
robots can help us automatic stand-ups
engineering hell's your operations
automatic merging and coat reviews so
all this stuff Adam this is what this
talk
we'll we'll cover and bots are actually
everywhere and I collected all these
cool BOTS when I talk to this to the to
the people I've collected all these cool
BOTS and put them in buckets so first I
would talk a little bit about coding
bots then about test spots how we can
have a better code quality using bots
using a button operation and using
server spots so we're doing service as a
support and software developers to so
how can we how can we use BOTS to be
more effective with that and then at the
end I will talk a little bit about
reporting bots how they can help us to
get shorter feedback loops and reporting
but the first spot I found I couldn't
fit in this bucket so I start with it
right away so who know who knows that we
start at a new job and say hey this is
your new laptop go or well we get a new
laptop or let their laptops breaks down
and we don't want to install the back up
because we're going to clean
installation something like that what
would what we do is then okay let's
download something and then install all
these different things and configure
this so the JDK a little bit scallop
host Chris IntelliJ you name it
everything that we need power
development wireman we install it and
then it takes for the next eight hours
we have nothing else to do but just just
installing this the software and then
figure out how to configure it again so
the pretty smart people adolescent so
for new people we wrote this this this
this little help installation guide line
how to install your cure your new new
mac and it goes like install these
following programs set up your bitbucket
account upload your keys blah blah blah
then configure maven the next thing you
do is that may even download the
internet for you
it's a postgres until it's all in tell
EJ said up in tell EJ and then if still
if if you're still waiting for me even
read these articles so great i mean it's
it's it helps but so the first comment
or the second common actually that
somebody did is why are you not using
Agent Charlie to automate a whole bunch
of these steps hey Charlie meet agent
Charlie so we have Agent Charlie and it
calls Charlie our little mascot called
Charlie because of Charles Atlas it was
a body Bella and holding holding things
up so looks a little bit like like our
small Charlie so Agent Charlie what does
agent shall you do so you install a
little bit a small snippet and then it
what it does is you start Agent Charlie
and it helps you actually downloading
the software so it's downloading the
software automatically it installs the
software and it sets out the software
just automatically so you just start
Agent Charlie and it puts all this
programs that you need on your on your
laptop what's under the hood from a to
Charlie well we we have it it's it's
it's puppets a bunch of chill and Ruby
scripts and we have it for for mac OS
and ubuntu and you yeah here again what
agent Charlie does does much more than
than just this but this basics that put
a Charlie installs on your on your
machine it's just the basic setup of
course and then you install your tools
what you need to but it's it helps a lot
say that is without Agent Charlie well
it's not so nice to install all these
things and spend eight hours with Agent
Charlie actually you and you start of a
new first job you can actually go and
meet your colleagues and talk to them
and let agent Charlie do the works of
automating installation big deal all
right so but I told you I have this five
topics so let's get started with with
coding bots so how do we automate our or
how do we how can robots help us to
automate a little bit our coding phase
to be more effective with that so s
developer we have this this huge screens
27 s who has a 27-inch screen or large
that's half of you so the other half why
don't you get a bigger screen really see
people can do that so go to your boss
and and buy a bigger screen so why do we
need this this huge screens of course we
want to see a lot of code but also we
deal with so many programs and we want
to see them all in parallel and yeah so
let's remove some of those so let's
let's let's remove this issue tracker
thing I'm from atlassian don't say
remove it should track at all but remove
it from your from your from your desktop
so what let's get started with that so a
normal issue tracker workflow looks
looks like this to do in progress and
view done just just an ordinary workflow
if you look at a coding workflow it
looks a little bit like this you are we
branch for every for every feature we do
offer every issue we have every branch
we could a cost little bit vectoring we
pull make a pull request and then we'll
merge okay so how does the progress look
like so I look into into my issue
tracker and sets my issue from to do
into in progress what I do then is I go
down here coding go to my terminal or my
my my IDE and branch then I start coding
stop refactoring I'm done so I make a
pull request and ask people for feedback
and then wait I have to go to back to
the issue tracker and say hey this issue
is now under review and then at the end
I merge and said hey hey wait I have to
go to this issue tracker and say ah this
is now done so this is the the way we
should work the way we work is actually
looks a little bit different so we
branch we code we refactor we pour we
merge and said oh man we forgot to
update the issue trigger so we go to the
issue tracker and say to do in progress
and review done while we fix this issue
in 10 seconds yay this is how it looks
at the India tracker but jokes jokes
besides by a mean we really we have to
keep the team updated especially when
work distributed with the team needs to
know where we add and and and sometimes
just saying that as a stand-up is not
enough they want to have shorter time
periods where they want to get updates
so how do we do that
so what people say they tried a bunch of
things they tried for example this using
this epic epic mind reader and just
think about this issue is now in
progress and see what what it does
automatically it drags the issue
automatically by just thinking without
using any mouse into into them progress
it's great isn't it you just think about
it well you still have to open your
issue tracker by doing that so that
doesn't really help and so let's let's
look at some some other things that we
do you call them smart commits or you
put actually what you do is you mention
your issue key and you have a trigger
and then you you you specify transition
what where the issue should go and tools
like github JIRA utrecht Trello
bitbucket they all support this this
thing codes we call it smart commits i
call it probably a little bit different
than other tools but what it does is
actually you have your issues and to do
and you commit message you say hey this
issue start progress so the issue
tracker reads the commit messages and
say okay good i this issue must know in
a progress start review and then it says
fixes this is actually the the github
notation they just say fixes blah blah
blah and then it goes into a into done
okay that's great isn't it I mean who's
who's using these kind of smart commits
here one two three four well not not too
many okay good you should you don't have
to go to issue tracker you just tell it
through the commit messages the good
thing is we don't switch tools anymore
that's a good thing the bad thing about
is we still have to think about the
issue tracker so we still have to think
we still just give the this robot just
given commands and tell them now this
issue is fixed now it's in review so we
still have to give this robot commands
but we can be smaller than that robots
can be smaller than that so if you use
JIRA
together with spit bucket you can just
say I create a branch and mention the
issue pee in the branch name so issue
jira sees that and transition see is she
automatically over what you then do is
just you you you make a pull request on
this issue and you don't do anything
else you just do the pull request and
USC said and transition phase you over
at the end you merge your code and also
grr sees that and transitions the issue
over so that works great with JIRA and
bid packet at the moment but I guess
other windows will also do it later on
but anyway so when I first saw that I
was thinking oh this is awesome this is
great i love it i really doesn't save so
much time great so let's talk about this
this workflow that we have this branch
pull much work fluent how robots can
help us even more by by doing that so as
I said for every every issue that we
have at atlassian we create a brush
create a branch and then we work and at
the end we merge very very obvious
workflow but some people think they are
cool so what they do is actually they
say we don't need I don't need to create
this this feature branch here I commit
directly to the master branch okay well
we don't we won't we will allow people
to do that maybe they have good reasons
but then maybe the built gets red but
this guy is so cool he can just fix it
right away so we just read fix and the
builders green again great isn't it but
what it does then is there's a senior
developer who who doesn't the proper way
so creates a branch fix us some things
and then that's the bit run oh my god
it's red why I just fixed the small
small senior can't come pee and then
looks in it looks in the lock files and
I didn't change this test how can it be
until it finds out so what we have is
actually that's a really bad surprising
and we don't want bad surprises that's
why we can use robots to tell us there's
something something here you shouldn't
you shouldn't create a branch and we
have this this bot or this hook that
tells us don't branch from a red built
you shouldn't you shouldn't do that so
we cannot branch when the built is red
we cannot create a branch so it helps us
not to get into this wow moment so the
next thing is a pull pull request so but
if you invite people who are the best
people you can you can invite in a pull
request your friends maybe they already
like your code so they just approve your
pull request well anyway so the best
people that you can invite for pull
request the other if you look at this
here the last committees of the file so
these are the best people you can invite
they know that the fire quite well but
then I have to look into it into the
commit history and see hey who committed
the last changes here who is the author
let's get some help from some bots and
and we have an add-on it's free for for
bitbucket server that called
auto-suggest reviewers and we suggest
review us just like just like this
looking at who was the last committer or
who is the original author so they would
be the best to review this this file and
Zelda suggests reviews and then we have
a bunch of merge hooks that helps us to
do stupid things on words so we have for
example a minimum of two approvals or X
approvals you can set that up like you
want so if if we have two approvals we
allowed to emerge before we can't really
merge the code or we have unapproved
code reviewers when when the code
changes so if if you have approved
already the pull request and the code
changes we said automatically we see
that instead automated the reviewers to
unapproved again that's also bought that
we that we are running okay this is good
at at last time we have this
a special thing that you can install
your software on its owner on the server
and then we have different versions
running like VW is also now the problem
that they're different versions out
running and they have to change the code
for these for these different different
versions and we have we have the same
same issue because sometimes we find a
back in an old release we have to fix
that and update all the customers that
have actually that that version out
there so this is how how we do it on the
on the branch level we create branches
for each word so each word from we have
a release branch and we keep those
release branches so we know what's out
there on this branch it's this version
that's out there and then if we find a
bug in an older version we just create a
hotfix brunch and then merge back to the
to the actual release branch and then
what we do is we merge back to their
from the most stable branch to the least
stable branch just upwards here and for
those people who work with get they they
know well branching and merging is very
easy and if you don't have a merge
conflict here maybe we won't have much
conflicts up the way so this is totally
boring work I mean think about merging
ten versions upwards that's that sets
mega mega boring so what you what you do
is the following work you have a but of
course and we have that too so we use we
yeah the boss says hey I can do that I
can do that and he does it so we have
Auto merger so the code gets merged
automatically upwards and then we have
some automatic builds running and if
that's successful we deploy software
automatically to our servers so we just
we just merge here the first step and
then the rest is done by by robots which
is pretty cool all right let's move on
from coding BOTS so some some tests
spots here it helps us to to be a little
bit smarter with with test automation so
if you look at this code looks okay
first thing but maybe you spot out that
there's an issue here there's this magic
number up here there so what you do is
of course static code analyzes they they
can catch this magic number it's you
shouldn't use that so fine box check
check style PMD all this static code
analyze towards they they do that maybe
not check style but fine box and PMD we
we're not we're not using these tools
actually not in in this with with with
that tool that I into the people that I
interviewed so we have actually some
fraud that that tells us something about
our source code so Freud would tell us
here yeah you should use a variable
instead of this magic number here and
then fraud so justice this this colors
are quite the same so maybe you pick one
of those colors and we date they do that
for a do that in a pull request so when
we do a pull request Freud's looks at
all the code and makes a static code
analyzes and put the comment directly
into the poor request so we have a but
that that looks actually in a pull
request we called Freud pot so fraud pot
actually helps us first let's review
work for other reviewers because that's
it's obvious that we shouldn't use a
magic number for example I'm so it's
less less less reviewers they already
see that ok Freud pod kicks in and tells
told already about that and then the
good thing is it also makes suggestions
so it's a little bit intelligent and
says hey this color maybe you wanted to
use this color here looks looks quite
the same so a software developers we're
trying to write awesome coat we we put
our hearts and minds in the code and
make make it really look great we want
to really make it look great so there's
a new class you've ride and then you
want to make it look great and at the
end you're proud of your on my awesome
class here that I brought well it's not
very complicated but it looks ok and
then you may go on on vacation or
something wait 1 months later you look
at your code again and said what the
fuck happened
so my coat my awesome class is not all
so many more huh but this happens to
code it does I mean who yeah that's
that's what it does and there's not just
that the lines of code of Awesome
classes goes up because people are just
putting their stuff in there there's
more if you look at your metrics test
coverage deprecated methods all units
heads as you have so J unit three you
should use j unit for tests or compiler
warnings over time they go up and code
gets unhealthy so why are developers
doing that they are doing that on
purpose they I mean they don't want to
make the code look bad that's not it but
I think as developers we often just just
look look like this we want to solve our
problem here that we want to solve and
then don't don't think about okay this
code should be maintainable and should
be look nice and we just want to solve
our problem and the problem is solved we
move on so at the end you have to call
someone that that looks at your code and
says this code is unhealthy I call him
doctor coat so dr. code measures
constantly the engineering else so dr.
code is of course not a not a person
that looks at the code dr. code is of
course a bot that looks at the code so
and we started with with measuring our
engineering health first when we wanted
to move from j unit sri to j unit for we
said okay we cannot migrate all tests
that we have so we say no more j units
retests just j unit for tests so this is
what we wanted to have so we wrote this
small counter class that counts all the
j unit three test and says this is now
this is now what we have and we are not
allowed to have more and then people
said wow this is great we don't just
need that for for j unit we can actually
measure all this all this other awesome
stuff that we have that we want to have
don't have 1i have more ad magnifying
your JavaScript or whatever so there's a
lot of stuff here that people write and
and by measuring our our engineering
health
and if you get caught by dr. code
because you wrote your J units retest
what happens then is you enter the hall
of shame at last year not good you don't
want to be in the Hall of Shame and you
got really caught up by your bio photo
so people can see who entered the hall
of shame so it's a little bit social
pressure that you keep your coat healthy
and then we have this wall bots so
people show your pictures everywhere
they can see that and say hi why did you
break it good but you can get also of
course out of that by by fixing some
some mate sub-matrix hear them and then
if you if you if you fix something for
example you fix the j unit three tests
and make them j unit four test you enter
the hall of fame so you can also get out
of the Hall of Shame by entering the
Hall of Fame great so let's look at some
some code we all code as we we love to
look at code so here's an old version in
the new version give you a little bit to
spot the difference between the old
version the new version that's just as
somebody has seen the number of year
yeah right so we're good at looking at
code and comparing code we have really
developed an eye for code so we can
really see that so look at that where's
the difference in this user interface
hey I know you can look for hours i
think also the resolution of this
projector is not very good so but i want
to what what i wanted to point out this
is the these are different icons so and
i think designers if they look at it
they can really spot that lets say a
this is one pixel off when you say what
how can you do that because I mean we
can we we know code but design hmm so we
said okay we can't hire a bunch of
designers always to look look at the
designs or at the new version that we
are developing so we have actually
bought that looks at the at the newest
version so and on a built it runs and
makes makes a picture from the newest
version and compare that with with a
screenshot from the from the database
and then
it gives you an alert it's that the
picture is different and then it also
helps you and showing actually here at
that that stage there's there's the
problem there the picture is different
and you can of course go in and fix it
and and make it make it right again or
you say okay this is the new version so
just click on it and it uses the new
picture or the new screenshot as the
version in the database okay talking
about testing an automatic testing our
tests actually less and they ran for
hours there were really long tests so
the first thing that we did is of course
we make them parallel so we run those
tests parallel so we bought a bunch of
new machines split it up our tests into
into different tests and then we run
them just just in parallel and looks
like this so this is a static resize
test block and the problem problematic
was latest that is we are always waiting
for the for the longest test and then we
can say okay fail or success green or
red just waiting for the longest test so
we thought okay we of course you can
split that up again but then it's not
very smart to do that and you have
always to manual work so let's let's
let's Lee use some BOTS to make our
functional tests balance better so we
have a functional test balancer here we
call that hallelujah so hello yer takes
all their functional tests and then we
have a despot just X as a dispatcher I
mean it's totally simple but as you can
see we use our time much more wisely and
at the end we see okay good it's very
effective to use hallelujah in that case
alright and then at the end we say ah
the build is green and we love the green
belts and we so built say the screen we
say hey array awesome but sometimes of
course the builders red
it's it's not it's not life at this I
mean that's why we have that automatic
automatic tests that's a reason why we
have it okay it's red eye fix something
but then you look at the log files and
says how can this happen I don't know
what I do is I rerun the test it's green
again whew and that's a frustrating part
say oh no because you just discovered a
flaky test huh so what we did is
actually hate flaky tests all of us
hateful flaky tests because they don't
say anything about about our about the
test i mean if success or not doesn't
tell anything so we brought actually a
flaky tests detector so this this
detector detects flaky tests what it
does is it sees a failing test so what
it does is it just reruns this failing
tests the tests are still red okay we
fail the built but if the test is green
all of a sudden we know we have detected
the flaky tests here so we continue the
built but also we put this test into
current in so it won't be executed for
the next run anymore but not only that
we also create an issue automatically
sorry that transition shouldn't be there
but create an issue automatically at the
at the end so this flaky tests get gets
tested all right good so what how did
how did it go we actually found 817
flaky tests when we started with it
until now 800 tests we put into current
team that doesn't mean they are fixed
now but then current team and people
have to look at it and fix those those
current intestine we're a little bit bad
at fixing those but we're trying hard to
do that and we keep pushing people to to
fix it or scroll the test away I mean
what is the flaky test so just throw it
away if it doesn't tell you anything so
flaky test you take care I think it's
great for forcing us for fixing fixing
these these flaky tests and we don't
have these ah this one again moment
again I brought once a test with some
where were tested some time zones
so I set the time zone and set different
time zones and compared it and it was
two times a year it was always failing
because of the daylight saving time
change and so 22 times a year i was
thinking okay good close my eyes for for
one day and then it's running again
great but we don't have this a hard
moment i should have fixed it up course
no log file searching you don't have to
look into the Loch Fyne says I don't
know why this failed and then rerun
again and no manual reruns that saves a
lot of time these lock file scanning and
and and many reruns if you have a flaky
tests detector that safe saves a lot of
time alright let's move over to some
operation up spots that helps us to to
automate our operations and we know we
have to work together with the IT folks
it's not just like this guy here hey
here's the software by I mean we know we
know that we don't say hey this is now
the the ops problem so it's your problem
here we shouldn't do that all right but
what what is actually when when when a
problem occurs on the production system
so problem the Ops guys jumped in look
at it maybe and then the deaf guy so a
problem occurs the Ops guys get pinged
try they try to fix something on their
own maybe the look at the menu or
whatever doesn't really doesn't really
turn out that they can fix something so
they call the deaths and they start
looking near the code and maybe change
something they know okay I've changed it
yesterday so maybe it has something to
do with that but we want to have fast
this is really a slow feedback you this
is not good so we want to have faster
feedback loop so from problem directly
to the developer so the problem occurs
the developer get pinged and then they
start coding this is what we want so
what how do we do that so what we do at
Alaskan is we use pagerduty so pagerduty
actually combines different systems and
can tell okay
a when this service failed I know that
this team is responsible for this
service so it finds out this service
failed this team is responsible so I
forward the the problem directly to this
software development team so Peter duty
knows that but you might say holy shit
that's that's great but all this
configuration when I when I have a new
servers i have to take pagerduty that
I'm responsible for this service and we
said also no don't we don't want to do
that so what we actually wrote is is
that pedro de finds out directly who is
responsible for for the service or who
actually deployed the service because we
mention actually the team name in the
deployment of Scripture so peter julie
can read that and build their own matrix
so that way actually if something fails
pagerduty notes are automatically who to
call if the new servers that somebody
introduced fails pagerduty knows who to
call so and this is very very essential
for I think for for every software team
we should own our code we we should only
we're responsible for our own code from
end to end and this service helps us a
lot so before we release we can maybe
lay back and say hey we're prepared for
the release everything fine until
somebody says have you thought about the
release notes oh yeah after of course
you have to also write write the release
notes so what you can do is of course
you couldn't look into issue tracker and
see okay which is all this version tag
here and just export that but doesn't
really tell you the truth isn't the
truth in the coat so the code says okay
this is a new feature we did an
improvement here and we do it there so
what some companies do is on their
release branch if they start their their
release they create this release notes
automatically so they actually and
that's not not a surprise then what's in
the release so they actually write a
commit message look at that though so
they have a service that look at all the
messages reach the issue key that is
mentioned this commit messages combines
that with some issue information that
they get out of of the issue tracker and
create the release notes automatically
and deploy that automatically yeah
deploy that automatically for example
hazel cast is doing that if you read
that release notes they using github and
github issues and if you read the
release notes they have this labels they
use for github because github don't have
different issue issue types so they use
github the news labels for for labeling
the issues so they can say these are
improvements it's a fixes our new
features but not just hey Lucas does
that if you look at zero turn around
that's the same thing they just use a
jira bitbucket combination and they
create their their release notes
automatically so you can also see here
depending on the issue type but this is
new feature an improvement in fixed box
this way you always write your release
notes like a so it's a truce because
your code is telling the truth here so
issue disturb his release notes it's not
just like that this is so great because
everything is automating and it's no
surprises in there in the release notes
but it's what I think it's it's it's
more important is that you tend to write
human readable issue descriptions so
sometimes you read an issue description
you don't know what to do with that but
you if you know okay this will end up in
the release note so I better write
something that the customer will
understand not just this that they will
understand it but it's also good for you
think about what value this this issue
has for the customer so you also think
about the customer value I think this is
this is very valuable valuable stuff
alright 20 minutes left let's go to
service BOTS we also have to do some
service as software developers so let's
think if the support can't can't can't
help the customer anymore so the sort of
spot atlassian for example they say okay
please give us a log file and then we
have
or developer look at the log file
because we have this speciality that the
software is running on our customer
service we have to ask for for the log
file and so then we what we do is we
scanning the log files and we're good at
that we can scan through log files and
directly point out okay there's a
problem I can see that directly I don't
know how we do that but it's just magic
we can scan through log files and oh
okay this exception I know this
excitement notice is something new and
then we know we have this system
knowledge that we know okay if this
happens it's probably that problem here
but the problem is that the support has
to reach out to us so the problem is you
have to pause your work and everyone
knows when you're in the flow and you
get disrupted interrupted then it takes
you 15 minutes or something to get get
into that stage again so it's really
losing a lot of lot of working time here
you probably know this talk is about
robots so we replace this nice developer
into a robot and we call this robot
Hercules what her vocalist does this
actually looks at the log file and
suggests some some article from our
knowledge base how did we do that well
so we have this this section here so
this is our knowledge base here with
some diagnosis cause resolution and we
have this section this machine readable
section so helpless is looking at that
and said oh i found this pattern here in
the log file so this could be this could
be a solution for this problem it puts
that ended in a comment in this issue so
the support person can can actually read
that and the support is constantly
constantly updating this knowledge base
so we're teaching the robot constantly
and this is how it looks like so the
robot suggest something to the poor
person updates the knowledge page base
and tabulous reads the knowledge base
again so at the moment we use that
internally we also thinking about just
get it suggested directly to the
customer but we need to have
some more experience with was hopeless
but we're thinking about that we think
that we can maybe solve five to eight
percent of all support cases had come in
with Hercules so that's that's good and
the first time helpless kick actually in
somebody wrote a comment and said wow
fuck me the rubber was right i increased
the memory available and the things work
and we said we thought this is so cool
we are t-shirt company so we created
this t-shirt well fuck me the role of
was right awesome so when we not just
doing support for our flour developers
we also do support for other people for
our bosses for example so and then
imagine your boss comes and has a really
important task to tell you you have to
do that amelie and then he comes to your
desks and the whole team is gone because
everyone works from home or somewhere
else playing ping-pong or something and
you don't want to become your boss
looking like this getting really angry
so what actually Spotify did they
actually developed this terminal so if
they're not in the office you can use
the terminal and ask your question to
the terminal so this is what they did
and actually in a hackathon 24-hour
hackathon they wrote this thing so
nobody's in the office so you can fill
out Phillips this ticket here and the
cool thing is that you you see there's
this this printer machine so this
printer machine is actually printing the
issue number on this ticket and you can
take something physical physical with
you get back to your desk and say ah
yeah my folks are working on that great
so this is good but as you know right
now we all have a chat installed and I
mean you can reach everyone immediately
with Chet I mean everyone has has a
mobile app and you can reach everyone on
the team was Chet so but then you have
this problem that you get all these
questions in all these different
questions like your boss comes and say
hey how do i download this print report
I need that for the
meeting or some teammates came and say
how do i setup built from a new feature
branch or just well do that or what yeah
barbers java version do we support stuff
like that yourself yeah read the fucking
menu it's all in our knowledge space
read that come on or you can just go
into chat and use the the ask pot so we
have an a spot that actually you can
just type Express much ask ask you a
question and the bot is looking actually
at the knowledge base so here you are
scary how to SSH so agent and the the
bot suggest some some things that they
that they found in the knowledge base
and sometimes it's just people asking
and I just teach them the with a bot so
I just say hey drop expression mark ask
copy the question that they have and
then let the bot give you the answer
cool so support BOTS cover that let's go
over to to report thoughts because many
reporting sucks so I mean when I talk
about reports we are all very agile kind
of start working so let's let's automate
stand-ups well I don't want to I want to
automate stand-ups because that's
something human interaction and stuff
like that so we can't really automate
that one hundred percent but there are
some problems with stand-up said that
BOTS can help us to solve so for example
they are too long people speak too long
during their stand up and we can have a
pot helping with that we have to remind
people that there's a stand up every day
and they normally hang out in the
kitchen man at that time or if you have
a remote team a distributed team setting
up VC cards take also time so your stand
up starts normally five minutes later or
you have this problem that you work in
different times on and that's really in
three different times there's really no
overlap where you all can meet to a
normal working time so let's fix this
too long that people speak too long
first without weather is actually much
the the real physical bought the only
physical but that we have and this is
actually quite cool because you press a
button
then after a while it starts vibrating
and it's it's it's it's this I don't
know if you know the small box that can
run around gets inside there so it's
this vibrating box that are inside that
so if you speak too long this this small
bot reminds you that you shouldn't next
problem that people are not coming to
stand up so how do you how do you never
miss a stand-up and a developer of a
lesson you've wrote an extension to
chrome to chrome and it's chrome tab so
chrome to have actually automatically at
a specific time opens a tap we have set
it up to Pandora and every team has set
up to a different playlists in Tampa
Dora so if you hear ACDC you know it's
your team that has to stand up in one
minute if you hear Taylor Swift you know
it's a marketing team that has a sound
the next time so okay and we you said
this is the same chrome tab also for for
setting up vc chords so we have a
permanent link here as a video
conference call and so it's it's it
started automatically so we don't have
to do any type and it stops
automatically also okay stand up BOTS I
think they are great for for co-located
teams so having this vibrating but they
are great for distributed teams which we
see calls starting automatically but
what about what about different time
zones how can you how can you really
works work in different time zones and
have a stand up in different time zones
if you have no overlap and your working
hours so we have also bought of course
for that and you tell actually the bot
what you have been doing the day so you
tell it okay this is my status update
and then you go to bed and the other
person on the other side of the world
gets up and asked just the bot hey what
is it what is the team doing and it gets
a team update from the last 24 hours
what's happened with the team and we put
it into our chat room so what you do is
you type just slash stand up and give it
give it your update of the day and if
you if you just type stand up without
anything
afterwards it gives you from the hot
updates from the whole team and you can
see the whole team what they have been
doing the last 24 hours so great and we
use actually BOTS chat BOTS everywhere
four or five forget a new exception or
build failure or something chat bots are
literally everywhere atlassian and for
example if the built chain fails we have
a bot that tells us about it that
reports the bill failed and we can go
into chat and talk directly and say hey
who's who's fixing that then there's
deployment board so we can see when
somebody employs something person it's
about telling that in the chat room in
the team chat room and then we use a
century in the hit on the objecting for
exception and if century sees a new
exception that have never happened
before on the production system we have
a bot from century telling us in the in
the chat room that there's an exception
happening and then we can discuss out
who's fixing that and yeah chat box
everywhere and chat bots helps us
actually to have faster feedback loops
so we can we know directly in the in the
in the chat that there's something
happening and then there's a single
place where well all this all these
things happen team knowledge well the
team looks at the chat room so so it's
built out the team knowledge and they
know there's a new pull request or
there's the build is broken at the
moment and we can start discussion
directly in there in the chat room but
on the other hand this is maybe this is
great but maybe you also need some some
additional things because what you see
is just just something in it at the
moment so you can see okay the bill
failed right now you can see okay
there's a new deployment and there are
some step messages you can see there's a
new important issue somebody somebody
has and sometimes you actually need
something something more on you need to
get the big picture and we get the big
picture by having warbots everywhere so
we actually wrote brought our own nodejs
Atlas sport you can download that it's
free it's it's open source so you can
use that and development teams are using
this for getting the big picture to see
what's really what's really going on
during development so who's working on
what who's our our code review champ and
the Hall of Shame of course is also on
there and point directly to can point
directly because these are really
screens so really information radiators
you can point directly to it so all
kinds of we have all kinds of board our
developers has their own development
board our developer advocates have their
own board measuring blog post views and
then we have served support people that
have also their own board measuring
support cases in critical support cases
and stuff like that all right bots are
everywhere bots are in coding and
testing and operation we have service
BOTS report bots and talking now for 50
minutes about bots so how do you start
with automation so sometimes you think
okay you'll really have to reinvent the
wheel everything has been written before
I just go to to some open source
repositories so I go to github or
whatever and just there are so many
services out there and download just
just this automation service and I
talked to the store to some people and
say hey why don't you just use something
that somebody else wrote and this told
me well that we would try that but the
code is mostly because it's just small
code mostly unmaintained and sometimes
it really solves a very specific problem
we can maybe take the code import it but
maybe it's also easier for us to write
it ourselves but that's not the the
biggest problem I mean you can you can
write your donation code what's what's
the number one problem when you think
about automating your software
development it's your time the time
investment you never have time to
automate anything because there's a full
backlog and you have to work on that and
you have sprint goals so how do you deal
with that well you have to take your
time
course to write some some bots so if you
look at that we had this problem that we
are we still have that we are still in
technical depth in with the douro team
so our technical lead said hey we have
to fix it or our engineering health is
really really not good so you get ten
percent of your work time in fixing
fixing our engineering health yeah and
what what what some somebody did said
okay good I can fix everything or I
write write a bot that automate
something that tells people that there
something wrong that they have to fix
something and he actually this is Philip
from the from the grants office and he
wrote this doctor code but that tells
about the engineering health and in
force people to fix something so this is
really good so use your time maybe you
you have some some specific story point
for for your Sprint goal that you can
put into automation or you do something
we do it in a hackathon and 24-hour
hackathon we do that every quarter call
it ship it days use that for for writing
some automation to be more effective in
your in your software development and
it's not just like you be more effective
writing automation code is is also
serious fun it's really fun to write
automation code why because it's so
motivating to write to write code
because it's really your problems that
you have day in day out and you're so
motivated fixing those problems so it's
really fun to do that not just that well
you get to get fast success so it's fast
feedback loop normally it's just a small
thing that you've right and then say wow
this is awesome that this this small
thing helps me so much so you get really
fast feedback loops by writing out of
money out our writing writing some bots
that helps you and also you can you can
try new languages I talked to people and
said hey what do you use normal for
languages for automation Java didn't
come up anyway they say oh hey we use go
Ruby people you've read PHP code I don't
know why but do that
Tyson so this these languages came up a
lot and you can even play around with a
new language and write that and you
learn new technologies like like puppet
chef ansible secure technology you can
use docker for for deploying yogya your
automated service in the container this
is this is kind of cool but when you
start with automation it runs normally
you brought it onto your machine and
sometimes things happen to your machine
so this is really unprofessional so how
do we get to the really professional
automation so first add your code to
source control also your automation code
has to be in the source control it has
to be personalized so do that our all
your other code you write a test to go
in turn into source control also don't
forget coat reviews just use your normal
what what you use for your normal a
professional software development you
said also for your automation code so
the team gets knowledge actually about
about how how this this small robot
works and then of course put it under
automated tests fried tests for for
every automation service that you have
and I think this is the most important
thing because you can find maybe the
code and you are in your repository but
having deployment scripts knowing where
this thing goes and how well I mean
sometimes people say okay it has to go
into this cron job and it started on
this machine and and stuff like that so
having deployment scripts makes it also
automatic and keep your systems actually
actually under control you probably end
up with with a whistle there's a lot of
different services running around
everywhere and you don't know where all
these snowflakes running around
somewhere keep keep your system under
control that you know which service runs
where and what happens is so a bunch of
people that does that adalat Ian using a
doing automation code they actually use
amazon web services for that AWS for
that and running that their code on that
and then we saw an explosion the
automation code on that then
they saw an explosion in different
different servers that people had so we
said okay we have to get that somehow
under control so what we did is actually
we said okay every amazon web services
you can use labels for AWS so write down
the cost center the service name and the
owner so we know which which server
belongs to who and then they get
actually billed directly so they don't
have to fill out anything they just
write down in the in the deep in the
Amazon Web Services in the label they
just write down the cost center and off
you go on but we found it okay amazon
web service is great but we put a layer
on top of that we call that micros so
that's where we deploy our microservices
our automation code so and micros has
already some bunch of stuff in there
with our own platform as a service so
some you can deploy docker containers on
there there's an orchestration running
already pison code go Java code whatever
you want you can run on on micros and we
made it very very simple for people to
register their their servers there's
more microservices on micro so just type
service create service name and then you
give it a service descriptor which I
think it's pretty pretty cool because
the service descriptor it contains the
owner the cost center page of duty so
those those so if you want to put it on
a page a duty and the team name so it
knows who it's a service fails who to
inform and yeah so this is what we use
as our automation platform so where
we're heading with automation well I
think we're heading we're getting more
and more smarter in finding out what the
customer value is so better customer
insights robots helps out there there's
so much data and robots helps us to to
find find this data and to make smarter
decisions based on that on that data and
also if you look around the tool
landscape well they opened this tool
windows open more and more than a pea
eyes so the tools can talk together
so we get faster developer feedback
loops and we have an end-to-end
traceability there so we get more
integrated tombs tools and and that and
then of course testing bots helps us
also get smarter test bots are getting
smarter in reading our code and finding
box in that code so bots are getting
smarter smarter was that but I said that
is building software is a craft and like
every craft parts can be automated from
that Croft so okay we care we can
automate a bunch of stuff here and we
will automate a bunch of self that we
are doing now doing manually and that
can be automated but actually creating
customer value that's really an art now
I found it hard to see that that BOTS
will take over and creating customer
value but yeah so this is really what we
concentrate on to create customer value
this is really an art so the race of the
machines I don't see that machines will
take over our jobs in the next 10-15
years so the race of ministry changes
there but those bots are just helping us
to get into the the real problems what's
that something's wrong here shit oh my
god bus have taken over we all doomed
sorry we can go home alright that's it
so I hit the hour so come to me if you
have questions I'll be here the next
hour if you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
