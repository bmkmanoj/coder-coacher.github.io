give a talk on permanent generation
removable overview and a little bio I'm
calling I've worked in the hotspot JVM
runtime team for at least 12 13 years
and my co speaker is John Watson meet
sue who is the project leader of the
firm gem removal overview removal
project and John works in the GC group
and is a GC expert and he's worked it
son Oracle combination on the hotspot GC
group for more than twelve thirteen
years so a number not to be specified
and so we are we've been working on
removing the parmesan for at least three
years with a team of other people and I
will this is the this is the abstract
that all you know attracted you to this
talk and John wrote this it's very good
and we removed the perm gen and JDK 8
not JDK 7 so this is one of the major
changes of JDK 8 it's it's more of a
removal of something than an addition
like JFR and the other features but it's
a JDK 8 feature this says don't believe
me I'm probably going to live at least
once or twice in this presentation so
the agenda first time to talk about what
the perm journalists didn't even know
just everyone know what the perm gen was
so everyone raise your hand if you've
heard of perm Jam
ah you're all good and excellent but so
this is so this will be review because
now that it's gone I'm starting to kind
of forget about it
and it's kind of a it was a bad memory
when it was there um that's a mouthful
so I want to tell you where the metadata
is now I have to talk about compress
class pointers because
that affects metadata and it'll affect
Java programs we have some new tuning
flags in just in case you miss max verb
size we've improved to see who we've
improved GC performance and I can tell
you I'll tell you a bit about that and
then we do have some programmatic ways
and tools to understand now what we're
doing with them at a space cuz I know
you all are deeply interested in what
the JVM is doing at all times and we're
happy to tell you about it
what was the perm gen it was called the
permanent generation because the idea is
it's it's it's hot spots class metadata
it's it's your it's your it's your class
files loaded up into c++ data structures
and this is where we stored all this in
the perm gen because we assume that we
don't unload those very often and we
infrequently collected those so if
people have attended GC talks and
they're all very complicated and it all
boils down to I usually I only draw one
box for the Java heap and I was feeling
generous like I did like before but so
so new objects are allocated in Eden and
as they're collected they move back and
forth to survivor spaces and they
finally get old enough and they go into
the old Jenin and there they sit until
the full collection that's all you need
to know about GC that's a generational
collector the perm gen was also part of
the Java heap and there are no arrows in
and out of the perm gen because we
allocated stuff directly there so and
there's spaces in between there but all
this stuff is contiguous so but the
space there just make the picture look
nice or so the perm gems is now who is
used Mac's perm site sighs ah and who
enjoys that one that option oh good
you're gonna be very you're gonna be
super happy with one of my later slides
so anyways maxpro size was the default
is 64 Meg and adjust for 64-bit pointer
size scale forward size maybe was 85 Meg
that was the default size I don't know
how many people ever use the default
size or how they figured out how to set
this thing so they perma size this
continuous with Java heap because juicy
it would be slow and horrible in it and
once you exhausted the perm gen you
would get out of every or perm gen space
I think because of the hands I'm pretty
sure you guys might have seen this error
if you get out of memory perms in space
you could clear references by doing it
in cause class on loading I don't know
how you do that personally and I don't
know if your applications work that way
but I think that's pretty much
impossible so you would just restart and
try a different size see how that works
so why was perm gen eliminated well
see slide -1 the the perma size people
hated setting that parameter you'd run
out you wouldn't know how big to make
the perm size and John got tired of
telling me answering emails thanks for
this big so other other reasons we got
rid of the Pearl gen I don't know if I'm
motivating you but other reasons we got
rid of the perm gen was all the hats got
metadata all the data that we used in
hotspot worse were Java objects and they
weren't C++ objects but they were
written as he was was code so they were
super hard to debug there were opaque
types they weren't type safe we can mix
and match them and it was and we really
it really hurt the code so that's my
motivator it's probably if you're a Java
user you probably couldn't care less
that you know you probably don't really
care how happy I was in my job but um
anyways they also needed all this other
code
better metadata then the other reasons
we eliminated perm gen was to simplify
full collections we had a lot of we have
for garbage collectors right now and so
we have four different garbage
collectors in hotspot for different
people and different purposes each one
had to have a special mater for perm gen
and so internally that was another
reason we wanted to do that we we can do
more work after you've stopped stopped
the world to deallocate classes so we
did that and permanent kept getting in
the way of all these other things we
wanted to do so where do the JVM
metadata
go so we still need some memory for
metadata there was no magic involved in
getting rid of all the memory so um so
we've put the permit uh now in metaphase
and the meta space is allocated in
native and we have memory management
techniques to to do with metaphase so we
we have moved the problem from the for
collectors dealing with perm gen and the
VM to us managing a metaphase but it's
only C++ so then the minimus takes the
advantage of the JLS property that that
when your class owners live all the
metadata for all the classes you've
loaded can't be collected
so we've allocated these to a per
loaders storage area we call it meta
space because this came from the Oracle
labs and these guys have a good way of
naming things so we thought in metal
space was a cool name and so the meta
space things we allocate things in the
metastasis we don't move these things
around so we don't have to worry about
our hats
but code moving data that we're using
while we're using it which was know it's
really hard we had a lot of bugs for
that these things GC doesn't touch meta
space and and then and then when the
class loader dies we can just do like
eight the whole chunk all at once we
collectively called its we collectively
we call the whole space where we
allocate objects or the sepals rows are
doors it we constantly call the whole
thing meta space so there's per loader
class areas called no space but the
whole thing is called meta space so
that's what I so when I say no space I
meet a lot of it from now on so this is
probably not useful if you are a Java
program if you're interested in the JVM
internals this is a bit more this is how
we do it so we do have to manage this
memory now we it's not free and so we
have we have per class load we allocate
a bunch of em app spaces we have a bunch
of per class loader chunk lists and and
we have different chunks sizes depending
on the sort of class you have anonymous
classes only have one anonymous class
loaders only have one class in them so
those are smaller
those are specialized things so some
some things have different chunks sizes
so it's a chunky memory allocator we
have free lists and then we return space
to the OS and then I have to I had to
include the last slide which maybe as
people can't see it has the f-word and
we really don't we don't like to talk
about this but we are we are
continuously working to minimize the
this this this fragmentation because
class items you know if anyone's done
memory management you know these are
these are not fixed size items that you
can't allocate them to buckets there
they're allocated continuously next to
each other and there's there's free
spaces and we have to fill up the space
and these efficient as possible so so
yeah
the this fragmentation could be a worry
here's a picture of all this what I just
said so we have class loaders and they
have different chunk lists per class
loaders and these these are like virtual
spaces and mat spaces so and these
pictures are like a pain to draw and
slides so this is how way so what like
class loader 3 goes away that chunk will
be freed and put on a free list and a
different chunk will come up or a
different class loader will use up the
chunk but that's that's how it the
trunks are contiguous there's like
spaces in between but that's just would
be a better picture so that's how we
allocate that's how we're allocating our
metadata now so I have to talk about
actually I have to drink water I have to
drink something as my died um so I have
to talk about Java memory layout because
this this actually will feed into how
we're managing our meta spaces and and
flags that you're gonna care about so if
for Java classes the JVM adds a a mark
in a class pointer and this has a this
has a string in it the string text
actually points at the bottom thing is
another string so those are your Java
objects in yellow I won't talk about
mark that the mark because that's a
whole different talk but the class
pointers point into metastasis and the
in the class that it points to is is our
representation of the Java class that
has the devii tables in it and the
things we wouldn't allocate per object
for instance so for compressed class
pointers space we've had to for 64-bit
platforms in order to compress that
class pointer that you just saw we had
to introduce a compress class space so
we have now meta space and now we have
compressed class space which is
logically a part of medicine
but it is a different and map area and
then we have the e'en survivors and all
that they're totally separate from the
Java you know why I still have that um
anyways we have so the class so for
compressed so if we're compressing the
class pointers and and the other object
pointers we allocate the classes in the
compressed class space this is only for
64 bits if we're compressing the 32 bits
and it's only if it's only if you're
using compressed class pointers if you
don't use compressed class pores
everything ends up in the middle space
so compressing the pointers from one
object to the other is controlled by use
compressed oops I don't know if people
have seen that or that's default so okay
yeah that's default so hopefully you
haven't seen it and you just notice that
your objects are smaller and efficient
and all that the oops part and yeah I
don't if any JVM talk is going to
mention oops because these are what we
call our ordinary object pointers these
are your Java pointers from one object
to another
we call them oops and you'll always see
oops in a JVM talk so these are
compressed to 32 bits and they use the
heap base of the Java heap in order to
compress them the third units so they're
an offset we also compress class
pointers so we can press those two 32
bits same same deal but they use the
compressed class pointer space space as
the as a bass player in order to the
depression so it sort of introduced meta
space and compressed class pointer space
to you so there's two so the the
compressed classifier space only
complaint contains a small amount of
metadata it doesn't complain contain all
of it so all the things that are like
big like the methods and the bytecode
isn't comfortable all that stuff in your
A's have been here
and all that stuff that's all that also
goes in meta space and that only a small
bit of the class goes into the
compressed class pointer space
the reason the Caressa passport space is
important is that at the moment it's
fixed size so I had to admit that
question uh-oh you're paying attention
yes absolutely yes it's fixed in the
same thing because right now but I'll
talk about that I'll talk about in a
couple slides at the moment it's fixed
but we we have we have plans and so it
is so we didn't want to call it the new
parmesan but but I am somewhat busted
here because um it is fixed sized we
don't put everything in it we only put a
small amount of things in it so we we
feel that we won't have the same
problems we had with chrome done with
this space and if we do we have a way to
get around it the we need response from
you guys
so oh I'll tell you where did yeah yeah
yeah
oh no you're jumping ahead mister I
covered that I have just rewritten I
have just rewritten my slide so maybe I
delete it I don't know um
you come back talk to me so yeah so
paying attention that we we we do have a
fixed size allocation space for just the
class pointers so let me talk about
tuning flags first and then we'll go
back to the compress class space problem
so right now we have so we have we have
some new tuning flat Flags because I
mean I think people used per max perm
size in if they had class literally sir
excessive class loading or the default
wasn't big enough the default of this is
the amount of memory on your machine so
we'll just keep em mapping spaces until
your machine start swapping but you
might want to limit the amount of
metastasis that we use so that you get
an out of memory error and count on load
classes or something so so we do have a
meta space size a maximum space size
parameter we actually use it we use it
on our testing because we we actually
have a lot of tests that don't ever GC
classes and and fill up the heap and you
know cause the rest of our tests to
crash so we we use it for some of our
testing just because that's what we're
testing
so there's another talk that I don't
know what's the person that's doing that
other talk was here no oh well too bad
there's another talk in in a half an
hour after my talk about perm gen leaks
so a leak in your application they could
fill it perm gen so I kind of thought
that was interesting he talks about
filling a perm jaw but you you could
fill up the memory of your machine and
meta space but this flag will help you
limit that max Menace space size yeah so
it's it's both the sum of the committed
space
that you've committed so far Memphis and
the compressed crossface
so that was Maximus fees like this is
meta space size meta space size is a bad
yeah yeah you can also run native code
and kill your whole machine to so yeah
yeah that's that's well people didn't
like the limited Permian so we took away
that limit so you have to be careful
that's to be very careful yeah careful
what you wished for
but um so yes so you you might in your
case set a maximum space size you know
pick some size you know 40 gig this
application can only use 40 gig 20 you
pick a size so we also have another flag
meta space size and and this guy is the
effect the high-water mark for GC so if
you've allocated like 21 negative of
metaphase you you want to you want to
start the full collection and try to
unload some classes otherwise we're not
gonna
we don't unload classes unless you're
doing a full collection at the moment
that's true and then if but the limit is
twenty one mag if you find like you're
doing it you do a print GC details or
something and you're doing too many
garbage collections at startup because
you're allocating a ton of memory to get
to a steady state you might want it this
is what you would want to increase you
know maybe maybe you want a gig of
metadata and maybe that's what you need
for your steady state and so
absolutely absolutely thank you so it's
also the meadow space sighs will the
high watermark keeps increasing as you
allocate more metadata as high
watermarks do there's ways we do have a
couple tuning flags and if you've ever
used the GC free ratio parameters we
have meta space versions of those that
are set to the same versions of or the
same numbers as the GC ones
if you've ever said this and and you
want more information about men
metastasis John because he knows what
that code does yes no no no no no no
just the defaults are the same so okay
so we also have we also have our little
fixed sized class compress class space
pointer space problem so what we do is
we set it really large I mean this is
only 64 bits so we set it to a gig and
and then it's not committed until we use
it so so we will reserve a gig and and
the average class size is about a
hundred words why we count everything in
word size I have no idea so we have a
hundred words and so there's been a
hundred words per class say you probably
have about a million classes before
you'll run out of this depending on your
class loaders so we just start out with
a large reservation if you're running
national one before they fix their
anonymous class loader problem is soon I
hope you might want to gig for this but
they've been they were stress testing us
but that's the only time we've ever seen
this this run out except for our leaking
programs
so we in the future we can make the
space scroll because we're where I where
I have where we have it is if we have it
in high memory it has a high base we
could m-matt spaces on top of it and and
still be able to use the compression so
we can actually and map more spaces for
it if we decide to do that we decide to
me in classes isn't enough for you the
other thing I'd rather do is shift more
stuff into the meta space and just have
like more of an ear class concept so
just have like a little bit in in this
compress class space have it be fixed
size and and then that way you know the
zero fragmentation and the thing won't
ever run out until you hit like a big
classes so that's that's my preference
but out what's gonna happen did I just
do no no there's never a compaction
there's never moving there's never any
of that so we do we'd allocate into free
box it's actually managed the same way
as the other picture before it's chunks
per class loader so and we have a
experimental flag called now called
predicted loaded class count which our
performance team uses to size our system
dictionary dictionary of allotted
classes we might organ amelie set this
based on back so that you set one flag
you know BAM you got your you've got
everything you don't have to worry and
then if you have a Developer Preview we
just changed all these names to the ones
in the slides so if you say you know use
compress class space and/or use
compressed class players with a see it's
not in there it's called something
different so we also the GCC flags also
reported meta space this is an example
of our kitchen sink application which is
why there's so
space used and it's just so much fun and
this shows the meta space some classes
got unloaded and the meta space is
smaller and then we also the the the
print heap command also reports on the
metaphase sizes so you can use that to
tune max Vettes space size if you're
keen on doing that so you're gonna have
to tell me who you are after this sorry
this is where we talk data means
medicine the metastasis non-class but
yeah you had kind of trouble it
we called it data for a while there
might be a better thing to call it yeah
um so um so with this change we've
improved um we we
this desire was to improve GC
performance because during GC if you
have a large perm gen we're not scanning
pointers metadata pointers to metadata
pointers anymore which we used to do
there was a ton of complex sort of
duplicated code that we that were
removed so we enjoyed doing that we also
the menÃ­s space itself now only contains
a couple of pointers to the java heat so
you probably and we're gonna move those
so so I think we can improve performance
by by not paging in stuff from meta
space while we're doing collections so
that's my is one of the next little
projects so and also the compaction
there was compaction costs for for the
perm gen so we don't have that anymore
you don't do a lot of full GCS so you
might not see this performance the labs
when they gave us today Metis space and
showed us their prototype they got like
30 percent full collection improvements
but they're the labs the Oracle labs so
we saw
like 10% something like that and these
guys yeah we so regularly about tens but
10% but it's nothing how many full
collections you're doing how big your
probes in your meta data was so we're
not really promising anything
seed slide and then but this also
enables us to do class unloading and g1
after the concurrent marking cycle and
then and every and since we removed
prohm Jenner we simplified all the data
types in hotspot we keep finding places
we can get rid of GC activity so we were
before a full collection we walk all the
stacks to fix the bytecode pointers we
don't have to do that anymore I still
haven't taken that code out but they
there's there's a bunch of code we can
just just not use anymore and we think
that we think just taking out things and
we keep finding things to do well will
improve performance and and actually
make the VM easy to deal with or was
simplified the VM yeah
there's still a couple pointers we we do
oops do we actually we have kind of a
weird modified card thing yes we have
actually a bit set in class that says
this mirror is in young gen so yes we
get it we have to we have to fix that so
that's why I want to move them because
we are moving walking in the classes and
be nice just put them all in the same
place and go you know fix the old or you
know fix them at that time we are we are
scanning we don't scan the classes like
linear through meta space we don't walk
through Metis space we have a linked
list of the classes in each class loader
and we go through each classes and go is
this mirror is this mirror an old gym
you know huh it's done in the last phase
of collection it's not it's not it's
done in the phase where you used to walk
the system dictionary so we're actually
not walking on the system the dictionary
of loaded classes we're actually not
walking that the whole dictionary
anymore as of there's a code review
request out for getting rid of that
right now
by Thomas schatzel so we keep finding
optimizations so from Java
programmatically programmatically you
can get to the amount of space in your
meta space the other space we're using a
motor space there's a metastasis manager
and X being there's there's one for
there's memory pools for both of these M
X Y a memory pool MX beans they're non
heap types I think to get at the perm
gen it was one of the heap type of XP
ins
I think number three we don't have that
any we there's no number three anymore
maybe was number two I can't remember
but so so if you have a programmatic way
that used to get
Jen you have to use this you have to
change your code and use this new
interface and we've added MX beans for
memory pool and these report the memory
usage like so the memory pool meta space
and memory polemics being its max value
as max Miller space size which is
unlimited so if you set something like a
high water usage threshold you know
notify me when this gets up to a certain
level you can still do that but don't
make it a percentage of max meta space
size because then it'll fail just like
one of the tests I'm working on we also
have the memory pool for compressed
class space and this guy this might be
useful to set a notification threshold
since it's a fixed size so you you might
want to do this if you have thresholds
and all that so we have other tools for
seeing what's in that space and in our
air shadow tools our tool set is fairly
thin right now because we keep moving
things around so we we have J map and
class stats it there's J stat GZ option
I think I've I don't know if anyone
thinks that's not a lame thing but um
so we report meta space we just have
something new in JDK 7 a J command and
you might have seen this another toxin
you can you can see what your java
program is doing with J command and we
have a lot of sub commands of Jacob ants
one of them is GC class stats and this
gives of extremely detailed where'd he
come from
so this gives an extremely detailed size
histogram of all the things in metaphase
and we're using it internally because
all the things in metastasis we're busy
making smaller for for both embedded
mostly from the embedded platform we
want to have zero amount of memory for
our class data which would be sort of
impossible but
so with this gives a detailed histogram
of every sizes it has this Comus csv
option which gives you a comma separated
list and you can read it up into a
spreadsheet that we've been using so so
jay commands is actually a new thing in
JDK 7 I believe and and JDK a and and so
this might be useful you should look
look up J command huh
you want better tools here we go so I I
don't I don't know if my mission control
friends are here but oh there you are
so so mission control actually mission
control right now this comes out better
on the big screen Menace space before
and after GC it'll show how much
medication using before and after GC we
have a guy in Stockholm right now and
he's actually acting reporting per class
loader how much metastasis are using in
in JFR and he's been he's been working
on this and and so this is gonna be
really nice when this comes out so it's
my plug for Mission Control
so yes it's a commercial feature so but
it's it's worth all that it's worth the
big bucks no it's a commercial future
you know and there's another mission
IntelliJ if our talks here that maybe
you guys have seen but um this will
report I'm out of space so I'm at the
end I don't have done--for time so the
meta space is now moved and be really
been relocated there's still a fixed
size there's some tuning flags that you
don't really need and you could probably
forget about unless you have across
loader leaks and then you have to go to
the top in an hour and see that but this
changed for us the motivation for this
change is it doesn't enable us to do a
ton of other things we could never do
before and one of them is class data
sharing which could be a whole nother
talk and
i predigest fits the class finally and
map them and share them between
processes and that improves startup
about that's a that's one of our startup
footprint improvements and we've been
working so next travel one come to that
talk I'm sure we'll have one and then we
can do a lot of optimizations we've also
been doing a lot of metadata size
reductions we noticed that a lot of
metadata is is more blended than we
thought it was which we didn't think we
have somebody make is shrinking our
metadata we didn't think she'd find
anything but she's she's been she's been
taking out like megabytes for like a
year now and she keeps finding things
and so everybody's kind of in on the
game too so everybody's like finally
like oh wait I found a byte that you can
compress this bite into this other bite
so this this actually the permanent
elimination makes this really easy to do
because you can you can create c++ types
without creating metadata for them
fermented metadata for the metadata and
so prim john has made this really really
nice project so oh oh well yeah that
good to this side um
so comments you know internal JVM sort
of comments Santa hats back to have our
bug system is open now I'm sure you've
seen all that I don't know
what the URL is but I do know what the
URLs but and so the the credits for this
project and we've been working in this
for like three years now at least
John's our project leader and he he kept
us all going and Stephan Michael Eric
Tom Roland also worked contributed a lot
to this there all this is all internal
but since we checked it about a year ago
now everybody that's contributing
hotspot is also on the perm gen project
so you are all invited to to join that's
it
what time is it Oh questions oh my god
it's so like 3:30 alright alright yeah
that's it go ahead with the reflection
class learners you can get have to like
like tekapo I was like 500 classes
oh I'm sorry the question was in my
experience how many class loaders do we
actually see an application we have the
the Fusion Middleware am I supposed to
talk about it
um we have an internal application that
has I don't know the number like there's
like 500 or so into Capo I mean that's
the only number I i know offhand but we
have quite a lot in internal or Oracle
stuff 4000 yeah yeah well actually
Nashua used to spin up a class loader
and with just one class in it for every
little snippet of code it wanted to run
thank goodness but when they did do that
it was a giant emergency and they were
like screaming at us and but that that
was we had like three million classes at
one point with like probably two million
class loaders so yes
the metadata um actually that was kind
of complicated I'm the class loader we
have we have the class loader in Java
and Java memory we have the mirrors so
we can find the we can find the class
loader from the mirrors and that marks
it and then there's some places where we
have metadata without the class loader
and in those places we've added the
class loader like you know in our
compiled code we'll have metadata that
points to other things in places like
that we've injected a new for the class
of the class loader route so that we can
find it there back traces we had to
inject mirrors in the back traces which
kind of stunk because it made our back
traces bigger and that's why I'm forced
because we were talking about back
traces last night but yeah we were we we
had to inject Mir either mirrors or
class floaters and in a variety places
to make sure the class letter stayed a
lot in the few cases and there's a
handful of cases where you'd have
metadata without a cross learner
somewhere where the collector will see
it
class over live that way and all the
classes loaded by that closed class mode
or alive so in that in that sense it's
it's still a Java object
I'm going to repeat I'm going to try to
repeat your question there's certain
classes in the JDK that keep that caused
classloader leaks by keeping thread
contact somebody wrote this down I'd
know nothing about this
ah
mmm-hmm but there is something that's
kept alive that you there's something
kept alive in the Java heat that you
know about right right right
but um I somebody take a note of this
because I have no idea I'll take a note
but I have no idea either so yeah yeah
yeah let us know this is service we get
it yeah we get that we get them in big
chunks from the system and then we
manage the chunks so the fragmentation
that we have is is our management so or
or you know you get it you get a chunk
of memory and you don't fill it up and
then then that class doesn't load and
that class loader doesn't load any more
classes there's some unused space at the
end so sizing the chunks is you know
it's sort of a it's another memory
management problem that we have so we
have any other questions
good yes we walk it for class unloading
yeah yeah but just not for our system
dictionary maybe yours have used to have
references to metadata and other objects
that you'd have to go and clean or
relocate and all that we don't have any
references to job objects in there
anymore
let me move somewhere else the string
tables still walked just not multiple
times anymore
but that was about oh the string tables
still in the string too but we still
walk the string table the string table
has loops in it no the string table no
actually the string table has always
been allocated in native yeah and see we
could put in metaphase actually no we
can't from the string table because a
string table well well no the string
table itself isn't really a per loader
thing the only thing we've been a meta
space is per loader things so we could
put we could put pieces of the system
dictionary in these meta spaces we could
have per loader dictionary entries as a
outs from outside know what visibility
do you want the sister this oh that's
that's a totally different project so
actually this
the string table has a there's a
parameter string table size which which
really really makes one of my co-workers
mad because you know you guys really
should not know our string table is a
hash table because what happens when we
change it to like I don't know a stupid
linked list or whatever you know like
your number of buckets are gonna help us
know yeah well you could see in the
first case but we could do nefarious
things yes absolutely yeah well the
default went up the default went up in
JDK 7 yes if it's still too small
actually the we have a change going
forward and it has a really unfortunate
option name but the change is this the
symbol table there's a symbol table and
a string table just simple tables too
small the symbol table is the jvm is
internal
yeah internal like yes symbol dictionary
every everything utf-8 read out of the
class files it goes into our assist our
symbol table and this guy is like it's a
hash table of the thousand nine buckets
and it's just wicked small yeah so we
haven't we have an option going in to
make it larger I think we should change
the default I don't know but we've been
actually going in but it has a weird
name it's not there's string table size
but this is we started putting in a
symbol table size but again we so many
on our project doesn't really want you
guys to know we have a hash table for
our symbol table yeah oh absolutely I
lastly we want to do the symbol table in
the system the symbol date of the system
dictionary in the string table are all
hash tables and we have a project to
make all of those guys growable on the
runtime list
yeah
no no it's still linked list it's still
a linked list yes yes the default has
this bigger yeah I don't even do the
symbol table at the same time that's
because you know the performance group
our performance group tells us what
numbers to use and they didn't tell us
anything big they don't tell us anything
about the symbol table so all this all
the symbols that you read out of class
files are utf-8 some strings uh-huh
exactly it's honorless flowerless can't
stop you can't yeah we're tunes give us
time
well we don't really we don't really
want people hacking into the internals
of the VM and knowingly knowing what
they are because because we have a lot
of we have a lot of people that like to
make a lot of changes to the M because
we keep finding things to do that are
that are good for performance and you
know we have an open JDK process so
everything we do is transparent so if
you get on this mailing list or that or
there's also one firm I said I just said
there's hot spot runtime dev as well and
there's hot spot - GC des and hot spot -
compiler dev and then hot spot to have
is everybody if you get on these mailing
lists you can see everything we're doing
yeah okay are there any other questions
general question yes
what time is it anyway
no no no we don't know we don't actually
have any numbers to show generally we're
scanning less when we do a full
collection we don't scan through all of
the permian so you know those the
numbers in general are better yeah
that's right you guys should ask
Johnston yeah at what time point oh it's
all still full GC any other questions
No thank you very much okay thanks very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
