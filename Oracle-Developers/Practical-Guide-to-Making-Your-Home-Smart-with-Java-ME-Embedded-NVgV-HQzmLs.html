for Java ME embedded from Saint
Petersburg Russia and I have a
co-presenter this is working yeah my
name is Alex to and from Oracle I'm
software engineer of Java me embedded
cool and we have two more guys who will
help us today
this is Valera and bamboo we're here we
will not speak today but they will show
us something
and let's start with tag of course web
safe harbor statement and let's imagine
the Scottish farmer who decided to start
to travel around the world however he
don't like to lose the control of his
farm and he decided to put a lot of
sensors across the field to control the
condition of soil and he made his
irrigation system smart so he will be
able to manage it remotely and he left
it and still can see what's going on his
ranch and farm he harvesting the wheat
and what usual Scottish farmers do with
wheat will do a whisky out of that of
course and here he need some some
control as well to be sure that the
amount of whiskey at the start of the
technology protests is the same at the
end of the
process because a lot of stuff in
Scotland we would like to decrease the
amount on the way and he need to to be
sure he keeps all his product and the
way and then after the distillation
process he need to deliver his product
to the customers right food delivery
company he puts it into the container
and he need to be sure that the nobody
would break in the container on the way
and the environment beside the container
fits the requirement of like whiskey
condition and she puts one smart device
inside of it the device is gathering
information of course and as soon as the
container has a connection to some
wireless network it sends human
information in he he gets it after it
delivered the distribution he need to
some he need you need to sell it obvious
and the best way to sale the sale is to
use a vending machines million questions
need to be connected at the Internet of
course to be able to send the
information about the amount of products
we have the
to report some security incidents and so
on so the mainland machine you need to
be connected as well and as soon as you
are Scottish farmer once a day you need
to medically treat your liver of course
and if you live far away in small
Scottish village it's very hard to find
a good doctor there so you need to
utilize the ability of the telemedicine
of course so in addition to all those
parts of his range farmer finally
started to be connected to internet as
well and of course his home need to be
connected to internet to help him to see
the energy and to be brilliant
convenient house today we'll speak more
about this part of the coming internet
of things I have been speaking about
that to emphasize that almost all
industries in the world very soon
already will be affected with the
Internet of Things phenomena I would say
with this so the Internet of Things all
kind of industries all kinds of
businesses will benefit out of Internet
of Things and could increase their
competitive and competitiveness however
with a lot of a lot of opportunities
Internet of Things will bring us a lot
of issues problems and challenges that
fragmentations will have lots of
different devices and a field and it's
very hard to manage them because the
software on them will be absolutely
different if I would use a native
devices for instance it's very hard to
to to communicate with different types
of devices the time to market is very
important thing as well and of course
the security they fear about the
incident of the baby monitor or breaking
vulnerabilities so some hackers break
into the baby monitor and screaming to
the children from the internet crazy
guys but anyway yeah the security is
very important think of in the internet
of things industry and we of course can
offer something here Java can solve not
all but most of those problems pretty
easily and we think that Java could
could satisfy all three corners of that
triangle because Java in with Java you
could have more quality software and
then we've compared to native
programming you can program faster and
it finally it will be cheaper for you
mostly of course that's important for
management but for what what we can
offer for developers with Java in the
web Java embedded you'll have of course
as always with Java you'll have the free
tooling if you would like to start
programming with some native devices in
95% of cases you need to buy the SDK you
need to buy tools you need to buy some
additional programmers like deployer for
the device of Java you can start
immediately just download from ot on our
platform and SDK and you're ready to
became an embedded developer Joe of
course it is a class cross platform we
have a gem above I have a Jemma we have
solar panel da which runs on
Raspberry Pi and it the same jar file
can run on key 70 platform so you can
use the same jar file on completely
different platforms and that's nice in
in a native world to have a security
features the most probably you need to
use the third-party libraries with Java
with Java embedded with Java mean be
that we offer the security in the
package with the platform you don't need
to use something external
but that and of course connectivity is
important for Internet of Things
germanium bálint offers you the
impressive amount of AP is for
connectivity as well
however Java embedded however the
devices in the field can be completely
different sizes some devices are really
big some are small and it's not
reasonable to use the same Java platform
for for both of them and we have two
solutions now it's Java embedded and
Java ME embedded jonathan i see embedded
the the full stack of java symbol it
requires 32 Meg's of RAM now to run and
45 max of Rome and Java ME embedded
recently yesterday actually we released
Java and me embedded 8.1 earlier access
for free scale k70 free scale k70 as you
can see it's a very small platform very
very cheap it is cortex m4 with 256
kilobytes of RAM compare it to the 32
Meg's of RAM and the only one make of
Rome it has a SD card but it's not in
the scope of our platform actually so we
are really really small but we offer the
a really rich rich api's for you we'll
see what are they
where can we run currently we have
several several implementations from
Oracle it is way on the screen actually
it is Kyle board on the left bottom
corner welcome internet of everything
platform on the right bottom corner it
is actually STM STM discovery board we
did a developer's preview for the
previous version but haven't yet
released it actually and that's what I
said this is a free scale okay 64 what
it's very small and you can use Arduino
shields of that also with Java ME
embedded however those are the platforms
for development we are not for the
industry use you might be interesting
what kind of solutions we have for
industry and that's how the industry
solution works looks like this is a
Gemalto wireless module it is a cortex
processor inside it runs Java me
embedded 3.2 and those type of modules
used in a lot of a lot of different
projects for connection fluid for the
wireless networks for the GSM or some
other and it has the processor and GSM
module you just need to power it and
like drop out the antenna and your
solution is ready you can program
develop on Java inside of it it ok let's
move forward
yeah and of course we support the
Raspberry Pi platform why we decided to
do it because it's a quite rich platform
who has the Raspberry Pi actually in
that room uh-huh
most of them that strange that left part
has raspberry PI's and the right part
doesn't
Raspberry Pi is a Broadcom processor
briefly like 512 max of Rome USB ports
HDMI ports pretty rich platform and not
really expensive we're not dead
however do you remember I said that we
are running on 256 keys and here we have
almost a half of gigabyte of RAM isn't
it the overkill like why do we utilize
use so restful so powerful platform for
Java ME because just it's very cheap the
basic version of the Raspberry Pi is $25
only and it's really widely widely used
so we made that port for Java a minute
so the developers can use it using the
raspberry PI's as well in addition to
those both different interfaces
raspberry has a GPO general purpose
input general purpose input output pins
so you can program them and do whatever
you want whether blink the LED or
probably launch the Rockets that doesn't
matter
Alex you need to be prepared actually
yeah and then Alex won't finish the GPIO
pins yep GPU is very powerful platform
so let's do the small practical guide
how to make a small
home smart using Joey me in bed of
course we have a lot of GPIO pins or
another one interfaces on a Raspberry Pi
so using these pins in programming this
piece we can for example - no - no no -
no filete but we also we can send a
rocket to the space or something like
that so all right now we are trying to
you know turn on a LED using GP open but
for start just imagine if we don't have
a Raspberry Pi or another one hardware
is Jeremy in by it what you should to do
does anyone try to program small and by
the device on native languages such as C
or C++ or something like that
Oh only one and so if you don't have a
device what you do cry right my it so
you can start just you can write a small
program on C C++ but you don't have a
runtime you you can't run it but if you
if you don't have Java nearby the device
we have Java in the SDK and in Java me
is decay we have good device emulator so
just imagine we have bought a Raspberry
Pi on for example Amazon on eBay and
right now this device is delivering to
us but so what you can run a little tree
and this is a very important feature of
Java ME embedded so if you are going to
make your solution based in Java ME
embedded how in native word that that
works usually you need to decide on the
platform before before you start
development you need to agree with the
manufacturer that we will build for you
such device and if you have such device
after
that you need to start to make your
development with Jeremy you can start
development simultaneously with the
design and in development the device
because the runtime is the same on your
device and the emulator and Alex forgot
to mention that for GPO on native
platforms we of course we can program
GPO like the right and some like writes
to the to the hardware devices the
registers with Java offer you the high
level API strapper it with GPO and some
other interfaces such high to C or SPI
interfaces and now Alex will show us how
Java me and that works on emulator
before and after that he will run the
same code on Raspberry Pi remotely right
all right so let's create a simple
device simulator it's a custom device
emulator using Java EE is the key so
let's call it a raspberry mu for example
okay so do s configuration so this is
the view tall motion and libraries and
device profile MEAP okay so we need to
add a GPIO pin we can assign idea I know
20 ID 25 is the same as ID on a
Raspberry Pi it's written on in our
documentation okay
probably Alex we need to give a little
bit more description what they are going
to do this this is the emulator but this
emulator doesn't have any interfaces at
the beginning and so what Alex did Alex
add to the emulator device 1 GPO pin
with the characteristic you can see on
the screen and after that he will be
able to work with that GOP GPIO pin like
it is the real device right
I know how do I port number it's zero
how do I P number is 25
it's from documentation we need to
output pin because we need to control a
lat for example triggers for events
smell it's okay initial value so it's
okay and just wait a second and it's
created and it's a Puritan Java me is
the key device selector so we can run
our NetBeans ID in NetBeans we have to
add java me SDK Java platform and our
you know eight device is appear here
it's raspberry emulator so then we can
create a Java ME embedded application
that's called test application for
example okay okay just select your
raspberry Emma later it's a build here
and finish so it's a little bit small a
little bit smaller I can make it much
bigger right now remembrance 80 is okay
you okay yeah and you can click control
shift enter there remember yeah so where
is my device okay
so enjoy me in whether we have a little
bit different application model we don't
have a public static void main in MEP
application but we have mid leads with
startup and destroy it's because of in
one Java ME embedded runtime we can use
several methods in different easily it's
okay instant application we can do
anything you want right now I just
create a GPIO pin using device access a
pas
we have a device manager is a big
factory we can obtain or whatever we
want on this device I can open my GPIO
pin by ID at least 25 as I remember
so okay so okay we have an GPIO pin and
let's try to turn it on and turn it off
for I don't know five five times
okay we have a would just pin set well
true then wait a second
and set it to false so that it should
turn off okay and wait a second to see
you the result so it's okay it's not the
best practice so max at the end we have
to notify destroy it so our application
of you will be destroyed on device so
the sole do we need the clothes pin we
can attend it we can assure you can use
actually use the try beverage sources
now
Oh Alex could you help me aware is in my
device you don't have your device
section okay
control shift and Andrew Thank You Elsa
so federal presentation mode of NetBeans
so to run application just run a project
and our test application there is a
device selector window which will appear
in NetBeans as you installed the
netbeans plugin for any SDK and then
that window you can pick the device you
would like to deploy your application
just said
see the project name and the mid-late
will be deployed and run on the device
directly okay of course don't forget
about our security we can just open our
devices before getting all permissions
it's a security model we have to do that
so you just go to the application
description of our project and add all
necessary permissions that we want to
use actually so at the device management
permission is what what permissions
actually do what what permission
actually do these permissions are
protecting our resources of our pins or
peripheral networking and so on and so
on
so these permissions protect us from
unauthorized access to the resources for
example device management permission can
protect for opening GPIO pins repair
ports buses and so on so if you make
your own platform you can protect from
bad guys so yeah how it works actually
if you you are making the platform you
can say that on that platform I'm only
allowed to run applications which has
which signed by some certificate right
and for that applications signed by a
specifically certificate you said that
applications signed that that
certificate are allowed to use on the
this set of API so that that's what Alex
do now he gives the application ability
to use an API on the device and you can
say that for those guys that this
certificate I allowed them to use the
i2c interface for instance to reach
either CC answers for
the guys you probably can allow to use
UART to access some other sensors so you
are really flexible now with the
security model and javaee me yes right
so after that we can run our application
I know that I need additional on
permission it is for GPO permission
because I can open it but I know I can't
operate work in no actually it's working
show us the emulator
yep screen yep it's just my latest you
know I forgot about it this is an
emulator this is our pin here yep good
Cody Alex run your application run show
application and running and the status
is changing here from high to low this
our application is running you can add
different type of interfaces here and
see what's going on with them
okay so it's not right right now just
close our emulator and let's use our
real device so once you have the device
you can use it ok for the start we have
to you have to run Java ME budget
runtime
you know Raspberry Pi you can just
download Java me in by the runtime from
oracle.com Oracle development Network
and run it so I have a me eight runtime
here so it's called new meat original
and just just run small script
okay it's running so I know IP address
of this device I just add device here
the Jumeirah and time is different
- Joey see if you run Joey me run time
it starts our like EMS system
application management system also so
any SDK is able to connect to the
runtime and do the some management of
applications it can install applications
run applications top applications remove
applications which you don't have with
Java C actually so right now we have a
connected device and it's appeared in
NetBeans in device selector and we can
run our applications or just to run test
application and you should see magic
magic yeah I believe it
okay no I'm not running not running why
something wrong maybe it is all secure
all figures oh security device
management division of all this little
bit different
peel port names okay let's make our life
easier we can ask about permission for
all GPIO pins okay that's a good idea
it's very good only for development
purposes
don't forget it's it's not the best
practices here is just a test
application to manage our GPIO pins okay
it's a magic yeah yeah yeah it works so
so so it's working and for another one
interface such as ITC SPI we we can use
the same way to program it and use it in
our prototypes on some selected okay
yeah that was just a simple petition and
current version of Java amis Java me
embedded and Germany embedded eight it
was a revolution and in a me embedded
actually with Java ME embedded for
developers we provide such amazing
amazing set of features right you can
see that assertion generics for each
loop out a boxing in on marks static
campus so you can probably laugh a
little bit because yeah Java me used to
be used to like as the Java five
probably and with Java 8 we aligned the
api's and the language features almost
all with Java SE embedded so your
experience with Jeremy will be almost
the same like with Java SE with some
exceptions of course yeah yeah and we
don't have a reflection
theorization and some other features
which you probably frequently use with
Java SE however it's always the it's
always making a decision where we go
like we are from the product management
side would like to put a lot of features
to the product and keep it thin keep it
light and
not always agree with us Howard says the
favorite terraces joke
so I sent you like the requirement like
the thousand of requirements the
development development sees the
developers will not be able to use the
products with such amount of features
the coffin yeah I forgot to put the
easy-to-use requirement that and yeah
it's always it's always how it says
trade off
whether footprint or features and we had
to remove something we can't be the same
as TR AC because we're ants on two
hundred and fifty eight kilobytes yeah
for Java C is a big win ten max I think
we have with compact one and for us 256
K it's not like the end point probably
we can do even smaller I said we're not
support all the the set of api's of Java
C however in addition to you know Java C
api's we we give developers some
additions as device access what Alex
demonstrate as you are able to access
the device hardware interfaces from Java
we have a generic connection frameworks
which allowed which allowed the platform
makers to make the flexibility to have
the flexible instrument for the
different connection protocols and we
have a security model and of course we
have the portion layer which allowed us
to port the platform from one one one
hardware platform to another pretty
easily so we see that we have a lot of
features let's see what can we make the
that Alex what what we have now yeah we
have a demo actually we have used a
small part in our practical guide is
only one GPIO pin so this demo contains
an i2c
thermal sensor this demo contains and GP
or relate to control for example this
heater or hairdryer and we have an odd
communication with GP reduce shield to
send SMS or HTTP data to the backend on
something coexist but right now we are
sending SMS messages so let's wait make
it workable so go to our raspberry pi
you know this one I think so just
disable Itsuki and run in Java we have
another one Java instance with
pre-installed application just running
as usual way ok it's working and we can
connect to AMS console this Alex
connects to the runtime as SDK do but
using a comment line yep same it's more
convenient for me so and I can run them
I ok ok it's right so
you just want to you to send SMS which
takes on to this number if available
just just text on to their the donor
phrase the prices are the same we will
not charge you additionally yeah and
actually I have this such setup on my
data on my country house so I I don't
have a wireless connection there so I'm
able to manipulate with the heater by
SMS yes somebody somebody sent an SMS or
key and now we will know who have the
fastest fingers yeah congratulations
you've won a backpack the fastest
fingers you have an additional job and
backpack now congratulations I told you
don't afraid to send SMS ok I is not at
all so the next one we have another one
stand ok bees Joe is he in by the device
and just you can actually show the
slides the app where is the full scheme
of the setup here ok so we have the
second stand with Java is him wait and
this is Alex's yeah yeah how my house
looks like if I wouldn't switch the
heater on before go and there I told you
don't use hairdressers free house ok so
we have a big deal is common
communication or Wi-Fi and the one
device is just try to guess in all
information such as i2c GPU art and try
to send SMS messages and so on so on and
the second device just to demonstrate I
was an idiot
which wasn't wrong the system not the
system but okay switch switch off I
called okay it's working working what
yeah it should work it's blowing I agree
okay yeah that's that's that the setup
what I actually have at my country home
so I could send an SMS and to turn on
the heater of course the best way to
heat the house is to use a hairdryer you
know and as soon as the temperature will
reach the threshold we please hear Alex
what was the threshold oh yeah that
probably works you can you can show how
I'm going to data and would like to hit
it on okay I just want to send yes
amazing
yeah and we just send in that
information to the view written on
JavaFX
father I don't know yeah that's pretty
fast it's reached like 35 Celsius and
switch the system of very simple so you
can use it at your country home or at
your apartment if you would like Java if
I used the scene builder - right yeah
it's on and as soon as it's going below
35 degrees trying to switch it switch it
back on yeah yeah you can write the view
using Java effects and connected to Java
me we we use Wi-Fi for that and you can
see the temperature and different rooms
for instance at your country home and
you you are able to switch the heater on
and off by use SMS we have actually
posted the full description of
working with thermal sensor with ITC
thermal sensor at our block blocks dot
oracle.com / Java ME you can go there
and check how it works it's really
simple you can do it and if you would
like to know more just here and
gentlemen we'll have a hands-on lab with
Alex on Thursday I know
Thursday's a hard day this week but we
will show how to read the data sheets of
that I to see chip understand the
protocol how to connect the toad to that
and then how to write the Java in the
application using all that information
to get temperature out of that and if we
have a time we'll probably send that
information somewhere that I think
that's all we have now if you have a
question that's our pleasure to answer
it so it's theater li that can switch
on/off switch or some powerful devices
and we can control solid-state relay
using a GPIO pin just to be open without
any additional rate-o-matic so it's it's
really it's it's pretty effective right
it's very powerful yeah it's very
powerful it is can switch ON switch over
battery right
this one is 40 amps yeah it's it's very
powerful for is 45 power yeah it is not
more than the power of GPIO pin on
Raspberry Pi GPIO pin is 22 milli milli
amps I think all microbes milliamps
if you want to have the same setup
without AC power just the only DC power
yeah yes
you don't need actually you just to use
a regular hair dryer we need to use the
power from SMS it's pretty easy actually
we are using your serial interfaces in
our deal ApS is our API isn't Jeremy
invited provides access to all
peripherals and the sealant phases work
actually so and we bought simcom model
and it can communicate using 80 comments
so so we just listening serial port on
SMS messages yeah well let em send you
80 comments to that right and then parse
then input also we can send HTTP
messages or something like that this one
is this one we are using the working
stream API will be just blocked on data
so we are pollination yeah yeah but but
you know we can use even driven API it's
not a problem just is this way when we
have system user states is very
convenient to use polling sure rights
right yeah right
don't read it but we're pretty fast on
very small devices yeah
yeah well well well well we'll post the
we waited for these slides and you can
see and we have a even like 10% discount
for the chalk board this is sec a sieve
of JavaFX we don't have any UI for java
me for our program for our program it's
I know it's pretty small so I actually
we can see so here here's what's because
I don't know unfortunately I don't know
exactly right now but I know 50
kilobytes or 100 kilobytes in the room
100 terabytes is quite big yes here is
quite big busy is the fashion our test
applications very small action so our
demo is maybe bigger
okay
if you're interested in some stuff come
to our booth and DMI area of a bicycle
and tomorrow we will have a talk about
that green power green power raspberry
pi here I think as well thanks a lot
thanks for coming guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
