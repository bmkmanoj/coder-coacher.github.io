our session I'm Frederick from Morocco
I'm based in Paris in France and will be
presenting this morning with SD micro
about some work we've done for the home
gateway smart gateway and the technology
we have developed around the RAM java so
i'm presenting with oleg la vina from st
oleg good morning my name is Oleg Laguna
vs red candy presented me and I'm
located in sunny piscataway new jersey
and travel around the world pretty much
all the time st you probably heard the
name of the company but really where do
you find us where do you find our
products i think it will be very hard to
identify a place where you wouldn't find
our products our products is this today
in wearable devices and fitness type of
applications our semiconductors empower
our daily lives and our smart homes in
our entertainment devices automotive is
one of the key areas where st is very
strong smart grid applications
industrial applications power components
if you look around the world on spectrum
of the products enabled today by steve
it's really a very wide and broad
portfolio of products that make sense
and allow you to not only make the life
more comfortable more efficient but also
meant it with the features that really
increase our productivity our exposure
to convenience factors while becoming
more efficient on a daily basis with our
energy use so what would be talking
about in the in the next hour is a full
environment we have jointly developed
with st a color universal development
kit for smarter moments of building
application so what it is about it's
about putting together a bunch of
technologies including s microchip sets
with a chipset dedicated to power-aware
application called stream plug on top of
this cheap chart will
leveraging the Java I see embedded
technology to run some framework osgi
based framework to develop application
and all this is integrated and put
together into a gateway you can see the
form factor of the gateway that was
developed by a partner called Tatham and
of course it wouldn't be a complete
solution if we didn't include the
services that enable this gateway to run
that enable this gateway to be managed
and this service will be developing in
the data center and in the cloud so all
these together create this development
kit and the solution we have for this
home and building application and Oleg
you wanna show you want to show
something yes it will be hard to be
hardware company making chips and not
too short piece of hardware so what you
see inside of this little white box
produced by tattooing is really a very
small board and this is really hard to
this device this is a hard to trance
java an osgi framework and enables all
this variety of wonderful applications
that can bring very interesting things
to our market so as you've been around
the java one and the oracle open world
conference you probably have noticed
that oh I call is focusing a lot on
developing solution and technology for
the Internet of Things and what
representing today's is part of this
part of this initiative as you can see
on these slides developing for the
internet of things require and will
create new challenges for the people
developing the code and developing the
application some of these challenges are
shown on the picture i will just point
out a couple of them on which we have
more focused for the project with that
we are presenting today everything
relating to power management is very
important security is another important
issue as soon as you have devices
in the open air or in non secure
environment you need to clearly focus on
on security and having the ability to
execute locally some code some Java code
of course is also important because
these devices will be deployed in great
numbers in millions in some cases so we
need to have some local intelligence
able to manage the staff manage the data
before leveraging the services on the
backend as I like mentioned the Gateway
that has been developed by item on st
chipset is based on on java we've been
using the java embedded platform which
is a special version of the java SE
technology adapted for embedded system
when I say adapted it mean it has been
ported in the case we are describing
today it has been ported to arm-based
cpus it has been ported to some Linux
for embedded system and optimized for
the use in embedded embedded application
the platform that have been developed is
targeting the smart home and the smart
building it means it includes special
features that enabled to manage the
power to connect to the power
electricity network and it's developed
in a way that it can be used in
different type of application and
connect to different type of sensors
inside the home the application of
course being whatever the the developer
I able to develop and the integration
work that has been done as an objective
to facilitate the creation of these
these services
so you have a summary of the way the
Gateway will be integrated it will be
installed at home and part of a network
of sensors and application running
inside the inside the house part of the
development kits include tools for the
developers so that the equation
integration deployment and management of
application is facilitated when both the
Gateway the development tools and the
different mobility device that enable
users to interact with the system I also
connected to the cloud where you can
interact with the application and manage
different services in the Gateway for
this platform we use we've used the
latest version of the java SE embedded
platform which is version 8 you may have
heard about this technology during the
java one conference the most important
feature for embedded system that is part
of this Java 8 delivery is the fact that
since Java 8 we have now what we call
compact profiles and the ability to
deploy a subset of the big July see
platform into this embedded device
reducing the footprint reducing the
resources necessary to run the platform
and this is the first step toward the
odd reality of the Java platform that is
a long-term effort Oracle as I started
mostly to address the new needs of this
embedded platform and Internet of Things
platforms so this Java platform is
deployed as one of the main software
technology on the device that Oleg will
be presenting now thank you for direct
good well first of all I would like to
present a question to the audience we're
talking about Internet of Things and you
probably hear Internet of Things a lot
in conjunction with Java
action was cloud support platforms but I
really would like to ask you a question
how many of you see a very clear
difference between as an example what we
typically find in vertical applications
where devices communicate with devices
communicate with some kind of database
on the back end versus and IOT world and
IOT applications how many of you see a
clear difference can you raise hands
okay what is the difference in opinion
okay how about you okay how about you I
so one more hand okay I agree with you
but only partially I think what you gave
is a correct answer but it's only a part
of the answer in my opinion the real
differentiating factor between ihe world
and typical vertical application is a
fact that the same platform is now
starting to cut across multiple vertical
domains presenting the data to multiple
applications that traditionally would
reside in different domains let's take a
look at a smart home as an example which
sources very crowded pictures at
Frederick presented before right we had
door locks we had energy management we
had wearable devices entertainment I
mean the list probably is about hundred
items long but traditionally all of
those services all of those applications
were a part of a specific vertical it is
your security companies that provides
you with monitoring if you home from the
point of view of intrusion it is your
service provider cable or otherwise that
provides you with entertainment it is
maybe utility working with you somehow
to help you to manage energy and the
list goes on so you have a vertical
connection confined to a vertical
creation with the IT world we're
crossing those boundaries we actually
eliminating those boundaries which
presents another challenge that has to
be imposed on the device that is sitting
inside of your home because now you have
to starburst the data and also receive
commands and suggestions from multiple
directions xela by itself creates a
necessity for a very flexible and very
advanced platform that can be easily
configurable and easily managed
applications that we need to create
inside of this environment specifically
designed to cater to each one of those
verticals that is why we thought that
using java and osgi running on the top
of java was a very good idea if you look
at the stack of applications that exists
today in the device that we are
presenting we essentially integrate on a
platform of Java the ability to abstract
very many interface levels using osgi
framework so we become agnostic whether
we're using zigbee z-wave homeplug Wi-Fi
sub gigahertz wireless bluetooth and the
list goes on we can take data objects
that would be residing on each one of
those technologies agree give them in
one unified platform and network and
through that we can actually achieve
abstraction and integration and
convergence of applications running
traditionally in very different
verticals that's to me a really an
identifier of Internet of Things
starting to happen in a smart home
you're right we need devices with
constrained resources because we would
like better your life to never run out
and perhaps to harvest energy but i
think the ability to cater to many
applications is by far even more
important because that's what enables
economy of scale and if you will your
smartphone today is a good example of
how convergence of many applications
takes place in a single platform if you
take your smartphone empowerment we had
it's your entertainment device it's a
device that can provide you with weather
information to devise that you can use
for
payments it's a device that as an
example in city of Boston is used to
identify potholes on the road simply by
monitoring accelerometers and your GPS
very simple right so the same thing in
my opinion will to start taking place in
the smart home by allowing us to
converge many of those applications on
the same platform which took one more
step forward we actually looked at
another vertical that needed to be
integrated into this ecosystem home
automation is one of them energy
management is another one and
traditionally they existed in the
separate areas when you control your
blinds it's one system produced by a
specific vendor confined to itself and
when you talk about reading as an
example information premia energy meter
in home it's another application
confined to another vertical managed by
utility you may have heard about smart
energy profile except to another way
smart initial profile was a data
abstraction technology developed several
years ago and today it exists as a
standard tonight you play called 2030
that five and the purpose of this
technology was to enable the different
appliances different devices that may
exist in your home to interchange
information without actually knowing
physical properties of the device we
thought it was a good idea to combine
power of osgi and java platform where
the data abstraction is already achieved
for her motivation purposes and layer
into it smart energy profile so devices
that have been created for the energy
management purposes now can start
talking to other devices that have been
created for home automation and other
purposes so when you look at this
picture what you see is a foundation of
courses java embedded here on the top we
have osgi open services gateway
initiative platform that is running on
top of it we use one produced by company
called processed in germany and on the
top we have specific stocks that
effectively are responsible for the
integration of networking protocols such
as zinc busy way Bluetooth and in a very
similar fashion we integrated smart
energy profile as it now becomes a
look-alike of any other
network devices can be abstracted in the
same framework of course then you see
home device manager home to mission
managers are the typical components of
the framework that exist in osgi today
so how does it all work and how does it
all interact from the point of view of
as an example service as well as a point
of view of developer well from the point
of view of a service provider what you
have is a very simple one to one
relationship you have your cpe device
your gateway device whatever way you
would like to call it and then through
the JSON RPC WebSockets way interface
was a cloud enabling secure channel but
going back to what I discussed before we
can create a starburst we can interface
with multiple applications using the
elements of osgi framework we
essentially can create service bundles
that will be specifically catering to
specific applications and each bundle
can be responsible for a different
service with a different ownership of
the service and by the way I'm not going
to talk about it today but keep in mind
that we need to manage identity identity
of the device identity of service
consumer data consumer and by the way I
would encourage you tomorrow to listen
to the session hosted by my colleagues
talking about jama card which kind of
falls into the same category of identity
management which is a very very
important element as we're going from a
vertical confinement where everything
belongs to the same service provider sir
service operator into the world where we
essentially blend the boundaries of
verticals and create unified platform
working for everybody so how does it
work from developers point of view and I
hope many of you here are developers
that would be interested in this
discussion so see elements is that we
are presenting to the world right one of
them is of course user interface
extensions that we manage through
JavaScript it is json-rpc bundles that
we have developed to essentially allow
for browser capable methods for data
exposure to the cloud and service
bundles which essentially is a packages
of Java code that exists in osgi
framework and designed to support very
specific application for each service
let's go back a little bit to the use
case how does it all work we talked
about smart energy profile we talked
about energy management what are the
actors that participate in the creation
of any type of decision or command that
may be imitated or initiated in this
environment we have of course and
potential in the future some kind of
energy storage we have in 10 displays
that tells us what's going on it could
be either on screen display and you HEV
it could be smartphone app it could be
just some things that hangs almost like
a nest thermostat on your wall or maybe
something else we have solar panels we
have appliances we have electric meter
and of course we have utility that can
be through the internet connected to
this environment so you have a lot of
actors is it exchanged by directional
information with everybody utility is
providing you with information related
to as an example automatic demand
response events shortage of energy you
need to reduce the power consumption you
get a command from the utility or
suggestion from zhe lady dependent on
your service plan your meter tells you
what is your real time consumption your
solar inverter tells you how much energy
is actually available is it the cloudy
day or is it the sunny day or maybe is
there is a dust storm that kind of
reduces the power output how much energy
have in storage what kind of appliance
you have and this appliance needs to be
working continuously it can be shut down
so very many elements that go into this
decision-making process as to when you
try to accomplish something so let's
talk about an example in this framework
of thermostat controlling temperature
right how complicated could it be it's a
thermostat you decided on the
temperature setting and you have your
furnace or air conditioner everything
should be simple one-to-one relationship
not at all it used to be but if we would
like to live in a more energy-efficient
world and more a much more comfortable
word there is a lot more that goes into
this decision-making process so let's
try to follow
once again the actors as I mentioned
before we have utility supplying
information through the energy services
interface so you know how much you paint
for kilowatt hour at any given moment of
time or will be later you have meters
that tells you how much he actually
consuming instantaneously you have your
thermostats it tells you actually yes
temperature is at your comfort level oh
it needs to be higher or lower and the
load itself which is basically the
device that turns on and off right it's
your furnace or air conditioner so once
you get information from utility you
know what your tariff with your schedule
of prices is then you have some things
that you display on your in-home display
whatever factor it is then your
thermostat kicks in and tells you what
you need to do turn it on off or
whatever and after that you make a
decision inside of a gateway in the
lubes that actually process all of this
information and decides whether or not
the load needs to be turned off or maybe
you can tolerate discomfort of higher or
lower one or two degrees because you can
save so much energy so C is this is all
about being informed about making
decisions and being able to adjust your
behavioral patterns without impacting
your comfort level too much in such ways
that you can actually produce some
things that results in two additional
dollars in your pocket so that's a
purpose and this is essentially the idea
behind the creation of smart and as your
profile and integration for the home
automation so now you can orchestrate
cooperation of many devices within the
home how they can work together and this
is actually a more elaborate example
where as you can see how it all folds
together and how to follow through the
framework so I mentioned before we have
Java on the type of job we have osgi
which has service bundles and we also
have smart energy profiles that has been
integrated underneath of it with the
exposure into the osgi framework through
the standard hdmi adapter so as you can
see here once we decide to do something
from web admin can console we decided to
add the device we create an HTM adapter
which is a part of the framework and ohg
I then we connected to the protocol
driver set 2.0 driver is connected to
the protocol stack that resides
underneath the Java it actually existed
learnings the main and written in C and
then the application of smart energy
profile is launched as you can see it
all follows back through now we can go
through the API cool to change
essentially in temperature settings so
we're we're creating device event in the
osgi framework we execute it and finally
the load gets a command and execute it
so this is kind of a mirror image what
were followed through before I know it
might be a little bit cumbersome and
complicated but it really flows so
nicely just to give you a look into more
depth of what's actually inside of this
smart energy profile to integration into
the framework as we discussed before on
the top of it we have an application
right or a GI was bundled supporting
smart energy profile java and then
underneath of it smart energy profile to
application with the relevant stocks
that actually in parallel go to all of
the interfaces that can be running IP
capable smart energy profile information
looks a bit cumbersome but at the same
time it's quite simple so how does this
demo work we don't have a demo here but
i'll show you actually a small video
later in the presentation that shows you
how you can configure launch and pull it
all together and by the way once again
as i mentioned before this is a little
gateway that is available today for
purchase you can buy it online and you
can play with java and osgi and smart
energy profile and make your old home
much smarter so how does it work we take
as an example from grid to home another
startup company in
as it make smart energy profile we embed
the server into our application so we
have a device thermostat we have a
device that is load we have
configuration here we can figure it
server so now server is running and is
capable of issuing json-rpc commands now
we need to register resources what are
the resources well the resources are
thermostat load and light as an example
another type of load so we can drag and
drop them into the framework and
everything is the figure everything is
ready to run so if we start looking into
the device management console inside of
the OSGi framework all of a sudden smart
energy profile device which normally
would have been completely standalone
separated from our ji framework appears
just about the same way as any other
device would have appeared in this
framework those are framework devices
native framework devices and this is a
smart energy profile as you can see they
all look alike and that allows us
integrated management of smart energy
profile devices and other devices what
methods and controls that we need to
implement to accomplish that well it's
very simple head device remove device
device count so we can actually account
for what we have in the framework and
we're using some standard already
available in the osgi framework classes
that allow us to probe into the device
using as an example device class object
get device class object command or as an
example set property of the device so
those are very standard framework at
prayer operands and classes that allow
us to manipulate smart energy profile
device is very much same way as you
would operate any other device as I
mentioned before we have three major
elements so let's try to drill down a
little bit into how each one of those
elements work if we look at you I
extensions we talked about JavaScript
and graphical interface so how does it
work well as you can see
here it's a pretty standard codes that
you normally would see running on your
UI and JSON RPC call subsequently from
here that essentially allows you to
create an edition of this device into
the Java framework as simple as that we
go through the device edition now we
need to set up the status of the device
right as you can see add new thermostat
function call and device is there so
essentially as you can see is the
operation of this type of adapter is
exactly the same if you're familiar with
osgi framework as any azure HDM adapters
that you would use for this application
an interesting and kind of informative
is to take a look at network
transactions that take place if you
connect Wireshark as an example to the
network interface running between the
two devices and you look at what's
happening between the Gateway and client
device that you use that's kind of what
transpires running from one point to
another you using those requests it's
just interesting because it kind of
illustrates how the live interaction
among the devices take place yes yes
please that's the beauty of what we're
trying to propose see we're positioning
this device actually as some things that
could be like a raspberry pi for
automation applications industrial and
whore motivation of locations and the
fact that we obstructing communication
networks from you with osei framework
essentially means that you become
communication technology agnostic this
system will use just about anything you
have you have x 5 will use Wi-Fi we have
homeplug it will use comp luck it will
use igby or anything else that you
configure it and all of those adapters
communication technology adapters will
be populated depending on the survey of
the interfaces on the startup so you
already know from
to get go what you hell what you don't
have does it answer your question hmm
well the system assumes is that you have
something already on the other end right
obviously if you have a regular light
bulb it will not talk but we entering
the world where light bulbs again in
communication capability Fifth Circuit
thermostats and those technologies vary
as an example light bulbs in many cases
would be z-wave zigbee in some cases
Wi-Fi in some cases homeplug but as long
as it is IP capable technology and more
importantly if it is smart energy
profile capable technology which becomes
kind of a standard for energy management
purposes that creates almost seamless
integration you don't need to think
about configuration that's a whole point
of this exercise there was another
question so smart and your portfolio's
yes yes you you can query the device you
can essentially survey all of the
devices available as long as they are on
AP network and they have capability to
do smart energy profile communication
they will advertise their capabilities
and that's a you see it's almost like a
smart energy profile is one of the
attempts and I think it's a good example
of an attempt to create semantic
interoperability among the devices that
natively are produced in very different
verticals and in different fashion but
you're trying to isolate yourself from
communication technologies they need to
know how to configure communication
network and focus actually own device
property capabilities rather than
anything else so how does it do with as
an example browser methods very simple
so a very simple example very simple
JSON RPC co-registration and
as you can see here we define how we
actually have a procedure to add device
definition very concise very simple very
short service bundle that's actually
that component that resides in the
embedded environment and is responsible
for what is happening with the device if
you look at a bundle API which
essentially is a part of an osgi
framework you can see a list of
unfortunately this picture is not very
clear my apologies but basically this is
this is a list of classes and api's that
exist that you can leverage in order to
be able to access into the bundle the
reasonable likewise you have framework
for this application as I said we need
to start birth date and we need to
communicate with multiple application we
can have a bundle for each specific
application and leverage the power of
that very nicely this little video will
show you essentially how the device
framework is brought up how it is
configure it and how it goes through if
I want to know how to launch the video
it works can you see this the font no
not really me neither can i well the
purpose of this video was actually to
show you we've gone through as a
configuration of client-server device
we've gone through the installation of
HDM adapter the purpose of this video
was to show you is that how in five
minutes using this technology you can
actually configure a service without
doing a tremendous development work so
the point of using java and osgi
framework is not only convenience of
start bursting the data but allowing
yourself to do design acceleration
arriving at working system
a very very short period of time so in
those previous slides we just configured
as a server which is a gateway side and
now we're configure in the device side
I'm sorry we're still in the server but
then we'll configure a device side and
that is it all those elements already
exist in Java egi framework and are
there for you to use and that's one of
the greatest conveniences of this
technology it's not only convenience to
exposure to multiple classes of data but
convenience of design acceleration is ID
is designed once three you as many times
this a little bit more visible but I
don't think that's actually readable
right there is no limitation from a
count point of view it's all dependent
on how much memory you would like to use
and what is actually the interaction
with the devices it will be limited for
each specific physical Network by the
maximum number of nodes and the network
as an example for networks like Wi-Fi
homeplug it's probably not practical to
go above 256 devices in zigbee world
it's probably more like 512 or thousand
per per specific cluster of the network
from the point of view of intensity of
data exchange of course if you bundle
video camera for video surveillance
applications you know processing video
feeds from more than three four cameras
at the same time is not really practical
because it will chew too much processing
power and it's not practical from a
human perception point of view so let me
fast forward so we talked about how this
framework enables an application
development and this is a concept of a
product that we're working on as an
ecosystem of several companies such as
grid to home processed of course oracle
and st as well as tattooing and arcadis
as well as a clicker technologies so as
you can see we're leveraging the power
of cloud with very nice and sleek up
vacation running on your smartphone or
tablet we have local access we have
remote access but what does it do well
it sounds a very practical problem how
many of you have homes with basements
okay how many of you have some pump in
those basements how many of you have
problems with some pumps in a basement
all right I think it's pretty much one
to one relationship so what we decided
to do and by the way that came from kind
of my very personal experience I got my
energy bill and I see that my power
consumption my electricity consumption
is $150 hires this month versus last
month's I'm looking at the average
temperature the same I'm looking at
everything else I'm trying to find
what's wrong with my house I cannot find
anything so a month later my wife was
finally very convincing and I am down in
the basement trying to do a little bit
of a cleanup I was deferring the stats
for a little while a little whiles and
again finally the time came to doing it
and you know what I did a very good job
creating a very nice soundproof cover on
the pit of my sump pump here's what
happened the floating switch on the pump
got stuck in the on position the pump
was running there was about an inch of
water still at the bottom of the pit
enough to cool it off also when I open
the cover the cloud of steam came out
but I bought a very good one horse pump
that didn't burn out it was an expensive
good pump it was running for two and a
half months non-stop 24-7 add the cost
of about 375 dollars as I calculated to
my pocket without me knowing and
honestly if it wouldn't be for my wife
finally insisting on me cleaning of the
basement and I would not have been
working in that specific order has a
basement it probably would have run for
another three is four months because I
really couldn't hear it and I never even
thought about some pump to be a part of
this problem so this is a concept of the
products that we're trying to put
together as ecosystem players a very
simple plug-in device
you can plug your sump pump in and do
the following using all of those
elements of technology we described
before you can now talk to the cloud you
can essentially monitor the operation of
sample and from the previous experience
you know if it rains 3-4 hours after an
inch of water be on the ground outside
your sump pump should keep going right
if it doesn't it's an alert it all of a
sudden becomes something very simple at
the course that may be hundred dollars
or less that potentially not only save
you in my case you had a 75 s 385
dollars but also if you have a finished
basement a lot of remediation work that
would be required to replace rock
and clean your carpets and do a lot of
very positive things so all of those
technologies and all those complexities
we talked about now conversions is very
maybe not very glamorous but from my
point of view a very practical
application that can help saving
thousands and thousands of dollars to
the consumers at the end because you can
actually understand what is going on
inside of this little pit with the water
where your sump pump is supposed to be
parading but you know what if you extend
this concept it becomes almost like a
basement hub right think about what you
can do by combining the power of Java
embedded in the device service saying as
an example new applications it becomes
an app on your smartphone notifying if
something happened but it also can
become something connected to home depot
lowes who is connected to wireless
sensors now sitting on supply and return
of your air conditioning or heating unit
telling you ok maybe filters are now due
for a change and instead of you trying
to defer or maybe oh my god I need to go
to Home Depot and pick up a new set of
filters they get shipped to your door
home depot makes regular old revenue
much better in this case and actually I
eliminates it as if they hit right so
that's what we're trying to accomplish
as unglamorous this application is I
think the usability and usefulness to
our daily life is tremendous so
conclusions we and our partners together
with
Oracle we're developing a platform that
can enable us developers to create some
things that can be useful in the every
day of our life as partners we can
create some sense that creates a very
unique business model I just mentioned
right it's a tailor it's an insurance
company it's a consumer all of a sudden
we create new relationships that we can
enable with this technology and this
integration of Java know a GI gives us a
platform that we can leverage very
easily and open to developers to add
additional application we have never
thought about because I'm sure once we
open this platform and you start
building on top of it people are much
smarter than we are we'll figure out how
to use it the same way as the city of
Boston had figured out how to use
smartphones to detect potholes maybe
we'll figure something out to use in our
application later on and of course as I
mentioned tomorrow we have another very
interesting sessions that will be hosted
by my colleague sitting here so welcome
to attend it as well resources you'll
find a copy of this presentation you're
welcome to browse you can find details
of the Gateway at that own website where
you can download Java embedded and of
course I would encourage you to take a
look at st online because you will see a
tremendous number of components that you
can use just about in anything you can
think of and enable your creativity to
go to the next level with that I would
like to thank you Freddie buddy
questions yes please I like this
question hmmm no gateway still needed
because as I mentioned before different
devices will require different
communication technologies even if you
look at today philips hue good example
right you have a little gateway device
that has Wi-Fi to your heart phone but
really low speed wireless communication
zigbee 2230 light bulb in a very similar
fashion
we talked about constrained devices you
don't want probably moisture sensor in
the floor of your basement to be Wi-Fi
censored because you will have to change
the better it may be every month so in
every two months you would like it to be
maybe sub gigahertz maybe Zig busy wave
so you can put it there and forget about
it for a year at least so you will need
to have a blend of technology so gateway
becomes this very nice aggregation point
if you look at this slide that we had
earlier in presentation it could be
either remote access going to the cloud
and through the cloud to your device or
it could be localized access from your
gateway yesterday it's pretty far along
we would like to see it very soon it's
not about actually product development
product development is very simple we
have this platform turning this platform
to this form factor is about two months
exercise software with Java AGI we have
pretty much everything it's more about
creation of go-to-market strategy that
encompasses follows those elements with
retailers and others that I talked about
that's what we're working one at the
moment from the point of view of
hardware it's here it's now lineage
baseus and other questions what was that
I would like to thank you again and
thank you Frederick for co-hosting this
presentation ok thank you means you as a
show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
