you can see and maybe from setting some
expectations about my talk so basically
the titleist um anti-patterns and there
is like agile and project management so
you can expect that there will be like
no coding I hope yeah pretty much yeah
that's good because I assume that you
are old Java developers or majority of
you so even before I start how many java
developers are here just right hand oh
gosh excellent actually expected that
and I think that few hands were not up
so I expect those people are still
asleep but no worries we will work on
that I have few comics unfortunately i
don't have cut pictures so i have to say
no cut pictures in this presentation so
if you are here and your fan of cuts so
sorry to disappoint you ok so how many
of you have contact with customers hands
up ok that's good and how many of you
have contact with like marketing people
or people who are just right
requirements like product owners ok
surprisingly still there are a few hands
that weren't up and i just wonder if you
don't have contact with customers and
you don't talk with product owners how
basically you write the code ok so the
title as I assumed I think that still
people are joining us but I think that
we can like start and kick off so my
name is kshama of sam a quite
challenging i use usually the shorter
name the longer name is Catalina so yeah
if you want would like afterwards we can
try to pronounce it ok so who I am
basically I had an experience in working
in software houses as well as in
internal IT complem internal IT
department so I have the perspective of
both and I would like to share with you
my experience from the perspective of
the person who start from being like
technical person because I was a
developer then I was sysadmin and then I
was finally business analyst and product
owner so I have been respected from
quite diverse perspectives and also I'm
like kind of agile person so maybe
that's why I have right to creature
criticized a bit agile at this the way
we try to do or even worse implement
agile but I guess we are in Java
conference so implement is even better
world ok so I'm part of the agile in
Europe community so you can guess I'm
from Europe as well as you've seen my
name is Ernest also can guess I'm
currently I'm living in London however
I'm from Poland originally and I'm
contractor there and basically trying to
figured out how to make projects working
sometimes it's like stitching few staff
together sometimes it's like developing
and creating completely new product also
during the talk i would like to present
you few scenes that we all have no
matter what kind of company we are in so
if we're software house or if we are
smaller company developing software or
if we are the IT department inside the
company that actually doesn't care that
much about 80 but still use us as a
service i would say ok so maybe we can
start from ok i serve a question if I'm
standing like that do you can can you
hear me actually not really ok because
usually like you know like walking
around the stage but I assume that I
can't work with that ok so I hope
somehow handle okay so start from agile
and basically the expectations that we
are all agile so there's like maybe
anyone who don't know the word agile
never heard about that please rise hand
now hands up ok that's good that that's
means that everyone heard the word agile
that's good basically companies really
like to be agile even the even though
they're sometimes
kind of not really agile they have agile
names sometimes they you know how like
adult coach isn't really really try hard
to transfer the culture too agile one
however sometimes it sends only on
transforming IT departments to agile or
software part of IT department too agile
and the rest of the business states in
the old fashioned waterful way and
sometimes it just means that everything
gets cranky synthesizing agile so this
is basically trying to just first and
think okay we are agile we word
waterfall but we renamed everything and
we must be agile so also what I would
like to present during this talk is that
sometimes you can adapt like piece of
stuff that works for you not necessarily
try to follow the names which are like
you know beautiful buzzwords that
everyone have to use and still makes
this whole stuff work maybe not
necessary under the word agile but I
think that the most important stuff is
to create awesome software and there's
like no matter if we are actually agile
scrum doings doing scram or I don't know
whatever ours is right now trendy Aldean
startup or maybe you now go back to
waterfall it's basically how we create
staff that works so yeah sometimes we
really hurt try to convince everyone
around us that we are you know super
trendy until we're agile and if you are
not agile obviously we are old-fashioned
and we have to die you are laughing but
there is a lot of having that in
industry especially if you are selling
software and there are customers that
are like not basically they're using
software they want to know okay how do
you do your beautiful software and they
want to be certain super certain that we
deliver it like you know in really
excellent manner frequently without bugs
obviously and really cheaply because
everyone knows that you know a lot of
features no bugs and quality comes
together and you can't have everything
and customers thinks that if we say that
there we are agile it means that we have
all those three things magically
yeah so first of all maybe I can ask you
do you know the agile manifesto just
raise your hand even yes okay keep three
hands up and who would like to say it
loud okay no hands okay so really
quickly we just go through this boring
guide which is agile manifesto just only
to emphasis the kind of the anti
patterns that we unfortunately do during
trying to be agile and maybe I just
spoil it a bit why because agile meant
to be like philosophy and we start to
treat it like a kind of thing that is
ridiculed for everything and sometimes
it's a bit awkward afterwards okay but
actually I should start from explaining
the title of it why agile project
management I've seen a lot of like job
offers a lot of descriptions in the
company companies that have something
like that they're like actual project
managers or their claim that they have
agile project management so basically
what that is at this entire array so
applying traditional project management
to agile principles so it's like
philosophy this is usually like PMI or
prince2 methodology so this is kind of
waterfall world so people like tend to
think that if we merge those two this
magically creates agile project
management so what we have in the end we
have beautiful a drug names in theory we
have philosophy that we actually don't
follow and we have our beautiful baby
waterfalls because we just for instance
you scrams or something like similar yes
so yeah this is maybe I just leave it
without comment because the talk the
whole talk is about how to not do it
that way okay so first of all processes
and tools so what do it do you remember
what was above I just put maybe some
joke to like you know
make it easier anyone remembers what was
like over processes and tools okay so i
want to say loud yeah excellent oh yeah
someone remembers that's really good so
companies really like to say okay yes
individuals and interactions over
processes and tools but when they try to
delete deliver when there is like agile
transformation what usual is done we are
buying a software or we are employing
other coaches are we are sending the
whole team for today's scrum training
and then we expect that we are other
already and sometimes I even seen like
project plans how to deliver our gel to
the company of Lucy will start in the
end and unfortunately it's not that easy
because us as principals usually says
and how's the idea is we need to be
flexible we need to adapt so it's not
something that stays the same constantly
we need to work in order to make it
happen we need to adjust and basically
we also need to value more people and
how they are used to work or how it's
like more convenient to work over the
tools and those it cells are not bad
because there are meant to help us right
yeah I think that there is no integers
photos buddy a statement to help us
however if we try to make standard
process across the company and force
people to use the tools in exactly same
way let's start to be tricky why because
if we have big projects and some of us
delivers like web based solutions and
other of us have like heavy back-end
systems we just can't have the same kind
of process and the same kind of approach
simply because our backlog items are
different the stuff that we are
delivering are different and the
dependencies between those products also
are different because maybe we have
backend stuff there's like 15 others
teams that actually waiting for
to deploy our the no new search engine
and if you are just doing that maybe not
just but if you are doing the user
interface for something only there you
know there's like maybe less
dependencies between that and the back
end ideally maybe you to be like even we
have like slice of everything in one
project sometimes it's not the case but
basically it makes really difficult to
make it standardized and if we tried
really hard then we are just actually
doing the reverse to the idea so we have
to the process and tools over over the
people okay what is next documentation
exactly i leave the joke form for a
moment because it's quite good okay few
people left so it's good it's progress
okay yeah so sometimes we have even you
know too much documentation which is
like nah trivalent and also I just not
want to say that we don't need any kind
of documentation but it would be good to
keep it light also the really excellent
way there's like the previous stock
buying holy about automation and
basically it's good way also just to
have all stuff automated tests as well
because then he's like easier to us to
figured out if software is working or
not so I work in a software that health
like only five years relatively fresh
but what I say only because the previous
version of the same software was written
the times were there were like no
internet protocol available so the
previous version was really old five
years old was like brand new staff and
we had like pretty good coverage and why
I'm saying that because if we were
developing new features on top of this
five year old systems and we would like
to remove some pits we're able to do it
even though sometimes we haven't
actually remember what the modules were
doing because there were tests so we
knew that okay if we remove something
and tests are green it means
software is not broken if you don't have
tests but you have documentation hmm go
ahead with reading and trying to figure
out what our connection and dependencies
between the software I also just want to
emphasize that it's really good to have
like the user documentation just doing
are not being bothered and by the
questions okay what the software is
doing but if you speaking about the
technical documentation is good to like
keep it to minimum because first of all
people are not reading it frequently if
they're reading it at all it just gets
out of debt like I think minutes ago
after you just finished writing it if
you have tests yes that can happen as
well that's there are just up outdated
but it's quite easier to have them done
just to rely on the manual regression
tests currently I work in the company
world and we have no automation test so
each regression is really really painful
so I'm now I will total fan of the
automation tests okay okay and one more
note about documentation if you have do
it if you doing it I would just
recommend like drawings because it's
usually easier to understand than read
the 100 kg documentation okay so this
was the nutshell of my message here okay
obviously we have the contract
negotiations which are pretty important
and we should caliber collaborate in
theory what is sometimes in practice so
again we expect that we have tools that
will do everything for us so there are
like plenty of ways to make the
collaboration like you know a seamless
like let's say that we have sharpened
SharePoint page and tag someone ok we
just written in comment for you so we
expect that you know the staff or
confluence page and we talked some 10
you know just read it afterwards yeah
done communication then we don't have to
call because you know speaking with
people is terrifying yeah so again the
way how we would like to cooperate and
how would like to communicate is really
important obviously contracts and stuff
are important too usually it's like
totally messed up in our world maybe one
word as well from that we'll just go to
the solutions as well as I want only
complain about those typos I give some
remedies or recommendations how we can
try make it better okay and the end
flexibility connected with changes I
really love that example because we are
agile right and then I arrived the
company that says oh yeah we have like
agile teams obviously we work in scrum
so everything is beautiful I arrived and
see ten thousands user story in the
backlog excellent we are really agile
and we're really responsive to change
yeah hmm excellent so again I will talk
a bit about the backlog itself later on
but this is not really flexible if you
have that mandame backlog items so why
we should be responsive to change I
think that everyone knows that basically
word is changing our customers not
necessarily understand that if they
throw away a lot of requirements on us
and a lot of buckle Gators that
basically makes us not really flexible
so it is it is really good to say okay
hello if you give us more and more and
more it's like she actually does limit
us and sometimes or maybe not sometimes
but we are too afraid to say no to the
requirements that are from the business
and from our customers or our marketing
people and we J say yeah we are so agile
so we can't have this 10,000 one users
during our backlog we handle it and then
we never do it obviously some customers
are you know like
really cunning and they are to finding
like bugs that actually supposed to be
features but because it's like not
working and you know never ever they
were requirement it would be working
that way but you know we can like rice a
bag and add to our backlog and then it
gets even more messy but this is their
way to make us a change so this is not
agile as well okay so really quickly
wrapping up if we would like to be like
more agile try first focus on how we can
make people working together in like
nice and flexible way how to make teams
effective and how to make their life
simpler in terms like having like small
backlog and good communication with
product owner I've seen that all that
business the best the business the best
I think that's what I ask few people
didn't have contact with such people so
it's good to learn now starting from
scratch so starting from communication
remember that there are like good ways
of seeing the bigger picture and the
requirement unnecessary the user stories
I talked about and also basically if we
communicate with a proxy it's getting
difficult especially if we have like few
proxies and next to us so let's imagine
we have marketing cells product owners
business analysts tackle its developers
and just imagine the beginning of this
beautiful chain we have the requirements
in the end we have developers and just
imagine what we hear in the ends yeah so
it will be good is even even one person
from the team have ability to
communicate even if not directly because
marketing is too terrified that whisker
customers just to have at least some
good communication and cooperation with
marketing team and make certain that
they don't promise to customers stuff
that we cannot deliver if we are working
in internal IT department and again
maybe our boss is a bit terrified to you
know let us go from our basement
somewhere in the building just suggest
that if we will feel allowed to diagonal
grab a coffee with our business and talk
with them or observe hard-working it
would be easier to deliver something
what is valuable for them and it'd be
easier for us to understand the business
requirements because again we are
sometimes failing in understanding that
basically without understanding the
business needs we are not necessarily
able to deliver software and the
requirements that are like you know only
written and documented don't reflect the
reality really well okay and maybe in
the end keep things small this is the
record on our recommendation okay but
let's start with my favorite part so the
scenes some of them I think that will be
like really quite of some people
familiar with them I hope ok let's start
everyone knows which one is a waterfall
which one is agile right yeah it sounds
so I don't know I couldn't hear you guys
louder excellent ok that's good now it
was convincing so what companies are
doing because we can think ok it's quite
easy distinction right so if we have
waterfall we have all those steps in
order to know develop test and deploy
and and and in the end basically we just
find out that what we think here was
revelant basically it's like falling
apart because it's like two years after
so business change instead of like I
don't know card payment we have apple
payment so our payment system that we
delivered and design two years ago it's
just not refund and more here we have
like smaller feedback loop in theory at
least and basically we're working close
the business and everything is great so
companies when they are saying okay we
now want to be agile want to have this
but what's we see in
practice unfortunately this is you know
this is good first step if we are like
really huge software house with 10,000
developers across all possible location
on Earth developing even on like deep
deep oceans or hell I don't know
whatever it is maybe it's like you know
hard to start and do everything in agile
way right if you are smaller companies
maybe it should be easier but it's not
it's really huge change it's changing
the way how we also sell our products I
think that sometimes we are not even
think we are thinking about the
development but again I'm business or
the people who just signed our paychecks
expect the ready product and ready
product are usually sold in a way that
we promise to give something it's really
hard to go to the customer and said you
know we have IDM we don't know what it
is yet but maybe you would like to buy
it and so again if you are internal IT
department maybe it's easier to convince
your business in that way especially if
you have a lot of coffee with them so
maybe if you are a huge software house
um no it's not working in that way
unfortunately so that's why the
companies also have a problems with
being in a full agile mode and now is
the question is it so terribly bad to
have it that way how do you think yeah
so will a bit talk about again the
feedback as well but it's like we are
still waiting it's like no diff it does
huge difference from waterfall it's like
better it's you know we at least like
try so it's good as I said it's good the
first step because if you're big it's
not easy to change if you have multiple
location agile starts to be really
difficult as well probably there's a
plenty of scouting agile talks you've
seen but the biggest problem is that
basically wait to have the feedback loop
and to understand the needs of our
customers and also we are waiting for
our competitors to finish their software
so maybe they deploy something on the
production earlier than we and we will
lose our market so this is the i think
really huge constrain again example from
the software house I worked in we were
developing this beautiful software i
told you that this new 125 year third
year old one and there was like the
older version and once we deploy it we
just figured out that our competitors
were earlier they have much less
features than we had but they were
earlier and guess what customers were
satisfied and they didn't need all the
features that were planned for us so
stuff like that happens as well so it's
all it's worth to remember that if
someone from business sale okay this is
our beautiful as a way of doing god that
with ten thousands user stories and five
years of bug look ahead saying okay but
we are not alone there's a plenty of
other companies i think especially here
in san francisco orders like so many
startups around you know that the kelp
competition is really hard if we talk
with business of you if we have our own
companies like worth to remember okay
competition is there so if we wait and
if we pretend to be agile basically
maybe when we deploy there will be no
customers and it's really hard to
convince customer who bought the
software wants to spend the money again
on something new even if it's totally
brilliant and awesome and have like
really a lot of features that may be a
lot of features is not that convincing
but yet so okay so what is the agile way
obviously time to market it slow shorter
and surprisingly even if we don't have
like enough features but maybe not
enough but even if we see that there are
some features are missing is usually
better to deploy something anyway and
start covering feedback and doing
started proper way and make
it seems to be so obvious but companies
simply stop you know at this stage and
not really willing to moved here because
it's like additional effort that they
shouldn't ever changing not only our
development side but also like marketing
sales strategy and everything and even
if we are startups usually need to sell
our products so again this is the change
across ok so feedback loop I mention it
the sooner the better and what else
basically we need predictability and
sometimes we can say ok what we can do
if we are like maybe not planning at all
the features right what would what
basically can happen it's really hard
because we usually have roadmaps and
romance drama bistec example of another
scene itself it's excellent because it
means ok we have vision of the product
in practice usual you have commitments
so we say ok we deliver this done
another feature is done and basically we
have no flexibility to add new stuff
again example from the payment world so
let's say that we all like half a year
before and we don't know that Apple
payments go into the market and we just
think okay just do some awesome stuff
with the contactless cards and then we
have bug look for you know I don't know
half a year ahead with those payments
and then we just learning all there is
ample payment ok and we cannot squeeze
because we basically are committed to
deliver something different or maybe
fingerprint few years ago it was like it
was the thing and still some especially
banks are delivering new features that
you can logged into bank with the
fingerprint it is at least I think a
year or so in the market or even longer
but recently my bank introduces like I
maybe week ago like a new LT that you
can log-in valve via fingerprint so I
just assume that probably they have
really
back looking like you so but those are
the stuff that basically limits us in
terms of delivering faster new exciting
features that can convince our customers
to move in to the new solution basically
I also switched recently my bank to have
the fingerprints so it was convincing
for some customers and there's plenty of
people who actually really liked having
the life simplified so again Rodman
commitments quite difficult and what
else basically there are other people
who are like depending on us so if we
will be late it's starting to get tough
and people just depend on us as well so
it's like really tricky if we say okay
we have like I don't know three miles
development cycles and this is the stuff
that will develop within three months so
we are not planning few years ahead and
if you are not squeezed in that means
that you basically don't have to wait
because you don't get the stuff people
at least try to think about the solution
that it's like working and non waiting
for us to deliver something and then be
you know really sorry for saying screwed
because we didn't deliver and they don't
have any workaround and so it's worth to
remember about that as well okay moving
forward and we have the backlog itself
usually too big backlog so as I said I
just won't say it again it's my favorite
so feature gluttony so basically we
would like to have too much and we're
just forgetting that there is a point
where our customers are like satisfied
obviously there are customers they want
more and more and more but this
basically doesn't mean that we should
deliver more this means that maybe we
can rethink our features again in the
place where i worked in we had at least
three features that did exactly the same
thing but in slightly different order we
had like 120 customers based so it was a
lot of customers of the system features
were
toggle off depending on the customer but
anyway depends you know trying to
maintain feet treat the same features
it's quite hard again because of
dependency because of the architecture
problems just imagine trying to do
microservices if you have multiple stuff
that actually doing the same in a
slightly different manner impossible and
it was relatively new software five
years also not that bad okay also so
what we can do we can also start
deleting features I know it sounds scary
but business is changing so after a few
years if we ask the business okay do you
need that because we have the logs and
we noticed that you didn't click it like
at least two years so maybe they say you
yeah just go ahead delete it we don't
need it and guess what we have easier
code to maintain and basically the
complexity of the whole staff is also
like easier but for that we need to do
really scary stuff talk yeah obviously
measures are really important too
because we cannot guess what is used
what is not just if we don't lock where
our customers are clicking and what they
are doing we also can try you know if we
really don't want to talk because it's
terrifying we can also try to hide it a
feature if we just notice that it's not
used and afterwards try to you know
delete it if it's still no one says oh
you know there's like my favorite button
I used every half a year just to fire of
my favorite Excel spreadsheet so yeah so
basically there are the things that we
can do in order to limit the number of
features there already we already have
and then the play on top of that why
because our software and some point will
be old someone will have to maintain it
and if we kept keep adding the features
without trying at least to delete old
stuff a lot your staff our software soon
will be like the really ugly legacy and
everyone will tell
my gosh we even developed that right
yeah okay um obviously customers are
asking for a new feature so this is like
the Twitter recently seen so I really
like it because it just represents that
basically we sometimes have to think and
try to like critically approach to the
stuff that customers wish to have
because honestly not everything is
needed and also we have the problem of
the usability if we add too many
features
this should be actually the first try to
make it this level yeah okay so everyone
almost everyone loves so not that bad so
a small security check how many of your
asleep and read you know if you have
stuff few people are asleep okay so few
people are still wake up or maybe I
actually should ask how many of you you
know still awake so raise your hand okay
much more people are awake down sleeping
few people didn't you know eyes their
hand and neither way so I think that
there are like in between okay are still
sleeping i don't want one minute okay
one of my favorites right now that's
what I want to look you know wake you up
the quality of backlog items because
sometimes you see the stuff like that
which are like my favorites to tell you
when I see ten thousands like that so
yeah the format itself so when we try to
be agile T now and we say read like some
you know books and blah blah blah and
say okay our backlog items should be you
know one standardized format because if
we have the format there is a value
behind that surprisingly people can hug
this format and do it like totally
unusable and totally basically if we
just say okay I want login I think this
is the same message obviously it didn't
show anything connected i don't know
maybe we need kind some sophisticated
security because we are bank maybe this
logging stuff is basically fingerprint
but someone forgot to mention it so yeah
so I qualities like one of the stuff
that we sometimes miss while
implementing the structure kind of agile
because obviously we have formats so if
we have format we are right and
surprisingly not really okay and we
might ask we have backlog items you have
a roadmap
what is with them basically finishing
yeah yesterday I was talking with one of
colleagues around here about basically
delivering the new features in a way
that basically they are broken and then
someone ryzza back and then when back is
you know wonders about Brock bugs have
like higher priority because staffing is
in production and is broken all right so
then we delivering the feature guys it's
not the way and there's a plenty of
other ways to actually say no to the you
know features that we won't like to
develop I will talk a bit about that
later on this is the basically the way
to have really bad software than then
we'll be like really ashamed of doing
and I think that there's like come on
you're on Java ones are pretty brilliant
developers but I seen the notes so i
hope that you are not doing it on daily
basis but you are honoring gothic oh
yeah we've seen that some other people
did that we are good okay so basically
we're if we have the feature and if it's
even the really crap description of that
we should try at least to make it work
and not delivering something that is
broken in the first place because like
no sense at all delivering that and also
like one thing that we may think and
which sometimes somehow don't remember
that if we have the project itself size
matters and this is the statistics I
took from the research done by Standish
Group so what basically it shows I think
that these small projects because oh
okay right now I notice that the screen
cuts the top of my slides which is
surprising because on my site is look
good on my computer okay so you have to
imagine here is like the big projects
here are small projects I hope you had
good imagination I just wonder how many
slides were cut before
and maybe that's why you were not
laughing that could explain a lot okay
but you know I'm agile person so I adapt
I will be reading you what is above okay
so because you had good deed vegetation
and I already read here are the big
projects and yet big projects are
failing my failure I mean like one of
the dimensions of the projects of her
maybe not even one but all so it's like
never on the production some someone was
so desperate after you know spending a
few millions of dollars that they say
okay we are shutting it out because
there's no point of delivering it
fifty-two percent of you know changes
this mean that was changing the budget
scope whatever and the success we didn't
change anything and you can see that
smaller projects IT projects because
those are the software projects are
actually delivered and they are like
working maybe there are clunky maybe a
user or users are not fully capable
happy but at least they have software so
at least they can do their you know the
stuff for what they are both the product
so they can support the business process
in some kind of way and if someone from
the business or basically if you have
your own company sense okay we need to
deliver everything and we have like huge
backlog just show the statistics usual
it's convincing I know the statistics
usually lies because me and my dog
statistically have like h three legs but
this is pretty convincing to the
majority of people because also why
smaller projects are easier to manage
because even if you can think about it
if something takes like three months
it's easier to now handle that the
changes that the scope everything will
be delivering if something is like five
years long and we know it take it will
take ages we have problem with you know
project management that I mentioned
before and we are not agile honestly if
we have five years scope ahead we are
definitely not agile and we are not
flexible ok now we quickly you know wrap
up the staff the society
I've talking about and then we all try
to find the cure so obviously trying
really hard trying to do it agile but
not really following that the full path
so this is the first of the scene
another having the commitments so
together with really huge backlog full
with them you know not actually limiting
the future gluttony from our customers
so if customers calls us your deliver it
will add the future and some of you can
actually know that wonder okay if
customers want the features and they pay
us why we actually think of not
delivering it this is like short term
strategy if we deliver everything
because as I said maintaining it
afterwards and making it like better in
the future you know any architectural
change it's quite difficult if we have
several features that person for example
do the same stuff and in the end my
favorite so the quality of the backlog
items itself so what we can actually do
so let's return to the question okay do
we have any hope as especially if we
want to transit from this to this so
what I'm usually suggesting to the
strike struck try to not think linear oh
this is line which helps us to have some
kind of the predictability of when we
delivered something which is ready right
business wants to know when something is
ready so we have to show them that okay
maybe if we don't keep it in a linear
way it would be easier to say okay
within the three months time box we can
deliver this what will be in the future
we will see how we can achieve that so
what I suggest to use is a product tree
Iraq this kind of methodology as a
support to the you know agile transition
what is basically do so it is obviously
fun we govern developers people who are
like stakeholders and trying to produce
the ideas in order to make the emitting
shorter it's better
to have ideas upfront written down and
then trying to figure it out okay what
we do within our time box if we use
sprint's because we really love scram we
can use it with sprint if we use Kanban
board or if we have some kind of weird
mix it will be like any kind of time
works we wish the leaves are the ideas
the branches are modules or categories
and maybe some kind of the basically
groupings why in that way because then
it's easier when we are trying to think
about the architecture and if we are
brave enough to make you now
microservices that we had listened can't
differentiate between the features and
also business understands that if they
want to mix something this is dependency
so this is not separate branch because
again if we speak with business they
really have problems with understanding
dependencies between our product so this
allow us to make it like visual and
people usually have problems to like try
to figure it out oh okay so we cannot
merge these two branches actually
because it's the tree and I understand
how tree is working so oh yeah really we
cannot merge it yeah it makes sense okay
so what we are doing here here is the
staff which are outside our time box so
first of all people are like really
happy because our ideas are written down
somewhere so there won't be lost we are
happy as well because if we want to
return to that we didn't put a lot of
effort in writing this down in the user
story or whatever documentation in this
we have idea and idea could be lets say
integrated payments and when we take the
idea integrated payments we see oh my
gosh we have new fingerprint login we
have apple payments oh so nice so we can
take those idea make them detailed one
there when we have time for doing that
so what we will be detailing is
basically what is inside the tree and
the set but not everything because that
would be too easy
if we just deliver everything right so
when we have first bunch of the ideas
that are not ready to be developed
obviously because they're high-level
ideas and so what we do next basically
we need to try to prioritize because
excellent ideas not necessary brings us
money and what is this love thing you
can think because you know Rory so
basically how much cash we have is quite
easy to understand what is that this is
the stuff that we care about and why
called it love because context is the
king so i can say that its performance i
can say it its usability but it
basically depends on your software that
you're developing if you are doing back
end and you say that usability is the
most important staff well your choice
but probably it's not so that's why here
we are putting the stuff that it's like
really important so let's say that its
performance then we take all those
leaves and trying to figure it out okay
where it is between the prophets and the
performance left side and trying to
figure it out the whole staff
surprisingly easily we get a stable is
called MVP and then we had to apply
logic itself as well because sometimes
there are stuff that are not profitable
maybe they're not influence our
performance but we need to have them
anyway because otherwise software has
like no sense this helps to understand
both for developers and for business
basically importance of the features
because it's not linear again it's also
like easier to communicate an easier to
talk okay well to put it as you can see
there is no scale as well because it's
ty quite random this also helps us not
to focus on being like to accurate and
waste time at that point why we
shouldn't estimate at that point because
we have no idea what it is it's like
brilliant idea that we can you know
assume that there are some money behind
that and there is some performance
increase or basically improvement after
that but then we need to
and probably validators after but it's
like afterwards not trying not before
because it's quite hard takes time and
time is money so if you have the big
session with all those people in the
room you really want to keep it short
okay so this is it but obviously we have
more sins I also have two glass for our
watch because I think that we have 10
more minutes if I'm right okay so I try
to be quick more okay estimates i
started talking about them why is that
so basically if we have those features
those ideas there we can try to make
them in a more detail and we actually
should we write them down and people
usually ask okay so when we deliver so
safe way of doing that is actually
saying okay let's have like time box if
we work in scram we have Ted say two
weeks or let's say we have like well
week or whatever we try to deliver as
much once we can there is like a lot of
no estimate approaches that are fine I
actually recommend to have like let the
23 stuff with ideas around like three
months backlog and because it's quite
safe to you know deliver enough to be
like usable and a convince business that
if it doesn't work out afterwards you
can just you know it's quite small
investment so we can kill it and don't
lose a lot of money if you are killing
the project that it's five years old
it's painful so this is the the way
again in internal IT company internal IT
department is easier than in bigger
companies but it's like achievable
involve voice again project plans yeah I
think that we all we have them and why
basically people want to know that again
because customers expect to know when
they get the features done right so
because they expect to have that what we
have yeah
I think that all everyone knows that and
if we just have estimates like story
points to share cited whatever we have
project manager this is the brilliant
person who knows how to map it to the
Excel and whatever you are doing even if
you are doing like really I don't know
t-shirt sizes or I don't know colors of
cabs or whatever you just think about
there is a magic formula in Excel which
map it to the time and money and again
what you can say you can say oh we don't
know and then they will probably push
you to give some numbers and we usually
do as a mighty the number and we just
this creates in the business the point
of view that we can predict how much the
staff will take I've met the people who
are a strong for estimating stuff and
saying that yeah we are able to do it
accurately we have that you know huge
matrix with a lot of you know beautiful
and numbers inside and beautiful
equations and we are able to predict the
future some other people have like the
you know beautiful crystal ball and they
saying yes we delivered it like in 2017
oh no no this will be actually 2020 and
there's a plenty of people like that but
again if we keep it small and say okay
first batch will be within first three
months and more or less is doing the
ideas we discussed then business have
like predictability they are carving for
because they really want to know we are
relatively safe because there are three
moms so the scope is small so even if
you have scope creep because we figured
out better way of doing something it's
still like manageable and we were
avoiding to having like really you know
scary estimate and again if we are
working in huge software houses and we
don't deliver on time usually Dennis
like the finding the blame
hurts and we think oh no because this
person was you know there to take holy
days and that's why we're right so yeah
so at least we can try to avoid that and
again if we try to speaking about
estimates if we have like infinite
backlog and we put the numbers again in
skills infinite the same is with any
kind of estimations math on some point
is basically not accurate enough to do
the to do the productions it's quite
it's actually quite hard that I'm
telling that because I finish a kind of
them IT and econometrics course so
basically I'm doing forecasts as a job
and models and stuff like that so I
actually should say oh yeah there are
beautiful models that can predict
everything but yeah I'm quite aesthetic
in terms of the predicting the staff
connected with producing software okay
I'm last one almost left one Sylosis and
so what happens we basically help of you
see marketing sales development you and
we don't talk to each other and
sometimes we have like test team as well
which is separate to development which
is even more hilarious because we can
assume that testers and developers
should like you know sit together and
cooperate and we finds the staff which
are quite surprising like let's say test
us has the KPIs or whatever it is to
find as many bugs as possible and we
suddenly see that let's say oh yeah we
have this beautiful bag because this
button instead of being in Great Hall
color is white or stamping linea
hilarious like a dad that basically
there is no difference from the software
perspective and customers actually don't
care or basically it's working software
as designed but we arise the back just
to have the additional back so we need
to communicate and how we can do it if
we are in silos colocation helps but not
always be it's possible so again cause
it's like something that it's useful but
usually if we have video because if we
have only phone call it
multitask how many of you have like not
co-located team okay a lot how many of
you have like phone calls without video
okay keeps your hands how many of you
multitask exactly yeah so if you have
video your field watched so this helps
if you have the marketing and sales
teams and development and testers
usually it's good to talk to each other
and ask okay what are your KPI kpi's or
measures of your success because
companies have such stuff in place and
this is the natural thing may be natural
for organizations it's also pretty I
just sometimes think okay we want to be
agile but we have measures of success
and kpi's across the organization and I
think okay but we should be like a team
so we should have a common aim so how
it's even possible that we have still
style losses with different goals so if
we know that something like that happens
and we really try to be agile so we at
least have to ask okay what are your
goals and how we can align within our
organization that supposed to be agile
than done actually doesn't help us to be
agile at all if we know then at least we
can work together to make certain that
we are achieving our goals so marketing
plans say to the customers that they
deliver some feature cells can obviously
says afterwards and we as a development
team don't have like five the same
features written in slightly different
way okay and there's a lot of questions
should with skyla agile or not I just
allow you to answer this question after
the stock by yourself again we can try
also I would like to say that sometimes
our companies maybe are not meant to be
agile and it's nothing wrong with that
maybe we can adapt some parts of it
maybe we can try hard and instead of
saying oh yeah we are cool we are Adele
or we are cool because we have scram
maybe we just adopt things and makes our
life easier but then not use the word
agile because it may
the frustrations especially in the
people who just worked previously Nicole
smaller companies go to the bigger
companies which says oh you're agile and
like in my case when I see the backlog
of 10,000 user stories and people keep
saying that we are so agile it just
costs frustration and sometimes it's
better to admit okay we really try to
change but we are big it's not easy it
will take time we adapt few bits from
agile few things from Lean Startup
because we need feedback from our
customers but for instance our industry
is not able to deploy to the production
more frequently than half a year again I
worked in a company when the releases
first world where every two years
because our customers weren't ready so
it was huge success to be able to deploy
every half a year and again for a
customer what it was quite big challenge
because it was the training of the crew
because it was like few thousand people
using our software and even though it
was really you know ux people were
really and indeed the best job ever just
to squeeze additional features in the
seamless way but again people needs
training we need to deploy it we need to
check it if we are in the cloud probably
maybe it's easier but sometimes we have
service where someone have to go
physically and install the software so
the plenty of stuff like that and
sometimes we don't have to like you know
pretend or you know synthesize agile we
can say okay we try we are that things
will make things working and we are
delivering software and this basically
is the mapping with important stuff so
quickly summing up because there is no
time processes documentation basically
are quite common way of trying to you
know implement agile in a way which is
like structure and exact really unified
across everything is not the way to do
basically try to be flexible and try to
maybe add up small part and if you
cannot just admit okay we are trying
collaboration
I just writing emails or documentation
snot collaboration sorry guys we need to
talk I think it's especially scary when
the girls sire We Need to Talk yeah
again we should be at least trying to
make things small in order to be
flexible so again trying to chang our
product in a way that roof in three
months we can deliver some ideas and
then show them to the customers again if
we were trying to be agile and change
our organization it's better to focus on
the root cause not on the same time
sometimes symptoms are like for instance
too big backlog right so first we have
to think why this too big because maybe
the demands from the customers and we
should start from thinking okay how to
change the marketing and sales in the
way that we can adjust our other part of
the development cycle again XO x is
actually surprising tool I've seen guys
from Microsoft and I have to say that
Excel is amazing because each company I
saw is basically there is some part of
it that it's Excel driven and I'm really
amazed of the creativity creativity of
people who use Excel so I think that yes
spreadsheets spreadsheets rules and
again try to think about the ways we can
do step from like planned staff to the
standard allow us to make software in a
flexible small matter so all those you
know bad stuff should be replaced just
to try make our product successful not
necessarily the methodology that we use
successful okay so thank you for your
attention I feed those people are
leaving for another session so thank you
remember about the feedback
I'm not certain if there are times for
questions but I'm here around so we can
talk and again thank you for your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
