I'm your employee from Oracle technology
Network and my guest is a Guido yes hang
middle/high not video nice to meet you
too so you have a session about Apache
Kafka
yep that's right so tell us first like
what is it okay
Apache Kafka I always tell people are
new to it it kind of metaphor on
steroids so what you always wanted to
have within a traditional Jamis kind of
broker you have with Kafka so what do
you sell I mean what do you present
actually in your session I'm at yeah I
will start first introduction because
there are also people who are not so
familiar with it so the idea is to give
the motivation why LinkedIn LinkedIn was
a company who started with Kafka why
they built Kafka and why it's
interesting for us as well you see it
more and more in different architectures
micro-service architectures event stream
processing architectures and yeah I will
just tell about the the basics so why
why does it work why is it scalable why
is it fast and so all these properties
which are course sounds interesting
because that's what I always missed when
I use traditional brokers in the past
and yeah just to show how how you get
that with Kafka okay so it's it's
between micro services and events
basically that's it not it doesn't
matter it also like between micro
services it's basically a message broker
which you can use to pass messages and a
message can be an event and it's
scalable in a way that it scales out
from an architectural point of view and
by that it doesn't really matter how
many events you pass so I also will tell
people you can think it as you can think
about a message call as aria method call
and you don't have to think about how
much it costs me to send an event from
one component to the other so so think
about I'm calling a method on another on
another component but instead of doing
it by a method call in a synchronous way
in a very coupled way you do it's very
key couple little messages bypassing
events yes and and then of course you
have to think about what what happens if
I do it I don't know ten thousand times
a second or 100,000 times a second or a
million times a second and of course if
you want to be able to do that you have
you need the product which is scalable
and the project Kafka can really handle
that okay
and so with what what other products do
you use it I mean is it I mean is it the
open source and it's a good question so
you can have it the on-prem you can have
it in a cloud and it works with them I
would say almost everything you have
today I'm not sure about Cobble if you
have a couple application might be
difficult although there is a rest
service so if you can anything which can
call rest can also be a producer to
Kafka but normally you don't use rest
because it slows it down as well so
there's are there are find api for java
for pricing for go for c++ for c-sharp
and so on i'm always using at this java
or or a component which has Kafka
support built into it so from Oracle
there is built in supporting Golden Gate
for example there's still been
supporting Oracle stream analytics
Oracle service box so there's quite a
lot of product which which comes with
built-in support for Kafka okay that
makes it very interesting of course
right so as a developer if I want to use
that it doesn't come by itself it's
already integrated with something else
the client is integrated but of course
you need a broker a cluster so Kafka is
always running on a cluster with
multiple machines so you need to set up
that
in a central place I mean if you do it
on Prem if you do it in the cloud you
can also have it as a cloud service so
Oracle for example an Oracle event top
cloud service that that is just cost as
a service as a managed service and
that's also interesting in architecture
depending on where you get the messages
from if it's an IOT use case then maybe
the the messages or events the devices
they're already in the cloud or in the
Internet so maybe you want to have a
Kafka instance which is near to their to
your to your producers to you're the
ones who send you in the messages okay
and some of your examples are actually
with IOT as well right yes we we have
used it in a project or in a at the
customer for now three years and we
built first the infrastructure then we
did some social media so we had stricter
as a load and put that into Kafka and
now we also have an IOT use case where
we have devices producing messages and
sending these messages to to Kafka
directly and then after that you have
the consumers and that can be an again
anything it can be a stream processing
solution when you need low latency like
you want to analyze directly on the on
the stream or it can be in a dupe system
which we always also have to put your
raw event into HDFS for example so you
can just consume from Kafka and store it
in a file and so how do people can find
I mean find out more about the projects
and also examples that you're giving
during this during your session I mean I
after the of course that is the
presentation I do some demos as well
there and I mean there are many sources
these days I also have a blog where I
where I do weekly reports on stream
processing where Kafka is a very
important topic I just try to reference
all the the new blog articles new
presentations
coming from all people which I find I
also have some some articles from time
to time there but if you want to start
there also a couple of very good books
from people from Kafka itself the the
people who have written cops how they
they are just writing one at the moments
and so there's lots of information
available today well thank you any last
thoughts about the things that you want
to share to developers I think it's just
a perfect
so everybody who had not yet use this I
think it's just worth it to use it we
restore this cop car and that was the
the architecture choice or product
choice we never regret regret so far so
this was the real thing to do three
years ago and at that time it was still
quite new today it's more simple to get
into it and to learn it and I would just
say yes just come to my session and and
and and use it yeah cool in an hour all
that go everybody right here so thank
you thank you so much thank you and
thank you for the tip we will use Castro
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
