if you want to get a little bit closer
to make questions will be sharing the
microphone I would like to thank you
very much all the panelists and
specially Matthias for the invitation
and discussion it's always a very good
start for enhancing community and
enhancing projects so I'm pretty happy
to have people here that wants to be
discussing we want to talk a little bit
to Maternity okay perfect I would like
to introduce you to some of our
panelists so we have mr. George sab here
probably most of you know him VPN
software development we also have Eric
Staal also a VP on IOT space and Peter I
would not say your last name you we
thank you either you yeah right from
probably manager as well robert we have
robert clark here on the project
management as well right development so
thank you very much for coming bro
number and from community we do have
here but reigns Kirk from a performance
expired hey Kirk oh right and Trisha
Trisha key is here with us and my tias
cars home also the the guy that had the
idea of doing this panel so thank you
very much for inviting everybody you
don't like it it's his fault yes if you
like it is everything responsibility if
you like it it's your asphalt
at last one that's me our singer from
Seoul java resile so let's start with
some if you want to can you move the to
the next slide so we prepare with some
questions but if you want to do
questions through google moderator you
can just access this nice Billy URL or
also use the JC pano and Java one
hashtags will be trying to monitor that
we have all the Twitter accounts here
almost all we are missing Eric reddit
Twitter I don't think I'd imagine i
don't use twitter no more a facebook
kind of guy myspace myspace but actually
it just does ello but if you feel better
just get going to get the microphone
just show up and we'll share the
microphone if you so we did receive some
questions and let's start start with
some questions from attires the who
created that regarding jugs so is there
anything more oracle could do to support
and marketing the existence of jugs how
do you feel about that friends wait yeah
on a second you asked the question
you're going to answer it yeah yeah yeah
so so I don't get the question and the
one thing I this is soap box here so in
the sense that is a lot of things that
are going around in the community and
I'm kind of wondering if Oracle kind of
likes what's happening and if there's
anything more you can do to to support
the difference initiatives and you know
you secret meetings around the world and
stuff like that
maybe this for you Peter so I'm Peter
which diner the Java evangelist teams at
my group so so the the our relationship
with the community is tremendously
asymmetric there's way more of you than
there are of us and it's a good thing so
so Oracle definitely is aware i think
the first part of your question is aware
of the community and and that things are
going well and we do a lot to promote
that within Oracle right the most recent
example of that is at a so my boss
amisha Suja he reports Thomas Korean
runs all development for Oracle and
recently the woman that runs all of the
events open world in Java one was
presenting at his staff meeting and the
highlight for her to be presenting was
the vibrancy of Java one this year so
all the stuff that we had said in a
keynote about attendance and about the
number of submissions of talks and all
the exhibitors showing up you know from
where it was three or four years ago she
was able to now come in with a gold star
and say this Java one event looks great
the communities involved and it's
highlighting it so we try to push up as
much goodness from the community so
things like when we did the the eight
launch and the outreach and the
evangelists were out on the road with
Stephens night hacking tour we take
every single positive thing that we can
and try to wrap it up so that there's
awareness upward about that that doesn't
always translate into more dollars or
more evangelist but it definitely keeps
the investment that is there safe so
it's kind of the better thing that we
can do there's all kinds of stuff that
we can do using otn or using the
platforms that we have to raise that
availability I think the thing that we
probably don't do enough of which we've
talked about in previous years is how
could the jugs if needed better use
Oracle facilities around the world to
hold events because i know it in some
locations
places it's hard to find a big room or
to find the right facility or in a
central location or something so that's
something I would like to see better
coordinated but any I am open to any
ideas that come from you guys and
through the Evangelist or directly with
me or whatever to figure that out yeah
sure it seems like you could work to
make java.net more relevant and actually
update the platform so it makes it a
useful place for community people to
blog actually and and to and to be able
to keep schedules and advertiser vents
it seems like that the java.net is
woefully stuck in some state right now
that is not really useful for us to help
you help promote more community it's
cool that we're speaking next to each
other with a mic and it's a little like
in a conference like we're at Yalta I
can i call ya so so I'm resent ative
from Hungary please yeah make cast your
vote so java.net is kind of a crappy
year old system I think the worst it
really didn't help me when Jim Weaver on
boarded and and one of his first task
was to launch the IOT or embedded space
within java.net and coming from kind of
a rich FX background I thought he was
going to rip his hair out so we know
that it's old and creaky I think the otn
folks are also trying to figure out like
what should java.net become and I think
the decision you know it shouldn't be a
sourceforge we should let source for
just be source for jizz but we would
like it to be a place where you guys can
come and have a dialogue and create and
do things I don't know the degree that
the community has been involved with the
otn team in terms of the future
direction of it so that's something I
would take back to to Roland
and what they do with Donna we have a
new editor right Bob Evans of Oracle
yeah what do you mean a new editor yeah
yeah is the mic type yeah he took it
from me I said we have a new editors
like bob bob evans so this seems like a
good opportunity for i guess maybe a bit
about reach to figure out what yeah i
think so yeah so it seems like an
opportunity to get out reach to get say
you know how what does the community
actually need in order to make the site
useful for community so said I'm going
to put you on the spot but somebody else
we would just need somebody a couple of
you whatever to be the we're we're
willing and wanting to to get involved
in java.net project thing oh that's the
hashtag right okay awesome so let's take
this offline and see what the otn things
in the current state of it and what we
can do but I agree with you but
volunteer editor panel so I think that
is something you should post on the
juggler the least and if you're looking
for somebody that could step up and help
with that that is a really good thing to
use at least four so to continue on the
subject then so do you see any
difference in the way you did the Java 7
and the Java 8 launch and how you use
the euro you see groups differently and
which one of them would in that case
kind of prefer because i think that the
signaling for java 7 was really
brilliant nobody remembers right so what
happened when we so we really do java 7
lawrence saying it was kind of worldwide
event and we were given a
a bit of a monetary thing to actually
held a meeting and then we have this
kind of java 7 launch t-shirt so the
lawns can went out through to the
different judge through the world so
that you can use that it's marketing and
so that really worked out well yeah and
the Java 8 was more online right they
produce it thousands and thousands of
videos tutorials and all that yeah so so
a couple things and this will sound like
a cop out but it's not so in the well
tooth is so I'll answer the first
question was like how the use of the
user groups and how did what did we
think about seven eight I think aside
from the mechanics of how we did the
outreach I think when we were doing
seven the from an Oracle perspective the
community was we were in fear of kind of
the state of the community the community
visa V us and how we were doing so there
was a real conscious emphasis of Kim can
we be friends and try to start to build
that bridge between the two ends we are
friends now ya know and I appreciate
that so but the end em with seven so
that like if you just say the dynamics
of seven and eight I think we went from
the we're trying to get java back on
track please don't hate us and help us
to eight where it was like together we
were actually celebrating it because it
was a good thing and I think a lot of
maybe the animosity back and forth or
whatever that had grown over the years
that we inherited whatever wasn't there
so that for me that's the difference
between the user groups in terms of the
mechanics of it Oracle's change the way
that we do major product launches so
Cameron was probably the first one to
suffer through this when even with the
EE 7 launched last year he was the first
one to have to do an all online launch
and then we were the next ones with um
with with se8 right so it did Oracle
changed its format and doesn't do big
launches even for Oracle products
they're doing mostly these online things
which are effective in terms are using a
medium
not as effective from a people
perspective yes because on the user
group perspective on java 8 launch we
lose a bit of space as user groups right
on 7 the user groups what were more
involved and they knew better before and
all that on the Java 8 launch I thought
it was a great surprise to have all
those videos and all that but it was
more like a surprise even for the user
group so in terms of cooperation I way
earlier Java 7 because we are trying to
be friends we got a little bit more
space on that that we owe ya ever had
and and you know java 7 actually needed
something exciting to happen with it
because there wasn't really that much
excitement in there except for was a new
law it was a clean up for launch 48
really comes with a lot of pre hype
anyways but I would like now to do the
another question that came from tricia
the other way back so now we ask it how
r co or you know organization could
support better the user groups and now I
would like to listen a little bit more
about what would you expect from the
user groups to keep it vibrant and and
all that so what how user groups and
java champions can work better in
benefit of our community and friendship
so I I'm Henrik many of you most of you
maybe know me so in a way Peter and his
team are kind of responsible for working
with you and telling you what's going on
and getting you involved whereas my team
is responsible for listening to you and
trying to take that feedback and
figuring out how we can use that to
improve our technology in particular
it's kind of ironic given how much I
like talking about you know we were all
thinking that yeah weren't going to sell
so do you thank you George one one thing
that I particularly appreciate which
today is not particularly well
structured is there are a number of user
groups and user group leads representing
like that you know the broad unwashed
masses if you will of Java developers
that's you by the way
is like there again there are very few
of us I have about 15 people in my team
and we're supposed to be responsible for
understanding everything that goes on
everywhere would like technology in the
world and seeing all the trends and all
that and the realities well you know
half all the time we're working on
completing turn of things we're not even
out listening and the rest of the time
you know we're very tainted by what we
see because most of what we most of the
information we get our through oracle
lenses which is only a very small part
of like what happens in the world so
something out find refreshing in like
meeting with you guys and getting your
feedback is that you often have a very
different perspective on what goes on in
the industry and it's hard to get that
information through other sources sure
it can go to developer conference but at
the end of the day you represent the
developers and you have already still
the information that when you share it
with us we get like a highly refined
view of on what goes on so it's very
very valuable to gather information now
the way it works today is very
unstructured so these are basically
ad-hoc conversations and there are a few
people that for whatever reasons are
just more vocal or they're more
proactive in reaching out to us or they
just happen to be more conveniently
located close to our offices so we spend
more time with them which is which is
good like you know I spend a lot of time
with Matthias and it's kind of hard to
avoid not spending a lot of time with
Bruno but I would like to find a way to
make this kind of feedback loop be a bit
more structured so that not only you who
represent the user groups but also
they're the kind of second layer namely
the developers in your constituencies
also feel that you know their views and
their feedback and and their character
action on where they think what they
think we need to focus on can come back
to us and then be incorporated it into
our future planning because I mean at
the end of the day sure Java is
developed in an open collaborative
fashion but like ninety percent of the
resources come from Oracle right so it's
very important for you that we
understand
we understand why you believe that Java
needs to go okay that's something I
would like to have can I send you all to
follow wait listen so that's so
completely agree with what Henrik saying
that could be in the form of a number of
things if he has like a simple binary
decision of do we want to support this
addthis do that or even a feel of it it
would be great to even have not to try
to distill it down to a survey but
something in the form of like you could
push it out you guys amplify it out you
kool aid it we get it back for some
things it could just be that simple
because then we we actually have like
Henrik assigned a high-quality sample
size that isn't just us making stuff up
right which would be helpful so I don't
know what the mechanics so that would be
but it could be like conversations or
the visits but also like a survey ish
type thing Henrik yes
well I mean you have to mailing list set
up and that you guys seem afraid to use
Theresa wants to talk me okay how come I
was gonna say in there in the london
java community we serve started the
adopters are adopted openjdk one of the
interesting things about starting that
was the fact that trying to give
developers the empowerment of feeding
stuff back to Oracle and saying you can
actually help influence the direction I
think there's still a kind of surprise
from the development community that they
can actually help to contribute to that
sort of thing so firstly I think there's
still an education piece around saying
you your voice is important and we would
like to hear it and the the second part
was do you find the dr josiah dr. jdk
stop useful is that oh yeah oh yeah yeah
um so I retire I I said this um in the
keynote and I'll say it again i would
like to thank all of you write the
original question was you know what can
what can jugs and what can folks in the
community do to help us and support us
and I'm just so gratified at the help
that you've provided us already as we
were working on eight you know the the
hackathons and things done you know the
sessions where it was like working on
date time and working on lambda I mean
the date-time the tests you know TCK
tests and other tests for daytime came
in large part from you know jugs getting
together and and you know encouraging
people to write some of these in
treating them and i can tell you you
know I kind of wondered i was like huh
well this could be interesting to see
how this goes like you know are we going
to get a bunch of things that you know
work really well or is it going to be
you know kind of unorganized and kind of
all over the map and and i asked folks
on on the TC cape team to look at these
and and kind of give me their assessment
and they said they are just absolutely
awesome they're really well done their
high quality their thought through there
well organized and and you know this is
from an organization of people who you
know for years and years and years have
been doing this as you know
their bread and butter they're living so
that that's just great I think also the
feedback that we've gotten on things
like you know the design of lambda and
streams as we've gone along you know
hearing about the things you know from
you getting together encouraging people
you know making it easy like packaging
up the here's how we get started and
have an environment that we can work in
and in fact I think you know the
ambition was the first I think the first
time the london java community did this
it was like well we're going to get some
people together and we're going to look
at lambdas and by the end of the first
session all that had happened was
somebody was able to get a working
environment and it was i oh ok well
that's the starting point right now we
have a baseline and the nice thing is
that as things went along you know each
one of these got easier and they got
better and you know I I had a number of
people i think there were some some
people in the Avengers team there were
certainly people on my development team
who were able to get together in some of
those sort of larger groups like that
and and sort of help out and but not
just help out be helped out right and
and so I thank you for that all of you
and and I'd love to see more of that and
you know as Peter says right there are
so many user groups and and you know
organizations out there that we can't
possibly you know if I wanted to have
someone from the development team at
each one of those we just actually never
be doing any development because we
could just go around and do that and be
completely full up but so we can't do
that on the other hand what we can do is
try to you know pick a few and look at
some places where you know it actually
will make sense and be involved in that
and I'd love to see that happen as we're
going forward with nine because you know
I did mention this in the keynote you
know you will hear more about this some
of the things that we're doing in nine
are going to be a challenge as far as
adoption and making sure that we have
the balance of compatibility you know
versus isolation and modulation and so
on so so we really will need your help
with that because we want to get it
right we really do want to get it right
and and it's not gonna be easy to
can you come here please sorry no
problem at all two things with regards
to the feedback loop can you hear me now
okay with regards to the feedback loop I
run a jug but I have a full-time day job
i mentor for FIRST Robotics I've got
four kids so I don't have time to read
the I actually have a filter that puts
the jug list off to a side and I maybe
look at it every couple months is there
some sort of a synopsis page where high
level features or whatever are that are
being considered you know along the
lines of a survey but not a survey on a
feature by feature basis but more of a
list and a voting type thing that would
be useful to me where I could look at it
quickly and stay up to date at a high
level and so let me see if I understand
the question so you're wondering whether
there's a place you can go to get an
idea of features that are being
considered for future releases yeah
without having to wade through like the
bug tracker yeah well so what I would
say on that is on you know we we
recently earlier in the year made a sort
of rev of the other JDK enhancement
proposal process and the intent of that
was very much to make it you know first
of all so that the information on jeff's
was in a system that people would be
encouraged to keep live right so rather
than being a snapshot of what someone
thought two years ago it's sort of
here's what the latest thinking is on
this thing and the other part of it was
to have additional transparency on kind
of the workflow of these things right so
there was a workflow with kind of the
first rep of Jeff but that was kind of
revved in the second Rev which is why we
call it a rev and so so what that does
if you go and look at it hopefully it is
kind of clear in terms of what the state
of a particular JEP is at any point so
you know whether it's something that's
like as a crazy idea we're just kind of
discussing and trying to figure out
versus it's now something that we think
is you know is actually candidate that
would be reasonable to consider in some
future release and maybe you know what
release that might be versus we're now
to the point where we really think we
understand enough about the scope and we
have kind of the commitment of the
various you know things that need to be
involved in order to actually deliver it
successfully that you know we're
comfortable actually saying it's
targeted to a particular release so
right now that is just you know kind of
a workflow in a group of entries in the
OpenJDK jira that is something where my
expectation is that you know over time
we'll figure out a few things that make
it easier to look at so that if you
wanted to say show me all of the things
that are you know currently you know we
think might go into eight you 40 or in
29 you could just go and look at that
page and then you'd see which of those
are sort of to the point where you know
we're confident enough in them that
they're targeted vs it's a candidate it
might go in but we're still kind of
learning about it and part of the intent
of all of this by the way is to be a
little bit more you know a little more
agile in our development so that you
know we're a little bit more late
binding in terms of commitment to
releases but with the result that
hopefully there's sort of less this is
definitely there oh well maybe it's not
because you know we want to be clear
about where we actually think particular
things are so hopefully that helps does
that it helps a little bit thank you for
your question I would like to change the
subject a little bit I have recently
watched that talk from the stack
overflow founder and he was talking
about the Anthropology for stack
overflow and how they can change
behavior by giving badges so when they
give the badges they can really change
the behavior of the participants on the
stack overflow so now we clearly see
that all the iot space is being rewarded
with the number of talks we have here
and all the attention that this is
calling and the discussion would be are
we forgetting or taking out a little bit
of the focus of java ee which is the
technology
that mainly pay the bill for most Java
developers I'll say something quick on
that and then I'll that somebody who
actually knows about it talk more um you
know my view of it is this right when
you look at IOT typically what people
are doing in IOT is an end-to-end kind
of thing right there are sensors or
things out on the edge there's some kind
of you know relay our gateway and
there's a back end and what is that
back-end probably going to be written it
it's probably going to be written in you
know in Java EE or you know some of the
component technologies of e so so we
don't see it as kind of one or the other
we think he is a very very crucial part
of a real IT solution so I'm probably
guilty and more so than anybody else
from just me I'm very focused in trying
to make sure that that we are making the
IOT opportunity as accessible as
possible for java developers so it kind
of cuts both ways right on the it
definitely shouldn't be happening to the
detriment of E and I think on a Java one
thing I wouldn't have necessarily
expected that I suppose if you add
another track then automatically you're
you're reducing the number of possible
talk so I can see how we could see it
that way I think that if I turn it
around and look at it this way from pure
economics the our economies are going to
shift largely to services based on
infrastructure based on devices right so
all of the and this is me like I make
the kool-aid with Henrik so we're
serving you kool aid right now for free
but I am absolutely convinced that even
the wave that we're seeing of innovation
of mobile applications and the adoption
of smartphones and tablets and stuff 10
years 15 years from now we're going to
look back and laugh right because these
actually become the ultimate remote
controls to our environment the physical
environment around us which we will now
be interacting more with with IOT
offered what's it assuming they look
like this in 10 years and they're not
inside here and I have a zipper on my
head and that's my upgrade which could
very well be happened and I at least I
can choose which side of my head the
zipper goes on so the N and I guess the
point to that thanks code for throwing
me off my track no I think the point to
that actually this is the point I want
to say which was the in the past Emmy
and embedded se embedded were like the
redheaded stepchild I mean how many
people knew Emma developers write any
when i started in whenever it was 2010
started getting acquainted with java in
the community and in particular java one
it was like they were the odd ducklings
i felt really bad it was like it was the
part of the keynote where everybody
walked out they were the least attended
sessions right and that's because those
were exotic things in niche markets and
we want to try to make sure that you
know that the bridge is there so that
the same skills are applicable and
george is absolutely right the the in
five or ten years time if the this kind
of plan works that you guys will have
the expertise of the back end but also
have the expertise to understanding how
to change the behavior of the devices
that connect to the back end and right
now embedded development is pretty dumb
it's limited code running on a limited
device that doesn't know how to evolve
and we have to collectively change that
devices have to be smart and they have
to be connected to the existing
infrastructure yeah just keep robot
rewarding the java ee experts as well
because i sometimes I feel like my
friends that are not into the IOT space
yet they are like no I have never
touched the Raspberry Pi and you know
that maybe all this rewards our around
IOT might make the java ee heroes less
important yeah it's so my question back
to you on that and
and I I was hearing Cameron we did a
press panel yesterday and cam I thought
maybe was a little bit defensive as it
relates to mobility and E which for him
from an e perspective the like the
shiner luster of EE was getting lost
just because of all the developers who
were moving to mobile development and
his point is okay that's fine there's
lots of mobile development but
ultimately it's like I end Kim Kim will
say he makes up statistics so he was
saying his guess eighty percent whatever
number he could make up all the backend
stuff is Java and he's trying to with
others in the community and that was
part of their keynote is how do you
change e to be able to also take into
consideration behavior of a ton of
mobile devices connecting to back-end
and equally and it's probably not there
yet the implications of IOT to EE as the
next devices so I think the things
they're doing with mobility will go to
IOT and by the way f and by the way
because we haven't said se in a while I
have to say no actually what I want to
say is that you know one of the things I
think is very exciting and you know to
your question of looking at things in
the future this is a space to watch
because one of the things that we're
doing in SE is we're looking at the
things that are needed for IOT and we're
looking at the things that are needed
for EE and we're helping use that to
drive innovation in SE so when you look
at some of the things that we're looking
at thinking about planning for keep in
mind that you know those things are not
things that are just sort of ivory tower
you know we're doing because they're
cool in isolation there are actually
things that you know are being driven by
a real need whether it's a need to be
able to accommodate you know smaller
devices and a smaller profile for SE or
a job as a whole or whether it's in
order to be able to do more stuff in a
cloud you know more flexibly get more
out of the same amount of resources you
know in order to drive the back end of
these things thank you very much now
another subject going back to something
I'll handle the question one second
talking about another thing that it's
being cool and attendance all around the
world not only here in US but in all the
word regarding startups we have all this
we have this question from Bruna what
can oracle java champions and jugs do
together to engage our community on this
worldwide movement to promote
enterpreneurship and startups Robert
hasn't said anything yet take a few time
to answer yes just you know now on the
jugs forum on the big data panel there
was one professor from stand at Stanford
and he was telling us that no student
wants to go to the market right they all
want to go for startups so as a
community what can we do to engage more
on the startups ecosystem so that's a
great question so what we are seeing as
well is that a lot of developers have
great ideas and they're really
passionate and creative but they didn't
really know what's the next step so what
we've done with dev ox is that we
actually have a start-up track now so
the startup tracking is actually showing
all the dynamics of like VCS angels the
whole levels I Charles lean startup etc
and I think it would be a great great
addition if you want to increase Java on
the tendons to maybe consider a track
around that because you're in the
centrum of the VC Roseanne done beyond
doesn't always have to be VC right and
maybe channel a little bit well and in
fact I don't know if you remember but
this was something that actually
happened very early in javas life that
in fact there was a particular VC who
put together a fund that was
specifically to fund startups doing
things which other fish which was
definitely don't focus just on the VC
route I mean there's also organic or
ways of growing etc but it would be
great if you want to increase like ten
twenty percent more attendees I think
that's a really
big opportunity and I'm taking that one
for sure in with the dev ox movement
yeah it would be great to do that in
user groups as well at a smaller scale
but I think what would be really
interesting for user groups is and more
difficult is the differences in the
legalities of starting up your own
startups because we hear a lot from so
I'm based in Spain at the moment I know
how to start a company in the UK I hear
a lot about startups in the US I have no
idea how to do it in Spain and it'll be
good to some local information about how
to start your own startups and how to
grow them and how to reach out to them
yes until you see what we did was an
expo export export area for startups and
makers so instead of talks we let them
show their products they're so like in
the exposition area we had these little
tables for people to expose their selves
that's our startup guy here let me just
add one thing here of course I think
that at oleg review that doing more
things and events for example Java one
could be an excellent place we have here
like a whole week of activities they
know that we could do a lot more in
terms of the startups one thing that we
that we are seen is that all over the
world you know you have this in Brazil
particular right now he's seen a lot
there's a whole lot of movement of
people one inch of tribute ursday i
start up wanting to start a business and
there is a huge movement of explaining
how to do it and how to business plan
how to contact invest and everything and
every time you go to those things you
know everything has been talking about
this ruby is Piton is PHP right you know
there's very very little talk of Java
right so I think that's you know what
can we do to get a little bit more
attention to participate or more on this
to get you know more what we are doing
because because of course you know we
are seeing a lot of the startups that
started with that if those technologies
are coming back to tower right and so
how can I actually get engaged in
earlier on this discussion again the
badges right maybe read words yeah it so
did um just one quick so the so it's
funny I I live with like an ongoing fear
of offending the community and I tried
personally through my team through
development to kind of buffer the Oracle
that's like you know that's an
enterprise software company money and
the rest of it from what's happening in
the community so if I had proposed to
have like a start-up thing I would have
thought like I never in a million years
thought that you guys would think that
having like a start-up track because I
would have thought you would have
thought it was like Oracle trying to do
some commercial edge or tweaking it or
sucking the marrow out of the bone of
the community so certainly for me if
that's something that you guys think
people would like to have we could use
you know I'd we could have ethroo people
in oracle including our own MAA folks
bring in like quality VCS who could
either give talks their local here it's
like it's not like we're asking them to
go on a plane you could do another thing
and have like I don't even know how you
would organize this without it being it
like crazy like propose your idea even
through the JCP type of thing some kind
of pre-qualification thing where there's
like 30 companies get thinking a little
bit of like ignite but startups but 10
minutes you got ten minutes here is your
idea what you're doing or is it of
interest to the VCS to even use the fact
that the events happening here too for
them to do like a speed dating type of
thing with meeting lots of companies and
ideas and it's even you know talks i
think you know having to your point of
you know how to focus how to get started
are they doing it you know what have
their experiences right taking the point
of it the blueprint of a successful
startup right and so okay they've
they've done this in yeah
they've done this as part of the
conference in malmo and I think it was
it was relatively lightly attended but
the people who are there really learned
a lot because they had people coming and
say look this is what I did to get my
company started this is how we went
through successive rounds of funding
this is how all the things we had to do
to keep track of these are the problems
these are the good things Sam all that
stuff and I don't think many people just
understand any of that Eric and I have
if you don't mind can you make a note to
you to talk to Steven about doing this
sure and we can talk I'm happy to be
involved in what it is but just
discussion yep thank you very much
Matthias sorry he had a question behind
you those are more of a suggestion but
um I have has any thought been given to
having an accelerator program to learn
maybe Y Combinator but we invest as a
very small amount of money but you
provide got maybe guidance via visit EV
maybe the job evangelist team or
somebody else who can provide technical
assistance and by kid could help the
acceleration of the deployment of
technology for very little funding on
Oracle's part but you can't for a tiny
bit of that market share of that
company's capitalization and it could be
it but providing what the providing this
guidance it is a win-win basically in a
very short amount of time potentially
yeah so so I don't know but I can look
into I have no idea what Oracle does in
terms of like yeah well but we're not
like other companies in a lot of ways so
but what I don't know what Oracle does
in like micro investment stuff would be
one thing but the other thing i was and
i'm going to hijack your question a
little bit the two thing is when you say
to help them as well it's like it's
taken us a while to get the not only the
Oracle crowd stood up but the revamping
of the Java service on the Oracle cloud
and I had were spoken to some of the jug
leaders like two years ago when we were
doing it and it was still e5 and
everybody laughed and stuff and now it's
better and and they revamped it or
whatever would having Oracle cloud
instances where there's like a free
developer
yeah yeah but in like a very limited
kind of you're not building a body ideas
yeah maybe we should do is drop all I
don't know so so that it's it's kind of
funny that it comes up so I'll have to
echo Peter we've actually consciously
try to avoid bringing commercial Oracle
into the java community because we're
afraid of alienating the developers and
it may actually be in that we've gone
too far let the pendulum swung too far
in that direction yea big if you look at
other companies that lad hub I mean the
type of community we do that aren't that
many automate basically it's like
Microsoft Apple Google and that's it
right but they are much more brazen when
it comes to pushing their commercial
technologies to their communities which
we've been so one of the challenges we
have is that we've been treating job as
a development community and we've
intentionally firewall that from the
common commercial side of Oracle right
in order to you know not overwhelm you
with with crazy sales people but there
are there are a couple of things that
are happening so for instance we do have
adoption programs around the world cloud
we do have the oracle partnernetwork
which is a large commercial kind of
network adopt an Oracle technology you
provide value on top of that and you get
a ton of help pushing that up into the
market I know those 20 whatever 5,000
crazy sales people we have if you part
of this they actually help push your
things as well because one of the things
you need a start-up is is help to
generate leads and generates us I'm
absolutely convinced that if we raise
this with the appropriate groups in sort
of Oracle they would jump at it and want
to do it we would need we would want to
do it with some of you very carefully so
that it doesn't become an Oracle thing
right it's like oh that means we can
kill jawan we just put it as part of
open world that we're done right so just
be aware that these forces inside of a
camp like Oracle are very very strong
right and when you wake when you wake
the dragon right it may be hard putting
it to sleep again yes on the other hand
let's go to this discussion on startups
more on the discussion we still have
three important questions to handle so
I'm sorry about interrupting this
Matthias was trying to talk yeah okay we
got one question from Twitter and I
would like to put this here as more like
a suggestion than a real question which
is does it make sense to have a geo geo
location aware jug finder on the
download of Java yes so the
infrastructure that we have all these
nice tool bar offers that you'll love
and adore by the way you should click
yes and tell all your your relatives to
do it because we make a little bit more
money that way which goes back to
funding Java so but we have a pretty
nifty infrastructure behind this so we
can we can make all sorts of logic
decisions and we're pretty careful about
you know doing things that would offend
the different constituencies right so we
don't push an offer in Europe that's not
available in europe for example so what
you're asking for is technically
possible using the platform we have we'd
have to look into it and i have a
feeling that sorry yeah yeah yeah no
yeah what I'm saying we have we have
what we need to enable this sort of
thing we just have to figure out the
right we're doing it but at least I
don't think anyone would it be upset
about getting a toolbar offer that's us
this is the location of your local Java
user group so I like the idea perfect
thank you so next next question one
comment NM agaric a module toolbar in
other words in other words be careful
how you do view location because not
everybody when they install the stuff
actually wants yeah for the locations
are
physically I good run that we run into
this problem a lot of times another
another question here from from Regina
is are you aware that scheduling javaone
to the last week of October it will be
just one week before the Vox and Jay
fall it will work yeah we we are aware
of that and the reality of this is we
would never get the funding we get and
the support we get from the pink Oracle
corporate dragon unless this was
co-located with open world and where
when they're planning when they're doing
open world they're searching not asking
when Jay focus or dialogue sorry I'm
sorry that's just yes we have about
fifty sixty thousand people in the city
and they're not going to move so the
moscone availability is once it climbs
like three years in advance structure
yeah so that's hard yeah I get that but
just be aware that okay this year all
like hallelujah there's more people
coming to Jeff one but when it's so
close in Europe to other big conferences
people will not come to jail for one
they will go to their closer conferences
that are also big yep and then you're
not so like really unfortunately one of
those things that's probably out of our
control yeah each other but may be
opening the discussion and planning for
the other years or you know so if we
were able to do with a couple of years
advanced tell you when the compress
would be here that other people can plan
around that who that help but not we
might be able to yes yes that helps a
lot should be doable right would should
because you have to book the Moscow
ability yeah it's made it mainly a
matter of getting the dates for more
advanced team perfect another question
they are the tools ecosystem is very
crowded now we have lots of tools to
invest and projects to invest we would
like to open a little discussion
regarding netbeans NetBeans investment
and admins future can you comment a
little bit about that so yes it's not
that much space Oracle continues to
invest in that means the level
investment goes up and down depending on
you know where oracle puts his money one
of the interesting things that have
happened lately as the Oracle
development cloud service got a ton of
funding right because they want to build
their own little fancy development cloud
and that's actually based on that means
the NetBeans platform then with a
compiler and the underlying components
of the UI so that team got a little bit
of an influx of founding because of that
so I think it's fair to say that
netbeans will continue to thrive based
partially on that influx of funding at
the very least until you know nine nine
and a half ten long-term maybe will be
better to find some solution where we
where we merge different IDs in the
market maybe everyone will move to web
by ease we don't know at this point but
right now it's a small but very stable
team and we keep working with them and
all the releases that we do well any
other comments another comment a lot of
masks question first time you can do
your comments well okay so from my
perspective this has been an interesting
year from the NetBeans team because we
were reaching out to people too for this
that or the other thing and all sudden
people started disappearing and then
when we raised a question in the mailing
list you know there was a long
conversation it went on for quite some
time but we actually couldn't get an
Oracle person to comment on what was
actually going on in the team it really
seemed like from an outside looking in
that the team was being completely
defunded and and basically shut down we
didn't get a roadmap we didn't get
anything and it was it was very
disturbing and we just not sure why I
mean that whole conversation could have
been I
highly shortened and yeah okay so I'm
assuming now you you've kind of gathered
there's a pattern so when we turtle on
things and kind of go into the shell
we're figuring things out right and it's
not that we're not listening but a lot
of times we just can't communicate
because the things still in flux so
there's there's what's that I know but
still there's I know but still is it's
just and it's not just with netbeans as
other times where where we're having to
make decisions there are other influence
things I for me that goes under like the
bigger broader thing of are we able and
to do more and better communication with
you guys and we do continue to fall down
on stuff and that I know exactly this
situation that you're talking about and
there were 10 people running around with
a hair on fire wanting to communicate
wanting to say things but we had to
figure things out first right so it
wasn't bad sure yeah I'm not and I'm not
enticing justifying i mean the the
really scary thing about this is that
there's a number of interesting clients
doing interesting things with the
platform and and they actually for some
reason were scared off by other lines of
communication and we found that it
because some of them are my clients and
they and they were a lot of them were
questioning not on their investment in
netbeans platform but they're also now
questioning their investment in java
based on the fact that this you know
this platform that they invested a lot
of money in was now seemingly you know
disappearing so it wasn't just in people
disappearing it was other lines of
communication telling these people and
it was like all the stuff came together
and then all of a sudden there's like
you know yeah so so this is something
this is something that happens from time
and again we've had people question
their investment in java because
Oracle's group of hudson right right
like if you if you want to draw a
possible patterns between different
technologies and different parts you can
do that and you can say because like
oracle decided that you found this no
opensolaris thing over here i'm no
longer
java some people will come to that
conclusion we can't do much about it
it's it's obvious though that Oracle is
certainly not taking job anywhere bad so
I like that that that conclusion is
wrong and hopefully you as drug leaders
can help us clarify that look maybe
there's a bit of feelin s over here
opensolaris or whatever but doesn't
impact things over on this side llamas
help you yeah but again one of the
things that we strive to do since we
acquired a son wants to have very open
channels of conversations it's like a
porous layer like a Swiss cheese things
leak through we're not Apple right that
you know we were quiet and quiet and
quiet and all of a sudden something
happens the flip side of this is that
you're also you will also be aware when
things are in flux and that may get you
nervous and we know may not be able to
talk about it because things are in flux
and we're not able to communicate until
we're done and because we have these
open channels of conversation you are
going to be aware when these things
happen so I it's almost unavoidable that
they're going to be periods of time when
you know there is change and you know
there's change and you see it and it
makes you nervous and when you ask as we
say sorry can't talk about it yet okay
sure I we were getting clobbered
publicly on the security stuff we we
were developing a plan that now in
retrospect for the last two years I
think everybody would would say you know
but we and literally it was moving
developers wait you know like one of
those third world ferries that shifts
like everybody to get the end we button
it down and it took whatever 18 months
to years but like that was another one
of those examples of a time for us to
get the right things mobilized to do the
right thing takes time great we got to
get better to make those gaps smaller
and the turtling not to happen well well
you might have noticed that we didn't go
public we kept it private on on them so
because we were they were trying to we
were trying to sort out what's going in
absolutely
is a big turning point because actually
guys we're defending us five young
plug-in and the rest of it hello I
should very much I'm sorry again to
interrupt that bruna would also like to
comment something on that beans but we
have our friend here that he's trying to
make a question for a while so we just
have more or five minutes and I know we
can discuss that for the whole afternoon
thank you for the opportunity given to
me I appreciate be here and having well
I'm from Nigeria have witness and
observe all the development platform on
oracle java and it is quite tremendous i
appreciate a walk pinned on his
application however I my comment is
looking at the level of development here
compared what is attainable in my own
country I discovered that I don't know
whether you have any plans you know to
create awareness or promotes promotes
this development terms I mean Oracle and
the Java whether you have any plan in
down south africa because we're just
coming up it's like it is one way in
this part of the world yes the reward
was he like in behind you have plans
because you a great mind and you can we
have lived it on what you have to be
able to lose and i think the world is
global and at least we have a large
workforce which actually can assist in
actually it will green people are
increasing the what you have already
started doing thank you
um no thank you so do I guess to
summarize this question I think it it's
what can we do more to help promote
countries in Africa as they get started
started or increase what they're doing
in Java so I agree with you and I know
that it's been probably slow and little
I have from my team a number of the the
evangelists do travel around to probably
in mostly in North Africa to some of the
user groups even like when the riots
were happening in Egypt I had to get
like special permission of one of the
evangelists who still wanted to go
because the jug there had organized a
really big event and through the
Moroccan user group so Simon Ritter I
think his probably spearheading that and
does most of the travel there so it
isn't a conscious decision not to
support it I think we have been doing it
and we definitely could do more I think
equally it's it helps when there's a
user group and a base that's organized
that has that out amplification there's
some kind of infrastructure for us in
terms of a user group to be able to draw
people together and and and help out so
um from a good source of understanding
what their where the density of java
developers ours to look at heinz co
Boots's newsletter subscription map
right so you get subscriptions from just
about everywhere and you can see that
there's definite areas on the planet
where it's light there's like nothing
there and it's actually a good resource
to know where you know where activity is
happening in the world and Africa is
lightly sparsely populated with people
interested in his newsletter you know
you might get one or sparsely populated
well equal thing and I know it's
changing is in Asia back there's a ton
of Java developers but there weren't a
lot of user groups and that's starting
to change as well so thank you very much
for all the participants as I said in
the beginning discussion is the first
step for solving many and many problems
so in enhancing our community I really
appreciate all your participation quite
as the questions please sure I will will
summarize the discussion here and make
sure you have it thank you very much
everybody for coming have a great
rosanna one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
