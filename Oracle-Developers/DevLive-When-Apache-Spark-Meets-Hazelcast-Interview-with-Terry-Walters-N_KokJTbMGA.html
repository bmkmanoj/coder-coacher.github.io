Atlanta I'm Babu Bart with the Oracle
technology Network bringing you another
dev live interview with one of the
speakers from today's sessions and in
this case that speaker is Carrie Walters
teri thanks for stopping by my pleasure
tell me what you do for hazel cast well
I'm a senior solution architect I
actually have three different roles at
hazel cast I work with I work with
customers and a pre and post-sales
engagement that can a lot of times be
helped fleshing out their use case to
helping them it's a lot better to make
design decision intelligent design
decisions upfront than to find out in
production right so I help with the
critical areas for all distribute
compute in a pre-sales
toast sales and support that's one of
the roles my other role is events like
such as this in Java one and and other
trade shows whether I'm working the
booth and answering technical questions
or giving presentations and then of
course the third kind of role is because
I've worked with customers and the
community I get a lot of feedback and
that feedback rolls back into the
product that's how the product you know
it's it's it grows organically your
presentation at this event is a
in-memory analytics with spark and Hazel
cast let's start with the hazel cast
part tell me about hazel cast the
product sure
Hezekiah makes an in-memory data grid
and an in-memory data grid does some
pretty basic use cases in it the
fundamental here is that we do
distributed computing so we do
distribute cache destroy to compute and
that basically means that we're able to
take data that would normally live in
one instance of a program and make it
live across many instances of the
program and share it so it's it's it's
sharding the data in you know in scaling
it out to two large you know web scale
what happens when apache spark meets
hazel caste
it's beautiful you know spark the overt
uc-berkeley was created as an abstract
computation engine and of course they
built on top of Hadoop but they have an
abstraction layer Hadoop being file
based head cast being memory based
memory Trump's file so so you know it's
it's it's fast big data tell me a little
bit about your session today if I give
you say 120 seconds can you talk really
really fast and deliver your entire
presentation sure sure sure so we did a
we took the the typical word count
example and counted all the words in
moby-dick for example we run across
three different machines and how many
word are there in Moby Toth unique words
are thirty-three thousand eight hundred
and twenty three or something like that
you know Ahab comes back like you know
70 times okay but yes so we basically
gave an example of running an abstract
process in this example counting words
but as this morning's example was he was
actually doing computational orbits
right so we could have taken that
process and run across many many many
machines if the audience at that
presentation takes home only one thing
what do you want that one thing to be
well in the world of scale it's all
about reducing the network calls and
reducing the amount of space you're
putting on the wire so reducing okay
what's next on your speaking calendar
what do you have lined up so I'm not
sure actually it may be the coding
convention up in the Chicago coding
convention or it might be back out in
San Francisco at one of the in-memory
computer or or Java one even I'm not
even sure okay this is hey that's coming
up three months away let's write three
months yeah so so I don't know because I
have to jag yeah yeah yeah a lot of that
happening right now a lot of checking
going on well Terry thanks for stopping
by talking to me if you'd like more
information about Terry session or any
of the other sessions in the
Oracle code event today or any of the
previous Oracle code events you can
visit developer oracle.com slash code
you'll also find information on the
upcoming events in this series as we
move into South America in the
asia-pacific region for the Oracle
technology Network I'm Bob brew barks
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
