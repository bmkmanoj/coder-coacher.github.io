scale and I manage software and apps
group there I hope co-presenters with me
kwak we just stepped out jay is from
oracle and zach is from arm since you
know it there's quad he also joined so
first and foremost the session title and
what we're going to discuss they are
kind of a little bit disconnected but we
have outside and the session title was
locked in a while ago but what we want
to talk about today is that you know the
freescale oracle and arm we have been
working on in this whole iota strategy
for a while and then we want to show you
and explain you what we are doing and
what we are trying to demonstrate today
actually in the show booth 10 or here so
and how it fits in in two grand I of
this scheme for all the companies okay
so let's see if it works there you go so
so these are the agenda items we intend
to go through IOT I think most of us
have seen the strategy we get it most of
the companies get it definitely
freescale Oracle and arm are definitely
leading the pack here on IOT in general
we have a platform called one box
gateway platform we want to discuss some
of that and how everything fits in in
you know from the iod perspective so we
will give you some details on the what
did that platform looks like we have
some mark platform here as well for you
Oracle's a vision of the IOT platform
overview so Jay will cover that part arm
since you know the arm and center team
actually arm sensing or together they
drove the integration of the whole thing
top down so Zach will give us the
overview of the data flow and how the
whole demo works and he will walk you
through that the details and then dinner
will have you have time we will go
through some Q&amp;amp;A so this slide you may
see in some of that the presentation but
at the freescale you know we definitely
are leading the pack for a while now on
the IOT vision we have clear mandate at
the corporate level
because of the way the IRT scheme is
going to work you know its data
collection and microcontroller
everywhere anything what we do so what
we are trying to do by working with
Oracle and arm is that we want to
address data gathering connectivity
scalability security and management
across unified platform you want to
create a platform we we definitely are
in the process of doing it which fits
into all ecosystem of the IOT and in
that at a high level there is an edge so
end portion there is a gateway portion
there's a servers in the cloud and how
that fits in that's where we want to
show you today everything from over here
is smart we have a smart home smart
energy smart meter smart parking
everything is going to require
connectivity everything will require the
devices to know each other and what do
we do with that information how you
process it seamlessly across different
platform worldwide that's where we want
to play make a play there so freescale
Oracle and arm since you're having
engineering team has been working
feverishly for many many months with
this vision type and then we want to
demonstrate how that fits in and in a
proof of concept and then we have
exclusive roadmap how to execute going
beyond and that's a demo of our goal is
to run Java across the spectrum the
whole platform end-to-end including edge
to the middle to the end so the way the
Java has been architected we believe in
that it will provide us the whole
ecosystem from the security data
transfers and services so it's
everything about smart world everywhere
so translating that into some explicit
view so edge products this is where you
know we have all the sensors you know
everybody has their own protocol
everybody has a different data and then
but it do require a small MCU doesn't
matter freescale or non freescale we
believe that there is always an edge
product in order to make our tee box w
work all the connectivity happens
depends on how you connect as i said it
may be proprietor it may be standard it
doesn't matter but all that data needs
to be gathered at some point somewhere
and that
where we want to demonstrate and discuss
more about that so that's one box
gateway which freescale based platform
has been created in and that's what
oracle in arms and she know teams are
working for a while and that gateway is
the one which enables the wireless
capabilities secure device m2m gateway
cloud connectivity remote access
management and of course the end once
that i collected any storage
synchronization in the processing and
data mining by the java scheme and then
this is where rest of the pieces of the
puzzle fall in so once we have the data
then it goes to cloud and then the data
server and the data mining happens where
oracle is already leading the pack with
the industry nobody call the enterprise
level of the java exit there so i'll
quickly talk about what the one box
looks like it's the busy slide but
definitely we want to talk and give you
a view of how everything fits in in the
grand scheme of thing this is the
platform from the freescale we have a
product imx6 series which is the
arm-based associates it's in production
for a while with all the connectivity
standard Linux drivers and everything
connective device you can think through
the unit sig bees wireless and bluetooth
and everything and this creates a
fundamental platform actually there is a
white box there which you can see that
and that's what the platform is created
about Thank You Jay right and then you
know you can have all the details you
know you can literally see it working in
arm booth and as well as the Oracle
booth but that's a platform for a
nominal platform we need we want to make
sure that the software developers the
ecosystem providers don't have to worry
about it so we'll create the platform
and then on top level view the data flow
and what other software the arm sense
interactivity in the application piece
fits in so with that I want to pass my
baton tu quoque who who had some of the
activity on the top level and
application level software on the
freescale platform and then will he can
give you some more details on that
good morning can you all hear me so feel
free to ask me any questions so before I
go into the BC slide I want to go back
to this slide so as Molly mentioned the
purpose is to connect all the different
machines and devices in our life
connected to the cloud and the purpose
is as follow we want to streamline the
business process make our business more
efficient so that we generate more
profits at the same time the second
purpose is also improve our quality of
life reduce our stress and then improve
sustainability which is a making our
planet greener safer more secure and so
on so we are familiar with many point
solutions today so there are people that
deliver products that connect some
devices through our self smartphone or
smart tablet and then go into the cloud
those are point solutions those are
one-on-one solution as long as your
smartphone while you're smart abilities
with you but sometimes you take your
smartphone and smart tablet to work but
then you still have want to have devices
in your home connected to the cloud such
as your smoke alarm your your garage
door opener and and so and so far so
therefore you also need a gateway that
is more persistent in your premise
weather is your home your office or
factory to connect to all the devices to
the cloud so those are the basic concept
behind any questions so let's whoops
whoops sorry let's go to the details
like so as mullen mention freescale has
many devices and
we have linux kernel and sdk to support
all the drivers so the basic five things
in the Internet of Things gateway the
first one is it is a secure wireless
router so so what we have is a secure
wireless IOT gateway here and then
within the secure wireless gateway there
are several key functionality one is of
course he has all the major networking
switching routing capability so it can
hand the 128-bit ipv6 it can handle VLAN
virtual local area network domain name
server but it also need to have some
basic discovery protocol for example it
can do you pnp universal patent play you
can do ldap lightweight directory access
protocol you can do as an MP simple
network management protocol so when by
time you look through it is a very
complex networking box and then most of
all is very important to have security
capability so security such as
authentication identification
vulnerability which is preventing attack
and denial surfaces sometimes we call
intrusion detection intrusion prevention
so there's a whole stacks of software
there starting with encryption
capability which we call IPSec and
sometimes we call VPN firewall n80
network dress translation and then you
build up to put in intrusion detection
prevention and then you added all the
basic authentication and SS control so
for more detail you can always go into n
is T dot National Institute of Standards
and it will tell you all the basic
security measure you need to put in
there so our as Mullen mention our
freescale internet things gateway has
all this rich security capability
building on top of the wireless
networking capability so it's a very
secure IOT gateway now in addition there
are several other capability so we need
to have storage capability so this as I
mentioned is persistent gateway in your
premise even when you are away from home
you can still stall your sensor data if
you will you can also offer us a cash to
the cloud so that even when the cloud
servers somehow is disabled and not
working so data would not be lost and it
can be cached and the caching is also
offering a smart networking capability
so that you can perform some local
processing and you don't need to keep
sending a lot of data to the cloud so so
you need some storage capability to do
some smart local processing and also to
do caching and then in addition one more
capabilities management capability so it
can offer remote provisioning remote
governing so such as TR 69 so that a
service provide the away from your
premise can remotely install update and
provision your IOT gateway it can also
do QoS quality of service traffic
policing and prioritization other stuff
any questions so far there will be a
quiz at the end up to set so now we
finish talking about the IOT gateway so
the whole purpose is talking about how
we enable an end customer to build a
vertical products or solutions so now
you have the freescale device that come
with secure boot capability and we call
trust architecture our driver already
with all this wireless connectivity has
the wireless security between WEP wpa
and then you have now this out a gateway
so what we have to do
now is to connect to the cloud so
because if you will you have the local
cloud which is your sensor network
connecting to the IOT gateway and then
this local club now also have to connect
to the global cloud so that you can do
remote SS remote monitoring and so on so
this way even when your again away from
home away from office you can still
remotely monitor and control all your
devices in your machines so to do that
later on we have two more speaker jay is
going to talk about the whole Java
capability that we have put together so
we have Java ME running on all our
sensor devices such as we have the smart
meters we have where the smart plug that
has in the bottom there we is from one
of our partner cutting equals my plug so
once you have a smart plot you can put
all your smile appliances there such as
your LED lighting your HVAC heating and
cooling so I guess for my friend marlins
he would be his hot tub jacuzzi or
swimming pool so but of course you can
also hook up your all your home security
devices such as a IP camera security
cameras smoke alarm and so on so let me
see so now you have all the sensor data
in your logo cloud trying to connect to
the global clout so there are various a
data model if you will there are push
model and there pull model so
traditionally we have the pool model we
and we use HTTP or rest which means from
the server and outside you can make a
request and then this IOT gateway can
response with the data so you can either
do it with HTTP or co-op in this case
we'll demo using the co app which is
constrained applique
proco and then there are other
alternatives in the future that people
can explore its publish-subscribe where
the IOT gateway can publish the data and
then out there you can have many clients
or servers that can subscribe to a
specific data that you want so they are
various model and then Zach will go into
that more detail so I was talking about
Java besides Java ME in the sensor
devices this LT gateway we have the java
SE and then in the cloud applications
the end customer will have to build some
end applications also in the cloud so
there are three kind of applications
going on there are sensor applications
in the sensor devices at actually
therefore there's the embedded gateway
applications in this white one box IOT
gateway there is the smart phone and
smart tablet devices those are called
mobile applications and then lastly
there's the cloud application so it's
four things going on and Jay will
mention how the jophur can run into all
these four different devices okay so let
me just talk a little bit about the
cloud so now you have the cloud
applications so the clow will also need
to have communication mechanism to
interact with the IOT gateway and then
you can also issue SMS and alert to the
clients again if you're away from home
and then you have device management
capability that you can now remotely
control and SS the IOT gateway and then
last but not the least on the upper left
is where you start developing your end
applications where you look at your
business logic of how you want to
connect all these devices and what part
of the process you want to optimize
making more efficient and so on to
deliver values so those are the three
basic concept in the cloud applications
and again java j and set we
give you more detailed explanation any
questions so far okay so let me talk a
little bit about our romance so this is
the first box that we built together
believe it or not the three company we
get together like a week or so ago and
then within one week we're able to
connect everything together so freescale
has the IOT gateway with the IOT gateway
platform and then oracle come in and
putting all the java middleware and then
sack come in and enable us with the
sensing note capability from our so you
can see how quick we can build together
solutions but of course what's missing
is customers who have to add their own
cloud applications on top so this first
demos i mentioned is its magnetic home
you can see smart appliances connected
to it smart meters Matt thermostat if
you go to the Oracle booth and also to
the amp of you see that we connect to
the Wi-Fi thermostat into the smack
gateway also and then we also have Wi-Fi
security camera all connected so this
box can connect with Wi-Fi can connect
with 3g to the clout can connect to sick
be so sick bees where you have your m2m
connectivity where you do the wireless
sensor network and the personal area
network so in this roadmap we'll be
adding bluetooth LE for the smart health
for wearable computing that's a big
growth besides my energy and then we'll
be adding NFC nephew communication and
then we're at power line communication
and then we'll also consider adding the
weightless weightless is the TV white
space those are used for more outdoor
applications like good couches and data
concentrators and so on okay so let me
finish our portion here with a little
bit so as I mentioned what's left is for
customer to build this my application so
looking at what segments you want to
help provide the solutions you can do
smack home and automations my energies
might health smart industry so let me
try to if I have one or two minutes okay
summarize this very quickly so just to
for you to get the concept a little bit
across imagine is 5 a.m. in the morning
you're driving to the airport and then
halfway to the airport you find out that
your garage door is open in the morning
you're eating breakfast and your oven is
on but it's too late for you to drive
back home because you miss your flight
then there's no problem you just pull
out your smartphone or tablet but first
of all you need to pull over the
shoulder then you can check indeed your
garage door is open your oven is on but
before you shut off everything you turn
on your video surveillance camera and
you can check every room inside and also
check out door make sure there's no
intruders before you turn off your
garage door opener and the oven so you
won't burn down your building or your
neighbor's home so I hope that gives you
some incentive that there is actually
one more alternate ending to this use
case scenario is you try to call 911 but
by time you call 911 it would be too
late so you actually have a back door
sigdi control back gay you turn on your
back gate the.com out apprehend the bad
guy in the back yeah and by the way
there's also a sick be enabled up okay
so with that I'll pass it to j2 he will
describe more under Java sweets
good morning as mullen mentioned earlier
when we started off with the concept of
this talk we we didn't have very high
goals we just said well let's just try
to run Joe embedded sweet and/or Clement
processing on an imac six board let's
start with that and then we as we went
along and the time came closer well
given the progress that these guys have
been making with one box and looking at
all this stuff that they've been doing
like let's combine all this together and
then we can create a much more
compelling session and a demo and then
Along Came Zack and since in order with
or who have now been acquired by arm so
that well sensor node cannot combine all
this together and then connect us to the
cloud so we can make an even more
compelling demo so what we have today is
a very good end to end use case and the
demo in the job javed emigrants booth
shows you that and I'll walk you through
some of the components that we've used
in enabling this use case but just to
quickly get started to set the context I
work for the job embedded team and
here's our portfolio and if you are not
familiar with that Joe embedded which
has been around for a long time it's
been used in many consumer devices and
industrial devices it consists of Java
ME embedded for small devices ranging
from hot like 120 k Ram 21 mb 2 mb it's
it's based on the Java ME platform that
has been around for more than 13 14
years have been used on pillions or
mobile phones we've taken that same
platform adapted it to embedded devices
we have power management capabilities
and a device I or capability so you can
connect to different network interfaces
local network interfaces like gpio and i
square see spi o etc then we have Java
Sea and better which is the same gel IC
platform shrunken down
optimized for arm PowerPC x86 embedded
systems it's again one of the key areas
of innovation for us because developers
Java developers can leverage their
existing Java knowledge and develop
applications on embedded devices like
raspberry pi we are developer border or
even imx6 which is the one of the most
popular commercial boats and you can
just leverage a gel gel knowledge to
build applications on it and then the
two blood products we specifically use
in this demo or Java embedded suite
which enables you to bring middleware
functionality enterprise middle of
functionality own small devices so the
ability to run web applications rest
applications run a local database on a
small device and Oracle event processing
for Oracle Java embedded which is a
pretty exciting application what it does
is we'll go in a little more detail but
basically provides you a query engine
that allows you to analyze data in
motion so as data is coming in through
sensors which is time series data you
can apply queries on it as the data is
flowing through the system filter it do
correlation on it do pattern matching on
it you can put a window operator to say
if event occurs so more than a certain
amount of time then take certain action
so that's the kind of stuff that we p
for embedded does and that's something
that we have tried to use in this use
case as well so why are we doing this in
the sense what is the goal of all of
these it's basically to enable
intelligence on devices all right with
the with Moore's law of course we can
run more software much more powerful
software on very small devices I'm exits
is one an extremely competent a
commercial board we've done some
performance testing on it it's just
rocks so we can definitely do a lot more
on this little device and what we want
to do is basically enable intelligence
on smaller devices with Java so which
are embedded our goal is to enable you
to harvest this real-time business
insight from the data that you're
gathering you can use
for doing communication events machine
event security events environmental
events business logic events these are
just examples of the kind of events that
you can do in terms of what kind of
intelligence that can you can you gather
from it and this is critical because one
of the key things with m2m or I Ortiz
you cannot rely on network connectivity
most of the times network connectivity
is extremely unpredictable especially
like logistics or shipping and all those
kind of use cases or if you're behind in
that and someone just keeps turning off
their home router for some reason so
it's extremely important that decisions
can be made locally that you're not
dependent on the availability of work
network connection to the cloud for data
to be analyzed and processed and that's
something which we can enable which are
embedded today here's where the whole
thing fits in it is very similar to the
slide that Mullen showed earlier the
second slide it's our interpretation of
it we kind of tend to focus more on the
back end side of course and and it kind
of completes the picture they they kind
of bring in the weight on the client
side we bring in a lot of weight on the
back end side and Zach kind of arm
brings in the weight that connects all
these things together so which is a very
interesting combination of these three
companies that can kind of come together
and build into and solution which is
production ready so in this vision we
have the same kind of thing except we in
our world the way we look at it is
sensors can be sensors that are
connected over cellular directly to a
data center or connected using some sort
of a local area network to through a
gateway using a communication gateway
that sits in the data center and we can
enable all kinds of enterprise
functionality to secure your data
process your data in a in a production
environment with components like access
management identity governance
provisioning of software and then
address ability of the devices and then
data routing and analysis and then all
that data once it
into the big data back end or no school
back end or so aback and Oracle has very
strong solutions and the jaw world has
very strong solutions on how to process
that data so that's our goal on how do
we take the data from here in a reliable
manner how do we send it securely over
the network and then how do we then
route it to the right processing
back-end at that point and that's really
the goal of the IOT platform with this
particular talk we really focus on the
Gateway over here that's where one box
is most prominent this is our reference
architecture again it's it's kind of a
blown-up view of what the earlier slide
was this is kind of a more visual slide
this is a more technical slide it kind
of details that different components and
we as part of Oracle's IOT platform our
goal is to enable a platform like this
and there are certain things over here
which we don't provide today like in
this particular is the IOT communication
gateway with this protocol mediation the
devices can be talking protocols other
than HTTP that's device registration and
management howdy when a device joins the
network it needs to be registered
provided a particular IP address more
than IP address or a particular address
ability and that's the kind of stuff
that sensor node provides so we provide
here event processing an application
framework on the verge can run on small
devices the devices themselves are
provided by freescale or the device
platforms a priority but freescale the
communication agents the protocol
mediation the device registration is
something that sense in toward us so
it's a pretty good combination and then
from then on we can take their data like
use an Oracle back end and then do all
the processing so that's the
architecture that we're going after so
in summary basically if going back to
the one box this is what we've enabled
we have the one box running jic embedded
which has Joe embedded sweet on it
running web services and then we have
our key element processing running on
top of it Joe embedded suite provides
a framework for running rest web
services so you can so we have tablet UI
which is now accessing which is running
Joe effects on a Linux tablet and the
JFX based you I can talk using rest to
this device and gather data from it and
then oracle event processing is doing
local intelligence processing data
filtering it and then generating events
which are then sent over to the cloud
where that data is processed further and
I in parallel which I've not shown here
is the sensor node Shack wins a quick or
in a minute which provides the
management functionality for this whole
end-to-end solution that Zach okay so
let's go back so thanks Jay that was a
great overview of what we're doing with
Java and how does java fit into all this
IOT stuff so I'm going to talk a little
bit about how we put all this together
into a system because in the end if you
just have pieces of Java gateway a few
device sitting around you don't really
get a service out of that you don't get
a system product something you can sell
or or provide to a customer so what we
wanted to do in this this cooperation
between companies in these demos at
javaone is really try to show how we
take something from a sensor arm to a
gateway to do local processing local you
is and then take it all the way back to
the cloud and do cloud-based UI's cloud
based processing and I encourage
everyone I me of course in a session
here we can explain we have nice slide
where we have devices but I encourage
everyone to come take a look at the
booths so at the booths we can explain a
lot more about this stuff and we have
this demo split up between two booths so
at the Oracle booth you'll find you'll
find this gateway this one box gateway a
bunch of local sensor devices
and a local you I based on javafx so if
you stop by the Oracle gateway look for
this white box at the Oracle booth and
the guys can show you a really nice demo
there too we'll show you a little bit of
a demo here as well and then if you want
to come by the arm booth we can show you
a little bit more of this end-to-end
architecture so at the arm booth we have
some Java ME based devices we have some
native based devices we have a one box
running some distributed intelligence
and then we have cloud software so it's
java SE running on an ARM based server
so we really have from the cloud server
all the way down to Java ME and native
and the interesting thing about what
we've done to integrate all this is we
haven't done it using some sophisticated
middleware that requires that we go to
proprietary data formats and we do all
of our special sauce in between we
didn't do any special sauce that's the
really cool thing about what we do
everything we do in this demo is
completely standard open interfaces
based on rest so we built an entire
architecture for IOT which is fully rest
based and the way we did that is that we
actually changed rest we did that at the
IETF for the past three years so this is
all based on a new protocol that was
mentioned the beginning called co-op the
constrained application protocol you can
think of coop as HTTP four little tiny
devices with limited bandwidth limited
processing capability so co-op does what
HTTP does today with a 4-byte binary
header very simple to parse in any
microcontroller and it does it over UDP
with a synchronous transactions so
rather than the synchronous polling
you're stuck with a hdb Co have actually
builds in the synchronous transaction
builds and discovery so that's something
that lets us use this even with tiny
sensor devices that might be Wireless
zigbee radio type of type of devices so
we use these protocols to tie all these
components together so we're really
tying rest-based interfaces together
using java to get our platform
independence complex event processing
technology and a lot of other things
that Java lets us do so in the overall
architecture on Java ME we're actually
leveraging the current Java ME embedded
33 release and we're demonstrating
actually the world's first
implementation of these IOT protocols on
Gemma I mean so that you can come and
see at the arm booth we can show you the
different things we can use that for we
also have native devices and the reason
why we always show native devices as
well even though we love Java is that we
want to make sure that people are able
to build these systems regardless of the
programming language or device type so
these these protocol interfaces are
really independent of the language you
used to implement them so we have both
native devices and Java devices my kind
of rule of thumb between Java ME and
native is that you know if you are at a
cortex m0 arm or cortex m3 below 128k of
RAM you should probably be in native
land you should probably just do some
see probably what you're doing on that
device is so simple that higher layer
language abstractions might not even
help you so that's that's kind of a rule
of thumb but once you get over a cortex
73 cortex m4 I mean there's our cheap
processors these are sub dollar
microcontrollers um above 128k of RAM
then you can start getting into Java ME
and with the new Java ME 8 release it's
getting very interesting that means we
can actually do a lot of standard Java
code which looks just like Java SE some
rapper things you need to do with mid
'let's but otherwise we can do a lot of
the things we do in the standard Java
world on a very small device so cortex
mm3 cortex m4 we can do Java and that's
really interesting now when we get under
the Gateway the thing that we find
really interesting about gateways is
that arm it's not that we're using
gateways as in the old application layer
gateway world where we had to convert
everything from zigbee and the rest web
services and anytime it's something
changed you had to upgrade all your
software so we've gotten out of that
what we do today is we actually do
end-to-end rest so all these
these data flows are really end-to-end
transparent rest we don't change the
media types we don't change the the
methods or the URIs what we're doing is
we're providing added value by
distributing intelligence to the Gateway
and that's very different than
application layer gateway so we've we've
put a distributed directory here on this
gateway something we're demonstrating at
the arm booth so we're actually able to
have these devices to local
registrations local lookups regardless
if this cloud interface goes down that
still works we're able to do a complex
event processing on the gateway which
means we can take sensor measurements
from these two devices combine them
filter them make new web resources
publish those to cloud directories what
we run here in the cloud is actually a
big search engine it's really a big
resource directory for IOT resources and
a proxy between HTTP rest and m2m rest
or IOT rest so we're doing transparent
proxying here through these applications
now once you get here we get into the
place where most developers are really
involved right this is some of this is
you know embedded device development
using Java we can simplify that reduce
time-to-market but once we get here
we're into the real java web app
development land and what we've done is
we've made that normal this whole thing
to the java web app developer looks like
a normal rest resource that you can use
in your application there is nothing
special about about what you see here I
think that's the beauty of this whole
architecture is we make this really
normal technology to develop with so
we're also demonstrating a really simple
JSP based on web application HTML CSS
JavaScript based web app and that just
shows how we can use this technology to
build applications that are that are
pretty straightforward and finally in
the future we have we have a pretty
interesting roadmap we're getting into
integration with identity management so
ldap based identity management for
managing all the security that goes on
here security is really the
the kind of complex thing to solve in
all of these systems we think we do a
pretty good job of that but we're
looking at using more Enterprise tools
to do that and big data integration so
how do we feed streams of this sensor
information and really straightforward
ways in the know SQL databases into
business intelligence into Hadoop so you
can do a lot more advanced processing on
that but how do we do it automatically
right we don't want to be writing
complex connectors and new code to do
that should be configurable so
end-to-end we've created a real really
elegant architecture for this using open
standards using Java and the great thing
is we're making this available so we're
actually working on delivering and
making free downloads of these solutions
available on to everyone who's
interested in doing IOT development on
Java so keep your eyes open for that
will be will be making more
announcements with releases so the final
thing I wanted to show is a little bit
of this this demo itself what we can
show here remotely from the booths
apologize
you need to do some screen mirroring
now
well you can see most of this gooey but
not all of it
I don't think I have a way to fix that
other than this
you know that's better okay thanks so
this is how one of the you is that we're
going to be showing at the Oracle booth
so this is a JavaFX based you I this is
something you could run locally on a
gateway or on a tablet device that talks
to a gateway so this is something it
doesn't require any cloud intelligence
to do and what we're doing here is we're
actually gathering information from the
different sensor devices we have here
for example the smart thermostat that we
have at the Oracle booth and we can get
different different pieces of
information for example temperature set
point values device information who
actually manufactured the device and all
of that is gathered using rest
interfaces very simple media types and
low overhead so we can get a lot of this
data with with a few tens of bytes of
overhead single UDP packet so they're
really small streams of information we
need to get this so come take a look at
that gooey when you come to the Oracle
booth we also have an application that
we're showing up the arm booth that
demonstrates the cloud side of this so
we can take that same very same
information this is just a browser-based
browser based web application and we're
able to show exactly the same kinds of
information same kinds of web resources
in a JSP based web app now this has gone
all the way to the cloud we're doing
very normal web development I can
actually look at that exact same smart
thermostat and we're actually able to
get information about the device we're
able to read streams of sensor
information set point information we're
able to practice etc and this is the
kind of you I that you might through the
cloud provide to to the user so to the
home owner that wants to manage their
home remotely when they're not near
there their home gateway so we can do
both home based you is and cloud-based
you is using the same rest interfaces
same information
um and that all fits nicely together
that's about it I'm happy to answer
folks might have regarding the
technology or the demonstrations
themselves and of course everyone is
welcome to just stop by the booths chat
with the engineers we have there if you
have some more detailed questions I'm
sure they'd be happy to answer anything
please very good question yes so um
Oracle then processing is something you
can use really on any any events dream
so this could just be internally no
sensor data you've got flowing through
your flowing through java right you
could just do event processing stored in
memory and etc what we're doing here is
we're actually extending event
processing interests we're now instead
of doing event processing on internal
variables we're actually using co-op to
locally discover resources on other
endpoints so other sensor devices other
gateways we request streams of that
those resources in and we use those as
input to your processing so we're
actually just doing subscriptions to
sensor data using the event processing
queries we can then produce a new piece
of data and now what we do instead of
just storing that a memory we publish
that new piece of data as a new web
resource now it's a web resource of the
gateway of complex event processing but
because of the way we use rest we can
actually just register that to the cloud
register that to the local directory and
then for somebody who's writing an
application they don't really see a
difference right they might see raw
temperature in a room they might see raw
humidity but then they see this other
thing which is maybe long-term
temperature statistics or a long-term
may be an indicator of occupancy it's a
really hard thing to indicate like
what's the real occupancy of a house
somebody home or not that's something
you could do in a local gateway and so
for the web developer you just see a new
resource yes so we can use HTTP as well
it really doesn't matter which because
they're both restful we tend to use coop
when overhead or the network capacity or
the device complexity are issues so for
example over a cellular link we'd use
co-op to the backend over a broadband
Ethernet link doesn't matter you could
but HTTP is fine over an ethernet
network in your home it really doesn't
matter you could use either one but then
if you start getting over like a 50 not
for base 6lowpan sensor network it
matters a lot we don't you're not even
really able to do full-on HTTP properly
you mean to be able to use co-op yeah
that's currently yes you have to write
your own adapters um the nice thing
though is we have a lot of co-op Java
libraries available actually from arm
we're providing those for easy download
so what you're able to do is just use
the library from from oep in the future
I think you'll see more and more
integration ready examples and such we
show how to do this over HTTP / co-op I
think that's really good feedback form
for oracle as well
yeah I agree and then right right
obviously you seem to know about oh it
be that it has input adapters and output
adapters for embedded today for
conserving footprint because footprint
is so critical and embedded we can't
really put the whole away p which is i
don't know how many hundred mb we don't
ship any standard adapters but the likes
the framework is flexible enough that if
you you can leverage libraries and if
there's a co-op library it's fairly
trivial to go build something quickly an
adapter that just talks go up but i
agree that some sample code would be
useful and will definitely work on that
yeah that's really really great feedback
that's exactly what we want to hear what
do we need to put in this stuff to make
it useful for developers great any other
questions um random questions in this
field area general area are welcome as
well you don't have to know about oep
internals okay thanks everyone we
appreciate the early morning wake up and
enjoy the booth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
