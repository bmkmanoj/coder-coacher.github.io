OpenWorld
2017 I'm Laura Ramsey and I'm with the
Oracle developers community and I'm here
with a couple of our most recent Oracle
ace directors as well as aces as well as
developer champions from viscosity so
first I want to introduce you to Charles
Kim Charles tell us a little bit about
what you're doing at this Casa T yes my
name is Charles Kim I am the president
of viscosity and one of the co-founders
and also joining us from viscosity is
Nitin one of our more popular authors
that posts articles on the Oracle
developer Network so how's it going
they're doing great looking forward to
the weekend open the world oh you guys
I've got a lot going on so this has been
a big year last year we talked about
moving to the cloud and viscosity has
got several engagements where you're
moving very quickly with your clients to
the cloud tell me about some of the some
of the activities you've been doing as
far as your workshops yeah so I'm also
the president of the IO u G cloud cig
and as part of the initiatives that we
have we are kicking off a lot of cloud
workshops all over the country and in
particular we've done numerous cloud
workshops in Northern California we did
that in August with it obviously we do
one in Dallas in Houston because it's
our backyard we're scheduled to do
another one in
member in Michigan and we're scheduling
an another workshop for the Suncoast or
Weiser group in Florida fantastic and
there's been some pretty good attendance
at these workshops because I've seen a
lot of the blogging and the material
coming out of that absolutely last year
when we're doing these workshops it was
harder to fill now we're waitlisting
people and there's a lot more interest
and I think a lot of it is also that
they're trying to get a free copy of our
book and so yes it's the Oracle cloud
pocket solution guide great generic
right yeah yeah we originally developed
it as part of the curriculum for the
cloud labs that we did so originally it
was just you know here's the problem
here's a solution and this is how you do
it it's part of our workshop and they
eventually morphed into hey let's add
some 12 to new features that a lot of
the DBAs and architects are interested
and we'll talk about like lifting and
shifting pluggable databases with zero
downtime door pop loud things like that
right and obviously it's got all the
hands-on labs and solution for you know
database-as-a-service
to storage cloud and even like the
hidden things that a lot of guys don't
seem to know about like the Oracle
storage cloud appliance right exactly so
you had one white paper recently and
this is like buzzword bingo ready lift
and shift to the Oracle cloud on bare
metal yeah yeah and excited to talk
about something we latched on to just
this past year was Oracle infrastructure
cloud which is basically bare metal and
so work with the Oracle PeopleSoft folks
that looked to do a lift and shift from
on-premise to bare metal using pdb so we
did the pdb relocation so we tested all
the new features of the lift and shift
of entire middleware database stack to
bare metal the database is about 15
terabytes how long did it take the whole
orchestration the whole process probably
took a couple days to do but the
planning no we didn't lose any of that
this is all it was very straightforward
very streamlined
if as long as you do the proper planning
upfront as far as network storage
compute getting the right sizes and
shapes
it becomes very streamlined very very
easy to do sound like it was really easy
Charles well he's the master right
you've got the DB Cloud Shifu and there
it is right okay so tell me since you've
done this once do you want to do it
again absolutely we're gonna actually do
this with JD Edwards and other
applications too in the e business so
the PeopleSoft was the first I wouldn't
say low-hanging fruit but was the first
approach but we're gonna do this again
with JD Edwards and the e business as
well oh that's fantastic
okay so you know what's your plan for
the year I mean you gotta have a
business plan right well we we decided
this year that we're gonna go full
throttle with getting the viscosity name
out there okay
and as you know we took on rich d'emic
as our chief innovation officer Jack and
Julie right I'm expecting him to like
photobomb
and so with that we're going it
practically every conference in the
country right Michigan is right there
we're doing Austin we're doing I mean it
just we have it stacked I'm trying to go
to New Zealand Australia even trying to
get that approved right I was first
getting approved by the spouse there's
huge business deals to make down in
Australia yes just add that we're
focusing on managed MSP as you guys know
it's a very popular programs that are
focusing on MSP is Oracle management
cloud okay good that's fantastic
I'm actually supposed to take the
management cloud certification test on
Wednesday
wish me luck yeah okay so both of you
I'll give you a couple of seconds to
think about this before answering but if
coming up somebody who has not used the
Oracle cloud before and you had one
piece of advice to them I mean what is
it that you know today after doing this
a couple times that you wish you would
have known before you did it the first
time well can I go first
okay I knew this I gotta be there not on
this thing ready go yeah person foremost
definitely planning is the key and
understanding network connectivity from
on-premise or wherever your applications
are running from connecting to the cloud
is probably the most important thing
that we've learned through this journey
their network connectivity and planning
for infrastructure my name is on the
security side o people who do RAC they
they get to security because we have to
set up what we call user equivalents on
the right side and when you go login to
Oracle cloud there is no passwords
especially if you're trying to log in
from the infrastructure side the
operating system side and so
everything's about secure shell
everything's about SSH and having the
right certificate RSA tokens
keys and
not and so for those who are not
familiar with security it's one of those
things that they'll have to come up to
the learning curve in fact as part of
our workshop last year we split we would
literally spend the first hour talking
about security right and and there's two
parts of security one was to convince
the attendees that Oracle is secure you
know in fact probably more secure than
their on Prem right because they have
locked down everything right and the
second thing it was to educate them
about how do you log into the cloud all
right well thanks guys I'm glad you
could come on by and we'll be talking
later in the week might even take a tour
of the show floor with you to find out
what you think is cool I like that I'd
never be awesome walk in a park right
all right well thanks everybody say bye
all right thank you buddy enjoy the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
