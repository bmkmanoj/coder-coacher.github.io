with a raspberry pi wall I'll start with
the background and set stage a bit then
we will go through the different
alternatives we thought about when we
needed to do our performance tests will
go into the implementation how we built
the wall and configure it and everything
then we look at the load tests and how
we execute it down hopefully we'll try
to do a live demo I don't know if
that'll work but should work and finally
we conclude with the results and turn
for questions feel free to break at any
time if you want to ask questions that's
fine we have time for that so Who am I
and my name is Sarah cramnar i started
with java in 1997 so quite a while back
and well since then i've written many
nice applications and i've also worked a
lot with performance journey our company
code means is small consulting firm
based in Gothenburg in Sweden we focus
primarily on Java and Oracle technology
stack and we also do performance tuning
both for the applications we build and
for other applications so in a recent
assignment we were asked to build a
business critical network server it had
to be up all the time no downtime
accepted so it was a clustered solution
the expected load was fairly high it
needed to sustain 50,000 concurrent
connections with the 100 business
transactions per second and the server
used the custom binary protocol for some
parts of the traffic and web services
with soap for another part of the
traffic and there were very strict
security requirements as well that so we
had to use SSL for instance for
everything and we wanted to run
prolonged load tests in order to make
sure that we could actually deliver
something that worked and we thought
about several well the usual suspects
basically single server developer
workstations the cloud and finally I
thought about hey why don't we build a
wall with raspberry PI's instead the
most common approach is probably to use
a single server and ideally you would
like that to be a dedicated server
somewhere it never is you usually end up
either running on the build server where
you already do a continuous integration
for you or and probably for other
applications as well so it's a lot of
contention for CPU resources and that
box or you end up to run it on the same
server that hosts the application you
are trying to test again not a very nice
idea and usually the build server is
also the application where you run your
application so not a good thing also if
you run it on the same server as the
application the tests will use the
loopback interface which is order of
orders of magnitude faster than using
the real network interfaces so not a
very good idea if you can avoid it
another approach is to use the
developers workstations and use one of
the many distributed load test
frameworks which are out there again
there are problems in many organizations
the developers are not allowed yet I'm
sorry I'm not allowed to install
software on their own machines also in
many organizations the workstations are
rebooted regularly so you can't have a
long-running test if someone restores
your computer all the time and the
developers don't like to have low test
frameworks running on their already slow
machines so while it works it's
something you want to avoid
the cloud down well clouds are great
there are cloud-based load tests that
you can configure in minutes if you are
just testing a simple web application if
you are testing something with a binary
protocol that you wrote yourself it's a
little bit more work but it can be done
they are cheap if you want to run a
short test and they come with the canned
reports and analysis tools that you can
use unfortunately if you want to run a
load test for a month and you want to
have 50,000 connections it is no longer
shaped we found one provider that it
would cost sixteen thousand eight
hundred dollars for one month at that
level and there are other with other
pricing plans but the point is it's not
very cheap and then comes the
showstopper we couldn't allow the cloud
inside our firewall so basically it
could not reach our server so cloud was
out finally we got the idea to use cheap
raspberry pi units and build a wall with
them and this was very good because we
can place the ball inside the corporate
firewall so no security issues the world
can be bent cheaply I'll come to that in
just a moment and the Raspberry Pi runs
job on so we can use all of the existing
classes we have we can reuse the choices
for our binary protocol we can reuse a
load test framework and the tests will
also be more realistic because there are
many weak clients not one huge server
yen rating the load and of course it's
fun for those who don't know the
raspberry it's about as powerful as a
300 megahertz Pentium too but with much
better graphics so it's not a very
powerful machine but
it works so over to the implementation
now we start talking about the design
how to design for affordable costs
construction how to put it all together
installation and configuration of the
software the framework support that you
can use on the raspberries and conclude
with the cloning and individualization
of the different units while the
raspberry itself is cheap peripherals
costs anyone who has bought a raspberry
for his roar whom will find that the
raspberry cost perhaps $25 but then you
buy books for it and you buy cables and
you buy this and that and suddenly it
costs like a cheap computer and we try
to keep costs down so the raspberries
$25 memory cards you can't avoid them
ten bucks network cables could have done
those ourselves but we didn't so ten
dollars there as well per unit and
instead of buying USB cables and USB
hubs for power we soldered cables
directly to the raspberries and then for
the prototype we use the pc power supply
from an old pc for this travel wall and
the larger one we bought power supplies
that were smaller and lighter the switch
is the most expensive part i don't know
if any of you went to the session about
a Raspberry Pi supercomputer earlier
this week but coincidentally they had
settled on 48 raspberry PI's we also
settled on 48 raspberry PI's and the
reason is if you want to network switch
you can buy a sheep consumer switch but
it's small so you need to buy several
not good or you can buy a very big
switch but then there is an enterprise
price tag to it so you need to find
something in between and the largest
a consumer prized switch that I have
been able to find has 48 100 megabit
ports that we can use for the
raspberries and to Jacob it ports that
we can use towards the lawn all in all
everything included we ended up at about
three thousand dollars for the big wall
with 48 units so it's not that bad
another important decision is to
consider what java version you will use
the natural thing that comes to mind is
of course i want to use java SE eight it
exists for the raspberry why not use it
and indeed it's the fastest out there
it's great it's only that if you instead
of just clicking accept you actually
read the fine print before downloading
its you will see that it is illegal to
use it in production and it's also
illegal to use it for tests if you
install it on more than one unit so Java
8 is out java SE 7 embedded is also fast
it's about as fast as java 8 it works
well there are two problems with that
one the first is that it works only with
the soft float image the the images or
kernels for raspberry pi coming two
versions the old versions do floating
points decimal calculations in software
which is lower the newer versions
support the hardware that exists on the
raspberry for floating point operations
unfortunately java SE 7 can only run on
the older versions that do not support
hardware floating points and that means
basically that you cannot use some of
the goodies that appear in the new
releases the other issue is that it must
be licensed for production use it's not
free
it's very very very very cheap I would
say I I counted to 20 cents per unit
don't quote me on that contact oracle
but it's on something about that and
twenty cents it's not too bad the
problem is it's not something you buy
with a credit card it's something you
contact an Oracle sales person and then
you have to pay support costs twenty
percent every year and the money is not
an issue about the administration around
it maybe finally you have OpenJDK which
is free it supports for floats you can
use the latest Russians but it is much
slower the tests we have here is a very
simple test that only does calculations
so there is no garbage collection no I
you know nothing only calculation but if
you are able to read the text the two
bars to the left or Oracle's JVMs they
are clearly the fastest they complete in
less than 20 seconds and then a violin
under OpenJDK is almost twice as slow if
I put it like that and the OpenJDK zero
engine with which is the default is by
far the slowest now that test was pretty
trivial if you run a better test you
will get some other results in this test
we ran the load test that we actually
want you to do so we ran the load test
for our real application and the thing
was we didn't run it with the entire
wall we only used a single raspberry pi
unit and the Oracle JDK 8 Indian could
produce 1200 business transactions per
minute with that setup whereas if you
look at John vm which is the closest
contender from OpenJDK it's at 600 so
Oracle's vm is twice as fast
which may be worth some money of course
with a lion that seemed to be a winner
before we got very irregular throughput
and in addition it would die after about
an hour consistently we didn't really
delve very deeply into what was the
problem I think it's related to garbage
collection but i'm not sure what we did
was we said okay we have John vm it's
about as fast and it's works and it's
stable so let's go for it so I would
recommend either openjdk with the John
via or oricas latest and greatest java
version at the time you start doing
whatever you are going to do one thing
that happened to us was that probably in
order to save money they decided to
change memory chips on the Raspberry
memory controllers so the recent
raspberries use a chip which is called
the hynix ship if you take a looking
glass and look at it it says other hynix
or samsung on the ship and it's located
right in the middle of the Raspberry Pi
there and the java SE 7 only supports
the old soft float images unfortunately
the old soft floaty images do not
support the hynix memory chip so they
cannot boat what to do we got this 447
out of 48 raspberry PI's so 47 refused
to boots and the 48 worked flawlessly
and if we switch the memory cards around
the one that worked always worked on the
others were always dead we found the
problem and luckily you can fix it what
you do is you take the soft float image
and write it somewhere so that you can
access the contents for example to
memory
God and then you write the latest and
greatest hard flute image to another
memory card or to another disc and they
have two petitions on them a both
petition and the road petition the boat
petition contains several files you need
to locate free of them and copy from the
hard floats boat petition to the soft
floaty boat petition and the files are
named Boott codeine started elf and fix
up dot dots if you copy those then you
can vote from the soft floats image and
everything is fine there are a lot of
blogs about this coincidentally many of
them only mention one of these files but
if you copy only one it will not work at
least it didn't for us so you need all
three right so we built the prototype
using spare parts so in the first
version we had a power supply from an
old pc and we solved the raspberries
power connections to that one and well
yeah the rest of it looks like on this
world basically it wasn't fast enough so
we decided to build a larger wall and
that was when we built the world with 48
raspberries looks like this as you can
see the switch is pretty large takes up
a large part of the wall power supply we
didn't just use pc power supply on this
one because a pc power supply can handle
35 raspberries and we needed 48 so we
had to buy something that was a little
bit more powerful ya know there is much
more to say about that one
so installing the software them with
OpenJDK this is fairly easy because you
can get all the software you need with
the apt so first download the latest and
greatest hard float we see image from
raspberries download site right into a
card I don't know if you can read the
text there sudo d d e f and the name of
the image Oh F and the name of the drive
block size one megabyte this is the
syntax for Linux which I used it's a
similar on the Macintosh and there are
programs for windows as well one thing
to note here you will see in in ribbed
the name of the drive sdb this is the
drive which corresponds to your memory
card so it was as the be for me it may
not be as TB for you it may be SDC your
STD or whatever so when you insert the
memory card check which drive it
corresponds to before you start writing
because if you DD to your hard drive
you're basically dead also note that
it's sdb not as the b1 or sdb to wear
has to be anything else you want to
write to the the entire drive not to a
petition in the drive after that you can
vote from the card and connect us usurp
I with password rasberry using SSH and
this is a very good thing with the
latest dress / images they come with the
ssh enabled by default before you had to
use a keyboard and a screen and use that
for the first start enable ssh and then
you could get rid of the keyboard but
here you can actually use the raspberry
without a keyboard and without a screen
which is nice initial configuration sudo
raspy config we give you a nice menu
where you can select things to do in the
beginning you will want to expand the
file system so that it uses your entire
SD card the image is about
two gigabytes so if you have a larger
card you will probably want to expand
the image also you will want to disable
both to desktop because we will not be
using X Windows you might want to
overclock we will talk about that later
and in advanced options you can select
memory splits and decide how much memory
to give to the CPU with Java and how
much memory to give to the graphics
processor and of course we want us
little memory as possible to the
graphics processor so 16 Meg then one
thing with the raspberries it doesn't
have a clock so if you pull the power
plug from it and then you let time pass
and then you insert the power plug again
the raspberry will think the clock is
whatever it was when you pull the plug
so what the raspberry does is it
connects to an NTP server network time
protocol and if it is connected to the
Internet this just works if it is not
connected to the internet and it has
gotten its IP address from a DHCP server
most DHCP servers also tell it that hey
you can get time from this the NTP
server and then it will also just work
but if you are using a DHCP server for
instance from windows that doesn't give
you an NTP server then you would also
have to point to raspberry 21 and you do
that by editing at centipede ii sorry
ntp door conf and simply tell it the
name of your ntp server after that you
can reboot and update the installed
packages with the pseudo get updates and
an upgrade and then you can install java
and using sudo apt-get install OpenJDK 7
yada yada yada so pretty convenient then
you're done as for overclocking the
short hair froze
the simple computation test case that I
had before time in seconds for that test
case using different overclocking and
these all the toppings are the presets
that you get in the configuration menu
for new raspberry PI's you can also find
unit yourself and select the frequencies
for different parts and voltages and so
on but it's much more convenient and
safe to use one of the presets the turbo
preset which has 1g garage clock
frequency is of course the fastest but I
wouldn't recommend that one because
there are several reports about people
corrupting their memory cards using it
the memory cards are not fast enough to
catch up so unless you have a very very
good memory card or unless you are
prepared to take risks turbo is probably
not a good idea hi should work we used
medium just to be on the safe side we
used John via matha said so we started
with Java minus janvier on and then we
need to decide how much memory to give
to to Java and of course we want to give
it as much memory as possible but we
absolutely do not want to swap because
swapping to an SD card on the raspberry
is not fast so you may need to fill a
bit with that or take a safe approach
and use less memory than you might have
done it is actually possible to
configure raspbian so that it never
swaps instead it will crash if it needs
to swap but that may be a bit extreme
you can also disable unnecessary
services but we found all the services
that were running to be pretty harmless
so we just let them run
what framework to use them good news is
the raspberry will probably support
whatever framework you like almost there
are some exceptions there is one a
framework that I've used which is called
CLE sale I and it uses native code and
that is out but otherwise all the pure
Java frameworks should work we use the
grinder free which is one of the leading
distributed load test frameworks for
jalan because we had existing tests for
it and they worked out of the box no
changes so that was good the grinder is
very good if you want to make tests for
web applications because it can record
them you just point your browser to
proxy server that grinder provides and
then it records the session and then you
can edit the code before you actually
use it however the raspberry is much
slower than a PC and in particular it
has much less memory so I like to
program so I wrote my own load test
framework on my free time and that way
we could get rid of the lotus than sorry
enjoyed on engine much fewer classes
less footprint and I could multiplex
several clients on the same thread so we
could handle more clients using fewer
threads less contact switching faster
right you don't want to do all this
configuration for 48 units it takes time
so do it once and then if you're using
soft clothes make sure to copy the free
files i mentioned from a hard fruit
image so you won't have to redo all the
work later and create an image from the
SD card it is you just switch the ifm
of' arguments in the command i had
previously then you copy the image to
all the other cards and you start the
wall and if you want to individualize
the settings for instance we have
different host
names on all our devices because if one
of them dies it's nice to see which one
so you can easily do that if you just
start the wall plug it into a network
with the dhcp server then you scan the
network to find the IP addresses and you
use a simple SSH script that logs in and
perform some commands an easy way to set
the host name is for example to use a
part of the IP address the last part and
concatenate that to a prefix and they
are also the image is very good to have
as a backup the SD cards do break down
sometimes so it's good to have a safe
backup right Lotus on a load test to
measure if the application meets its
performance target so the targets must
exist they must be measurable and you
must measure them so the first thing is
to determine the requirements then you
can generate load with a raspberry wall
you can measure in various ways and
analyze the results so for us the
requirements were pretty clear we needed
to handle 50,000 concurrent connections
we needed to handle 100 business
transactions per second and I can add
that that is with ssl we needed stable
performance over time at least for one
week and we wanted few errors preferably
nom so those were the requirements the
ball would generate requests preferably
ramping up the load slowly so that it
wouldn't just outright kill the server
and the screenshots are from the
performance monitor on windows 7 and
some some log output which you probably
cannot see you need to measure the times
for successful tests or in several
places probably the most important one
is to measure on the clients because if
a client tries to connect to the server
and it doesn't get a connection the
server will never know so you need to
measure times on the clients and you
should measure connect times
you should measure processing times of
course errors some of that can be
recorded on the server as well but on
the client has the complete picture for
complex tests the individual steps
should be measured and it's a good idea
to use a performance monitor or top is
good enough on the client side on the
raspberries because it's pretty easy to
to swamp a raspberry with too much work
and then it just starts contact
switching and garbage collection and so
on so it's better to scale down the
workload a little bit and put it
somewhere with the raspberry is working
one hundred percent but not much more
than one hundred percent server-side the
strictest are at least as important and
if possible it's very good to instrument
the server so that the server itself
logs out statistics that way you can
leave these the tix disks on in
production which is very handy if
something changes we know the total
number of successful transactions per
minute errors per minutes number of
active connections we didn't lock the
number of active threads because it's
easy to see that in other ways and the
processing time for step for each
business transaction may be very good
but you don't want to lock that all the
time but it's a nice feature whether
without instrumentation you will need to
look at the JVM internals and look at
some performance monitor to see how the
system fares and the screenshot to the
left here is from jconsole I don't know
how many know this but Java comes with
jconsole out of the box and if you
connect to a running java vm with yay
console you will see graphs and tables
with information about garbage
collection about threads about lots of
really useful data so so use it and a
performance monitor from the operating
system it's also invaluable window serve
insists is very good but all operating
systems have them
it's also going to use a profiler I
don't know how many of you know that but
in java SE 7 there is a free profiler
included visualvm and if you connect
with visual vm and profile you can see
which methods java spends the most time
in and you can filter so that you can
only look at your own methods of course
so that way you can see that ok this
method is expensive perhaps I should
optimize it and also you can see that
this has the other method that looks
very complex is not worth optimizing
because it's never called so a profiler
is very good if the targets are met
great then the test was successful and
you are done if not well ideally the
problem stands out perhaps in the
profiler or perhaps in the logs if it
doesn't stand out you will need to
analyze the logs so it's a good idea to
keep them in a format that you can
import into Excel low into a database
for for analytics some issues rjb are
more platform-specific we run into
several of those actually so it's a good
idea to test the application on several
platforms to see if that is the case and
of course Google is your friend at least
here so Google for it perhaps it's a
common problem and now time for the live
demo so what I'll do if I haven't
already I will start tomcat and the
grinder console the console is an
application that controls the agents
that run in the raspberries I will then
start the agents on the raspberries
using SSH commands and around the chest
and measure some results so let's see
what I have I
that looks like the grinder console that
looks like visual vm when I probably
need to stop Tomcats now it's running
okay good what will tests is basically
this very very very simple application
that i wrote a giro number is a certain
kind of account number used in Sweden so
this simple webpage valid 80 numbers so
you just enter a number of some sort and
you press validate and the page will
tell you if this is a valid number or
not here it expects the shake some seven
so we'll try that and it will tell us
that this is a valid Bank your number
and it's also valid postal hero number
the only difference is how they are
formatted so this is what the
raspberries will do they will do this
time and time and time again and so
let's start them have a very simple bat
file that simply rounds puti which is a
ssh come on for windows and it tries to
connect raspberries in order to start
time this doesn't look too good so
perhaps raspberry number one is out of
action we'll see
yep okay bad sign number two is there
good at least one
and see where we have the console there
it is here is the grinder console I
don't know how much you can see but it
has four tabs the rightmost has a script
with a grinder properties file that
tells grinder what it should tests so
the grinder properties tells it how many
threads to use and lots of other options
and it points to the item file which is
here and this code is present on my
laptop it's not present on the
raspberries to start will it has a
processes tab and here we can see the
raspberries that I've connected let's
see if they are all done yeah okay to
raspberries seem to be dead so we will
only have four raspberries in the test
but at least we'll know for a space so
we tell this raspberries to start
running like so and grindr kindly tells
us that perhaps we should sound the
latest and greatest test code to the
raspberries yes please grinder do that
and this will take time I often stand
here thinking oh gosh they are all dead
and then suddenly they start working it
can take up to a minute or something so
while it's doing that we can look at
visual via here is visual vm just
started you know how much you can see
but here to the left it shows the
different java
engines that it has found running on my
local host so I will connect to the
Tomcats instance here it is if you have
extremely good eyes you can see lots of
details here otherwise you can look at
it later yourself here you can see
graphically the cpu usage you can look
at the heap size both the normal heap
and the permian and you can see the
number of clauses that a loaded the
number of threads that are started you
can go in and look more closely at the
threads and then to the right here you
can actually start a profiling session
we will do that in a little while but I
want to run the test without profiling
firsts as profiling is pretty expensive
so Rinder yeah all the surviving
raspberries have connected and all
running so we can see here that we have
400 and something TPS and if we look at
the results this is probably too small
to read but each gray line here
corresponds to a web page so the first
gray line gets the web page that i
showed you before it gets the page it
gets the style fit and it gets the logo
image and then the second gray line
makes a post requests that validates an
invalid Bank your number and then the
last call does the same with a valid
Bank your number and we can look at the
statistics have here for how long time
it takes and so on so let's go back to
the profiler and shows CPU it's running
oh I forgot something we'll stop it what
I forgot always forget is you need to
look at settings and
by default it's monitors the wrong
classes so you will probably want to
change this to whatever classes you have
so we want to profile com code mint
classes because that's my code and we
want to ignore the library choices so
let's go again and in just a short time
there should be some results coming in
yeah it goes and you probably can't see
that but there is only there is only one
line which really takes lots of time and
that is an HTTP class that feels a
buffer so if I were to spend some time
to to optimize some part of my bank
account's validation code that would be
totally insignificant in this case
because it doesn't spend any time there
so I think that's it for the live demo
any questions before we go to the
results yes
I didn't quite hear you what was the
question if the raspberries are all
working multi-threaded or or what yeah
what happens is there is a the console
here is the controller so each raspberry
connects to the console and says here
I'm here I can work for you give me
something to do and then the console
says here is a heightened script run it
for me and run it with for instance 20
threads so then each raspberry we will
run the same title script and with it
will run it with 20 threats so taken
together that will give you 20 threads
for each raspberry here great ok I will
stop the raspberries yet
that they die no this is the first time
anyone has died for me but then on the
other hand I haven't traveled to the US
with a very open so I'll have to blame
that we haven't had any failures with
the the big ball and there were 48 of
them so it's not very frequent but yeah
let's see I had some slides left on the
presentation as well and see if we can
go back to that one there goes okay so
the results on for us the load tests
made a difference we profile and found
some bottlenecks in a lightweight soup
engine that we had built and we could
eliminate those issues profiling also
told us what we didn't need to do
because after we fix that all the CPU
cycles were spent doing SSL handshakes
and XML parsing and that is platform
code so anything we did in our methods
would not help we had some issues with
the garbage collection we would get full
Giese post times that would cause
timeouts and errors so we had to change
the options a bit and focus on getting
shorter post times we paid the price
with the somewhat less throughputs but
it's a good price to pay if you can get
rid of the errors so that was okay on
some platforms notably windows
performance would degrade over time
quite a lot actually and we found out
that we could avoid that using JVM
parameters as well if we fiddled a bit
with the garbage collection this problem
disappeared and it never happened on on
linux or solaris we reached our targets
we actually reached better than our
targets we had more than 90,000
concurrent connection
and a bit over 100 TPS so we were quite
happy and the customer was quite happy
about that and as this test had been
running for well well more than a week
with consistent performance we felt
pretty safe about the thing that it
would work so to sum it up I think the
raspberry wall worked well as a load
generator there have been no real
hiccups except for the hynix memory chip
we are issues with and the vayan openjdk
engine that didn't work so well and of
course today I had some problems with 20
the raspberries two if you count that
the normal job Alou test frameworks can
be used so that's great you can reuse
all the tests you already have the
platform seems to get better all the
time there are regular updates coming
that you can get just with the apt get
update upgrade and yeah it's working
well we do look forward to java SE 8
from oracle though because in particular
if they make it free we could double the
performance i mean one go and that's
actually all for me sir yes
do
right okay so the question was why did
we do it with the raspberry PI's which
are slow cpu wise but have a good
graphics processor that we don't use
instead of buying a big box and using a
virtual set up or something on that we
could have done that but that is
essentially the dedicated server
approach that I talked about before even
if you use virtual machine on that
dedicated sober it's still one dedicated
server it still typically has one
network interface and you still have to
go somewhere and get permission to buy
that box and in addition this is a good
marketing thing for us so as a small
consulting firm yes other questions okay
thank you that or do you have a question
did you have barn
yeah it's twice as fast as OpenJDK in
our tests compared to the fastest
openjdk engine gambia and it's more than
twice as fast as the default OpenJDK
engine zero on our application of course
it's possible that if if you write an
application you will get a different
results but in our tests and also if you
if you look at the internet and see
other people who have measured they
don't say it's twice as fast but they
always say that it's faster so it
probably is right okay thank you if
anyone wants to see me afterwards I'm
here and there are cards if someone
wants to take them as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
