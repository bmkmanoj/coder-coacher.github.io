minute detective
I'm Kevin honey I'm an independent
consultant trained and writer and I'm
based in the UK and the clock starts now
let's talk about synchronization it's
about flow first of all let's go see if
I mean this is a road system it's a
traffic system and if everybody's moving
in the same direction at the same time
and there are no obstructions life is
easy life is good
this is sequential programming there are
no problems
but what if we introduce other threats
what if we introduce a desire to have
multiple streams of traffic use the same
resources the same space where roads
meet there is a conflict these are
shared resources so our natural instinct
is to say right we need to lock this we
need to create a system of locking here
behind me we can see that there is a
traffic light system and there are also
systems of priority
other systems that we can involve
four-way stops roundabouts and other
yield models all these are based on
stopping and they are they do so to
impart sense of safety on the codes as
well as the road unfortunately locking
is not the right answer in most cases
what we need to consider is that if we
did not share the resource that would be
the first thing if we don't actually
have to cross the streams there's
nothing to share so no locking involved
why am i coming down on locking as being
a bad thing because locking is the anti
thread locking is stopped it is the
opposite of concurrency it is the
elimination of concurrency granted it's
for safety but if we can take measures
to eliminate that we sidestep the
problem that many people observe which
is all systems wait at the same speed
the other way we can do this is to allow
no change so if we make things immutable
then there is no need to synchronize the
change there is nothing to lock against
so within that space we can see that
most of our locking challenges are
imagined was that a good tip it is good
we want your opinion thanks for watching
and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
