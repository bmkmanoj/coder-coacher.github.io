farmer Stephen this is just a reminder
that we may be talking about future
directions and there's no guarantees
that any of this will be implemented or
in what timing my name is Anthony -
nigga I am a software developer for the
Oracle database group working in the
scripting language drivers and other
related technologies I am the creator
and maintainer of CX Oracle and there's
some contact information there so today
we're going to first introduce the X
Oracle and advanced queuing a little bit
most the time will be spent working on
bits of code and showing how it works
and then we'll talk briefly about some
possible future CX Oracle enhancements
and then I'm going to turn it over to
Anna Neil
madam who was beside me here he's a
software developer director for the
advanced queuing group so first an
introduction CX Oracle is an open source
module for Python giving access to the
Oracle database you'll know what it says
there C Python that's because there are
multiple implementations of Python C
Python just being the most common and
most popular one it is in C yes the CX
Oracle is written in C and gives Python
code access to the Oracle database she
don't need C to access the Oracle
database use Python there is a Python
database API specification saves Oracle
covers all of that but it also has many
advanced features and most of those over
what are we will be talking about today
I began CX Markel back in 1998 with
Oracle 8i and Python 1.5 there's been
more than 30 releases since that
covered all the way to Oracle 12c and
Python 3.6 the current CX Oracle version
is six released just a couple months ago
in August 5.3 was the previous release
and it was released a little bit earlier
this year and it's the first one that
supported it
advanced queuing which is what we're
talking about today so what is advanced
queuing a simple definition is that it
stores messages in abstract storage and
it's called queues and it is intended to
be based on the standard programming
paradigm called queues but there's a lot
more that it covers some of the
terminology that we're using there's a
producer
it creates messages and then in queues
them or adds them to the queue and then
there is a consumer and it DQ's messages
or and removes them from the queue other
producers and consumers don't need to be
aware of each other which is an
important fact that we can make use of
and messages stay in the queue of teller
consumed or they expire
I will get to that little bit later
consumers can also be not just
applications they can be other queues in
the same or remote database so you these
can be chained together and you can also
have not just persistent messages in the
database but also buffered ones in
memory some of the advanced queuing
features that I'll be covering today
besides the normal standard feature
functionality is first you have
conditions to limit the messages that
consumers see and you may wish to only
read messages of a particular priority
or messages from a particular area
the default single consumer queues have
producers one or more producers creating
messages and then one or more consumers
reading messages but once a message is
read it's gone from the queue multiple
consumer queues allow the same message
to be read multiple times by multiple
consumers independently of each other
messages can also have a shelf life
after which they expire and messages can
specify an identifier advanced queuing
has its own internal identifier that it
uses but there is also another one that
an application can specify called
correlation which is not managed by a
queue in any way some of the other
advanced queueing features that can be
of use you can have messages delayed by
for a certain period of time before
they're allowed to be DQ'd a queue
handles that all internally for you you
can change the order in which messages
are DQ'd the default is in queue time
but you can change it to be commit time
or any part of the message data you can
also change the type as messages are
DQ'd or an queued so that you can have
various parts of the application changed
independently of the others you can peek
at messages without consuming them
ordinarily if you read the message is
gone from the queue but you can also
read the message without removing it
from the queue you can also define
exception queues for managing exceptions
there is a default exception queue that
is created when you create a queue
but you can create additional exception
queues and use them yourself specify
what you would like to do with those
exceptions and then you can also as
mentioned earlier create in memory cues
for transient messages which don't
require persistence before we get to the
code this is the application that I'm
planning to to show we have some
customers and they are ordering widgets
from stores the stores in turn are going
to request those widgets be manufactured
by some manufacturers the orders are
going to be sent from by the customers
to the head office then each of these
stores are going to send request for
quote or RFQ to the manufacturer the
manufacturers are going to respond back
with a quote if they're interested and
responding and then these stores are
going to respond back indicating whether
they accept or reject the quote and then
finally the stores are going to send
back an email to their customer
indicating when their order is available
for pickup an important thing to know
here is that the manufacturers there may
be more at or less of them we can add or
subtract the manufacturers without the
application being changed and we can add
and subtract stores without the
application being changed so moving on
to the code first this is the
architecture that we're going to use in
this application we have some grey
rectangular boxes
these are the microservices
we're going to implement we have some
blue parallelograms these are the cues
that we're about to use to send messages
back and forth and then we have some
vertical segments these are the various
areas that we're going to to use we have
a head office which is going to receive
the orders from the customers and send
them on to the various stores and
they're going to have some stores that
are going to process these orders and
send off a request for quote to the
manufacturers and then we have our
manufacturers that are going to respond
for pose
so the first micro-service are going to
look at is the send orders one it's
pretty straightforward we have a head
office it's going to take those orders
for the customer presumably from a
website of some kind and then it's going
to write these orders to a queue we're
going to call Emma create a single
consumer queue then we're going to call
it order queue and we're gonna create an
object type called UDT order and we're
going to use that as our message payload
and then we're going to demonstrate the
a queue property correlation we're going
to use that to identify the order number
so the first section here of the sequel
code we are creating object types or
creating the payload type that's going
to be used for the messages advanced
queuing has the ability to use any type
and we're using that capability in this
case to create an object type these are
sometimes called a DTS or abstract data
types they have the ability to store
messages
I'm sorry historic attributes on these
objects they can also store
such as constructors but that's when
that's what you would use when you're
using PL sequel and since we're using
Python we're not going to use that so
lines one through four we're creating
our UDT order line that is going to be
represent a line of the order that the
customer is making lines 2 &amp;amp; 3 are the
widget type code and the number of boxes
that the customers ordering then in line
7 we're creating an array of those order
lines we're using a V array in this case
and the 20 in parentheses is the maximum
number of elements that you can put in
that array you can also use a nested
table but that doesn't maintain order
and we want to do that in this case so
that's why I'm using a V array then in
lines at 10 through 15 I'm creating the
actual UDT order object type there's a
bit of header information a customer
name or email address and the store code
and then lines which is the V array
containing all of the lines and thing
customers are doing and then the second
part of the code of sequel code is to
actually create the cue table and the
cues the package DBMS underscore EQ ADM
is what's used to manage a cue tables
and queues so in line two we have to
first create a cue table you need one
cue table at least for each distinct
data type that you're planning to use
the first parameter there is the name of
the table that you want to create for
calling it or order of messages and the
second parameter is the type name unity
order which we just created then in line
three we create the cue we're calling it
order cue
and the second parameter there is the
name of the table that we just created
order messages and then finally we start
the queue in the line four and that's
all that's needed to create an a queue
queue then the Python code this first
line is showing the code that's needed
to actually create the order object so
in line one we call connection get type
that allows you to get the type
information from the database in this
case UDT order they are there's the
ability to use of introspection you can
determine whether it's a collection or
the attributes that this type has but in
this case we know what the attributes
are so we're just going to use them
directly then in line two we create a
new empty object and then in lines three
four and five we are setting some
attributes on that object and you'll
know that it looks exactly the same as
setting any attribute in Python the only
thing that might look a little strange
is that it's all an upper case and
that's because by default oracle changes
object type names and attribute names to
all uppercase unless you quote them
event in line at seven and eight we're
getting more type information and now
nine we're creating a new object a new
collection the array and then in minds
10 through 14 and we are going to
populate that via a collection a line 11
we create a new line object then lines
12 and 13 we go ahead and set the
attributes our widget type code and our
number of boxes and then line 14 we
append
a newly created line object to our v-ray
and then line 15 we go ahead and set to
the attribute to the v-ray which is
created and now we have an order object
that we can then put into the queue
adding the message to the queue is
pretty straightforward line 16 we go
ahead and create an NQ options object
this has the ability to set various
options for in queueing we're not using
any in this particular case but there
are some which you can see in the
documentation and we're also creating a
message properties object on line 17 and
this in this case we're also setting the
correlation to our order number this
correlation will then be available when
you DQ the message for whatever the D
queueing application needs to do with it
the line 19 we in queue the message the
first parameter there is the name of the
queue that we created earlier order Q
then we pass our NQ options our message
properties and finally the payload the
order object we've just created on the
previous slide and then finally line 20
commit you need to commit or no nothing
happens
moving on to our process orders of
architecture microservice this one's a
little bit more complex it is going to
read from the orders queue and that is
going to write to the request for quotes
queue
in this case I'm going to demonstrate
the use of the EQ property condition
this is good we're gonna use this to
ensure that only messages for the
particular store are DQ'd and not any
other ones and as each order is DQ'd
we're going to request a quote for each
order line in real life you might do
something a little more complex than
this but for this example that's what
we're to do we're also going to include
the store location in the message so the
manufacturer can use that information to
make a decision on whether to respond to
that request for a quote since not all
manufacturers are going to be interested
in responding to all requests we're
going to create a different type of
queue this time a multi consumer queue
and that's how that each manufacturer
can manage its messages independently
and the object type UDT RFQ we're going
to use is the message payload and this
is the code for creating the unity RFQ
object type this is pretty
straightforward but for different
attributes the only thing I'm going to
draw your attention to is line two which
is a location which is a type SDO
geometry
SDO stands for spatial data objects and
can be used to store points or lines or
polygons or any 3d object at all in this
particular case we're only going to
store a point on a map that the
manufacturer can use and then align five
that we have a cue name and the reason
we have this is because we have a
distinct cue for each store where we're
asking the manufacturer to respond to
send its quote and the code for actually
creating the cues looks very very
similar to the previous code that was
used to create the orders cue the only
difference is line three and all we have
to do to create a multiple consumer akin
is the parameter multiple underscore
consumers and set that value to true
then the Python code the first part here
is to go ahead and create the message
and set up for both D queuing and n
doing the first section lines one
through seven is for setting up for D
queuing and this second section lines
nine through twelve or for setting up
for any queuing the line one again we
get the type information unity order and
line two we create a new empty object
you'll see there's two different ways
that can be taught to be done one is to
call the type information the type
object directly instead of calling dot
new object that's just another shortcut
that can be used we're creating a DQ
options in line three and setting a few
of those parameters in lines four five
and six the one that's an interest here
is line 6 we're setting the condition
conditions act much like a where clause
in the query in this case what we're
doing is we're saying we only want to
look at messages that match our store
code so tab user data is referencing the
the message data itself you can use
other things you can use various aspects
of the internal attributes that advance
queuing has as well
and then line 9 we go ahead and get the
type information for a unity RFQ create
a new object and then line 11 we're
setting the location from the location
information that we got for the store
and then creating any two options line
13 you'll see there's a while loop there
of the reason for that is that when you
call connection dot DQ if there is a
message available you'll get back a
message ID but if there's no message
available you'll get back to none
you'll also note that it looks very
similar to connection dot NQ it has
exactly the same parameters or right the
first is the name of the queue that you
want to DQ from the second is the DQ
options then message properties and
finally your payload and that payload
object will be filled in with the
message information when you're finished
and then line 14 you can see that the
message properties contain our
correlation that we set earlier and we
can use that information as we'll see in
a few more lines then in lines 15
through 21 that we are requesting a
quote or adding a quote message our
request for quote message to the RFQ
queue you'll note in line 15 there is an
as list in red there that's because
we're taking that theory and converting
it to a Python list and then by 19
you'll note that I'm setting the
correlation yet again this time to the
order number and the line number that's
that we can readily identify the quote
when it comes back which lion it was for
and then we go ahead and queue and
commit now moving on to the process a
request for quote Matt microservice this
one we're reading from the rfqs queue
and then writing to the quotes q there
the quotes Q is specific to the store
and the question is how does the 95 to
decide how if he's going to respond to
the RFQ in this case I've made it quite
simple I've said if the story falls
within a certain distance from the
manufacturer then he goes ahead and
responds to the request for quote and
otherwise he ignores it I will show how
that can be done we are going to use a
separate rule for each manufacturer for
multiple consumer Q's you have to add
subscribers you have to identify who is
going to be fetching from those queues
we're going to use sto as mentioned
earlier to limit the messages to receive
receive to only those from stores and
then a certain distance and an important
thing to note is that EQ filters those
messages as they're added to the queue
so if you add a new subscriber no
existing messages will be processed if
you change your rule that only affects
new messages not old ones we're going to
use the object ID UDT quote and
demonstrate the a queue property
expiration to show how you can specify
how long this quote is to be valid and
the important thing to note is that once
the time has expired without being DQ'd
it gets put into an exception queue
which you can which DBAs can look at or
you can actually use application logic
to
than as well so here is the unity quote
object type it's pretty straightforward
you have a widget type code number of
boxes the data that the manufacturer
says that the widgets will be available
total cost our manufacturer code and our
q1 which we want to have response then
this section here is for creating these
subscribers and they accuse so in lines
two through eleven we're creating our
subscribers we called a method DBMS
underscore EQ medium add subscriber and
we pass in the name of the queue and
then on this line four we're creating
our consumer name we call sista a cue
dollar underscore agent and in this case
we're using our manufacturer code to
differentiate the cuny event in lines
five to ten we're creating our rule in
this case our rule is any met any store
within a particular distance so we're
using the method sto underscore within
underscore distance which passes two
parameters three parameters the first
two are the location of the store tabbed
user data dot location which we passed
in the message and in the the next
section on six seven and eight are and
doing a sub query to get the
manufacturer location and then in my
ensign in ten we use the distance equals
and that our manufacturers of maximum
distance with a unit of kilometers and
if all that is true then the message is
available for the consumer and otherwise
it just gets discarded then the liens 12
through 16 we go ahead and create our
multiple queues one for each store
here's an example of how you create one
cube table and line 12 and then minus 13
through 16 create multiple queues with a
different name
store and then this code looks very
similar to what we've seen before
I'll draw attention to line six or we
specify the consumer name you do need to
specify a consumer native if you are
using a multiple consumer cue the rest
of this is very similar so I'm just
going to move on and this code also
looks very similar I'll draw your
attention to align 21 where we're
setting the expiration this is in
seconds it is 24 hours times 60 minutes
per hour times 60 seconds per minute
and this is our process quotes
micro-service it is going to go ahead
and read from our store specific quotes
Q and then write to our quote responses
manufacturer's Q and we're to use the
type UDT quote response which is very
very simple and similar we're to have a
sub accepted flag which is wire in
indicating whether the store accepts the
quote and then some optional comments
once again we create a cue table and
then we create one cue per manufacturer
and we create our quote I mean our sorry
our quote responses again this code all
looks very similar so this this
information will be made available to
you you can download it later so I'm
just gonna go through this really
quickly
some additional steps that would need to
be done if you needed to continue
working on this application you have to
have the manufacturer's process the
quote responses and ensuring that
they're able to ship by the date they
originally promised and you'd also have
to have the store's send an email to
their customers and here's another
example where cues are very helpful
because if you fail to send an email you
don't want to abort the transaction and
if you fail to commit the transaction
you can't unsend the email so a cute
helps to manage that the Mail's were
sent independently and but they're still
guaranteed to be sent and then briefly
some future CX Oracle enhancements first
off the support for raw Q's what you've
seen so far is object types that you can
also use raw which is basically a bag of
bytes of undetermined length aq doesn't
know about the contents of this data and
that can be used for example for
serializing data using say pythons
pickle or Jason for example and that
makes it easier to actually transport
this information without getting the
database involved but you don't get some
of the eight use features either you
can't use conditions or rules based on
the message data the second support for
notification of availability of messages
to DQ right now you have the call
connection dot n Q and wait forever this
feature would allow you to get a
notification when there are messages
available and then you could go ahead
and DQ an n Q then and not have to hold
a database connection open permanently
and then there is also possible support
for sharded queues this will come
automatically with Oracle 18 C but you
can also back port it to 12:1 and 12 to
put the bug number there and
you wanted to request that and then now
I'm going to turn to the floor over to
anneal madman who's going to cover some
EQ features in more detail thank you yes
each each subscriber gets its own cue in
essence that's the normal cue that
multiple consumer cue each subscriber
has its own set of messages so when
subscriber a reads a message subscriber
B gets to read that message as well yeah
thanks for 12 years and Anthony wanted
me to basically give you an overview of
what all advanced features are there in
hate you and also that couldn't be
covered in his demo and all
about the new scalable kills that we
have entered into an SI called charlotte
kills so in this slide as you guys can
see that we have added Python interface
on 8 you know with the help of Anthony
but there are other interfaces as well
that are used by customers we have JMS
PL sequel dotnet and many other Amyas we
also have customers who have got
applications written on different
application stack for example large
banks having applications using IBM and
pew series typical and they would also
like to basically have the capability to
you know have that application interact
with the new application that are being
developed on top of Oracle database now
in order for the two applications to
coexist which is the fact that most of
the large banks they can take advantage
of a package called messaging gateway
messaging gateway will allow the message
is to flow from the IBM - aqune vice
versa so that the two systems can
coexist and it is an entry of cost so
it's not an fitna you know paid option
the keq is also part of the enterprise
database as well as Oracle Express
edition messaging eight-way internally
uses transformation and propagation so
what is transformation transformation is
a teacher again out of box that a queue
supports word it and allow two different
applications who are using different
data format to interact to each other so
it allows two applications of different
formats to integrate we also saw the
users that are using transformation will
have to use the DBMS underscore
formation package and they can't write
the sequel functions but they can
specify the old data format and return
the new data format and it will
automatically invert those
transformation functions either at the
end of time or take your time all right
the propagation time so we have a lot of
customers who are also using propagation
now propagation use cases are like if
applications want to kick-start a
workflow for example in when an order
got received and they wanted to pass on
this message for billing purpose to the
billing department in another database
again out of box you get a propagation
feature that way you can specify the
source and the destination queue and
these queues are managed by two
different departments and can be within
the same database or and we across the
database over a deepening the source and
the destination once it is specified by
the user may give an automatically
transfer the messages between the queues
it's also used by a lot of customers to
have their own replication built in on
top of a cube so that you can basically
often or the OLTP database and do some
kind of analytics or other things on
other databases so propagation is again
another feature that we support besides
our normal comments of feature of a
queue now as you can see in this slide I
have got two applications application 1
and 2 they are consuming messages based
on the condition that is specified as
Anthony also mentioned in his example
so in application one it has specified a
condition saying that I'm interested in
messages where priority is greater than
2 that's one of the conditions whereas
application 2 is saying that I am
interested in messages where the
correlation ID is water and the score ID
was used by Anthony in his example so
one way and the consumer can consume a
message is by polling the queue and
consuming the messages but what are you
guys have messages coming in at half
rations what if the messages are coming
in bursty fashion so should you be
pulling the queue quite often should you
be holding the connections in order to
wait for the messages to come we have
got a second way of consuming messages
that is called notification so what
notification means is you register in
the ato server saying that I want to
automatically consume the messages as
and when orders come in I want to pick
start order you know going that order
request to the procurement department I
want that really a billing department to
know that there is an order that has
come if you want to automate all that
without polling you can take advantage
of the notification now we have
different types of notification not just
one where you can just consume messages
and you know process the orders
automatically you can also have email
sent out automatically so you specify
the email list and it will automatically
send the notifications out to the
billing department or to the hand user
saying that the orders ready for pickup
that comes out of us from the it's part
of the a key feature now as you can see
there are different features and akin is
part of database EQ internally leverages
lot of other components of database like
we use the scheduler layer we use the
security layer we use the transaction
layer so that we can give you exactly
one square and
give you reliable robust messages so we
are taking advantages of the different
layers of databases and we are out of
the database so with this what we are
seeing is lot of large applications and
you know cloud applications they are
taking advantages of these database
effect messages and as part of the
database now to give you an overview of
different types of customers within
Oracle itself that are taking advantages
of a kill we have got critical fusion
applications that aren't making use of
ATO internally we have got the
middleware pass cloud services that are
rolling out these days they are using a
new internally and there are several
reasons for this first is that queues
anderson plus messaging is an
established programming model they have
been using JMS and there are a lot of
JMS providers out there but the key
things that is what is happening and
that I see happening in Oracle itself is
that as we are moving to cloud there is
a drag to the stateless materials
basically they want to start the VMS
they want to start as many processes as
possible but where do you get the data
the data is being stored in database in
form of messages using a cube so lot of
applications are being translated from
the winter JMS queues to database backed
queues and it also solves from this
important problem of high availability
and disaster recovery which is very
important in cloud these days there are
lot of pass applications there are a lot
of pass services like identity Oracle
Identity cloud service that is taking
advantage of a queue because they are
rolling out there you know services in
form of micro services we also have got
the Oracle data warehouse cloud service
which is again having
microcell missus built on top of a cube
and high-availability disaster recovery
being one of the main factors and
exactly once literally so the goal of
all these applications and services is
to basically scale out and they want to
have great resilience now here I just
listed some of the Oracle Applications
sass and pass which are using a key
internally so if you are using supply
chain management distributed order
request raishin Oracle Retail saw a
suite has got a plug-in adapter Eloqua
ebusiness suite and many more we also
have got database products internally
using a queue for example we have the
database change notification alerts p.m.
Enterprise Manager and many more now
please note that a queue predates GM
standard and that it was introduced in a
toe so there have been a lot of
applications that have been taking
advantage of a queue and what we found
was that lot of our customers are happy
with the performance that is provided in
11.2 and 201 with the classic use but
there are lot of applications that are
seen a need for high throughput and like
for example without naming the customer
customer was looking for around 20
million or more messages per hour we
could not support that with this classic
queues so what we did was we redesigned
and created a new tube and introduced
into ANSI called shadi queues
so what shadrach uses basically it's a
logical queue which many shots
now what chars is basically is like a
partition we manage the partitions
automatically for you so the addition of
the partitions and
the partitions are not users
responsibility it does it automatically
depending on the load that it sees with
partitions what we are able to do as
more and more processes are trying to
produce and consume messages we have got
a load balancer layer which tries to
distribute the load across all these
partitions but also making sure that we
are giving you as JMS session ordering
guarantee with exactly once
we also are taking advantage of the
systems that are having a lot of memory
so what we are doing is we are caching
messages in memory so with caching
messages in memory we are able to give
the consumers the messages from in
memory itself without doing any sequel
or i/o we are also having an in-memory
rule evaluation so that we can do
filtering of the messages in memory
itself rather than doing sequel in the
classic you there are many more things
that we have done in this case well
which is allowing us to basically scale
up so as you guys can see here what we
are saying is that with charted queues
we are able to give higher throughput we
were able to go up to finding million
messages per hour persistent messages we
are using less resources we were hardly
using you know 20 or 30% CPU which we
used to see being a complaint in the old
classic use we are able to handle much
better way large number of subscribers
and concurrent queues and decals across
rack if there are customers in this room
who know about a queue on drag they have
been complaining about contention issues
so but which charted cubes we are able
to handle all those and do it do a
better job of that another important
thing to note is that if you guys are
using classic use either a PL sequel or
a JMS which is right now supported you
guys will be able to take
of shouted Q's without changing a single
line of code all you have to do is drop
the world cue create a new shouted kill
and that's it so the key takeaway point
from my presentation is that if you guys
have a requirement of millions of
messages per hour if you guys are seeing
a contention track you know interact
environments if you guys have seen that
the throughput requirements are
increasing and not being supported by
the classic use you guys can take
advantage of shuttle queues
all it requires is a partitioning option
there are no other you know it's not a
paid option and comes from Plan C so now
I would like to hand it over
thanks just to let you know about other
sessions that are going on there is
another Python session tomorrow in the
afternoon at 4:30 there's also a
hands-on lab at 9:45 and we also have
our demo booth so if you have any
questions that you can ask right now you
can always come by and see us there and
then we also have business for node and
for high high availability and
performance and scalability if you have
any questions you have maybe two minutes
otherwise thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
