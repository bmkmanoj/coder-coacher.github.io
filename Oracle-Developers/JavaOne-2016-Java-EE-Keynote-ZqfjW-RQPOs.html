Gower
good afternoon good afternoon my friends
my fellow developers I'm very excited to
be here today I have an opportunity to
share our vision our strategy around
Java EE and I know many of you have been
waiting for it to anxiously so here we
go we have a very well defined plan for
java e8 and java 9 but before i go there
i would like to take a step back and
let's see how java is doing today you
have many implementations to choose from
the ecosystem remains very healthy and
vibrant and all major application server
vendors have their application servers
now offered in the cloud as services so
Java he has made this transition to
cloud very successfully and you have a
countless applications running on java
ee both on prem and in the cloud so this
is great for Java EE and the ecosystem
doesn't end there right there are
numerous open source projects that
extend Jie platform there are so many
frameworks you know that are leveraging
java ee components and i think overall
this is all great for you the developers
if you're writing any enterprise
application it's very likely that you're
using something from jie whether you
realize or not so what's next you know
what should you expect from Java EE over
the next couple of years and what's the
theme for java in X so the theme is
right here it's the new app dev style
for cloud and micro services how did we
get to this theme so the answer comes
from the kind of challenges developers
are facing you guys are facing the world
around you is changing you know you're
some of you are getting restless you
know you are demanding more from the
platform providers as we move to the
clouds you have to work with distributed
environments you have need for more
agility more flexibility you know you're
moving from
ago infrastructure to virtualization and
there is a shift from monolithic
applications where you package entire
functionality into one application now
you have you know many many smaller
units of your application that you
develop as microservices and the last
thing here you know there's a
fundamental shift in how you package and
deploy your applications you know
traditionally you have an application
running for you you know you deploy your
application probably more than one but
that's not true anymore right its
flipped 180 degrees you know application
is the boss now application decides
what's packaged so the runtime is
packaged with the application and you
want just enough runtime you know if you
don't need a class a framework why
should you carry so all of these
problems kind of need something to
change in the platform we need to
fine-tune we need to optimize the
platform circle it can evolve to solve
these problems let's also look at the
cloud development model you know when
you look at cloud development you're
more likely to see a heterogeneous set
of clients probably using mobile rest
html5 or some JavaScript at the back end
you will have some traditional RDBMS or
you know more and more people have
started to use no SQL DB you know you
have data streams and some other options
there and what happens in between these
two you have a collection of services
you know microservices typically they
are stateless but some of you may need
stateful services and what you want from
these services you want the flexibility
of managing the lifecycle of these
independently you don't want to be
relying on person sitting next to decide
when your service should be rolled out
and you want it to be scaled
independently so let me think of Amazon
right you have multiple services you
have one service that provides list of
all the products another one that you
use to place order and the scale that
you need for these is different
so what's the issue here it's not like
you don't have solutions to solve those
problems you know in fact you have more
solutions than you probably need and
that may not be ideal you know unless
you are an advanced developer you know
Adam B ends of the world you are you
know you hongos who can write a nap
while sleeping or our own Gupta you know
so or David Blevins they can solve all
the problems to Java EE as it exists
today but we need to think of you know
developers next wave of developers who
may not be familiar with this but they
still want to write next generation
applications where do you start it's
more likely you know you go to the
Internet you search for what you are
trying to do and then you know if you
have hundreds of hits you know you may
lose all your hair before you can figure
out you know where to pick the right
framework you know what's the right way
for you to go whether it's based on the
standard whether your application will
be portable so you can protect your
investment and these are the problems
where I think java ee can help you so
java ee has been so successful because
it provided you a comprehensive platform
a platform that provides you all the
api's that you're likely to use need for
your application when you're writing
your wide variety of application that
needs you know scalability transactions
and you should be able to do it in a
portable way you know so you you're not
locked into any vendor so all of these
aspects you know they've worked really
well for Java EE and we want to bring
these benefits you want to extend these
towards the new world and that will be
beneficial for the entire ecosystem of
Java EE one thing I want to make sure
here that whatever i'm talking about is
a proposal right this is a community
process we will go through the process
we will form expert groups where you
know major vendors some licensees
community member jugs you will
contribute and it'll be the expert group
that decides what goes in individual J
srs and overall at the platform so
that's
step into some technical areas of focus
you know what are we planning to do to
address the challenges that I just
mentioned so first and foremost the
programming model itself you know the
programming model has to change we are
looking at reactive style programming
that centered around distributed data
streams so the reactive programming
model will be extended in jax-rs Jason
binding you know jpa and many other
specifications we also plan to bring in
the benefits of HTTP to 0 lambda from
Java SE and we need a unified event
model that all the components within the
platform can use to surface the events
or consume those events so there will be
an event messaging API another thing is
the eventual consistency you know the
traditional way of managing transaction
the acid transaction model is not so
suitable in the distributed environment
you want things to happen fast you're
not storing information it just keeps
moving as streams so I think eventual
consistency will play an important role
there we are seeing more and more people
started to use key value pair you know
it's for simple for storing simple data
structures or your documents and the
next thing is security no matter what
you do you would like to make sure you
know it's secure throughout the platform
especially when you work in the hybrid
clouds where you know the some services
are you know not in your cloud so all of
these things become very important the
standards play a key role so we will
introduce a standard way of managing the
keys and secrets we are seeing or an
open ID connect becoming very very
popular so bringing those into the
platform next is the location
transparency so you would like to scale
your services horizontally what needs to
happen if you want to do it you cannot
afford to have the configuration tied to
the service or state tied to the service
they have to be externalized they have
to be stored somewhere
so we need the api's to manage the
configuration or you know the state so
it can be stored in an external you know
set of services and then once let's say
you figured out the programming model
you know you figured out how to solve
their transparency resiliency becomes
very very important so imagine like you
have an environment where there are
thousands of micro services running you
know hundreds of versions of those micro
service is running and the system is
under stress things are bound to fail
when they fail you know is there a
mechanism that the platform provides a
standard way where you can deal with the
failures you do not want any particular
service to fail and you know bring down
your entire system so we would like to
kind of you know have circuit breakers
bulkheads those concepts in the platform
that can isolate that problem to a
particular microservice that's failing
the command should be resilient you know
if something fails you know are there
corrective measures are there some steps
from work around that you can try in an
automated fashion so these commands
become important and next is the
standardized health reporting you know
if you cannot have a standard way where
each service with reporting help I mean
there's so little you can do to manage
the environment and run it now next is
the packaging model itself you know
you're seeing the trend where your
packaging your services or your
applications on time into containers you
know we are seeing docker being used
very frequently so as I said you know we
need to separate out the configuration
you know from these packaging itself and
we want to enable to package more than
one artifacts you know if you have
multiple services you should be able to
package that within 11 container we also
want to be able to leverage some java SE
features as marc was just talking about
here modularity you know so the j link
there that can help you pick
the kind of you know libraries files you
need so it will help you pack it just
enough runtime with your application we
are also seeing that server less is
gaining more and more popularity you
know right now it's only useful for very
very simple applications I would like to
see that expanded the same concept where
as a developer all you care is about
your code you should not have any
knowledge or should not be required to
have any knowledge of the runtime you
throw your code in there and it's
someone else's responsibility to run
your code as efficiently as possible
based on the parameters you define so
you would like to kind of you know
introduce that concept and then grow up
from there the last thing here is
multi-tenancy you know in our own cloud
you know when we built the cloud first
basically want to make it work right
once everything is running then
efficiency you know this comes into play
because every vendor cares about margins
right you are competing with someone
else out there so density becomes very
important I mean there was a time when
we were buying memory every week and you
know who wants to spend money on those
things so having multi-talented support
in your services can help you make it
run more efficiently you can do it at
the container level or you can do it at
the vm level it depends on how much
density you really want so all we want
here is to be able to have a notion of
tenant ID in the system and I our
unified way of propagating that tenant
ID throughout the system so this slide
is just a recap of the focus areas that
I just talked about so these are there
is areas we are evaluating and I expect
these to surface as jsr or set of jsr
that will be included in Java e8 and
some will go into Java e9 and how the
architecture picture might look like you
know so the
blue box in the middle that's the Java
Runtime that has all the api's that i
just talked about some from the existing
version of Java some new ones that we
are adding it probably will run on a
container runtime front ended by API
gateway and load balancer on the
right-hand side you have your data
stores or some shared services that you
know your services may be using on the
left you have you know some supporting
functions or tools that your environment
may be using so those of you who are
familiar with java ee you tend to look
at features in the form of j srs in
automatically in your mind you start to
map it so Java is java ee 9 is the most
recent version of e these are the set of
JSL which are already there and the ones
in the darker blue box these are the jsr
switch are going through major
enhancements to support some of the use
cases that i just talked about at the
bottom those orange two boxes on the
left hand side these are new jsr that
got added to eight and will continue to
invest there and the last two here
configuration and health check these are
the two new jsr s we are proposing to
add to java e8 let's look at the road
map so we are in the planning phase soon
enough we'll start to find some new j
srs and we would like to finalize java 8
by end of next year we should be able to
ship it by then subsequently a year from
then we would like to find a java e9 and
the work on java e9 will start right
away so it's not like once we are done
with the head then we start on ie9 and
that will help us you know finish those
on time so so far you've heard my
perspective on you know java ee or what
we want in the future of java ee now i
would like to hear from our elite
partners custom
when community from across the globe you
know what do they think of you know the
proposed set of features so let's have a
warm welcome for our elite guests
thank you for making time for being here
today I highly appreciate your time so
Benjamin you're from soon let me start
with you so you do some cool R&amp;amp;D right
you do some research on particles and I
heard you have a lab that spends like
seventeen miles is something that works
on tiny tiny particles second and
somewhere there there is java ee right
and what i just talked about it players
are all there so can you share with the
audience you know what does it mean to
you what are you looking forward to well
speaking in the context of Surinam we
are collaborating with over 600
universities and institutes all over the
world so the concept of federated
identities and talking to remote
identity providers is getting more and
more important so by having platform
provided AP is for providing for
standards like auth an open ID will
definitely be very useful in my opinion
also sign is operating its own
on-premise cloud and it also problems
provide support for docker images so by
yeah having the platform supporting this
kind of packaging it will I think it
will add a lot of flexibility to the
application development teams so I'm
looking forward to see this feature ship
and I think you're on a good way this is
great great news so next let me welcome
mr. Kazu murah from 4g to it's great to
have you here so you have been a partner
in java ee community for many many years
you also are ec member in a JCP you have
investment in your interest rate
application server so tell us you know
what role standards play or
compatibility you know how is that
important to you okay the first version
will be fitted to interstate application
server was released 1998 just three
years after gela was born and producer
has also have been a member since epa
lift committee since its inception since
that time auditor has a world to bring
java ee standard and technology to the
japan other countries while updating
interstates and now one of the most
important thing is that our customer are
is how to migrate the application to the
crowd in that sense that I might very
excited the new Java EE technology for
the crowd that you explained today and
with dole technology for the to
interface with proposed a new
application development model or the
crowd and I believe this will be able to
migrate the application to the crowd
easy with interstates thank you that's
great Johan you're the face of the
community here you know you have been
you played an instrumental role I would
like to hear from you you know what do
you think the community will think of
the proposed roadmap and where you would
like to see it go yeah thanks I'll in
terms of technical content i think the
areas that you mentioned the programming
model the packaging api's to access to
external services make lots of sense and
it would be great additions to the
current java ee platform and i believe
that the community agrees that it's
important to attempt to standardize them
why well for example with a balloon our
focus is on driving mobile users to the
cloud using glue and cloud link which is
a service that automatically
synchronizes mobile users to back-end
services such as the Oracle cloud now
the more standardization in that area
the more developers can focus on their
core business functionality and the less
boilerplate code they have to write for
accessing external connectors and so so
it's important to standardize this but
it's gonna be a difficult task it's very
ambitious especially the timeframe and
challenging but I believe we can do it
and one of the reasons I believe in it
is because while you mentioned the JCP
and we have the JCP that will help us in
the JCP Oracle can work together with
the community and with other initiatives
in order to standardize these important
areas so we're looking very much forward
to work on this together in an open and
a transparent way that's great so you
touched upon aggressive nature of the
schedule I am counting on you I'm
counting on the community members you
have to help us you know to get there
it's all about collaboration and
community effort once we are there I
have no doubt that you know we will not
be able to deliver so let's do it next
let me introduce mr.
murakami sent from hitachi you also have
a significant investment you have an
application server Kozma Nexus so you
tell us you know where do you see value
in the Java EE platform and what value
you see from some other proposed
features that i just mentioned today
thank you for inviting me statute to San
Francisco and uh we are very pleased to
be here and I like to a zombie harvest a
chi we are very excited to hear about a
new direction of Jabba ie8 until I
statue is a social innovation company
and one of our key technologies causing
Nexus application server and the our
cousin next user application server uses
customers will be very happy with the
new direction and uh now with the move
of Jabba e8 towards cloud on mark
microservices it will be possible for
customers maintaining the existing
investment and they can now move to the
new cloud and Michael service era so it
will be a great helpful our business and
it will be a great pleasure for that
these IT technologies ok so the steam of
cloud and microservices it's in line
with your business objectives and where
you seeing your customers go it's
awesome ok thanks ok Marcus welcome to
ja one thank you for making time so I
hope you have a large and complex ERP
system that build on Java EE so what
part of the Java Enix proposal you find
exciting for you and your customers well
a lot actually but in the short term
business to business collaboration
between our customers and their partners
is growing very rapidly and managing
third-party access using enterprise
directories is becoming too complicated
to these days we also start seeing you
need to
expose certain erp functionality to
individuals and of course those
individuals would expect to be able to
use their online accounts so we need
support for standards like open ID
connect to be able to provide secure
token based access making IFAs
applications more accessible so we're
really looking forward to that and we're
happy to see that as part of your
proposal slightly longer term there's a
lot of the functionality that you've
shown here today that makes perfect
sense to us awesome yeah I could imagine
you would care about the security yeah
okay next let me introduce mr. cushion
away welcome to Java 10 you also have
investment in Java EE you have an
application server ya booty X and you're
seeing some trends in your customer base
so tell us how that's aligned with the
Hawaii next and what you find more
exciting from your customers perspective
okay thank you for keeping me up me to
chance to talk to this way energy will
come as the announcement I think proper
direction for java ee is to extend to
kannada capabilities including external
support for micro services and the
countenance this direction is consistent
with the focus area of energy and lots
of energy customers who start
implementing lots of softwares on the
crowd so we are looking for the seeds at
speaks different implementations and the
kissa kids very soon great thank you I
give me much yep Alan so good to see you
again so you are a financial institution
right and I'm assuming you will also
care about security features in addition
to that anything about containers or
other features that I talked about
anything resonates more than others for
you yeah definitely and today or will we
have been using J for many years and
today we are running multiple
applications within the same cluster
that's within the same jvm and and that
works fine as long as the applications i
will behave
looking at paradigms like microservices
and continuous delivery the number of
deployments will increase and so will
the frequency of the deployments of
applications and that requires a
different level of autonomy and that's
why the future je applications in
nuclear is going to live inside docker
containers destined to be distributed
and balanced across clouds the end goal
being a competitive and cost-effective
infrastructure that allows us to scale
capacity proportional to the business
activity level and so I believe that's
really going to help you can it stay the
preferred financial partner for
homeowners in Denmark that's awesome
thanks okay um now next shinichi or
cower from compo japan necessary until
you are in insurance business you have a
large and complex application you have
thousands of developers working on it
and I heard that you migrated from a
legacy application to Java e so tell us
how that's working and what are you most
excited about you know in the java ee
eight or nine roadmap okay you know
somebody upon is a one was a resist p +
OC insurance company in Japan and the
headquarters of Tokyo and then now we
have a huge size of a cover application
done and the two days of a course that
we need to achieve the open platform so
lastly i joined java one here and the
discussed with many experts and also
including us analysts speculate and i
confirmed to use e74 this course asleep
at home so our pop my my point is to
first one reads finish from industry
system you know this is a very very
confirmed we need to confirm how we
proceed our future so strong bender
support is mandatory for us and the
second point is micro services
in the near future we need to sift our
architecture to Michael's services and
the e seven eight nine we usually
continue to use this architecture so are
you team we need to have a high
expectation to support our business no
person my team if I sitting here high
expectations listen thank you so thank
you can keep this um so looks like the
common theme is that you will care about
compatibility portability you are moving
towards container based deployments
microservices more and more in senior
data center so overall I think the theme
of java e next in the proposed feature
set is resonating well so it's great
thank you again for being here let's
give a round of applause for our guests
someone is texting me here I'm sorry I
was not expecting this so looks like
there are some developers who need to
see more code and unfortunately I didn't
have slides to cover more code but I
cannot decline requests from developers
so I care for you so let me see what I
can do some telepathic connection with
my colleague you see a BG widget kamar
if you're there please step out hey you
made it well thank you thank you busy
I'm glad you're here I hope you brought
some slide something that you can show
you would like to level is laptop here
and accidentally but accidentally I like
I like I so burn it up and see what we
have bring I've been told that we are
also running a little bit short on time
so I want to get right to the code and
let's switch very very quickly and you
know it's a very straightforward
application you go see this application
this is trying to get a wish list and
really what I was going to show which
I'm going to get to right here is that
how we are going to simplify a
development of reactive code and then of
course let's go quickly switch how you
go deploy this to a Oracle cloud Hawaii
console I really apologize that I do not
have time but for those of you who are
going to come into the Java one booth we
can show this demo to you okay so thank
you yeah we will have more sessions
under the booth
all right title just to summarize so
Java EE you know remains healthy and
vibrant it's very widely adopted the new
theme for Java is you know cloud in
micro services we are embracing reactive
programming model so it will be
introduced throughout the platform and
we are extending the benefits of
Portability and standards to this new
paradigm of how you write applications
and we have a broad community support
around it I would highly encourage you
to get involved you know we are
transparent so when we get on the expert
groups please do sign up help us shape
the future of Java EE we also have a
survey that we are rolling out so you
know take some time please provide your
feedback you know we want the platform
to be relevant to you to your business
and there are some additional sessions
if you need more technical information
so i encourage you to go attend those
and with that I would like to wrap up
this keynote thank you for being here
today we have a great show an exciting
agenda that's lined up for you and now
go out have fun have some beer mingle
with your developers and your friends
thank you thank you so much for being
here
