Javed Mohammad here at the article dev
life and I have as my guest today
Franklin pious did I pronounce that
reasonably right yep okay annerose's
correct of it okay who's the senior
principal product manager based out of
düsseldorf right here in Germany
so Frank welcome thanks for having me
thank you for coming so I'm really
excited about your presentation today
when are we talking about chatbots and I
was just looking at the description that
was in the program and is interesting
that you actually had a quote in there
from war games yeah and in fact I just
went back and Google's it on YouTube
this because I remember it was a very
interesting film so it's interesting how
times change and right we kind of come
full circle with all of the things going
on with North Korea and some of those
right but kind of going on there so just
a you a science fiction film well now I
just happen to be old enough to know
that movie and you know as I think men
can always had kind of envisioned
artificial intelligence to assist people
in their jobs or provide them services
and that movie came to my mind when I
was preparing for a conference and then
it happened to be your conference here
though I'm not showing that movie in my
talk I just used that as an example and
yeah as you said 30 years after the
movie we have the technology in place
and now we can reach aunt to machines
okay so those are mentioned I think I
was going to talking to Reggie Lewis
earlier who did the keynote so I think
he had to give a small demonstration of
a chat Bob in this case it was like
trying to get buying tickets for the
Golden State Warriors and right and they
kind of did because the conversation
proceeding from there so just kind of
gives a backdrop about whether we add in
the life cycle of a chat bar right yeah
so actually Reggie's gave the typical
American pitch which is sports and beer
so I'm going a little bit deeper into
the technology so I'm not just
presenting on chat but of course I will
use chatbots will give my opinion of
course because there's a lot of people
that write about chat boards but I think
opinion really matters what are the use
cases when is it good to have a chat bot
when is it better to have a mobile
application so I cover that in my
presentation as well and then I go a
little bit more into the details of
machine learning artificial intelligence
I go into programming a chat bot how do
we do that on the Oracle platform
so what registered was kind of
scratching the surface of what my talk
is so it's kind of a warm-up that he did
do it and again I'm not asking to kind
of think of this as kind of over the
trailer for your presentation so but it
just gives a little sneak peek into that
one who talked about things up cases but
it does make sense to go over the chat
pod of the cases where perhaps the probe
it's okay for mobile operation so how do
you kind of discern between what makes
sense where yeah so the easiest way to
put that is that if you think about the
TAF the duration of the task that you've
trying to complete and then of course
the audience that you want to reach so
there's a two different criteria of
whether you want a mobile application or
if you wanna have a chat bot so let's go
with the time spend so if you have a
task that really lasts for five six
seven minutes then probably you need to
have a richer UI than the chat pod the
chat bot really is kind of an
interaction between a user and a service
just through the conversation interface
because that's all that it is it's just
an API in interface to an application
now the second is if you're a business
or if you have a business and you have
loyal customers
you know those customers are very likely
to download your mobile application so
you can give them additional services
it's just a quick thing for for an
answer however if you're dealing with
young customers those young customers
they are living their own world and this
world is dominated with messaging apps
yeah so if you if you go with public
transportation you sit there you see
what they're doing they're not chatting
they're just kind of typing texting all
the time so it's a different audience
that you want to reach and that is the
way the use case would come in also in
the keynote we had it that they say it
owner actually they talked about API
first development now this is already
comes down to so in the past you build
the user interface and then for that
user interface you just deployed it now
today you build the functionality as new
and then yoo-hoo as many interfaces to
it as you can so that could be a web
application or application or a chatbot
map so Chapel is just another channel
into your business okay so what I cannot
go from what you shared is it's both
duration or time and the audience
accounts in terms of what which-which me
you kind of sway right yeah it also has
to do with what many people bring us an
argument that people don't want to
install too many applications I don't
know how many applications you have on
your mobile I only have the absolute
minimum of what I recognize I'm tough to
say where personality I guess maybe so
related to ball games yes and basically
this means competition yeah there's a
lot of applications out there in the App
Store's so how do you manage that your
application will be downloaded loyal
customers is one way to do it but if you
want to reach out to customers that you
don't know that you don't have yet then
the easiest way would be to meet them
where they are and that is all on a chat
application yeah I think one of the
things that Reggie tests upon in his
presentation was that just like from for
me to come here for each airline you
know you don't really care it kind of
becomes very cumbersome to download each
Airlines up just because all you want to
do is just check in exact oh it's so I
think being able to consolidate it
through artificial intelligence and
messenger and all of these things can be
certain questions like which Moore says
my departing flight delayed so why do I
want to open up another a mobile
application for that no reason for that
so that is what a service that you can
provide on the mobile channel but others
as well like booking a hotel room
cancelling a hotel room why not because
these are kind of one two three stampede
kind of actions so doesn't require a
large interaction with a mobile
application together and then as you go
you're gonna be going deep into this in
your presentation so how does kind of
Oracle play into this part of it good
that you ask
yeah well Oracle builds a cloud service
that allows you to build as many chat
BOTS as you want and everything is kind
of predefined for you so all of the
artificial intelligence all of the
machine learning stuff so you don't have
to learn this by heart you don't have to
code to API for that this is all
provided and you
focus on the code that matters and not
more so you just build the interaction
that you want and everything else is
provide for Oracle and we're looking for
this year to release that cloud service
and then you just sign up to the cloud
service and you build your chat pods and
it just get you going okay Frank so it
sounds like a very exciting presentation
just for the people who are here what
time is your presentation it's 10
minutes past 2:00 p.m. 10 minutes past
2:00 p.m. so you right after lunch
right over here grab your lunch and
check out thanks presentation yeah thank
you thanks thank welcoming to join thank
you so much for coming by and thanks for
having me again and all the best for the
presentation Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
