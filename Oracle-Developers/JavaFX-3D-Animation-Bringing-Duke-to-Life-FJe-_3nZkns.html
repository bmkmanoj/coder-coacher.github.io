bringing Duke to life I'm John I'm an
interaction visual and 3d designer at
Oracle let me just go ahead and switch
I'll show you more the chest stuff later
but before we go into the presentation
this is just the standard disclaimer so
let me start off with a little bit of
backstory so my current role at Oracle
is as an interaction visual designer I'm
currently working on Java SE commercial
enterprise products but previously like
looking back about eighteen years I was
an early contributor user of the my
animation software and then I studied
animation at the UCLA film school and
then I worked at Disney Animation as a
character technical director on Chicken
Little Meet the Robinsons American dog
before it became boat and Brother Bear
and then I worked at DreamWorks
Animation on How to Train Your Dragon
and Shrek Forever After and while I was
at DreamWorks working on Dragons I got a
call from a colleague at Son and he said
hey you want to join a 3d animation
research project that son and I told him
what are you talking about son doesn't
do any animation but he convinced me
after a while at first I said no but
yeah we worked on a pretty cool research
project which started in 2008 that's
back back when Sun was Sun Microsystems
and basically we were able to import a
whole bunch of animation from Maya and
drag and drop it and run it real time in
this interactive 3d engine and it never
got released it was just like a research
project but we learned a lot from it
and
and they asked me at the end of 2010 Oh
would you like to bring that over to
JavaFX at that time JavaFX didn't really
have any 3d it did have 3d transforms
but I said sure so one of the key pieces
that we brought over was the Maya
importer and then we soon used that for
the Java 1 2011 demo I don't know if you
remember that there was Jasper was up on
stage with a Kinect you can look it up
on YouTube and then in Java 1 2012 we
showed a shipping port and I may show a
little bit later and then javelin 2013
so last year's Java Mon keynote demo we
showed the Duke 3d chess animated so
this is kind of the back story behind
some of the 3d work from my perspective
there's also other other histories but
this is as I experienced it so let me
give a little bit of background about
Java fix so Java fix is a
general-purpose 3d graphics library well
Java FEX 3d is a general-purpose 3d
graphics library for Java effects so
what is it and what isn't it so Java fix
3d leverages the 2 D UI capabilities of
Java fix it shares the same scene graph
with those 2d UI controls which is
actually very powerful I've been
following a couple threads on Twitter
and there's this one developer that
develops home automation software which
has to do moments but also 3d elements
and people were surprised how easy their
it was possible to switch beef into 2d
and the 3d it's because it's the same
scene graph all the controls all the 3d
geometry it's all in the same scene
graph what Java fix 3d isn't is it's not
a thin wrapper around open jail or
direct3d there are other
wrappers for that purpose like WebGL or
joggle you know things like that and
it's not a triple-a game engine so if
you want to make you know the latest
high-end racing game with you know as
you drive by the ocean you see the
ripples in the waves and it's not for
that purpose I think it is possible to
make casual games that are pretty cool
and chess is just one you know example
of that but one thing that I really like
about JavaFX 3d is that it's easy to
learn and use so I wrote this very
simple example called molecule a sample
app and it's really quite simple and you
know if I can write this anybody can
write this and start getting into 3d so
you can you know show the axes you know
and rotate move the camera around zoom
in zoom out and this is it's very very
easy to do you can check this out
you know just it's in the Oracle
documentation you can just google a
molecule sample app really easy to get
into so what I really like about it is
you don't have to write a lot of
low-level code it has a the scene graph
is very powerful it's very well designed
and it adapts very well to 3d ok okay so
what are some use cases scientific
engineering visualization Mission
Control inventory process visualization
mechanical cad visualization
architectural stuff 3d charting casual
games and guess what
these aren't abstract use cases these
are actual use cases that are in use
today using JavaFX 3d
so on the scientific end there's Michael
Hoffer there's eran zamorak for mission
planning Sean Philips at AI solutions is
writing software for NASA mechanical CAD
Michael Hoffer he actually has a very
cool a constructive solid geometry
toolkit that ties into JavaFX 3d so that
you could do boolean operations Union
intersection and difference and show
those results in JavaFX 3d it's actually
very very cool you had a chance to stop
by the demo grounds booth he had a booth
there and I believe he'll be giving a
workshop tomorrow on material related to
this so check it out and then
architectural Jose he's showing
historical structures and JavaFX 3d 3d
charting we showed at the Java 1 2011
keynote demo and I think Sauron has some
as well and casual games 3d chess is one
example and Jose's leap motion demo is
not really a game in and of itself but
there's already been a lot of discussion
about how this could be used for you
know gaming applications even and yeah
he's got this running in Java FX 3d so
these aren't abstract kind of
pie-in-the-sky use cases these are
actual examples where Java effects 3ds
being used today so yeah let me just go
ahead and switch screens and play a
little bit of the chest demo from last
year to kind of refresh your memory or
if you haven't seen it before to show it
to you yeah so this is all running in
JavaFX 3d there's no external graphics
libraries there's no but this all runs
in the same scene graph as all the
controls yeah that's what I really like
about it so this
make a couple moves here so just let you
know my role on this was to do the 3d
modeling the 3d animation I think I can
probably count the number of lines of
code I wrote that's probably one hand oh
you know what this doesn't have
validations so I just had black move two
times in a row but yeah so the people
who worked on this demo
Jasper pots of course and then Alex
Kuznetsov and also an intern Alex Lee
who did a lot of great work with
subdivision surfaces which I'll get into
in a little bit so let me just make a
couple more moves let's see here so when
we were showing this at the keynote last
year we had it connected to a server and
the server validated all the moves and
all that kind of good stuff and I kind
of know Alex Kuznetsov took out that
server validation stuff so it's not
going to UM you know tell you if you're
doing something that's not quite right
so I think I'm think two moves in a row
and it's perfectly fine with that so
it's more fun in a way let's see
I'm just gonna make some very bad moves
just to show you some of the animation
so the Queen's gonna take a pawn it's
just to show you the Raygun and let's
see let's have oh yeah didn't finish it
oh so that's one example where yeah we
didn't validate to move he can't really
move like a knight but it's fine with
the animation side of things okay so
enough fun for now well show more of
this later okay okay so I'm going to
talk about two pipe lines today so one
is the animation production pipeline so
this is what the artist deals with when
creating content for JavaFX 3d and then
there's the animation data pipeline so
how animation data goes through all the
code to make it run and there are some
similarities and there are some
differences which I'll highlight later
so what are the components of the
animation production pipeline now in in
animation we have a concept of at least
in animated film production we have a
concept of front end and back end so
front end deals with everything from
modeling to animation and then back end
deals with like lighting and shading
rendering compositing so I'm not going
to talk about the back end today here at
all this is all front-end so this deals
with them all the way from modeling to
animation so what are the pieces there's
modeling 3d geometry typically you start
with polygons but then you want to make
it look better with subdivision surfaces
which I'll tell you about in a little
bit and you need to build a
transform hierarchy for 3d animation we
call this a skeleton or you know a joint
hierarchy and then you need to connect
that geometry to your transform
hierarchy to your skeleton and that
involves 3d geometry skinning or
parenting to transforms and then when it
comes to animation you want to animate
but you don't want to have to specify
the animation value on every single
frame if you don't have to sometimes you
have to if the animation is really
really wacky but if there's um if you
can take advantage of continuity and
acceleration and deceleration then you
want to use something like tangent
interpolators so here's what the
animation production pipeline looks like
I've kind of simplified it but this is
basically the components we'll be
talking about ok so how do you model
geometry so there are a number of 3d
modeling tools out there and some of
them are very expensive and very nice
and some of them are free and very nice
and I thought I'd highlight that because
blender is one of those ones that are
free and it's also very a very good
package I I like it myself for modeling
you know and then there's other packages
which will cost about $3500 but that's
what the animation studios use I
actually gave a talk last year if you
want to look it up on modeling geometry
for JavaFX 3d so I won't get into a lot
of details here I'll just cover it
really briefly and what are some file
formats so FBX is a very popular
autodesk file format there's also colada
obj it opj is a very old format but it
is still used a lot and an STL for
stereo lithography 3d printing and of
course there's proprietary formats like
Maya and 3d studio max but these are
some of the major formats
and yeah let me talk a little bit about
3d viewer and I'll show it to you in
just a bit
so 3d viewer it's a viewer and JavaFX
for a 3d geometry skinning and animation
it's free open-source I'm pretty sure
it's BSD licensed and it has a lot of
useful functionality so if you're
interested in stuff you want to check
out 3d viewer and we it was written to
basically help us prepare JavaOne demos
so it's experimental rather than
production code so it's not super clean
we don't support every single feature of
every single file format but it has a
lot of useful code in there that if
you're interested in this stuff I think
you'll definitely want to check out so
it's part of open JDK and I believe the
source code even comes with the samples
when you download it for JDK eight but
if you want to contribute to it because
it's open-source you can do that as well
so the 3d viewer supports only a limited
number of important supports a subset of
Maya
it doesn't poor general polygons which
I'll discuss in a minute as opposed to
only triangles it does support triangles
as well obj only imports triangles not
general polygons 3d studio max someone
donated it but it's untested Dae colada
it's just a start we were hoping to have
someone help us write an open-source
clot importer but it didn't quite work
out because he moved companies but there
are other importers that are not part of
3d viewer that are really good one of
them is an FBX importer by Tessa Stein
aware and they've released all the
source code for it right here and
there's also 3ds Colada obj STL
importers by august levers morph at this
website and I don't know if he's
releasing source code but I'm pretty
sure he's compiled it for JDK 8
okay so triangles versus general
polygons ultimately all jobs
gets turned in triangles however keeping
geometries as polygons so not just
three-sided you know four-sided or you
know four-sided quads are generally the
preferred topology for geometry for
animation but yeah keeping it as quads
has certain advantages so let me show
you why
okay
okay so I'm gonna load a very simple
cube into 3d viewer and I'm gonna change
the fact on color different different
files have different colors in them so
okay so it's just it's just a simple
cube and this one happens to be loaded
as quads as general polygons now if we
turned off the load as polygons it's
going to load as triangles so here it is
loaded as triangles and you can see
there's a lot of extra information that
you might not be interested in like for
example you don't need to know that you
know before render time necessarily that
this triangle cuts across this way and
this one cuts across this way and so
what happens is in Maya you typically
keep it as quads so if I went over here
and I intentionally pre tessellated it
so now I've intentionally triangulated
it and then save it out make sure I
delete any extraneous history on this
scenes cube triangulated so when you
load it into 3d viewer oh by the way did
I mention this this is 3d viewer this is
our JavaFX 3d application that we've
open-sourced which is also very useful
and it has a lot of useful code in there
and it's all free
but let's load the one that we've
triangulated okay well it triangulated a
different way than that's that's pretty
typical but the problem is when you want
to start subdividing it those triangles
start getting in the way so what is
subdivision so subdivision you've all
seen spines before if you use
illustrator if you've used flash you've
seen splines before our splines help you
get a nice continuous curve or a nice
continuous surface from just a few data
points so Catmull Clark's subdivision
surfaces as a generalization of that
idea and it gives you a lot of power
over your surface to give you a very
smooth continuous surface when you want
it with very little data points so if
you want to look up the paper that
originally started it was back in 1978
and what's interesting is they discover
this in 78 it didn't start to really
become used in the animation industry
until the 90s yeah basically until the
90s and in the 2000s it really took off
but it's it's wonderful it's a wonderful
surface representation so let me show
you what this looks like
subdivided when it's already triangles
oh let me load it be sure to notice
polygons if you want to learn to those
polygons so even though it's
triangulated I'm still wanting to learn
at this polygon so I can subdivide it
okay
so now I'm stopped dividing it hmm it's
introduced a lot of complex topology now
it's not too bad but let's see what it
looks like if we subdivided it with so
this is our cube that doesn't have the
triangles well we subdivided the
topology makes a lot more sense it's a
lot more ordered well I think it makes
more sense let's take a look at the
other one so let's take this back down
unsub divided let's bring it in
triangulated so it has all these extra
triangles so when you subdivide it yeah
it's not as it's not as clean you see
and then it starts looking a little bit
lopsided and it's kind of interesting
but let me show it's shaded it may not
be what you want on the other hand if
you go with the cube when you subdivide
it and it's subdivided more it's a lot
more ordered so it just organizationally
in terms of the flow of the lines it's a
lot more clean if you don't triangulate
it before you need to so what if like
you don't want it to basically become
curved so quickly you know for example
let's say you do want kind of curved
edges around the corners and stuff like
that but you don't want to turn into
like a blob then what you do with some
different surfaces is you can either add
more resolution or crease the edges if
you have a more advanced implementation
in this implementation we just add more
resolution so this is when you subdivide
this it keeps the shape along the face
is more so this becomes very important
and modeling see chess pieces okay so
let me show you some chess pieces but
first let me give you some background
information so Duke was designed by Chow
pal rang back in the 90s and james
gosling I was really happy to find that
he was into 3d modeling as well he does
a lot of modeling and Lightwave so james
gosling modeled this character in light
wave and then when it came time for us
to do demos with Duke we realized this
is this is a good start I kind of like
the proportions a little bit better here
although this is just a flat image so I
kind of split the difference and I
remodeled it kind of halfway between
this and this and I also did a lot of
remodeling of the topology so if you
look at the legs for example there isn't
a lot of geometry to bend and deform the
legs like let's say you wanted to bend
his knee using this model it'd be very
difficult to bend the knee and yeah so
you know there are other places where
the topology can be redone to be more
applicable to general animation which is
what we needed for the Kinect demo and
also the Duke 3d chess demo so let me
show you some some of that geometry that
we used for the 3d chess demo
let's see
oh I just dragged and dropped him into
subdivision level 3 which is yeesh
that's a really high subdivision level
hold on it's fine for cubes but when you
subdivide due to level 3 it here I'm
gonna have to
yes please cancel
oops not that one
okay
okay let me back him up a bit
oh there are those polygons yes a dude
okay so there is our Duke it's just our
it's just the King doing a walk in place
and let me show you some of the geometry
that goes into it so if you look we've
added a lot more geometry for the knees
for example and all throughout the body
so he can deform the information is
something that's very important for
animation and so he looks kind of a
little how do you say he looks a little
bit blocky right and that's because this
is just showing the polygon version so
if you subdivide him this is what he
looks like
subdivided at level one so the JumpShip
becomes a lot more smooth out so all
those hard edges are gone so that's
that's the that's the key idea with
subdivision surfaces is that you model
with as low resolution as you can get
away with not lower than is good but you
model at a low resolution and this is a
pretty low resolution I mean it's more
resolution in the than the Duke model by
James Gosling but in terms of what you
see in animation it's it's a very
reasonable resolution but then you know
you let subdivision surfaces do all the
hard work of bumping up the resolution
for you to make everything look nice and
pretty and when your model you just
model in mind oh this is what its gonna
look like as a subdivision surface to
take advantage of that so that's what it
looks like and let me show you a few the
chess hats and see what they look like
not subdivided and then subdivided I'm
sure
yes this is 3d viewer it's free
open-source BSD license so you can grab
as much of this code as you want use it
in your application yeah I think with
the BSD license you could probably even
sell this but yeah anyways let's see
okay
the Brooke cat for example so like put
it back to subdivision level zero so as
you can see at something at a level zero
it's it's pretty blocky yeah you can see
the idea of it but it just feels a
little bit it feels like it has too many
hard edges this is what it looks like in
the wireframe but when you subdivide it
it looks like Oh looks like someone
spent a lot of time carving this with
ivory or you know whatever it has a much
nicer look now when I modeled it I
modeled this n in mind so I modeled
toward this in using this so all these
edges that you see here all these little
small ledges they are intentional
because they basically control how the
shape is going to subdivide but let me
just show you one more piece for the
sake of time I'll just let's see yeah
maybe like a pawn so this is already
subdivided but it looks kind of crunchy
you see it looks you know crunchy right
at the unsub divided but then and this
is what it looks like in wireframe but
then when you subdivide it it looks nice
and smooth you can subdivide it again
and I think we can get away with one
more you know and it's really nice and
smooth let's just take this back down to
zero so this is subdivision level zero
okay
so oh so model resolution and topology
matter for animation you don't want the
resolution too high leave that for
subdivision surfaces but you don't want
the resolution too low if the resolution
is way too low then there's no way that
knee is gonna Bend for example okay so
in order to animate a 3d model you need
to transform hierarchy to which the 3d
geometry is attached so the general term
for this part of the pipeline is called
rigging or character setup that's what
we call it in the animation industry and
rigging is a process of setting up your
3d model for animation to make it
movable it's kind of like if you've ever
seen any of those outtakes or not
outtakes bonus features of a stop-motion
animated film you'll see they have like
this armature inside of their puppet
this is kind of what's happening you're
building an armature for the puppet but
you're building it all inside the
computer so let me show you what that
looks like in practice
so the armature the skeleton the joints
or the bones there's where the
transforms are shown in this purple
color so this is the skeleton for Duke
these are the joints that are that drive
Duke so this is what the skeleton looks
like when it's animated so this is a
this is one part of the process that
people who aren't familiar with
animation overlook because they think oh
well if you have a 3d model why not just
make it move well it's just like our
bodies you know without our skeleton
we'd have a very hard time moving
similarly anything in the 3d world in
the computer graphics you know
3d world also needs a skeleton in order
to articulate so this is the skeleton
for Duke and then the skeleton is
attached to the skin so there you see it
it might be easier if I show this in
x-ray mode yeah there you go
so the process by which the skeleton is
attached to the skin
that's called skinning so
it's kind of funny because it's kind of
an overloaded term but skinning 3d
geometry - transforms is different than
CSS getting CSS skinning is very cool
it's just but it's just different then
it's getting 3d geometry so let me just
show you a really simple example in Maya
so we have here a very simple cube I'm
gonna just make it a little bit actually
instead of doing that all change the
width and I'll subdivide it along the
width
and let's say we have a skeleton inside
of here they're just recreate that
so we have a geometry here but it's not
gonna Bend by itself you need to make it
Bend somehow so one way to do that is to
attach this geometry to these joints
it's not gonna what's called binding the
skin and select the joints I'm going to
go ahead and bind it and what happens
after you bind it is when you articulate
this joint
let me showed it x-ray mode again is
that it'll Bend accordingly
dipper but one of the tricks is you need
to spend a lot of time adjusting the
weighting so every single vertex every
single vertex of this geometry is
weighted to these joints so for example
this one I think it should have almost a
100% weight to hear but it's probably
not quite and you can definitely tell
that these you know I'm not moving this
joint over here but a lot of these
vertices over here are moving so let's
figure out what's going on here
so we can select these vertices oops and
then we can go over here and we can say
hey oh nine you're 90% weighted to joint
one and then 10% way to join two but I
really want you guys to be 100% weighted
to joint one and now let's move this guy
and now these pieces at the end they're
not moving anymore in that weird way so
that in a nutshell is skinning and I
could drag and drop this into a 3d
viewer but it's not too interesting
example so I'll just skip that okay that
was simple skinning and I'll show you
there's not only do there's also Duke
but believe it or not so Joe Powell rang
also designed some character Duke BOTS
and he looks like this and so this
actually was an early design of Duke and
we took this guy and used him for
something else
we modified some of his proportions to
make it easier to articulate him in fact
what we did was we the news here we go
it's thinking I think it's think today
double-click on it oh here we go
yeah
full screen so this is Duke but of
course animated in Maya one interesting
thing here is this is running on a $35
Raspberry Pi so this is a screen capture
of JavaFX 3d running on a $35 Raspberry
Pi yeah which i think is it's kind of
neat what a $35 computer can do but this
particular drum treat the point I wanted
to make here is that this particular
geometry is parented rather than skinned
and the reason why you can't get away
with just straight parenting and let me
load up this file is because Duke but he
doesn't have any smooth deforming
surfaces like um like we humans do so
he's everything is very rigid so this is
his this is the Duke character Duke bath
character everything is rigid so there's
no need for him to have that smooth
skinning so what I'm trying to say is
skinning isn't always necessary if you
had very if you have very rigid
mechanical parts okay so let me show you
the the animation part of it let me just
go to this file over here so in
animation we have this idea of this
notion of key poses so
so if you don't have to and you know
sometimes it may be necessary but if you
don't have to you tend to animate what
are called keyframes oh thank you very
much so it instead of animating every
single frame you tend to animate the key
poses and then use interpolators to
interpolate the motion so what these
interpreters look like
that's not an interesting one let me
grab everything
okay there we go so that's those are all
the that's all the animation data for
that character and as you can tell
there's quite a bit but the the really
important point is that this animation
here it's let me show you one that looks
easier to see okay
this animation here it's it's
interpolated so these values there you
don't need to animate every single frame
which is indicated by these lines over
here the in-betweens are interpolated
using an interpolator which is actually
the tangent interpolator which I'll show
you a little bit of the code for in just
a bit so that's one of the points I
wanted to make is you animate the key
poses which look like this you know for
example and then the computer helps you
in between but one thing that you need
to be careful to do is to specify how
the tangents are set up you know let me
just keep going okay okay so let me get
into the animation data pipeline so this
is the more a technical part and this is
what it looks like in code so for the
animation data pipeline the difference
between this and the production pipeline
is that you know let me just show you
the difference so animation tended to be
the last thing you did in the production
pipeline but in the data pipeline it's
the first thing because it drives
everything so I wouldn't say that it's
the entire pipeline is reversed but it's
interesting how animation switches
places from last to first so in the
production pipeline you modeled your
character you built the joints you
skinned the job through the joints and
then you animated
this entire character in the data
pipeline the animation drives the
transforms which drives the skinning or
the parenting which then is subdivided
so here's the data pipeline yeah and
this is what it looks like in practice
like for example if you animated your
character in Maya you load your
animation and then the key thing is you
get your timeline if you looked inside
the code to get your timeline what you'd
see a lot of is this kind of stuff you'd
see a key value which is the value for
that attribute like let's say a rotation
of 45 degrees on your elbow you see a
keyframe oh that happens at frame let's
say 24 which is one second into the
animation but you also see this
interpolator which describes the
acceleration and deceleration in and out
of that key and that is what's really
important without that all your
animation would look very weird okay so
what happens when you press animated
timeline play when this timeline plays
properties are updated based on those
interpolators there aren't values at
every frame but just the way surfaces
are interpolated or you know animation
curves are interpreted splines
properties are updated and transforms
are animated and then for skinning
basically it takes a mesh it takes the
weights that determine how that mesh
relates to the joints and and basically
it it defines a correspondence for every
single vertex in your geometry how much
it's weighted to each joint and that
defines how the geometry moves and then
you have subdivision surfaces where that
geometry that you just skinned becomes
subdivided and it looks a lot nicer so
what happens when it's all
put together it looks
like Java fix it looks like this so this
is all that pipeline work put together
excuse me for just a second author just
step out for a minute I'll be right back
okay
sincerely apologize I've been a little
bit under the weather but so that in a
nutshell is a 3d animation and JavaFX 3d
and how we brought the chest Sky's chest
pieces to life so if you have any
questions feel free to go in and ask yes
okay so when we import the data we turn
all of those my animation curves into
tangent interpolators yeah it's right
inside the it's in the JDK it's not
anything that we added
yes so well wait you're I think you're
asking about is the Maya importer so the
Maya importer takes all the maya
animation data and converts it into
tangent interpolators huh
oh I would like to make these available
we haven't gone through the process yet
but it's something that I would be
interested in doing thank you for asking
yes yes uh yeah they're all related in a
way but yes so I I did study animation
at the ECOA film school and then I
worked in the animation industry so it
is yeah it tends to be more more visual
problem-solving and I'm I'm better at
visual problem-solving than looking at
code so it's it's a good fit for me
both so every single keyframe has an
intention in an out tangent and so when
you combine all this together from
keyframe the keyframe then you have a
continuous curve that describes the
motion that's that's correct well
currently since we support Maya obj
oddly enough 3d studio max I would say
obj is probably your best bet but in
that case you need to pre triangulate
your geometry probably since we don't
import general polygons uh-huh there in
the back
hmm yes oh I didn't hear the second part
of your question yeah so basically this
is the constructor for the skinning mesh
and oh thank you I keep forgetting to do
that yeah this is the constructor for
the skimming mesh it takes the priests
skinned mesh the weights per joint and
then the list of joints all the joints
and then basically some information on
the transforms at the time we bound them
well this is part of 3d viewer and we're
giving it away for free it's part of
it's one of the samples and OpenJDK all
the source code is free you can make
money off of it you know etc huh that is
correct
there are no quaternions involved here
quaternions do have their place but we
just didn't use them for this demo
yeah
yeah sure so you want to see 3d viewer
with Duke
absolutely okay let's bring over so this
is Duke walk cycle oh yeah sure thing
yeah oh no we don't show the skeleton it
would be a nice addition I would love to
see the skeleton in there but yeah we
don't show the skeleton right now the
skeleton you know in my need to see it
in 3d viewer we haven't implemented yet
oh yes yes the skeleton is still there
the skeleton is actually these joints oh
sorry
the joints that you see here the these
listed joints that's what comprises the
skeleton yeah right
whereas my sorry missed the lesson it's
here it's here you just it's in the
values of these arguments yes or you
could you could write an algorithmic Lee
without them importer as well you know
yes that that would be a good place to
study
uh-huh
right there's various algorithms to help
you with this like heat maps and stuff
like that that calculate like heat
fall-off from a bone you know for
example from a joint you know based on
distance or fluid there's even fluid
type algorithms that use like kind of
like fluid simulation inside of a
enclosed mesh and how that relates to
joints there's various algorithms to
help you you know figure out these
weights but yeah it is kind of an art
it's kind of magic but there's also
technical approaches as well
mm-hmm so you've mentioned two different
things constraints and like wind shear
which is simulation so in this
particular incarnation we have no
simulation in our prototype from 2008 to
2010 we had both simulation and
constraints but it's so much easier to
work faster in a prototype that you're
never going to ship that's purely
research that it is to put it into a you
know a working product so yeah we did go
quite far in our research prototype
which oddly enough was written in a mix
of Java and a fork of Java FX 1.0 JavaFX
script 1.0 so we won't even compile
anymore but it had a lot of these stuff
in there any more questions well thank
you so much for coming
feel free to ask me any questions
afterwards and enjoy the rest of your
Java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
