Oracle and today I'm going to talk about
Redis one of the benefits of all the
technical problem we had is that you
will not have to suffer from my bad
jokes so I will just give them and go
directly to this slide which is not
there anymore so anyway that slide is
the setup a statement from Oracle and
basically what it says is that you
shouldn't make any business decision
based on any forward-looking statement
that I could do today so you've been
warned
so this is the agenda so well yeah it's
there so anyway so this session is about
ready so today I'm going to talk about a
project that we had where we had to set
up ready in a highly available fashion
on top of bare metal cloud so we are
keeping a key some key requirements for
that project like a ability scalability
and so on so even though that project
was based on Oracle bare-metal cloud
what I'm going to talk about today apply
to any cloud provider so there's really
nothing specific about Oracle in my talk
today so I will first start by giving
you an overview of Freddie's just to
make sure that we have a common
understanding about release what it is
what it provides what it provides those
kind of things then I will talk a little
bit on how we can scale ready and you
will see that when we are scaling
readies well basically in ready scaling
and I availability are often things so
sometimes you just want to scale Redis
but you will see that at the end of the
day by doing that you will also increase
the availability of you already set up
so I will just discuss about the
features that are provided in Redis and
then I will kind of map those features
to what we have done so this session is
really about sharing some experience we
had setting up producing highly
available
and scalable fashion on top of the metal
cloud so ready anyone knows what ready
stands for no so ready stands for a
remote dictionary server it's an open
source project it's quite old I think
it's seven years old and it's widely
used so if we look at readies it's a
fashion memory cache the thing that is
quite unique about readies because there
are many in memory cache out there the
thing is that is quite unique about
tradition is that not only readies can
store key value pairs swing base but
traditions also support for a different
type of data structures like sets of the
setlist and so on so Redis is not your
typical in your cache where you just put
ring and you access them using a key you
can do way more than that ready strip
off is a replication so in Redis there
is this topology where you have a master
slave architecture so the master is
basically where you will perform the
expenses of this extensive operation the
right and then you will have at least
one slave one read replica to which will
delegate the rich the rich are obviously
faster than the right so with that basic
ID master slave topology we can treat
that in multiple other dimensions so for
example we can have one master and have
multiple slave we can have one master
that has a slave and that particular
slave can be the master of another slave
and obviously reddy's will end up the
replication between the master and the
slave so if you put something in the
cache into the master cache it will be
automatically replicated across your
different slave that's something which
is handled in a very French efficient
way by release itself so the idea of of
that is that you can basically go behind
the limit of one single server
so just by clustering so another way to
go beyond the committee's to use
replication so sorry I've just talked
about replication clustering is a bit
different so I
di DN clustering that is also supported
by already is you take a cash and you
can divide that cash into multiple
partition and you will use different
Redis instance to manage those partition
so in typical example you would have a
car that you split in two partition and
then you will have one master for
partition a and another master for
partition B and obviously you can
combine that with the master slave
topology so you would have to master for
each partition and each master would
have their own slave so partition sorry
clustering is useful to go behind the
limit of one single instance so you see
that by combining by Jiki replication
and clustering we can easily scale out
Reddy's and radius also support
assistant obviously everything happening
is memory but it's sometimes useful to
do a snapshot of your cache content for
multiple reasons if something goes wrong
for example it might be faster to just
use the content from that is that has
been stored into the disk there are
multiple approach to end out assistance
in ready so one is called our DB so
basically our DB is just a periodic
snapshot that is done to the disk so
every X seconds the complete cache is
dumped from memory to the disk
a different approach is called away iOS
stands for a pan only file so in AOF the
idea is that instead of dumping the
complete casually disk you will well
Redis will only write to the disk the
comment that has modified the cache so
you start from a well-known state of the
cash and then Redis will write to the
disk the comment that has basically
modify that that typical cache that
octopus cache sorry and then if you need
to restore that well you ask reduce to
take to take the snapshot and you will
basically we play automatically all the
commands to to get to the current state
of the cache so that something which is
handled by ready now there are pros and
cons to user DD / iOS actually
on your use case and your requirements
one thing which is quite important about
Redis is that releases by design an
eventual consistent solution so that
that means that it might happen that
sometimes if you read some data you will
not get the latest version of the data
so you will not get incorrect data but
you might get an older version of that
particular data that's something that
you have to keep in mind and for most of
the application this is a good-enough
approach so if you need strong
consistency then well you need to watch
out but for most of the application
eventual consistency is fine release
also support monitoring while it has out
of the box a lot of monitoring
capabilities so this is something which
obviously you need when it comes to
production so using radio some of the
mentoring tools you have you can have a
lot of stats about what is what is
happening between your ready set up so
getting stats about your application
process between the master and the
different place getting starts about our
your cache behave number of hits number
of misses and so on rest
whoops sorry rest so thanks for
registering logician protocol it's
basically the protocol that is behind
readies so if you look at released this
is a simple kind server solutions so
between the client and the server that
protocol that Fred protocol is being
used and if you look at the protocol
itself it's a very simple request
response protocol and the fact that
protocol that protocol is so simple as
lead to a lot of solution that are using
that protocol to basically implement
ready support so i've list a few of
those obviously we can use Redis from
Java go Python JavaScript Swift and so
on but if you closely there are
solutions like for example del C I'm not
sure is I'm gonna in the rooms to use
del C those days no or they are stuff
like for example fancy I know
do what countries but the world only
thing I can tell is that it hasn't seen
a fancy name but other than that so the
fact that we have a very desi protocol
as basically increase the adoption of
ready in those different type of
solution now let's talk about some of
the design choice that have been chosen
for readies I already mentioned eventual
consistency this is something that you
need to know obviously when it comes to
performance eventual consistency makes a
lot of sense just as a side note radius
also support what we call a very
intentional intentional inconsistency so
the ID so I told you about the fact that
you will have a matter whether well
where you will write and you will read
from the different place but it can
happen in some specific case that you
will want to write directly to a slave
in that case that might work if release
has been configured to accept those kind
of right but obviously the things that
you are doing in the masters or in the
slave cache will not be replicated I
think is it to the matter so at some
point in time you where you will have
some inconstancy so that's something
that might be used that might make sense
in some very specific scenarios another
design choice offer this is that it's a
single threaded application there little
reason for that one of the reason is
that given that release has very strong
performance requirements while it's
easier to write a highly performant
single threaded application than having
to basically having multi-threading
support to that application you
basically avoid a lot of potential issue
like contention locking and so on but
you might say okay this is single
threaded so that means that basically
the limit I will have is my TPU that is
true but we have already seen that we
can easily scale out
Ready's using for example the master
slave topology and in most of the case
if you look at reddit reddit is notice
isn't
never in fact cpu-bound radius either
memory bond I mean if you have a very
big cash you will basically need a lot
of memory and release might also be a
network bond so if you have large cash
and you D you need to do a lot of
replication or you see we consume a lot
of network resources but the CPU itself
will never be the hard limit that you
will hit something else that is quite
important in reddit is the security
level that we have by default by default
Redis is not secure so that means that
for example the the traffic between the
client and the server doesn't go over
TLS you can from the client connect
directly to the server without giving
any password those kind of things so
this has been done again to achieve
either formants and the basic assumption
is that you will always use Redis in a
trusted environment so you would have a
trusted client running in a trusting
environment connecting directly to your
server so that means that obviously you
won't need to a secure connection
between the client and the server for
example obviously if that's not the case
that's something that you would have to
handle by yourself and their solutions
to do that but that's something that you
have to keep in mind
by default Redis is not secure having
said that they are improving a little
bit for example since a few version
radius now start by defaulting what what
is called protected mode protected mode
means that you can still connect to
Redis in clear but a radius will only
only accept connection from the loopback
interface if you want to accept
connection from a different IP you need
to explicitly configure ready to to
allow that
so I already talked about the rest
protocol if you look at that protocol
that they are set there is a set of
comments 70 comments more or less to
work on readies those comments are can
be used to work on the cache so to put
stuff on the cache to work using the
different data structure that are
provided by Redis
so I've already mentioned that obviously
ready support string but it's also
support list of strings as tables set
and socket set set and stuff that says I
are very interesting so a set is a
typical set where you could you can
perform operations such as intersection
Union difference and so on in a highly
efficient way so this is something that
is widely used the idea with softest
softest set is that basically you will
attach to the key some kind of score so
for each key you will have a floating
point value that will be a sign and by
doing that you will be able to do
operation like for example give me the
top and element of that particular set
or from that set give me the element
within that particular range and again
you would have the ability to do that in
a very efficient manner
so clearly the different data structure
that are provided by a Redis is one of
the key features that makes ready shine
ready to pop transaction so the idea
with transaction is that we can define a
transaction pipeline so using the multi
command we will basically tell Redis
okay the so this is the multi command so
that means that all the comments that
are coming after the multi command needs
to be executive in in a serial and
atomic fashion and radius will ensure
that during the operation of that
transaction pipeline no other clients
will be able to interrupt that execution
and Ready's also supportive of site
scripting so you should compare that to
well more or less to stock procedure so
the idea with server-side scripting is
that we will use those view our
scripting to basically define a set of
commands that will be executed on the
server side so on on reddit itself so
it's not
back and forth between the client and
the server is just from the client we
trigger the execution of a script that
will be fully run on the backend side
Ready's also support publish and
subtract mechanism something like we
have in GMS so it's very similar so it's
very key we have a consumer we have a
consumer and producer so the producer
will produce something in the case of
Reddit it's called pretty sure so the
publisher will publish something to a
specific channel and for that specific
channel we'll have one or more a
subscriber that will consume that
payload in an asynchronous way so
basically to do that
Ready's provide like 70 commands and as
soon as you start using Redis you will
see that you will see that the comments
are very simple very easy to grasp so
what are the use case for ready cashing
reddit is widely used to improve
performance of application so for
example for WordPress so what what is a
blog platform there is a specific
plug-in that is used to push into reddit
cache full render page so that when a
user comes to that specific blog the
rendered page is coming directly from
the catch it doesn't have to be rendered
rendered again
reddit is used for storing a session
information for web application so we
have a user the user has looked at
different items that you might want to
buy we are putting that in your readies
cache to do something based on the
interest of the user those kind of
things
the next thing that Redis is widely used
for is a little bulb so little ball is
basically anything that needs some kind
of counting so think about for example
some Facebook games where you want to
know what are the top 10 scores or what
are the top 10 user of the last 24 hours
those kind of things or think about some
website where a user at the ability to
upload or download article or
questions and answer like we have on
Stack Overflow so this is a very good a
very good use case for ready video about
election or counting pub/sub I have
already mentioned that so the idea with
the paps that capability of Redis is
basically that you will have one
application one services that will push
some kind of payload some kind of even
to a specific channel and other services
will use that to to be trigger when
something happening so this might be a
way to handle some some kind of
communication some kind of triggering
between two services for example time
series analysis that's another use case
for ready so the idea with time series
analysis is that we will put in in Redis
a series of event over a certain period
of time so over a certain period of time
we will put although even that happening
and then afterwards or more or less in
real time we would do some analysis
based on what has been put there so an
example would be a stock forecast
application so based on all the exchange
I and lows and average and the volumes
of the last 24 hours so you are putting
that all those event in Redis you would
do some kind of forecast to try to
predict what the market is going to look
like tomorrow for example those kind of
things and last use case for radius test
management test management is basically
using another list so a Services is
putting a task into a list and it's
picked up by another services this is a
bit different than pub/sub the ID is the
same so those are the typical example
that we can use ready for and if we look
at the most popular one it's really
caching and kneadable elections those
are really the type of scenario where
Eddy's shines so this was a short
reddish intro now let's talk about
deploying Redis
into and Contin eyes environment so we
had that project where we had to do that
and we had multiple girls will tip well
multiple requirement that we wanted to
achieve through that project i evil wiki
was really key so we wanted to have
readies in your highly available fashion
so if something goes wrong we wanted to
we want to make sure that we can recover
quickly from a failure ideally we want
to do that in a seamless fashion so it
should be a stronger at as transparent
as possible scalability was another
important aspect so we want to make sure
that we could easily scale our set up
because we had noah well we we have some
idea on how it might be used but we
wanted to make sure that if we need to
quickly scale that we have the ability
to do that so that's why we went for
that massive scale architecture I will
detail details that a little bit later
on
now obviously then CPU was a key factor
as well so we wanted to make sure that
we were leveraging the resource that we
had as best as we can so that's why we
went to a Content ID environment title I
availability we also wanted to have some
kind of feature built in that allows us
to reduce the downtime when we are going
to agree the set up because we knew that
we wanted to upgrade that set up quite
quite often so the idea that we wanted
to provide new features as fast as we
can
multiple times a week sometimes multiple
times a day so that's why we we wanted
to make sure that if we are upgrading
our set up it should be a seamless a
seamless and a transparent as possible
and we also know that a failure can
happen so if you know if in one of the
upgrade process something goes wrong we
want it to have Eureka to quickly roll
back so that's something that we had to
also consider
so some of the implement implementation
choice that we had we did we obviously
use docker containers we use missus
marathon the reason why we have used
mrs. marathon is because one of the
artisan project was already using using
that data missus marathon so we thought
that it would be beneficial to stick to
missus marathon but clearly we could
have used something else something else
like kubernetes for example for the NATO
I think this is more details but we use
bridge instead of network overlay we had
some issue with a network of LA so we
stick to bridge and it works fine one of
the things that we have used extensively
is a capability which is provided by
Redis which is called Sentinel so
Sentinel is the features provided by
reddish it's basically an Arabic process
built next to Redis and we will see how
it works this is something which is
quite nice so not only it provides
harvick between your Redis cluster but
something is also able to do a failover
if something goes wrong in your Redis
cluster one of the other requirement
that we add is that from a client point
of view we wanted the setup to be as
transparent as possible so the only
thing that the client knows is a one IP
@ v IP of the master and it's holding
that that IP is the only IP that the
client needs even to talk to the slave
even if something goes wrong so if we
have the master that is failing and it's
another master is picking up it doesn't
matter the kind only one IP to take care
of so multiple dimension to scale ready
so the first one it's basically scaling
in the box so we just increase the cash
side it's pretty obvious so we are just
getting from inside the server itself
the second approach is using multiple
replicas so it's basically this master
set up master slave a topology where we
have one master
which is Anna lling the right operation
and we have run one or multiple slaves
to deal with the rid and then on the
right we have this approach where we are
is in fashioning so in this case we are
split we have divided the caching to two
partition P 1 and P 2 not only that we
are using replica Soviet replicas so you
see that p1 as one master and has a
slave and the same is true for p2 it has
one master and it has multiple flip so
you see that Redis allows basically you
to scale in multiple dimension so for
our project we decided to go with the
middle solution it was easy to implement
I need we think that provided all older
it it provided all the benefit that we
wanted to get so we don't we didn't go
to the partitioning without that maybe
it would have been a little bit too
costly to plan on versus the benefit
that we would get so this like they pick
the underlying infrastructure so we are
using measures and marathon we have one
method leader and two measures slaves
which are kept in eye level in Ali
available fashion by a replicated
zookeeper this is a pretty standard
approach so this is well this is
important to know that the knowing
selector is running on Meadows
and marathon but as I already mentioned
we could have chosen a different
solution like kubernetes so this like is
quite more interesting
so it basically shows our Sentinel in
Redis works so you see that we have four
readies box OS one two three four you
can ignore us for four from now it
doesn't really matter so you see that we
have us one which is the matter and O's
two and three which are slave of aswan
what you see in black is very key
the traffic that is the the network that
is used to replicate between the master
the cash put a different place you see
that this this also goes to us for
because house for is a slave to so we
have the reddish kind which connect to
the already set up through the floating
IP so the floating IP is that unique
that unique address that the client
knows so it connects to the floating IP
to the master and it will use that so it
will basically query the master to know
where are the slaves and then the matter
we give specific IP for the slave but
again everything is done through the
master so slave discoveries that ship
through the master you see that OS one
two three have Centinela so sentinel is
a specific what is up process you see
that we have a specific network for that
so the role of the sentinel is basically
to to make sure that everything is
running fine
so sentinel will basically monitor your
complete ready set up now you might see
that all four doesn't have sentinel the
reason is quite simple if something goes
wrong the different sentinel that we
have will have to make some decision and
to make some decision they need to
achieve a poram so we always need to
have an odd number of sentinel to make
sure that if something goes wrong that
quorum can be achieved so that's why
iost four dozen have a sentinel it
doesn't ask for is not involved involved
if something goes wrong now if we map
that set up to our bare metal
infrastructure that's what we did so
basically we took them the same setup
and we have used three different
availability domain to so a valley
availability domain are basically a
domain that has no dependence we between
the other domains so if something goes
wrong between the availability domain
three well availability domain one and
two will not be impacted so this is yet
another way to achieve to increase the
availability of our setup so with
that setup entry ability available ghido
main you see that our clients have is in
average domain one keep in mind the
traffic is not secure between the client
application and ready so it has to be in
a dressing environment or if it's
outside we would have to secure traffic
in our case we are safe because we are
in a in our trusted environment you see
that app is connecting our app is
connecting to to the master through the
flip I P and from there it can get it
can discover the different slave that we
have I will skip this this in the
interest of time so just keep in mind
that we have used bridge network more
detail so what happen if something goes
wrong so the all the sentinels that we
have we basically check the chat among
themselves to say okay I think that
something is wrong with that matter and
they will all have to agree that indeed
that specific master is not reachable
anymore so that's why we need a quorum
then once they see they decide that one
of the Sentinel will be elected as the
leader to basically and all the failover
so we will have a sentinel that will be
elected as a leader that leader will
have to pick a new slave and basically
promote that place to be the new master
so that slave is becoming the new master
and The Sentinel will have to
reconfigure your reconfigure all the
different slaves to make sure that they
are aware that we are switched from the
old master which is done to the new
master which what used to be a slave
then one this is done the IP so the
floating IP will be switched to the new
to the new master so this is basically
how we achieve I ability in our ready
setup we are leveraging a sentinel to
handle the failover in a relatively easy
manner
now we can also use that approach to
deal with the upgrade so for example if
we need to a grid to new matter what
what are we do well we deploy a new
container so that container is a slave
will be a slave of the existing master
so we wait that the replication is
happening
once the we have to unplug unplug the IP
from your master we let the replication
happen and then we first we will force a
failover basically so we want we will
force the new master to be we yet to be
the new master intact and then once this
is done the new master is promoted as
the well yeah it's promoted as a new
master we will have to flip the IP to
make sure that it's it's reachable I
know you see the different slave will
also know that the new master will be
aware of that new master promotion we
can also do holding upgrade of slaves so
the idea is that we bring a new slave
those slave will be automatically we get
the replication from the master
automatically once this is done and only
once this is done we can bring down the
or save the ID that we need to make sure
that if the do the upgrade to the new
slave goes wrong for whatever reason we
have the ability to quickly roll back so
that's why we want to shut down the old
slave a very at the last minute and when
this is done obviously we can bring on
the old master
so ready several ability so we've seen
that we have multiple ways to achieve
availability in Redis first we are
achieving availability and addenda line
infrastructure so we are using this
marathon using a replicated zookeeper we
are also using different available
domain then moving up in the stack we
are using a massive slave topology with
Sentinel so that's something which is
provided by ready so Sentinel is that
what is that process that basically
monitored the habit of the different
slave and master that we have in our
setup and if something goes wrong
Sentinel the different Sentinel will
basically trigger a failover for us
process level HEA so this is something I
didn't mention but if you saw my slide
where I had ready and something L on my
slide they were on the same box this is
something that you should avoid because
if that box or that container goes down
you value can lose at the same time
you're ready and your Sentinel so
Sentinel should be isolated from your
radius matter or readies slave so that's
something that you need to keep in mind
should be different in a different
container for example so by adapting
those different patterns at different
level we have a solution which is a
highly available and scalable and this
also gives us the ability to leverage
availability capabilities that are
provided by the platform to reduce the
downtime during the upgrade that we have
to do that we might do so quick summary
it's already sourced many of the
distributed real-time use case it's an
islet performance elite element solution
with very low latency we've talked about
some of the use case the two most common
one are using readies for improving
performance of application so it's
particular cash or any application that
has some leader about concept that's
also very good examples then we have
discussed about the radius I have
ability the different approach to
achieve I availability we saw that by
increasing the ability of our
application we are also basically by
default increasing the scalability the
two are always tied together so I think
I have a bit of time for demo so is that
the timing the real time that I still
have okay because I'm completely lost
so let's do a demo so what I did here
that's yeah that's readable so I saw it
our infrastructure where I just
provision an original distributed Redis
cash so you see that we have three
instance three radius instance so we
have one mater and two slave those are
the internal IP and basically the way I
will reach them is by using their port
so I know the external IP that I need to
use so this is what I have here so this
one should be let's see so this one is
the master so 19 so I will connect to
the master so you see that I'm using one
IP to that specific port so if
everything goes well this I'm connected
to my master so if I do a ping it answer
I can issue a command like info so info
is Bala key used to get some information
about the released setup so for example
what we see here
we should see here that this is a matter
and also it should tell us that those
are the slaves that we can use so
replication so the role of this one is
the matter and we have to slave that are
on dotes on those specific IP so this is
my master so I can see what key I have
there is empty so I will also connect to
my flavor so I'm using the same external
IP but I'm using a different port so 20
so I'm connected so if I do let's see if
I check the keys it should also be a
fully empty because everything is
automatically replicated across the
bottom is living in the fully a
synchronous fashion so what I can do I
can set let's say I will do it on the
master that's a better ID so I will set
a key so let's say CD one is London I
will set another one CD 2 is Prag and
now if I go in my slave if I get the key
I see that have two keys city 1 and TD 2
so if I do get one of my key so let's
say a CD one I indeed have London
obviously I can continue and set C key 3
let's say Brussels so if I do the key on
this side if I get the keys on this side
I now have three key and hopefully on
this side I should also have a tricky so
that means that if I get CT 3 its
Brussels um I can remove one of the
key so let's see CT I think enough of
the command so I've removed city too so
if I again get the keys I only have two
city so now if I get cd28 null and
obviously I should have the same on this
side so if I get CT 2 it's null and if I
get my keys I have three key what I
could try so so this is the master this
is the slave I can try to set a key in
this one so let's see CT four and let's
say it's Paris so this is a master sorry
this is a slave in read-only so I cannot
write to that place so this is something
which is well this is a common practice
by default that I told you that you can
write to a slave if you want to but then
you might risk reach what we call
intentional and consistency but now if I
do the same here so set city for Paris
so this works so I can get my cd4 from
the slave Paris obviously I've done that
using just to show you just using the
master and in one of the slave I could
have used the other slaves it would have
worked out the exact same way so this is
basically what I wanted to discuss today
one line one Latin maybe so if you want
to play with readies it's very easy you
just go to try dots Redis dot IO you go
to that URL and you basically had
already sketch that that you can use
so you can just issue the command as you
go so this is a very nice way to start
to play with things so this is this is
basically what I wanted to discuss about
today the flow has been a little bit
rough I have to apologize for that
but given the rough well the beginning
that we had well I did my best to try to
stay within the time limits so if there
are any questions or remarks or comments
yes I think that you have to use one of
the mic so there is one behind you yeah
also so so the question is how do you
resolve write conflicts yes you don't
have write conflict there is no there is
no locking it's a single threaded
application so you don't have write
conflict this is one of the I would say
advantage and inkwell not inconvenient
but you have to be aware of that yes sir
so what if you want to start something
that is a cellulite object what if I
want to store some civilized object
that's urban area basically yes you are
you have you can do that the only the
only limit so you would still use a key
value to sort that so you will basically
Sharia say sterilize your object into
the value the only thing is that it has
to be under 512 megabyte keep in mind
that this is going in memory so if you
are putting a lot of those big object in
your cache you better have some memory
but that's perfectly possible yes thank
you very much there's a product or a
common market as part of this efficient
milliwatts park called coherence
what is central early difference between
Reddy's film is John coherence that's a
good question so the question is what is
the difference between Redis and
coherence and to be honest with you I'm
not sure I'm the best person to answer
that question so instead of giving you a
partial response I will just ask you to
I well I there's someone who knows
coherence very well here today so I can
introduce you to that person if you want
any more questions remarks
nope well thank you and again I have to
apologize for the technical issue that
we all have the beginning it doesn't
really help but it's like that so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
