start introducing ourselves of my name
is Keiko Itza I'm working for Deutsche
Telekom or in Germany as a developer
evangelist yes my name is Tomas I said
England I'm working for a medium-sized
of a consulting company called Anouk you
if some of body of you is interested in
rest you probably know my colleague
Stephan Tillich of whose author of some
rest books and so on and both of us are
Java and OSGi and through the years
since many years now and yeah so that's
why we here yeah and what we're going to
talk about today is our spare time
project open up so that has no
affiliation with our day jobs and it's
really what are we do more less at night
hacking stuff and this poor tech or over
started by me three and a half years ago
or actually for my own purposes to get
some smartness into my own house at home
I started that as our open source
project directly because I thought make
sense to share that directly with others
and so in the last year's we have
quieter or big community and yeah
many many people joining all the time
and so one of the big things that
happened by that was that on Sunday we
also got the Dukes Choice Award for
community and getting Java people thank
you so that was really yeah great day
for us yet the project really appreciate
it so let me let me start asking you who
of you is already doing some kind of
home automation okay quite many who does
it professionally so in a day job okay
two to three no not really many so yeah
next question would be who
who bought any of such IOT gadgets more
or less so that are there around so all
of you I hope you also said you're doing
home automation because usually that
small s fits into yeah what you in the
recent they see some automation devices
and things now these Internet of Things
devices are really very neat you just
buy them somewhere in the shop you link
them up to your Wi-Fi at home or you
have a nice smartphone application and
that's all very nice and handy if you do
that and you buy ten or twenty or so
devices of them you will have your
smartphone looking like that so we have
many nice applications doing nice things
right that's pretty good for each
application and each device but our
usually say Internet of Things is also
about connecting devices and I think
there's a problem here because you have
all these devices using the IP protocol
being somehow hooked up to a cloud
service on the Internet
but they are not really connected right
so you have really siloed applications
that work on their own but there is no
no real smartness on that or as you
cannot have overarching use cases
automation rules and so on so you know
as I said there you end up having silos
in multiple which respects first of all
your user interface as you see it from
the smartphone is siloed you have many
many apps if you want to do two
different things for something you have
to launch the apps and switch in between
and from the automation perspective it's
siloed you can't say if this device or
sensor does something you react with
some other device on it automate
so and this is really not not the
perfect world i think what you're i ot
should look like in the future as coming
from home automation and also you like
the term they're the smart home so it's
not just about controlling devices and
getting data it's really about the
smartness so to automate things and that
the things happen automatically there
and the second part the home in this
case with the IOT gadgets you actually
don't have all your data and stuff at
home it's all sent out to 20 different
cloud services of different vendors all
your data is somewhere there you don't
really have access to it to the core
data you just have access to some
services that they offer to you and so
for really a smart home I also see that
the user should actually R be the one
who holds the data has control over zone
data and it's even getting worse there
are figures out there that says there
will be more than 50 different IOT
devices in every every average household
in 2022 you end up so with doing simple
things you're you're coming home and
you're in the mood to listen to music
and what you're doing is open up your
iphone switch to the left and switch on
your stereo then switch to the right at
least three times because you have more
than 50 of those apps installed switch
around the Phillips you and set it to
the right mood and then switch back to
the left again opening your Spotify
application and starting music so that's
not really smart and that's not the idea
we think that IOT or at least smart home
should work so what could be solute in
solution to that the first solution
could be we all create the Omni
potential intergalactical application
level protocol that all of that vendors
adopt to and all they implement and then
we don't need any other things so that
would be great but it will never happen
to be honest
or the second solution could be yeah
that we change that siloed and yes
that's high loads architecture that we
currently have to more integrated
architecture so that we and have end up
with something like that we we change
that architecture that way in the sense
that we the that we does not connect
that IOT devices to their silos but to a
centralized integration platform that
that's all that protocols translation
for you that does understand the
different yeah specialities of their
gadgets that doesn't know the protocols
and that does provide higher level
services on top of all of it so
regardless if you speak MQTT or HTTP or
if you like to switch on your U or the K
and X or the inste instant devices it's
all done with the same platform and yeah
if you have something like that then
your iPhone or your note iPhone your
smart phone look sick it looks more like
that it's yeah I think it's writable
more and that's what open hub is about
and that's what we are going to
introduce you to you now right so one of
the core concepts are of open hoppers
that we try to actually model your
devices your environment or in so-called
building bricks or items we call them so
an item might be for example a light
here it might be a temperature value it
might be the currently selected radio
station or stuff like that every item
has an internal status so for light you
are might say well it's dimmed to 80% at
the moment and it reflects yeah the
status of the thing for such items we
have two kinds of events or things you
can do with that the first
our commands so this is something active
where you ask an item to do something
for light you would or ask it to turn on
off to dim to some hour certain level or
to just dim up or down a little bit
besides these active or commands there
are then also so-called status updates
where you say well you know from the
environment from the real thing that the
status is actually now off of your land
so you can actually send and update the
item which is the model of the reality
with the according status so that's more
less something passive nothing actively
happens in the real world then if you do
status updates it's really just
synchronizing your model more or less
now one one important thing and
something where open APIs are really
stands out and makes it's very very
useful is that we do not try to model
devices of the real world we're really
just trying to model the functionality
of devices so these are building blocks
these items you could consider this as
an example of a radio so we would
actually not model a radio as a device
with a lot of properties and so on but
we would simply say well we have a
switch item to switch the radio on and
off we have a dimmer item to adjust the
volume from zero to hundred percent we
could have a number item which is the
selected radio station okay so this
concept makes it really very powerful to
react on new kind of devices that hit
the market or you don't have to really
model the new devices but you can just
say well ok you can assemble these
building blocks and Tory can then simply
map the functionality or even if subset
of your trust
interested in partial functionality of
these devices
now what do you do with these commands
and status updates well you simply see
them as events and you put them on event
bus so that's a core idea is you say
well you have the staff you send
commands you get our updates and this is
the core concept of the modeling now
having these stateless events is of
course not enough so there is the item
registry which keeps track more less of
the latest status of all your items and
stores them so that they can be provided
for a visualization and user interface
for example because there you have to
know what to display automation rules
can react on certain conditions then so
they have to know the overall status of
your environment and there are also
other things like persistent services
which then take these events and States
and store them to some database or or in
a log file or wherever and it's also for
interaction with console so very much
took a textural approach to things so
all of these events or you can simply
use in texture of a presentation and
have different kind of consoles which
we'll see later you know to use that now
one important thing to note is that
really everything that is shown here and
you see this virtual or at the left side
it's really our modeling levels so we
can actually describe all our setup
including nice user interfaces including
all your automation rules without
linking that to any kind of real
hardware so we don't have to configure
IP addresses here ports whatever for
your real devices it's really the
modeled approach and that is the idea
then that you can very easily actually
say well this item is this kind of
technology at the moment but maybe next
year when something nicer comes up and
you have now a different light
technology
you just change the configuration and
how to do that as done through so-called
bindings that we have an open app and
these bindings are more less than our
translators to the real world so they
just connect to the event bus the vector
star on the status updates on the
commands and sent it an hour to some
specific or yeah protocol system and so
on so this is really kept very separate
and the overall approach and these
bindings then make it very flexible to
add new kind of things to your system so
important to note open half as a pure
software project so there's no hardware
or anything so all you need for the
runtime are is some device that runs JVM
or bestest Java is embedded that we're
using for example on Raspberry Pi or you
can simply install that on and where
this runs you can also use some NASA
server that you might have already at
home to install it there or some other
server that is running all day long but
we were at the keynotes that you could
simply buy a Raspberry Pi in future in
the near future and then it's all on
that that's a real Inc enough but for
stars ok the second part of the project
is the open app designer which is more
or less the configuration tool then for
your runtime and this is all the
configuration is text-based so the
synchronization between what your
configure and your runtime you can do
through a simple Samba share for example
or a CPU or whatever but we also provide
dropbox functionality here where the
runtime directly checks your topics
folder and so it can be anywhere on the
world with your notebook just share the
prop box folder and the config files
will be synchronized to your home and
update it there
and say in the other directions of the
log files of the runtime also sent there
and you can access them from anywhere in
your box folder so or few words about
the technology stack so the runtime as I
said Java SE 7 based for the modularity
we use the OCI framework or the equinox
implementation there all the linking is
done through declarative services OSGi
we use the Eclipse modelling framework
to do the modeling of our configuration
files and for everything towards the
bedpan zone we have an embedded jetty
with jax-rs
for REST API and atmosphere framework as
well for WebSocket support and many
different things then for connecting to
the outside world and from the outside
world on the designer side wilton
eclipse our CP application then also
with EMF for inside and using the X text
frame work to do
textural domain-specific languages so
our configuration files are actually DSL
so you have nice syntax completion
highlighting and so on all that for the
configuration files that's pretty useful
there yeah and open hub comes with you
ice at least because you have to control
all your stuff at home and it's the
normal installation comes with the
classic UI we call a classic UI it's
simply your CSS Styles web application
which runs on that in that it's jetty
and we have that green tea UI which is
based on html5 Sencha touch framework is
beneath that furthermore we provide
native clients the left one is haploid
called help sweet you can fetch it from
the Google Play Store the right one as
the iOS version you can fetch it from
the App Store for sure and there's a
Windows Mobile
application as well but that's yeah
that's a pre-alpha status so probably
one day not it will be yeah okay
chi told told you about that textual
interfaces or that textual interfaces to
the open map runtime and these are the
textual interfaces that are currently
provided we have that XMPP interface
that means you can check your Java you
can chat with your home and get notified
we are chat messages or X and P P
messages we use that OSGi console in the
moment and the nice one and really nice
one is that Google Calendar console that
means you you configure textually
configure calendar events that are being
downloaded and executed at the gate in
point in time so recurring events or
special events that you like to to be
automated like Christmas tree lighting
or something like that you can simply
create a google calendar events and let
open hub control your home accordingly
beside that we have there are there's
those those persistent services as I
introduced them we have two kinds of
assistance services once the credible
once so you can store data and get it
from from there again it's important for
visualization stuff so doing nice graphs
you can use that all we have the rear
the just exporting persistent services
to that yeah IOT platforms that are well
known to you and as like I said this the
bindings are the really the core concept
of open up and Omaha currently ships
with 47 of them so you have 47 different
gadgets protocols IOT tools that you can
already connect to open up just simply
by configure them using the internal
bindings so probably some of them are
used to you and yeah
just configure them and use them and
yeah that's we are going to do now we do
we demo and show you how open hop feels
like yeah now starts the interesting
part let's see if we're lucky with the
live demo
despite the screen size so let's mmm
okay thanks okay yep perfect so
everything on the screen
good so or let me start right over here
so what you see here is the designer
that I talked about and first of all let
us start with creating one item okay so
we go here control space and we see
already what is there and let's start
with something simple the switch item
which we call light that's enough for
the start now something we didn't
mention yet the concept of the site map
the site map is actually textural
approach toward decoratively define your
user interface so you don't do any
graphical designer with buttons on X and
y-axis and positioning and so on but we
more let's just describe what we want to
see in our user interfaces and we can
give it here a name and say my house has
a label for that no we say a frame where
we want to display a switch for some
item and we see already the item that we
defined appears here so we want to have
a switch for the item light now we can
already try that accessing in the web
browser ya know
and it's all above that that event buzz
if you remember the drawing from before
it's all on the virtual site currently
there we go
Northside so we have a switch and we
also see the status of the light it
switches wonderful now nothing happened
so far because well we didn't configure
any binding but we can very easily do so
right
helps our by adding now configuration
for Philips you and now let me think
what do we have to configure here what
to do well pretty easy we just say which
Lambert is on the you bridge and this
one is number six so we saw that here
and that is all that we have to do to
configure now the Philips you'll lambda
are for this item and now that's
interesting if something happens
ah The Tipping live demo effect right
everybody was expecting that
it's again the you bridge that
disappeared oh no yeah there's a problem
with the cable here and the bridge isn't
on the network why is that maybe well
well Thomas is finding out why is that I
just
Oh lied okay
don't touch anything no no I keep my
hands
Healing Hands okay and it's off
so yeah you see okay working okay okay
so now the ones of you who know Phillips
you it's not just on and off but you can
choose very nice colors for that so
let's improve a little bit our setup and
we say we don't have a switch here but
we have some color item and to give the
right feedback this is now a default erm
default icon that I define here not so
important so and in the site map we can
now say instead of a switch we actually
want to send our a color picker widget
in this case okay so we do refresh here
and receive we have a different widget
now and we can still turn on and off
over here and now we can also use the
color picker to hopefully yes change the
color of our lamp so very nice
control units with this arm let's see
how I do that if that works here with
the camera wonderful okay what is
yourself okay can you see yourself okay
nice so let me just try with the phone
here or okay not perfect quality maybe I
can I think it's a bit too big because
of the oh yeah because of the resolution
change oh let me put that up here like
that and it's small aspect ratio should
be fine oh let's make it a bit bigger
again that you can see it and then it's
there oh no I think that okay now I can
see my phone and we see we have helpful
it installed here an application and
that was not connected yet yeah
wonderful so we have here now the same
widgets available in a native
application and we can turn the lamp on
and off and we have a nice color chooser
here as well blue green yep
so that works nice now another feature I
want to show you with our heart rate is
that the phone has NFC support and it's
pretty cool I have I can't see it now
myself
let me see yeah I've put some NFC tags
up here and see that one I put red on so
if I not just hold my phone here ah the
lamp turns red there's one for blue
Chuck and we have a blue lamp isn't that
great so you you actually don't need any
oh yeah you don't need any physical
switches at home really at places where
they might not be convenient like
somewhere out in the garden where you
have a switchable socket or so we can
just stick an NFC tag to there and when
you're out in the garden just use your
phone to switch the socket you don't the
chain of the rings beyond the toggle
switch on the line
yeah and programming these NFC tags is
also pretty simple so all we have to do
is to say well actually here for this
light we want to do something for
example we want to have the toggle
functionality no I should touch the tag
I touch a tag here look successfully
finished and if I now come back here to
the stack I'm switching the lamp okay so
no programming involved or anything can
very easily just use any NFC tags and
use that okay then we bought some more
stuff with us no no no we have some more
I want to show some automation rules
first oh yes you do yeah yeah on me they
let me pass without any questions
they're probably trying to close both
eyes and so I don't start asking so okay
Automation rules there are as I said the
smartness comes with automation rules
and just to give you a very first idea
what to do so movers are also textural
and we can say well let's create a new
rule here which we now want to say well
we just want to hear when somehow on the
lamp is switch though if it's turned on
we say on if it's turned off we say off
just as a very simple example okay so
say command we call it and the name
isn't really important and we say a
fierce item light received command on
or item light received command off then
we want to do something and what we want
to do is to say actually in the received
command so you see the syntax completion
and so on it's all very convenient to
very quickly write the right things
without any syntax errors and so on so
that's a very simple rule it's easily
readable configured and now if we switch
over let's try it off off on ok off
working ok so now let's try yes let's go
to the to the next gadget we brought
with us yeah I'll do that
ok we have brought some hardware
Blizzard's with us that is called tinker
Forge
tinker for to stack this is yeah right
here but ok it's a little piece of
hardware from a German company and you
can stack those different it stack those
different bricks how they called it and
get from functionality out of it and
they have those control bricks and they
have many many different sensor bricks
or briquettes they call it that you can
buy so what we have here is that one is
a sensor for temperature that one is a
sensor for humidity or brightness and
the humidity sensor lies on the ground
normally the cables longer so we you can
catch up afterwards and see what it's
really is the thing is it's really
really cheap as the temperature sensor
is 6 euros and humidity is about 10 I
think
and the master brick is about 40 or 50
so get a reasonable amount of hardware
to play around with across your hundred
viewers and you have TCP and you have a
Java a Java API and yeah really nice
stuff and
yeah what we're trying to do now is
visualize or control different things or
let's open have be controlled by
different sensors that are brought to us
via think of watch so I'll switch on
that switch off the camera again how
does it work I can disappear and see it
now yeah just switch to that's
criticized problem you need something
that doesn't wait you know yeah I know
sorry
what's that you have to find her yeah it
wasn't fine it wasn't on the phone and
oh yeah the screen size is simply just
let it quit or just just move it over
just move the whole window to the side
okay maybe with that it's easiest that's
easier stretch so back to pink afford
hardware what we did here is we what we
have to do now to - let's open up play
with tinker thought is we have to
configure a number of of items as we
said we don't configure hardware we
configure functionality of that hardware
and I've pre-configured it to not rival
that things down and yeah you see the
different different items here what we
additionally have here that we didn't
talk about before is the group
functionality which is simply a logical
thing to converse with you to group sing
things and and work on those group
things afterwards so let's see what
happens we configured out we configured
those different things and yeah now they
are all ready yeah no the next thing I
have to do is to add that side map
that thing go to the side map refresh
the site map and there we have a
tinkerer Forge group and here we see the
different sensors and let me see if it
works
brightness humidity goes up humidity
goes up okay so it works and on the
other hand you see those their sensor
here and that's what we are going to
play around a bit more with it it's a
distance sensor inference sensor you can
see it measures the distance from a hand
from hand to sensor and what we are now
going to do is imagine you are under
Oktoberfest in Munich and the problem at
Oktoberfest is if somebody runs out of
beer
then the party is over so what we have
to do is we measure the the level of the
beer barrel of the beer barrel and if
it's empty then we do something so we
use that distance sensor and to imagine
that it's for the for the distance or
the level so knowing the millimeters
that the the barrel is high is not that
yeah this is not that that handy so it
would be more handy to see the level in
percent but that's what we're doing now
incorporating another rule and that rule
come on that rule simply you takes that
be a distance in millimeters and there's
some small mathematics and ya calculate
or recalculate to the level in percent
so let's see what happens
the rule is yeah
it's activated and now we see holding it
holding at lower means there is much
beer in it so we have to see about that
and if give it it's getting emptier and
emptier then the level or the the
percentage goes down and what you see as
well is that the level of the right side
from the icon also changes so there is
dynamic change of that icon as well so
okay having that in place is quite handy
but we have a smart home or smart system
so we have to incorporate more stuff to
make it more interesting so next thing
we are going to do is we visualize that
level of beer so I imagined you are in
the tent again and you see the level of
beer that is yeah the current level of
beer so nothing easier than that we
create a rule and we take that level of
beer in percent and what we do now is we
recalculate that beer level to the to
the color of the you lamp so we we we go
on that color circle and as much it
starts at 0 degree layer of red and it
goes to 360 green 3.66 back again at
what course win again I'm 2120 thanks
and so so we recalculate that handout
that percents of level to that great so
let's do that
yeah camera again to show what is the
camera
to show your distance and delight then
right so yes it should be something yeah
it should be sending or something after
I've saved it yes so saving is a good
idea absolutely and now we see green
because it's full and we see red because
empty you see at the right 0% level and
now you see 100% and yeah everything in
between is also visualized so you know
early enough when to leave the tent and
go to another one because there's no no
bein anymore yeah I think ok we go to
the next step right next step even nicer
just to show you a little bit what you
can do with the rules then as well is
that we say well if we ran out of beer
and there's no refill for a while then
we're really in big trouble so let's
create a rule for that we call let's say
beer along and we say if the state of
our beer level changes and if our level
state is zero that's not good oops so we
don't want to rekt immediately because
the refill might be just on the way so
we actually create yeah we create a
timer saying that now
in let's just say five seconds and
reality you might do five minutes
something should happen and this what
should happen is well is we say we play
the siren sound you can do many other
things here like or sending email
notification to your beer delivery or
any other things that you can include an
open up here now using Twitter they
won't bring it will drop it that's no
good so we're creating the timer but we
said if it's actually prefilled we don't
want to play the sounds or what we can
do here is the timer gives us back a
trimer handle which we can declare
globally inside the school file here as
a timer and in case that the beer level
changes and it's not zero then we can
actually cancel the timer again right so
that's actually a pretty nice and short
way to use the closure in here in this
in the scripting language which you
otherwise would only get with java 8 so
should be it right shall we try it out
so we have here we have here we have no
beer for a few seconds all we have B
again okay no alarm and red that's wait
for five seconds of it works
yes okay so now the very last toy right
yeah yeah the last toy we brought with
us is probably you've followed us on
Twitter and knows know it already
it's that leap motion thingy you know
that from if you if you attended the
embedded sessions Java embedded sessions
they yeah many people play around with
it we - and let's now configure that a
leap motion thingy to open hop know what
we what we like to control is our
Philips new lamp and now we configure
eval another binding and that binding is
called the potion and now we sorry no we
go we are going to control light our
Philips you lamp with guest chests
because that is what leap motion is
about so on/off okay just one the
synchronization state okay so which one
that's the key tap gesture that were
using on okay works now we can dim it
damn it up and down down up and down
okay and what what we also have this you
you probably might want to control your
your color with your fingers and at
least we have three colors to control so
we have three fingers to show up and now
you you can control the light or the the
color by just simply using the guest yes
right the rotating one yeah yeah
No yeah we have another one right so you
can do have found on we have the third
well fourth guest show that is
implemented and that's the circa guest
yeah and if you just want to scroll
through your colors then you simply
scroll with your fingers how easy okay
and of oh oh oh oh okay
that's for the demo so now let's switch
over to some yeah get that back the
presentation so yeah that was our live
demo it was really just a few toys that
we have available here so just to show
you a little bit from real house what
you can do as well with that just want
to show you a very short one-minute
video here so as I said it spawns on the
Raspberry Pi
but just some impressions and that is
real-life stuff that's no fake or so
that's my own house at home nearby with
where you live use cases so what's the
status of their open heart project
currently we have in the moment you see
that's the map of people that let us
know where they're come from as you see
we are closely or we are we are slowly
but constantly moving towards word
domination but yeah but there is still
yeah a focus on G on Europe currently
but SSE here they are showing nicely
showing up more and more us users of
open map currently we have around 40
contributors to the project and we know
not the exact figure of system that are
around what we think about 2000
installations that are currently out
there and we have a very vibrant Google
Group forum and a German forum
it's called carnac's user forum you know
who knows that is very famous in Germany
so there are many channels and really
active discussions and yeah things that
are going on there
some more details about the project that
might be interesting for you when you
are going to throw money at us and would
like to use it
currently it was GPL be free license but
we changed that in the near future to
the EPL license and we used to use
mercurial but after Google Code switched
off the Google the clone functionality
we have to do something and yeah we
switch to get and as I said Google Code
we switch to get up and we use maven
Tyco so that might come handy for you as
well and we are currently using our
stuff for building our stuff on cloud
peace probably that might change to
Travis but yeah who knows
okay sells a bit more words about the
future of the project so you might have
heard that we have actually proposed our
new project the Eclipse Martin project
that the Eclipse Foundation and the
reason for that is that we actually see
different kinds of interest in our
project we have the whole big user
community who is very eager implementing
the new bindings and so on because they
use that for their own system they have
something special or implement that
contributed to the project and we also
now see more and more interest in the
academics or universities picking that
up for research and so on also bigger
companies research departments or who
really like the stake and the framework
of open happened there are built
prototypes on top of that or doing other
things so these different interested
parties or we will now like to address
in different ways by that so we will
keep open up the distribution full-blown
with all the bindings very controls from
and so on but we want to follow at the
Eclipse Mottram project then moving the
core framework part of open up to this
project and really have been your the
innovation about our extensibility and
so on going on or in this project or and
really your invite or interested parties
and industry players there to
collaborate on your the smart home of
the future so I think we're then at the
end and would be open for questions if
you have any
well first you start off with the log
file that you find there and you can
also enable then debug logging and you
can our connect remote or Java debugger
also to it for the scripting it's not
always exactly easy then to find out
exactly the right line because that's
dynamically passed over the text there's
really just an you're I start on which
says or somehow open half per site met
this one and this item with this command
and the application then itself or you
configure your credentials in a fluid in
the native application and so it
automatically then locks in with the
credentials to the server so it's not
per device you have the tag and you can
use any device where you have set up the
write for your interest and it's by find
use that yep
um the system is is running normally
that system is running closely in your
house it's yeah it's not open to the to
the world normally if you like to
control it
we are the internet then we are
currently providing SSL and HTTP basic
auth and one of the main things is that
we have as I said the embedded jetty so
we're not trying to build any HTTP
server ourselves with a lot of security
flaws if we will do that but we're
really relying here on the jetty that is
hopefully pretty safe so implementing
another jar service like client
certificates for example should be not
that problem no we don't have yet
because we are we are currently
developing now we have the hardware to
develop a kind for instant which is more
or less the successor of exten so an
extent is not compatible at least here
so extend usually if people start new
then or you wouldn't recommend that
because it's really unreliable and yeah
not state-of-the-art anymore or that
attempts that we usually don't do any
real hardware recommendations as we're
really independent of any windows and so
on but I think especially here in the US
as we now support sea wave protocol
there are quite some interesting devices
around from danfoss or honeywell and
others simply wait for that wave
more questions
so can you describe a typical binding
are you intercepting IP messages but the
device is trying to send to its host
as the systems out there on the market
are so heterogeneous there is no
standard way of a binding and that's the
whole idea that really in the binding
you have the very specific logic how to
address a certain system so there might
be Java API for that system available
that are then used to do that there
might be IP communication but it's
always a problem if you need native code
here because then we're not on a pure
Java level anymore and portability and
so on is all much more difficult okay so
thanks a lot for your attention
yeah thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
