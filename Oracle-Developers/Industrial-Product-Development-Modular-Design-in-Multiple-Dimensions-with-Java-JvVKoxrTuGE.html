today is our experiences and in
industrial product development we're
gonna have a talk of about 40 minutes
where we demonstrate to you or explain
to you the technology that we've
developed over the last seven years
specifically we're going to show you a
real-world appliance that's in use
worldwide today that was developed with
some software framework that we
developed that's the shared logic
platform that we would like to explain
to you we're not trying to sell it to
you because it's not for sale but we'd
like to show you the principles and
concepts that we use to develop this
platform we're going to talk about
dimensions of modularity how that helped
us to achieve what we got today we're
also going to talk about challenges and
lessons that we've learned during the
course of the past seven years and we're
trying to be a bit of a fortune teller
in the end by giving you an outlook on
what's to come and what we think is
important in this field when you do
industrial product development after
that we're going to show your live demo
of this piece of hardware that we lock
together over there
we're going to show you that working
it's a little appliance that we've
developed together with with the tool
that was used to develop the software
that's running on top of it all of it is
written in Java and then in the end if
we still have time there's a question
answering session a little bit about
ourselves not much
my name is Kasper from Gunton I'm the
guy in the yellow shirt there and this
is skirt red lacquer my colleague we
both work at their governesses small so
it's company about 200 persons working
there not all doing industrial
development but the whole company is
developing software in Java alright so
first thing that I would like to
introduce to you is this industrial
product the so called energy wealth
that's that thing you see on top here
and that's already in its natural
environment as you
see say this is a a valve controller
that sits on top of a a tube like you
see here you can buy that if you're
within the HVAC business and plug that
just in the way it's displayed here now
this energy valve is an actuator that is
locally intelligent it runs inside a
Chava SC embedded a virtual machine with
some tools that we've written for it and
it's used worldwide for energy efficient
heating and cooling and the idea is that
this thing here does not have a central
control telling it what to do it the
idea is that this thing here decides for
itself in the place where it is if we go
back here with the help of two sensors
say two temperature sensors and the flow
sensor it should decide here how much
water should be going through here and
thus optimizing the the the usage of
energy in this specific place so you
just plug it in and it should work you
can control and parametrize it through a
web interface there's a web server
running within this little box here and
you can connect directly to it which
means you also have to hook it up to
some Ethernet somewhere this device is
produced and distributed globally Bible
EEMA that's our customer they developed
that they are there solely in the and
the N in the actuator and control valve
business and they distribute this stuff
worldwide most biggest market is Europe
but there's also in US and Asia going on
it's not unlikely that there's some
orange boxes hiding behind these walls
inside this building right here so what
you see here Lightning lights a bit is a
bit high this is the web interface that
you'll have if you connect to this
energy valve product so you basically
log in to it
then then you get to see some stats on
what the temperature is in front of the
valve with the temperatures in the back
of the valve you see the heating coil
here and you'll have some stats on how
much energy is currently being
distributed in the system and probably
also somewhere how much energy is saved
there's more controls on the side we can
see that in the demo as well where you
can when you where you can locally
customize some settings here
settings of Max and min values that you
would like to use to tweak the algorithm
that's running on top of it the energy
valve is for example used in the MIT
library the Charles Hayden library
that's a large building that was
retrofitted with the energy valve and
right now they're saving about 1.5
million dollars a year just by the
energy consumption that they could
reduce by using the energy valves that
decide locally and how much water to use
because characteristics of buildings
like that are that often you have the
so-called delta T that's the difference
between the temperature that you should
have and the temperature that you
actually have it's too big and then
usually central control tries to just
put in more water to cool down the
building but sometimes the coils where
the water runs through are not energy
efficient enough so they don't get rid
of this cooling that they as they should
and as a result of that you just pump
through more water and nothing happens
so by regulating locally you can reduce
that and thus saving water and saving
cooling and that's where those 1.5
millions come from all right yeah you
also get some stats then when you have
the energy wolf that show you you know
what's what's happening in the system
now why is that a good thing because if
you install a device like the energy
valve for example that doesn't just save
you money by by regulating locally it
also gives you stats what's
putting inside your building and what's
happening with with the energy in
general so you'll probably know that the
energy wealth that sits on the coil in
the neighbor building it can measure the
energy that is lost inside the coil
because it has access to all the data
that it needs and does it can show you
that this coil is not in good shape
anymore and maybe if you do some
refurbishing or replacing of course
that's where you should start so you not
only get a local energy optimization
you also get stats that tell you what's
happening in your building in general so
that's what the Peter Cooper the manager
of sustainable engineering and unity
planning at MIT said that is also
grateful for for these data points that
he gets for free by using a product like
that but as I said we're not here to to
sell you the product but just to show
you what's possible so next thing I'm
going to present to you is our platform
the so-called shared logic platform and
that's a basically generic application
development suite for the HVAC domain it
was specifically tailored to our
customer belly mo but in general the
principles are applicable anywhere so
what this suite consists of is you have
an extensible library of logical
components basically believe or not only
fabrics this this energy valve that I
just presented to you they also produce
a lot of smaller components actuators
and valves and that are placed somewhere
within the building and all of these
sensors and actuators you'll have a
component for that you can use to build
your software on top of so so basically
a driver for these for these components
then you'll have a visual data flow
modeling tool that's basically an editor
that allows you according to the specs
of our customer now to visually design
your software that you would like to run
and within this visual design you can
use these
logical components from the library so
you're basically just plugging you plug
this stuff in together we'll see that
later in the demo how that looks like
but you can just imagine you basically
construct a big flow graph where you say
well I have this sensor in that sensor
this data is coming in that data should
go out and if you know the sensor one
shows a certain temperature then
actuator two should move to position X
furthermore you will have a data flow
processing engine as we call it that
actually runs on the embedded hardware
node so on this little machine here as I
said we have a chili see embedded seven
running on top of that and that runs
this data flow processing engine and
when you're done designing your flow or
your model basically of the application
that you would like to run on this thing
you just upload it to the node and it
will run on this processing engine so
it's basically an interpreter for these
graphical models that that you've built
that will then run on the actual
hardware so that's basically what makes
up the suite now the great thing about
having a framework like that is not only
that you can now write software for your
embedded device it is that it enables
you to do rapid prototyping that means
you design your application on your
desktop within the graphical modeling
tool as soon as you've achieved and you
feature a new function you simply upload
it to the hardware and test it out there
you can also simulate locally on your
machine because we've abstracted away
the hardware and you can plug in
basically stubs that that gives you
sensor sensory information you then go
back you simulate and test you go back
to your editor you're correct and you
new to twitch whatever you need to and
then continue to develop your model and
upload it again so it's a very quick way
of developing our software for your
existing hardware devices as long as
they're capable of running the job I see
embedded and so normally in a typical
setting you would have
one or just a couple of these very
intelligent nodes that can run Java and
these will be hooked up with more
actuators and sensors through a regular
HVAC field and they can talk to those
from inside the software through the
drivers that we've presented before so
here's a couple of scenarios that I
would like to show to you yes please no
we're running SC so the big one because
we've had enough room and space
available and it was much easier for us
because we're all Java developers so we
didn't want to have a different
programming environment with this with
with the break basically of media and
having to develop specifically for ME so
and and our experiences are very good
with SC we've used we've been using it
for a couple of years now and we didn't
have any problems so there was no reason
basically downgrading because the node
was capable of running SC we have a
whole Linux running below that inside
the node so it's a non processor and arm
process it are based on so but that's
also something that's that's really nice
with this setting because I'm you're
basically Hardware independent right it
just needs to be able to run the SC
embedded engine and the as soon as new
hardware comes out new processors come
out you just use it whatever you have
and then you you supply a new model with
a better processor and you can
immediately take advantage of that the
software you won't have to adapt it runs
just the same so back to those scenarios
one scenario is that the developer
basically used the SL designer then
simulate something locally on his
desktop machine and just to get the
ground work basically going off of his
application then as soon as he's happy
with those results he can deploy the
application to the SL engine and the SL
engine will then talk to the sensors and
actors that are within its own field
network this field bus that you see
there it will read some sensors make
some decisions on what should happen
and then maybe tell an actuator to to do
something
and finally when you've deployed your
software and it's actually running you
can also use the web interface to then
later customize and control the
application that is running on the SL
engine so that's basically the echo
system where we are moving more stuff
that you have on the designer side is
that you can configure eight
configurator configure sorry your
application here you'll have this
extensible component library so whenever
the lemo develops a new device we'll get
a new task to do to develop a driver for
them but they can then use in their
graphical designer to talk to this
device you can also develop webpages
from within the designer we'll see that
in the demo as well and you can also as
it is standard software engineering
practice develop test cases for your for
your applications that should later on
run on the SL engine on the installation
side we'll have the engine itself the
intelligent the intelligent part that is
hooked up with some in this case
proprietary polymer sensors all some of
them are I think also just custom
sensors that they buy from somewhere so
that's just no custom sensor standard
sensors that they buy from somewhere
else in the market you'll have a way to
talk to these through the customer EMP
fieldbus
on top of that you were also able to
integrate an existing building system
through standard protocols like BACnet
that's the purple part that you see here
so if you have some building automation
control and you would like to use that
to talk to this thing here you can
integrate with that and then over
Ethernet as I showed you can basically
talk to the world or to other devices
basically peers of yourself so that
machines can interact with each other
over IP
so in summary for this first part what
we've developed is we'll have some
control logic that is drawn or
implemented through the graphical
designer and then later basically just
that results in a XML file defining the
model that you would like to run then
you have this processing engine that
runs on the actual hardware you upload
this XML and the engine happily knows
what to do after that
you can communicate with sensor and
actuators you just extend your library
and then they're ready to talk to and to
talk with you we use or we integrate the
standard industry communication
protocols the bacnet as I just explained
to you if you want to talk to Building
Control you can communicate over IP
either with human users controllers more
for monitoring or with other peer nodes
basically machine to machine
communication will have the web
interface there's a jetty running on top
of that we're not quite sure at the
moment whether that's a good thing or a
bad thing we're looking for alternatives
as well and we run on a standard Linux
based operating system we'll have this
visual design tool in our case that's an
eclipse-based
or simply application and you can do
testing and simulation on the developer
machine so you don't have to work within
the hardware domain to get your model up
and running only in the end phase or if
you'd like if you do some some
integrated development but you can
basically test on the on the developers
machine and then go to the hardware
whenever you feel ready for it but it's
very easy to to do that
at the same time as well all right so
now I'd like to hand over to my
colleague and he's going to tell you
more about modularity and the
experiences that we've made before it
comes back to me for the demo good Thank
You Kasper what is that
presentation now I want to go a little
bit in depth of the system to show you
at what at which points we have profited
from Java technology
and especially how we applied modularity
to the system in various levels or
dimensions so one piece the system is
not a single piece it's a system
development an embedded system
development architecture it has power
that's running on the node it has a
designer part and we used the Java
concept on both sides so for the
platform architecture it's it's the the
stuff that's running on the core and
also the the Java software that's
running in this design tool we could
profit it from using Java ME of using
Java SE for example to easily share
codes between the design tool and the
actual execution environment so this is
a very valuable thing it can easily copy
some code from the development part and
put it right in the runtime part and you
don't have to worry about collections
that are not there in Joe MA and stuff
like that and on the other hand we have
the application on top of it the
application of dr. fleet is the solely
dataflow application it's done via
graphical interfaces and you have this
box you stay away from all of your data
flow and this is specially done for HVAC
developers so we have a lot of
discussions with them and feedback how
they want to work
we as programmer we want to tend to
convince to do a little more programming
and less traffic stuff but they are not
that way that they want to program
they really want to have a graphic
design flow and they don't want to go
into program instead at this graphically
designed go we also have modular designs
so if you go from the design or from the
clip space to where tech tips plugins we
used a Clips OSGi techniques there one
certain important constraint don't have
one version of the stuff since this is a
real world product we have a lot of
versions out there these products are
sold to behave as it should be and you
should not change it later on so if one
of the wives of the drives get get
broken they have to be replaced in
exactly the same way this was before so
we need versioning also from our
software running on it on the other end
we have to the software running on it
which itself has different functions
which where we could profit from from
osg idea again to make it independently
develop able testable and so on and
important thing is also testing and
simulation support so if you are a
developer you want to do everything on
your desktop you don't want to go to
some installation where you have a board
with real sensors and then wait for some
effect and that's not a very nice thing
about Java you can run the stuff there
you can easily build up some mock that's
mocking a sensor and you can test it you
can make a unit test or an integration
test out of it and you'll find and so
you're sure that all the time this
behavior keeps the same so going a
little bit into the application design
as I mentioned before you have this
dataflow processing you have some
sensors you have some boxes where the
data moves through the application and
at the end you have some actuators we
to get input for example to turn the
valve off turn it down a little bit and
the hardware interactions for sensors
and actuators are handled by a driver
components the data coming from the from
the hardware drivers need to be the
processed for this you need calculations
for example to do some control you need
some special control calculations or you
want to just transfer from different
units for example from Celsius to
Fahrenheit and so on so you have a
concept of functions there and you want
to reuse stuff you want to use it again
in another model so we have the concept
of compounds you can make compounds out
of your functions and use it again later
on these compounds can all be organized
in libraries as Kasper already mentioned
before and one important thing we also
convince the HVAC engineers you need
unit testing at this level again for
your compounds you want to make some
deaths that your compounds do well and
if you later on change something between
the compound you won't be sure that some
of your behavior hasn't changed or at
least only to be behavior that you want
it to has changed so this was mmm idea
that came out of software engineering
and which now they find very useful for
designing also their data flow models so
if we go for round you can have more
than one intelligent wife in your system
so these wives have to talk to each
other you can design one big model and
and make communication points they are
beaten between the wives and break it
down to sub models for each single wife
then one one intelligent wife like this
one here could could control it
a slave which has no charm on it which
just is controlled by an proprietary
field pass and so you have to have the
control logic for controlling this one
also within the application on the
intelligent one so what were the
challenges during the seven years we
were working on this project the one
important thing it's it's a real-world
product it's not some Raspberry Pi
experiment which you saw a very later on
and next year you have something more
fancy this thing this has to be run 24
hours a day and it has to live for 20
years at least so if today if you sell
it it has to be working there for a long
term so we make sure that we have no
long-term side effects we do extensive
regression testing integration testing
we use best practices from software
engineering where Java already supports
us a lot with many tools like Jenkins
and fine parks and stuff like this we
also - code reviews we have manual
testers in the project then going
further down we can leverage that we use
a stable operating system like Linux and
the usage stable chi-chi vm like -
oracle a Medici VM and one important
thing is is that if such a device
eventually would crash it always has to
return to the safe States so we need to
install watchdog services which are
always able to reset the stuff and to
come back to a stable state because the
things are somewhere behind the scenes
or somewhere in the basement and it's
not possible that someone goes there and
press the reset button or blocks
unblocked and unblock the cable
as I mentioned these are hard hard to
access so currently not all of them at
the Internet so the software has to be
in a steady state when you ship it still
we are thinking of establishing remote
monitoring and having remote software
patching but that's currently a future
thing it's not that we could rely on
this at the current state not all of
these things will be connected to the
Internet and still they have to work for
20 years so as I mentioned before we
have this long term support for each
release if a customer buys the product
he wants to buy a replacement in 10
years which behaves the same so we have
to ensure that all software artifacts
are there we have to guarantee if you
change something on the hardware we have
to guarantee that it's backward
compatible to the software that was at
the state at the time when the product
was sold so that that it behaves the
same because the models you can of
course you can migrate models to a newer
version but then you have to really do a
careful work to think about all side
effects from the from the table high
level application view and this you can
do if you want to spend a lot of effort
but if you just sort an application and
this is one is fine and you want to
resell it you don't want to spend this
effort to always migrate the application
you have already sold to know to a new
software version when the software
involves during the time
what other challenges we face we have of
course hardware limitations this
currently we have 64 megabytes of RAM
and flash we have only 200 megahertz of
CPU power we have it's very important to
tune the order KVM parameters correctly
you always have this trade-off between
memory consumption and response time if
you do use too much heat then maybe the
the Linux is killing us because we are
needing to move too much memory during
the runtime there are such things like
over commitment in Linux so if you start
something and you say I want to be heavy
with have 128 megabytes Linus is very
well it gives you you can allocate it
but at the end at some certain point I
really need it why we really write on
the memory then suddenly the the memory
is not there it's not available and you
get killed to your process and so you
have to tune all the parameters very
well that you can have a stable running
system there
and also if we want to change the hard
drives it has a lot of costs because of
the electromagnetic tests that has have
to be done again so this is also
something that the customer takes care
about and you could not tell him we
software engineers we want to have more
arraignment give it to us put the chest
and bigger em on it so that's that's not
that easy to do on the other end we are
using it's in there it sits on the
baseboard and so it has to fit to the
baseboard because the same baseboard is
also in the dump devices in it so the
baseboard has the driver control for the
motor and stuff like this and table
doors I have a model are hardware
designs so they want to have a specific
different baseboard just for the 40
versions that have java on it so you
just want to plug in another processor
board so you have these constraints of
iOS on the processor board which you
cannot ask for more i/o there so these
are things that you have to fight with
in this area then as I mentioned you
have yeah you have to do all these lots
of great ideas and then you have always
the point how much does it cost and you
have to convince finally that the costs
for more intelligence are good they are
not wasted and for this you have to give
arguments like you can rapidly develop
new applications you have announced
monitoring and data aggregation you have
improved connectivity because you have
Ethernet and you can connect to the word
to the Internet you gain Hardware
independence because you're using Java
and you're not building for a single
hardware you can profit that you later
on can change your software if necessary
if you put in some some some
intelligence you can change it during
during the life outside as everybody of
us is changing
the software of a smartphone during the
air currently if there's a new version
and one important thing is Casper
mentioned you becoming independent from
central controller you can really if you
are hardware supplier like polymer which
supplies these valves you're not
depending on some very intelligent
building controller system you can give
your customer some some additional value
without changing the control of the
whole building so these ours are all
arguments against the dump valve
hardware device it but still they they
will all be around and it's hard to make
them intelligent if you don't have all
these good arguments and also the use
case where that it costs accepted
another important lesson we learned in
this field is that during applying such
ideas the whole embedded system becomes
entrancingly more software driven it's
no more just the hardware design that
counts it's more and more the software
design that has to be bulletproof and a
lot of people in this area coming from
the hardware side they were trained to
develop something in C C++ and a lot of
code they produce is not that good code
these people don't have a computer
science background they often have
electrical engineering background they
need some some training in programming
but not at that level as you have in
computer science and these are the
problems then to convince them or to
make them able also to participate in
this area you have to adapt software
development processes once I was working
in a company and they were doing
embedded stuff and they didn't have a
continuous integration there and I was
saying are you crazy you can work
without continuous
equation then I'm asking and how about
you unit tests and they were asking me
what unit tests we do this long-term
hardware testing but we don't have unit
tests on our software components and
this was somehow crazy for me so and of
course if you have to increase software
complexity you need modular design door
handle days so what's the outlook from
our perspective the Internet of Things
is near as we see you can put some Java
device inside of evolve it looks about
the same size as the dump valve so you
can put Internet connectivity everywhere
and it's not that expensive more and
more devices can come to be a part of a
network intelligence move closer to the
sensors and actuators and making whole
environments increasingly smart and to
our experience Java offers a solid
foundation to enter this new world so as
a summary over the last seven years we
have profit did because using Java in
industry standard libraries we can use
which are secured and established use
OSGi which gave us a perfect model
realization we have strong testing and
debugging support as our every Java
developer knows we have platform
independence during the seven years we
have changed our hardware system three
times and we didn't have to change our
code or most of the code and we have
powerful and major application
frameworks like for example we lose
Eclipse as a passes for the graphical
design tool and there are various
embedded virtual machines you can choose
on besides Oracle we have tried a lot of
others but still the Oracle one is the
one with the best performance and the
best stability so we are using it for
the river product
and this conclusion Java is a modular
architecture it's a modern and software
based approach and so you can
confidently look into the future and
wait for the coffee machine to treat you
someday now I will hand over to Casper
to I know your lifetime okay any
questions up to here yes
accounting for and over the course of
many months this would be a problem for
us a memory leak basically I mean ya
know lift a car not really the current
version we still use one point six six
because of memory footprint
seven and seven is is much too big for
us and they have a really running stable
for long-term testing it sits in terms
of months we don't have a watch took
reboot so so for our case it's it's
working quite impressive before the you
start of other VMs for example cambium
with new class pass and there we had
once in a while every least some weeks
we had crashes watched up reboots we do
which we couldn't explain and since we
use Oracle it's it's really nice or
we've had memory leaks but they were in
our software yeah you can always have
leaks in Java also if you have a static
list and you add some stuff there and
you never remove it yeah okay so then
I'd like to demonstrate you what we've
built here yeah I'm sorry
yes
the process running
this is this could be the case because
you have two less memory we also tried
out such things if you go for example if
you have space for eight memory megabyte
of heap and you usually use five
megabytes and you have this this this it
is waving around five and going up to 8
and then garbage collection sets in and
you go down maybe to four or something
then it's fine but if you go up to but
if you go up if you go go yeah if you go
up then the performance dramatically
decreases if you are working yeah
it's dramatically does it as a thematic
trait of prophy between performance and
heap usage you should not use all your
heap you should use about half of your
hip then you have good latency otherwise
the garbage collection has to be are
fighting with it we always have to take
care that the new complex models their
HVAC designers are designing still do
not use too much heap and then we have
to discuss again we can handle this we
have defined some stuff we can improve
in our software right you reduce the
amount of objects we have and so on but
this is always an effort it's an
embedded system you have to work on this
it's a Linux of the of the hardware
that's coming with the port so that the
company that's developing the board also
provides us with the Linux and we are
doing some patching of the Linux or
putting some additional stuff on it but
they're the basis is coming from the
tejada so it's a fairly recent kernel
it's 2.6 something okay all right
yeah sure that I actually don't know
because we only get the board from
bulimic pretty another actually involved
in in this in this
I think they source it
what bad sport mo who makes the board
that runs there it's it's from Freitag
good thing to tech it's a German company
and I think it's around fifty something
something around this I'm not sure I
just had some numbers in this here
how much
not much basically just a component
library that's it because we basically
implement the drivers for the hardware
components that Billy Moe gives us and
that's the only tie basically to their
domain apart from the graphical designer
that we've implemented in a way that the
HVAC designers can use it and would like
to have it but apart from that there's
no special time to gauge like well
yeah we you could possibly could I mean
we don't have any other we don't have
any other use case at the moment but
that's why we came here because we think
that's a a generally usable approach at
the moment we just produced verbally but
it's not impossible to think of that we
later on create a product out of it to
to our company does mostly project work
in software development we are not the
software products companies so this is
not our main business making a product
out of it we want to have interesting
projects ok I think we'll have more time
for questions later so we'll just
progress with the demo to get something
on the screen again and then if you have
more questions we can get to it and yet
ok just to explain you what what this
thing is doing that sits on the chair
there normally if you are inside a
building it could be that it gets a bit
warm wherever you are so you might start
flashing a bit and tell the the room
control here to please cool down the
room that you're in normally this has an
effect on some valve somewhere inside
the building that or some central
control that will measure the actual
temperature inside the room and then as
a result of that turns on the cooler
puts in some cold water into some coils
in here and basically cools down your
room now that's how it is usually done
and that's not very energy-efficient I'm
gonna show you why because it could be
that same setting again you're inside a
hot room you want the room cooled down a
bit it could be that or normally it is
the case that you also have a
ventilation unit inside the same room
that provides you with fresh air from
the outside so why not use additional
sensors on the outside that measure the
outdoor temperature
if the outer so it happens should be
colder than the inside why not use cold
air from the outside it's free cooling
energy right so you don't need you you
don't need to cool down water and pump
it into the system at least not for the
first couple of degrees to cool down at
least until you have the same the same
temperature as on the outside so that's
what we've implemented on the board over
there and we're just trying to show you
that oh by the way that saves you heaps
of money if you do that and now what
we're trying to we're trying to show you
that in case you can't see the demo very
much you'll have the system right here
maybe that's better if I try to oh yeah
you if you see the board so we have here
a these are all standard components that
are out on the market some of them are
produced by Billy Moore you could buy
them there some of them are purchased by
Billy mo that they use in their housing
installations so you'll have a standard
temperature indoor control that allows
you to say well I'd like to have 18
degrees 21 degrees Celsius now inside
the building so that's a standard
component then we'll have a actuator
here that's basically the driver for the
water coils right so there's an actuator
here that opens up a cooling water valve
up and down then we'll have the same or
similar actuator for the ventilation
that will open up a valve if more air
needs to come in or less air and then
additionally we've implemented basically
a window that you can open close because
if the window is open right you
shouldn't do any climatization in the
room it's lost anyway because whatever
is outside the temperature will come in
and make your efforts futile then we'll
have two standard sensors here one
outside and one inside these are also
off the rack components that you can buy
and they are tapped into the system to
measure the outside and the inside
temperature
I have a glass of iced water here to
simulate the outside and we can also you
know use the sensors here to make it
warmer by taking them into our hands so
that's basically the system that we have
now what I would like to demonstrate to
you just so that you get a general idea
what this would look like is that this
is the SL design energy a clip space
tool that our HVAC designers use to
design their their models so they will
have just a regular editor as you know
it from from many other applications
they can draw their models on here they
have a library of components at their
disposal on this side here and they can
choose for example on the top level they
can choose so-called frames that's a
large unit that is that is independently
tacked basically to read from sensors
and and and actuators so there's usually
one or more of these logic control
frames and and there's one frame for
example that we call a MP frame that's
the frame that talks to the field
network to the sensors and actors now
this this might have a lesser frequency
in working and the other frame each of
them are running in their own threat and
art acted accordingly because the bus is
maybe rather slow and it has to wait
longer it has longer latency until it
has read all the values and and on the
other hand the logic here can run quite
fast if the model is implemented
accordingly now then you have a few
boxes as you see here that's just the
components from the library here these
are logical components so here we have
something that simulates a constant
value coming in there there's a function
that basically converts a temperature to
a motor position
like that and on the empire MP sensor
frame here you'll have components that
actually correlate to the two devices
that we have on the side there so
there's this NPO PB control that's what
the device is called there's an MP act
MP xop here so these three boxes
correspond to the two orange boxes and
the temperature unit that you have there
and there's sensor values coming in from
this blue box here with the two gray
cables so what does this look like in
the web so if I connect to the first
orange box and lock myself into the web
server I get something as you like you
see here it's basically a schematic view
of a of a room right now the window is
open so there's no climatization
occurring if I close the window the
intelligent intelligent model will
decide whether it should cool down in
Eco mode or in auto mode eco mode is the
one that I showed you before if the
outside is cooler than the inside then
it will use outside air to cool down so
right now I think we'll have to tell it
to make it a lot cooler and now you can
see I told it to to cool down and it
sees that the outside air is cooler
actually can make it much cooler now by
putting this into the cool water and it
will use outside air it opens up the
valve to pull in outside air if I make
the outdoor environment warmer I'm
pretty sure you cannot see the values
that are flashing in green they're
constantly changing but I'm pretty sure
you cannot read it back where you are
but they basically show and
reflect the actual value that I have
here so if I hold on to the outside
sensor until it's warmer than the inside
it's at 21 degrees now 22 and now it's
switched because now the outside is
warmer than the inside so we cannot use
the outside air to cool down and it
turned basically to regular
climatization by using the automatic
mode and using cooled down water from
from the central cooling system so this
is pretty much the demo as we've shown
it and you're welcome to come by later
and check it out yourself from from a
bit closer perspective so going back to
the to the editor just a few more
features that I would like to to show
you what we use a lot or what the HVAC
designers use a lot when they are
developing and which is quite a nice
feature is they can link this model here
inside their desktop machine to the
actual model running on the hardware so
we call this life values and for example
I can use this sensor sorry I have to
put on life mode
so now I'm inside my desktop machine and
I'm through Ethernet I'm hooked up to
the actual hardware I've already
installed a previous version of my model
and right now I can measure the actual
data that is occurring on the hardware
and I see it live here inside my model
so when I develop my model I can use
actual hardware values that that I can
simulate on hardware if I want to do so
I could also simulate denim software but
once you get to a closer stage to a
release you'll move to the hardware but
there's still a very nice feature
because you can see what's actually
happening inside your model on the
sensor and the actuator side so that
means I have here let me see if I
consume that in maybe
oops that was a bad idea
scrolling too heavily so I don't know if
you can read it now but you should see
the actual temperature values here as
they are occurring on the sensors so
we're connected directly to the hardware
now one nice thing about that is also
that I can set inside my model that I'm
running here I can set the D values I
can override them so one thing that we
could do here is where are we to find
mine here I have this is the little
device that is used to set the
temperature I can also subscribe here
and you see now LED one is shining I
think that's the green one
and I could just use let to and say you
should go you should be lighting up as
well so I can set from the model and all
right directly on the hardware values
and that helps a lot when you're getting
closer and two to the release and
developing your hardware you can use
directly the values from the hardware
and change them inside your your desktop
model so that's one thing then what we
also develop them but we also support is
from the tool the deployment of your
application as far as you have it so
it's very easy to connect to the device
to upload a new version of your model to
immediately simulate it on the hardware
to download the previous version to
debug it and so on and you can scan the
bus this is a field bus that actually
hooks up the first orange device with
the second one and the temperature
control you can scan this bus and see
and detect new hardware that is on there
so right now there's three pieces of
hardware on that bus it's the two motors
and it's the temperature control that we
use to to control the temperature and
there's also the two
the two sensors inside and you can
inspect these devices and see all the
values that they are currently having on
their that's what you see here I think
it's very faint now on the screen so
that's one thing that we have this
commissioning inside and then in the end
what we also support is for the HVAC
designers to basically directly develop
these websites that you've seen they can
also do that directly inside the tool
and we have a basically an abstraction
of these Hardware values or if the
values inside the model that we call
data points and you can basically define
your data point you can say well sensor
one in Celsius is data point one and
then you put on a little box on this
editor here you drag on the data point
one and it will show you that life when
you have it running within the web
browser so on any of these of these
values here I will I can have a a
progression what's been happening over
the past few minutes that's the sensor
that we used the outter sensor when I
took it into my hand it was warmer now
it's cooling back down to the basically
environment temperature that you have
here so we'll have life values at the
moment over the past couple of minutes
and on the device
additionally we store all these values
over the past couple of days months so
that you can access them as well no
that's stored on the file system yeah
but still we have constraints and that's
one of the things we're working on now
that we can basically externalize that
and we'll try to find a way to hook up
another device that's basically a
storage where the devices can sent their
data to so that you're not limited with
it with your device because now we have
to thin out values you know over time
and to make you values available a month
ago of course we don't have five seconds
resolution it's gonna be I don't know
five minutes or so but still that helps
the developers and
building engineers to find out what's
happening in their buildings and they
can you know replan accordingly and and
say well there's bad things happening in
this part of the building we should
maybe you know replace the coils or
whatever additionally through the web
interface what you can do is you can set
date and time you can have email sent
out to some administrators or to some
suppliers if you'd like to if certain
conditions occur you can change the IP
settings and so on you'll see here the
data logging you can download the the
locks over the past couple of months or
days you can specify that here and
you'll see some runtime information of
the system as well so that's basically
the Java heap I think so that's the heap
usage since we've turned on the demo as
I mentioned before we are not using 100%
of the tape yeah it's not not so much so
there's certain values that you can
expect through here and we'll also have
a internationalization so you know that
if you sell this component in various
countries across the world you want to
be able to configure your webview as we
call it in the according language of the
country that you're shipping to so when
they install this stuff in Brazil
they'll have everything in Portuguese if
they install it in Germany they'll have
German texts and so on because that's
quite important if you have a global
market right alright so that basically
concludes the demo we're right on time
maybe one two more questions if you have
any yes
yeah we have that too and when we
developed the the end version of this
energy valve that we demonstrated you we
got from Billy Moe basically also
hardware sense that we could plug in and
you could basically manually change the
values that they would receive in a
normal installation so that's that's one
part that we got we got a full park of
these things that you could manually
tweak and set values and what's
happening on inside the building yes
yeah we are using chatty for a web
server the website itself talks to some
form of a arrest interface with with the
backend that has evolved over time and
it's not as clean as it should be but
that's basically what happens so we have
we'll have pretty much by now a html5
application running inside the client
once you connect to it to the front-end
and then that communicates through rest
with with the jetty and jetty itself
hooks into our application to to pull
out the values and for for them I mean
there's many more connections going on
as when the tool is hooked up to to the
actual application on the server to the
engine will use a special proprietary
code protocol to talk to that and that's
what we closed up when this stuff goes
into production so that's just for
development and then there's also SSH to
connect to the device if you need to and
as a department IP network standard yeah
another question yeah
they said they were in at this place
No now the question is whether we can
remotely update the software or if it
talks to a central server at the moment
there's no such thing and a technician
can go to the location and put the
laptop on the on the network and then
four out of the laptop with the design
tool he can update the software but
currently he's also not able to update
the Linux on the base system that's also
already set up of course we have tours
at our development side to update this
all over the network the bootloader dftb
stuff like that but this is not
currently not intended also from the
customer to have this in production
environment and also it's a very very
technical process so at the moment and
that's that's a problem of our
manufacturer that if you have to fix
something on site you basically have to
send somebody of your personnel there
right because a regular janitor doesn't
know how to hook up things and to to get
things straight again so you'll have to
send personnel and that's one thing that
will for the future we'll implement for
them to remotely be able to control and
fix things because it's too expensive to
send people there and to do that
manually and also it's not very it's not
very user friendly to say so you have to
SSH and then you have to enable things
and you have to poke in another way etc
etc so yes
how the question is how we will fit into
the general Internet of Things domain I
think what what manufacturers like
Colima are interested in is to provide
whole solutions for whole buildings and
not just components when you build it
when you build something so they will
work hard to make their own hardware be
able to talk to each other and to to
optimize basically building you say that
building control so I don't think we see
the the place in a large scale that
you'll ship you know
well we'll ship 100 thousands of these
but not like millions or billions that
the small devices that will talk to
something but we'll we'll have a small
internet of things within say a big
building or a building complex that will
we'll talk to each other and and
basically work as a whole together how
you see that yes currently they are not
at that state they have to speak with
different vendors to get some agreement
for example one thing in this HVAC is
always that there's a heating area and
there's the area that is dealing with
air the others are dealing with water
and they are just dealing with air and
they often don't speak with each other
and so if you have a modern even a very
modern house then the the system that
controls the air doesn't speak with the
system that controls the heating now
you'll have two on the wall right and
Philemon was working to have solutions
for that because did as we be shown in
our example sometimes it would make
sense that the the ventilation knows
about the heating system and so these
are areas where Polly Momo is focusing
I'm sorry again please could you repeat
the question
I would say so yes if there's a common
platform something because when we
started with this everybody was laughing
at us when we say that we want Java to
use it we started with with shock Java
processors which were not that powerful
and and but at least they were small and
then but then the hype which the
smartphones came in and all the better
processes get smaller and so we profited
from this so a part of the seven years
was also waiting for some hardware
development and other part is also to
make the product involvement so this
complex product as the energy valve
Kasper showed this takes also from the
HVAC side some years of development so
this this model is very complicated and
they have to think about what makes
sense in the business so it's not that
easy that you need to like that and you
have an idea and a product and you go to
the market so this was the reason for
the seven years
real walking simplified rapid
development that can be used to develop
many type of exact location exactly and
I agree with you I mean we still have
here is the field right so I mean this
thing though still talks to the sensors
and actors through a proprietary field
boss and that's for example something
that you could replace with with classic
Internet of Things right I mean if if
the actuators and sensors would be you
know independent basically and hooked up
through a Wi-Fi or a hardwired
connection you could you wouldn't need
this proprietary field bus anymore right
and this thing would then more act as a
as a gateway within the network to
control these things so yeah I think
you're right that as we go forward we we
will get closer to that mission yes
yeah we haven't we have I have to say we
have thought about it but not say
seriously in a city as we said we will
still be more of a project company and
not of a product company so yes but if
we would see some potential and if we
could could get more miraculous yeah or
or if you could can say say more
interested parties that we're actually
I'm willing to buy money for but but one
very important thing is still that you
have to convince people in the business
about Java we had I personally had had
many talks with with people from machine
industry doing different kinds of
machinery which could profit from such a
system and they have currently something
not that powerful
maybe at some point similar mostly
implemented natively in C C++ and and
you have to convince them and these
people are coming more from the
electrical engineering side all their
stuff there is familiar with C C++ and
now you come as next to a person you
tell them about this system and they say
nice but we have something should we
fire all our employees very much so
yeah but still in the companies that's
why we had these slides with the
challenges and basically lessons we and
one lesson we've learned very hard and
still learn from day to day is that the
people we talk to at our customer they
are not ready or willing to accept say
these software development the software
development thinking of you know having
a platform lightweight things they see
that they profit from the rapid
prototyping site but they're not in the
same state of mind as we are and they
need to be pushed and me personally I
see that the developers in this domain
that will make these that will accept
these things though that's the ones that
will survive all right okay thank you
very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
