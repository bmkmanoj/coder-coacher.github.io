Atlanta I'm Babu Bart with the Oracle
technology Network bringing you another
dev live interview from this event and
my guest for this segment is Gilbert Lau
Gilbert welcome thank you thank you for
you making me my pleasure so tell me
about this session you presented today
yeah my session would actually talk
about how to provision a date effects
Cassandra cluster right on Oracle
Bayonetta cloud is the Oracle cloud
platform in your presentation you
mentioned two open source projects that
relate to Cassandra tell me a little bit
about those open source projects sure
over the cost of last eight to ten
months I invest time in learning about
different Oracle API Clow API where to
provision data sex can sign your cluster
on to Oracle clouds one is on Oracle
compute cloud the second is the Oracle
beta cloud right so basically I have to
github projects right you can actually
go to github.com and under our company
can called ESPN ESPN and you can look
for a couple Oracle project there and
actually the one I use for our compute
cloud I use the the CLI orchestration
framework from Oracle like to deploy
data stacks and the second one is I use
the Oracle the terraform approach way to
deploy similarly the data stacks cluster
this time on Oracle bare-metal cloud so
this stuff is it's up on github
developers are free to get involved in
these open standards good good question
so basically I built it right by myself
but I need people to help and contribute
and collaborate so if you see any
improvement I should make right and you
can create some issues right on my
github project or you can create a
public rest pull request means you can
contribute where you can my project
and actually you know trying you know
playing around my code and make
improvements with me together do you
have other
open-source projects in mind that we
might look forward to in the future
yes actually I'll be improving number
one on the Oracle family the cloud
projects I'm moving I'm planning to move
my current terraform implementation to
use a better be called VM shape write an
article to use the most effective one
the ones more compatible with our
clusters configuration I'm moving that
piece to a we called bare metal VM shape
made one or two coal I mean one or two
CPU type shape and additionally we are
trying to improve you know the
experience of people trying data sex on
the oracle so I'm working with your
product management team on how to
improve the overall a first time you
know Dana said Cassandra in a custom
experience on Oracle cloud how much of
your time do you spend on open source
projects a lot of time actually and and
some project even I work with partners
they may not be open source right and
certainly I think I would say 5050 so I
would say I am bare hands on I need to
do some coding in my daily job but I
would say there would be a feel couple
more github project and trying to open
Foss and so that people can start
collaborating and my goal is to you know
expand you know our customer base and
build upon an ecosystem so that's this
open source is a significant part of
datas Texas strategy not exactly you
know so the open source project is our
team right we upon an architecture team
right on showing what prospect or
existing customer can do on the cloud
okay yeah so but the reason why we put
as a open source is not a a supported
product right is we want people to
really try out right and oftentimes I
see our customers taking our project as
a base so they can further automate I
mean the own use cases right meaning hey
I like this open source project but not
exactly doing what I do right for data
specialist Sandra on different clouds
so I'm going to modify right and they
don't necessary have the contribute back
right is totally open-source right
Apache
although sauce meaning you know they can
continue to refine or if they're willing
to share right the improvement feel free
create a pull request let's dig into
your presentation today what would you
say is the single most important thing
that you want the audience can remember
from that presentation yes I think
number one is a lot of people know my
company is a you know Apache Cassandra
company because we have a whole district
and supported version of Apache
Cassandra
in fact we're more and more over where
we have you know data stacks search data
sector analytics and DSPs DeGraff
database so meaning in my session is
kated my audience on all these great
stuff in a single integrate the platform
from data stacks right we call data sex
and the price right this number one the
second thing is I want to show I mean
actually I showed it to the audience
like on how to use Oracle care from like
to deploy a business tax cluster on
Oracle bare-metal cloud with a single
telephone command what's next for you
what's on your calendar my calendar
seems I'm upon a key tag right so I work
with partners besides Oracle I also work
other major cloud providers or platform
I mean cloud application platform
providers by pivotal right so is on my
calendar right now is I'm considering
presenting at Cloud Foundry summit in
Europe I think in October and also the
spring one platform in December in seven
Cisco okay so some travel coming up in
your calendar yeah hopefully I get the
one you know to do in Basel in
Switzerland
great well Gilbert thanks for stopping
by and talking to me today and good luck
in the future thank you very much first
time today you if you visit developers
oracle.com slash code you'll find lots
of information about upcoming events in
the Oracle code series there are I
something less than 10 left in this this
global tour so you'll find plenty of
information on how you can attend those
sessions or those conferences they're
for the Oracle technology networks I'm
Bob Gruber
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
