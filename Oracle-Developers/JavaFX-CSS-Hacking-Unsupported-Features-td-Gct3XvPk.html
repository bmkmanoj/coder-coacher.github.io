part of the Java platform client group
ones that make Java you guys and my
responsibility has been for the past
several years working on javafx and CSS
so what I want to talk to you about
today is a little bit about how to make
the CSS do some things that you probably
might want to do that it doesn't do
straight out of the box and so with that
we'll get going oh by the way all the
all the demo code the demos i'm going to
show i put all the code up on a github
repository that you can download later
that's like the last slide in this and
the deck so you have to stick around at
the end to find out where to get or you
can just send me email tell you where it
is all right so for the demo so here
I've got this little button with a
reflection and I did this reflection
using CSS which is something that's not
available to you astray out of the box
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you real quickly how I did that and
there's there's going to be a lot of
code and stuff on the next few slides
I'm gonna blow through it a little
probably faster than I should but you
will be able to click yep if you go if
you go look at the Javadoc under the
JavaFX CSS package you'll be able to
follow along with what I've been doing
here because it's really using you know
standard API are out of the standard
javafx CSS API to do what I'm doing here
nothing really magical going on here so
to to do this reflection the the
reflection API or the reflection javac
seen in fact reflection this is it's a
constructor here so it takes an offset
some fraction which is how much of the
thing you want to have reflected the
opacity at the top of the reflection and
capacity to the bottom of the reflection
alright so I want to be ruhr that in CSS
so what I want to be able to do is have
a CSS mail function that I can put in
CSS that looks kind of like this the
reflection and then the the four values
that match with with the reflection API
here and then I'm also going to need
some property to attach the CSS to and
CSS file and I'm just going to call it
my effect so the first thing I need to
do in my in my code it's going to handle
this is implement a sty level property
some of you are in the talk earlier this
morning know how this work and this is
the part I'm going to blow through a
little quickly so if you know if you if
you get lost or can't keep up that's
fine because everything you need to know
is right here in the Javadoc in the
javafx CSS package and in particular
this see if you look at CSS metadata the
Javadoc for CSS metadata has an example
of how to how to do these style
properties and the stuff I'm going to
talk about on the next couple slides so
this method here the supply style method
is called from csss alva set the value
of the property so I'm going to create
this style property it's going to
that you we use generics all over the
place and it's going to be a type effect
I'm going to use a simple style whole
object property which is part of the
JavaFX CSS package and this is the
simplest thing you do you just give it
this and this value here I'm going to
get to on the next slide it's the CSS
metadata that goes along with this
property and I'm also going to override
the invalidated method now the
invalidate admitted is something that
comes straight out of javafx beans
property API and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to call set affect and effect
is to set effect is an API that's on
node you know I can call said effect for
my code so it's not special there and
the get call here is going to return the
value of this object property that I got
right and this then I need some CSS
metadata and what the CSS metadata does
is it tells the CSS engine some things
that needs to know about this fact
property this thing called my effect and
one of the things that says is that this
is how you convert a value that's in the
CSS file into an effect so I'm going to
create this my effective converter to do
that and then there's just some
boilerplate code here and you can look
at the CSS metadata javadoc and that's
all explained with style ases s
meditator javadoc that's all explained
their last thing I have to do is I have
to return this effect CSS metadata that
we just created and again this is all in
a boilerplate code that does that this
is the method this can get control CSS
metadata is a
method that's it's called that returns
the the actual metadata that belongs to
this the CSS metadata that belongs to
this object ok so the CSS metadata
concludes not only the effect property
that it is created but also all of the
CSS metadata from button and so this
thing is going to it's a button it's
just a button that I'm adding an extra
CSS property to so here's where it
starts getting a little bit interesting
where we have this thing called style
converter and remember back a couple
slides i created this my effects style
converter and it's this is the API that
it's going to implement all right this
this convert method is what it's going
to implement and it takes kind of a the
from type and converts it into the to
type so the from type here is going to
be a string and the two is going to be
an effect and which we'll see on the
next slide this thing called a parse
value is something that's created by the
CSS parser itself and as you can see it
means a lot to the CSS parser but if you
look at if you look at it and you
probably figure out what it means but
mostly it's kind of obscure garb
gobbledygook the point here being that
if you try to create your own parse
values you're you're probably barking up
the wrong tree but for our purposes this
getvalue method getvalue method Oh parts
value that's missing out here parse
value has a method on it called get
value and good value on this case is
going to return a string the good value
call from some other piece of some other
parts value might return an array of
other partial values this is very all
worth digging into right now although
you can't call parse value no to string
and get like an XML print out with parse
value looks like but anyway so I'm going
to have if i'm going to create my button
it extends a button and i'm going to
have i'm going to add to that this style
converter my affected converter and
here's again that API that we just saw
in the previous slide which calls
convert take sparse value which takes a
string and returns in effect and then
font is there because CSS uses you know
font relative styles like M values so it
needs to have some font in order to
figure out you know how to convert and
we have 1.2 EMS to actual point that or
pixel values so we'll create a CSS file
that has you know or minus FF FF sorry I
should be minus my effect with that
reflection thing that we just saw saw
now notice the trick here is that I'm
passing this as a string and it could be
either single quotes or double quotes
doesn't matter and these should be
straight up and down quotes I didn't
know how to do that in PowerPoint so
anyway but when i'm passing to my effect
is just this string so when i get back
to this converter here and I call value
get value it's going to return this
string reflection blah blah blah blah so
I can simply just parse that out and
that's what I do so here's that here's a
closer look at that convert method you
call valued I get value and no it's
going to return a string because it
tells me that's where it is right there
I'm going to return an effect I'm going
to do it this way i'm going to say if if
if the string that was
fast in his reflection then I'm going to
do you know i'm going to pick out the
parts of the offset fraction tapas it
bono opacity and i'm a return new
reflection okay so that's that's really
the whole trick right here just passing
the string and the parsing the string
out and returning that the you know the
effect here ok any questions on on this
yes right so so yeah so the question
here is if i hadn't put this in a string
what would i get back well you get back
up our value that has a bunch of other
parsed values inside it all right
possibly it's yeah so and then you'd
have to know you know how to how to step
through that parse value and pick the
various parts out so you probably could
do that really the easiest thing to do
is just to put it all on a string i mean
you know when it comes to doing things
in CSS it really matters how readable it
is to a human you know i think so if you
have it in a string yeah it's harder for
a tool yes it is harder for it too so
this is the easy way
another demo so now we're going to
here's the second demo and now you see I
have the the reflection and I've also
got a blur effect so I've got two
effects going on here and in javafx you
can chain effects together so you can
have one effects be the input value to
another effect I think in this one I've
got it the reflection is the input to
the blur effect or something like that
and it probably doesn't matter so we'll
see how that happens so again i'm going
to i'm just going to i'm just going to
add another little bit here i'm going to
have something called box blur and it
can't remember exactly what the
parameters of the box blur are but will
but is easy there's three of them
whatever they are and i'm going to use a
little pipe symbol here you know the
pipe symbol to chain these two things
together and basically i'm going to do
the same thing i did in the previous
where i'm going to take this whole
string i'll split it at the pipe symbol
and that will give me you know that bit
and then it'll give me that bit and then
I'll do in a loop while to say you know
if I've got the reflection and do
whatever and if its box blur do whatever
and I can just put the input one into
the to the other I didn't feel like
there was much more to go in on that
because it's really the same thing as
the previous stuff just you know a
little extra code
and I think that this woman to be hard
to do maybe because the parser the
parser doesn't know about the pipe
symbol so you know I don't know what it
would do with that there may be some
other piece of CSS code there's no CSS
syntax that you'd use there or just
maybe a space between them you know but
then the parser is not going to know
that there's going to be multiple with
these values that I don't know how that
would come out so here this demo we run
that again this demo is a transition
effect that this is going to get old
fast it's kind of the same way we're
going to introduce a fade transition
will give it you know these three values
the opacity the frog impassive opacity
the two opacity and how long we want
this animation to last but I'm going to
do this one just a little bit
differently and that in the previous two
cases I did the the style converter
right so we used a style converter to
take the parse value and turn out an
effect this time I'm going to do it a
little bit differently i'm going to use
just a regular string converter here so
you know i'm going to pass this string
in and this thing's just going to give
me the string right back basically so
how am I going to take this string and
make it into a fade transition and the
way I'll do that is by overriding the
invalidated method again so what's going
to happen here is you CSS is going to
CSS engine is going to apply that truck
it's going to apply this value to the
fade transition property and then the
invalidating method is going to get
triggered and I'm just going to take the
string which is going to be exactly this
string here all right and I can split
that in the args and get the front value
to value duration and create a
transition out of that now why would I
didn't want to do it this way or the
other way notice here that this property
is a string it's not a transition at all
and so
that might be why you want to do it the
other way that might be why you want to
do it as you know a style converter on
the CSS meta data instead of doing you
know just taking the string and doing
the invalidated method if you care about
that i think the invalidated method is a
heck of a lot easier I'm probably a
little less code to write a little pim
it's all right there what's going on but
again if it matters to you that you know
thats a string and not a transition then
you know do the style converter
and this is just the rest of that method
and you know if I've already got
transitions stop it if I don't they'll
make a new one I set the node to
whatever you know my button is set the
values and play so so really in a way I
mean this is the same thing that you
would do in normal javafx code if you
wanted to create a fade transition on
this node this is you know the code did
you would write we're just doing it from
CSS hey another demo all right so this
is this demo is I'm not actually going
to show you any of the code for this I
kind of changed my mind about showing
this afterwards but in in CSS there's
the idea of the pseudo element and in
this case I'm playing with the before
element in the after elenin the way it
works in CSS or HTML you'd have you know
a before element pseudo element that
would automatically generate some
content so if you think of a bulleted
list the bullet value might be specified
as you know before pseudo element or
enemy might have a URL that appears
after some some link you know the actual
URL value might be a generated content
for the after pseudo element so that's
kind of one of this was playing with but
the reason I didn't want to show the
details in this is because it's really
not work and like it does in real life
CSS right for in order for these pseudo
elements to really work it would take
some code on the
runtime side to make that happen so this
is kind of faking it but you know the
idea is that I could have content before
I could up content after if you pull the
source down out of the github repository
then you know you can look at the code
for this but i will show you this one
which is a breadcrumb idea here the this
thing at the top is the bread come
chrome bar you want to call that and
this is just some sample data for the to
show how it works alright so this is
just a list of data it's nothing the
interesting the interesting part that
we're going to talk about is up here so
if I go through you can see it's kind of
creating a breadcrumb bar right and so
you'll notice that the if there are if
this is the only node it's got you know
this look to it if it's the first one
it's got slightly different first and
last we've got first last only you know
and the first last only these are all
pseudo classes in standard CSS all right
that you might want to make use of
however we don't have those positional
pseudo-class elements in javafx just you
know it's one of the things that's on
the to-do list right
so the way this breadcrumb works is it's
here's what some of the CSS looks like
all right I've got this thing called
breadcrumb bar and I can have a button
that's an only child and this is
standard CSS right here button which is
a last child or a button that's a first
child and the breadcrumb bar itself is
simply an H box with a bunch of children
right so this is obviously the first
child and this is obviously the last
child so you can kind of see where I'm
going with this is that if i take the h
box and I say oh I'm element zero the H
box then I am first child if I'm you
know size minus one then I'm last child
and that's but to do that I need to
introduce some to class States which is
simply done using the this pseudo class
get pseudo-class API which is in javafx
CSS and then the set so I go through I
so I'll go through my list of buttons
this is the middle of a for loop
somewhere and I'm going through the
buttons and I'm saying you know set the
pseudo class state the pseudo class
state changed API is actually API that's
a node so I call button pseudo-class
state changed and i'm going to set it to
the be the last child if it's the last
child the first time of its thirst child
the only child if there's only one child
and the thing altogether in that path
all together all right so there's you
know you can do a lot of pseudo class
state and it's very easy you know this
is all the coded that was required to
add a pseudo class state into this
into the system basically and this is
the only thing that's needed to to say
hey the pseudo class state of this node
is this value yes right so the liquid so
the question is when would you want to
change the style class versus change in
the pseudo class state the the way I
like to think of it is that style class
is something that should really kind of
be static you know every time you change
a style class the styles that apply to
you know this button or some node need
to get all recalculated you know codes
got to go back through and say okay
you've got a different style class I've
got to figure out now what styles apply
to you recalculate all those values so
there's a lot of overhead involved in
that if all you're trying to do is you
know apply a slightly different style
the reason you want to use stop glass is
that you have you know a class of styles
like might be my big text value you know
you got 32 point text so anywhere you
say dot my big text value you're going
to get 32 point pseudo-class States a
lot better and for for example hover is
a pseudo class state so when you hover
your mouse over a button the hover
pseudo-class state has changed there's
nothing that happens as far as CSS
needing to go and find all the Styles it
already knows all the styles that apply
to this button and all it has to do is
say okay you want the style that's in
the pseudo class state and the matching
is very quick so you pseudo-class
pseudo-class stages you know if it's
really state of the of the object of the
note
and you know the superclass state
changed method is easy and you can call
it it's an API public API on node and
you can call it from anywhere doesn't
have to be done in this way I've got a i
created a little toy application that
has a three-state check box and all of
different states that it can be in just
by calling said you know pseudo-class
state change method so it's it's kind of
useful whoo so that's that's this one
this is actually the most exciting one
I'm going to click on this button and
this is going to be magic i'm gonna
click on the button and while it turns
red so I mean but this is really
exciting this button that I just showed
you is actually f XML so I don't know if
you're familiar with our XML but it's
this XML syntax for you know kind of
laying out UI elements there's a program
called seen builder that you can run and
it generates off XML for you so it's
very easy to lay out a UI and FX oh no I
just let it be kind of interesting to
take F XML and put it in a style sheet
and see what happens so you can see I
mean it looks very much like seeing
graph where you got you know stack pain
and here's a button that's actually the
child of the stack painting because
there's a closing of a stack pain and
this little X for a little bit here
which tells it where'd it get its
controller controller is the
you know Java code that goes along with
this that does things like hand you know
you can handle button actions and
whatever else you want so this
controller actually that's all it does
is just handle the button action it just
says set style to read for the
background so really to do this I didn't
do anything different than I've already
shown you I've got us the style of all
property that added with this CSS f xml
and here's CSS f xml down here so CSS
metadata got the my F xml property and
i'm creating my own UI converter which
i'm just calling a data URI converter
know if you're familiar with data URIs
but and in my my F XML style property
i'm going to override the invalidated
methods so in this way i'm doing both
things at the same time right i said
before we did we create our own style
converter and then the second the other
example was when I over i rode the
invalidated method and here i'm kind of
using a combination of both the reason
i'm using a combination of both is
because i really just want to take i
just i really want to get the URL for
that CSS it doesn't have to be done this
way just some of my chose to do because
i thought it'd be fun because then i
just want to call you know I want to get
the URL and I want to get the content to
that URL the value here that's being
passed in is the value that came out of
that URI
data URI converter and we can look at
that right now so here's the data URI
converter if this is a real code it
would be a little more robust than it is
but basically we're being passed in the
value here we know the value that would
get back is again a string the the only
trick here is that I've got to encode
that data and I'm going to encode it is
utf-8 and I'm going to code it as utf-8
because that's the default d code for f
xml why not and so it just returns it so
all is doing here to convert it is
sticking this f xml tag on on the front
and encoding the data and they're
returning of course to use a URL you got
to do a little bit of extra work which
is really not much I mean you just gotta
register your your url stream handler
and URL stream handler is going to give
you back a URL connection and URL
connection is the thing that knows how
to get the input stream how that URL you
just gave it and so for the input stream
I'm just going to return a bite or a
stream and i'm just going to decode the
data that i just encoded its heck nigga
yeah yeah and then they get content
method is again if you remember that
invalidated call that's what it called
is a good content and that's where I
call the F XML loader ok so I get the F
XML loader that uses the UTF care set
utf8 care set pass it the input stream
from up here and it'll deep serialize
that f xml and return the note
and just as a fallback if it is
everything we badly I just returned a
rectangle but anyway so that's really
about all I had for all these little
acts and so I think that so I think the
idea is that you know you can take a
string value and pass it in you can use
a style converter to convert that or you
can override your validated method to do
that conversion it's not really magical
it's you know if you want to be
ambitious and try it without the string
as you can try that is you can print out
the parse value and see what you get out
and from there you can figure out how to
parse it hurting you unwind it any
questions
no all right well I hope you'll find
this useful and can do some fun stuff
with it that's all thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
