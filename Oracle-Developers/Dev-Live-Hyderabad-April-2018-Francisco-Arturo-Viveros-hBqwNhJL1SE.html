Anzio we are live here again had your
bed and we'll be here with Francisco
let's just go very os-- right see vitals
tariffs okay yeah and we're gonna talk
about micro service is an open-source
Francisco are you from okay I am from
Mexico but I actually even work in
Norway actually through the Oracle ace
program and developer champion I'd did
some networking and met some colleagues
and basically working on the same stuff
so they invited me to work with them in
Norway so is this your first experience
at Oracle code yeah yeah I've last year
I wasn't able to attend any of the code
events but I was really looking forward
to do it this year and this is a really
interesting event here because there's a
better thousand people here this yeah so
you have a session later on today
talking about micro services and open
source yeah actually I just I just had
it in the morning and just finished yes
so what did you say I was basically I
wanted to talk about micro services
which is very trendy right now a lot of
developers want to hear about micro
services but also open source because
most of the people coming here are
interested or or using some kind of open
source technology and Oracle recently
has had a big interest also a big
strategy towards open source communities
and like embracing this this kind of
movement so since last year we saw this
this okie project coming along we didn't
know what was that about that the name
is catchy working would like like
Chewbacca Star Wars it's really catchy
it's what micro services so I started
testing it at first it was
I didn't know how to make of it but then
I saw that it's really taking enough but
the community is interacting there a lot
of committee you look in github and the
project is it's been growing a lot and
it's it's it's pretty useful because if
you want to get started with micro
services especially like in the Oracle
cloud maybe deploy some applications to
application container cloud and and do
some work with Kafka even service or
with IOT then micro services have a good
heat and Mookie's is very good framework
to get started to do very simple very
very manageable micro services stuff
it's it has a very low learning curve so
even if you don't if you know nothing
about micro services or if you know
nothing about Scala which is a language
that it uses in a couple of days you are
already up and running and you are
already able to test and see that your
stuff works fast it's pretty fast it's
pretty simple that's a big plus a big
difference from like very heavy micro
services frameworks that can take you
maybe weeks or months to to learn and to
get something running no so so yeah
that's interesting for me and I created
this this demo I fully in the Oracle
cloud I followed some of the
instructions that that you can find in
the github in the readme in the github
from Luque but I also contributed a
little bit to it I added some more stuff
really it's that the setup took me it or
will take you like maybe 10 minutes 20
minutes it's quite fast learning how to
use a component it's also quite fast
it's built on top of very robust and
known technologies such as a scala akka
but but it does it in a very simple way
it wraps the complexity and it lets you
work with this stuff just writing a
couple of lines of code just doing some
configuration very small very neat so
and then you you can have some micro
services working on the cloud so I think
it's it's a great fit for our Oracle is
trying to do with
container native stuff from the cloud
this is a framework that you can use to
create this this component really it
really does work okay so let's talk a
little bit about open source here what
you know I mean you mentioned this is an
open source project yeah so that's how
you found out about that's how you got
involved with actually with me open
source aspect of it right yeah
absolutely because I mean I've I've been
most of my career at Java guy open
source guy I love working to open source
I'm constantly like watching which
interesting projects in github and
trying them so me and one of my
colleagues we found this rookie stuff
with okay it's from Oracle that's that's
news because before Oracle was not
really interested in open source and now
also open sourcing this stuff so let's
try it out and see if it works we were a
little skeptic but understandably so but
then then we started liking it and we
saw that community is actually
contributing to it there are a lot of
people getting involved and the code
works which is the most important
contributions yeah of course it's fully
open source you can fork the project you
can do your stuff you can create new
components new examples or correct some
some mistakes or some things to some
adjustments and you do your pull request
and as to accept it or they give you
some feedback and then it goes into the
main repo so it's fully open source and
that's that's great can you talk about
the value of that process right there
that say you have a company they open
some code
you know you on the outside you work for
somebody else or yourself right and then
you're contributing to this code what's
the value for you as a developer open
source community building contributions
you mentioned that you're really
interested in this concept of being able
to contribute yeah for me it's to two
main things one is that you can access
you can have the code the actual code if
you need to do some improvement or some
enhancement you can do it yourself
the other thing is that like new
releases or new functionality you don't
have to wait a lot right it's it's
really speedy because it's it's
community driven it's open source it's
not like with like with a typical vendor
product that you need to wait maybe half
a year or a couple of years for a new
release a new functionality you don't
know what it's gonna come here it's very
dynamic you know and especially with the
technology such as micro services where
you have to be leveraging all the new
technologies constantly you know so this
this comes around really fast you every
day or every every week at least I check
the rep I see what's there there's
something new I start trying it out I
add my own stuff so that's that's really
valuable from developer point of view
it lets you like enhance your developer
development process and maybe faster be
leaner so how was the community looking
and you are you guys trying to build the
community are you trying is it growing
is it is it more more interest around it
I see that it's growing and there's
interest around it I I I think it's a
good product all right that's what I
wanted to talk about it here to like
create more interest people developers
that haven't heard about it now they
might be able to try it out or
contribute but it has really picked up I
think especially this this year I saw
our commits I saw a lot of new stuff
people are this technology Scala it's
very popular programming language these
days akka is a very popular technology
for working with Kafka with micro
services with zookeeper and this kind of
like you know what with stuff so I think
that the pipe carries a lot of value and
has a lot of potential to keep to keep
growing super is there anything else we
need to cover this project rookie yeah
it's funky I it's really simple if
you're interested in micro services just
go ahead go to the github github
instruction is there clone the repo and
start playing with it and more
importantly start contributing to start
contributing yeah of course that's the
most importantly super well thank you
very much for in Cisco that's a pleasure
meeting you
what's up less risk and thank you we'll
be back again thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
