Atlanta I'm Bob revoir again and my kiss
for this segment is my crab mic you work
for Oracle tell the folks at home what
you do for Oracle and what kind of
trouble you get into there well I enjoy
my job here at Oracle because deals with
docker containers and my day job if you
will is I'm a product manager and in the
container group and specifically the
product that we have on the market right
now is Oracle container cloud service
I suspect that your session today was
about docker containers tell me about
your session so yeah docker containers
is a hot subject we had probably 120
people in the room standing room only
so people wanted to know that docker
with that what that is really you know I
asked the audience okay how many people
here actually have had hands-on with
docker only about four people in the
audience so people have heard about it
they've heard about this thing called
containerization and they're just hungry
to really understand this new paradigm
of being able to run an application
within a container comes up very quickly
and it's very lightweight and portable
so tremendous tremendous interest what
is the nature of that interest why is
docker so hot well that you know it kind
of goes right with what I was saying it
because you can take your code you can
even take existing code or an
application right just read logic you
can run web logic in a container and the
any advantage there even for up an
existing application like web logic or
even the database is that can take that
I can put it in the container and I can
bring that up and I can do that on any
Linux machine server VM whatever
VirtualBox and do that consistently and
all that I need is the docker engine
running on that Linux machine and I can
I could just take that I can run it and
it comes up and it runs the same way
exactly
at time after time so that it gives me
portability it gives me the ability to
spin up a more complex environment very
easily with just launching a container -
it gives me the ability to run that on
any Linux server you know and boom -
whatever flavor of Linux that you might
have Oracle Linux because the docker
engine Excel that possible
so portability scalability the ability
to package microservices than that the
ability to take something from debt dev
through tests through QA staging
production and it runs the same way
across all those platforms that's what
people really are liking is there a
scenario or a use case in which docker
would be a bad idea
well it's funny to say that I mean I one
of the slides in my in my presentation
or what are all the good use cases what
are the hot news cases and that's like
repeatability with dev tests spinning up
a dev test environment very easily we're
doing the front end of an application
where all of your CX your customer
experience your web level is in
containers and you can rapidly innovate
on that those are some really good use
cases right that also may have
traditional backends traditional
middleware in the in the middle and
databases on the back end so it's not
like yes there are some good things like
I say front-end services things that are
ephemeral that containers or
applications that do work and then pass
that on and then could go away that's an
excellent use case database maybe that
might be good for dev tests remember
that scenario where I said I spin up a
dev test environment or QA environment
and I need a date a test database what
might be a great use case for that would
I do that in production I don't know I
mean I think I need to use containers
for what they're really good at which is
coming up quickly processing work and if
they go away I don't care because it
replaced by the next container when you
get home from here do you get to unpack
your suitcase or are you off
another stop well I'm next I'm home for
the weekend fly out tomorrow and then
rapidly turning around and going to
Mexico City okay which is next a week
from today
yet the Oracle code event Mexico City
yes actually as Oracle code in Mexico
City same presentation or some variation
or nothing well with with what's cool
about that is it got me doing two things
we're doing the presentation again
because it's a popular presentation in
fact I just uploaded it on the portal
everybody want to know is your as Europe
presentation up there so I did upload
the presentation I'm also doing the
docker hands-on lab which is a two-hour
take somebody from having never touched
docker from zero to something I always
say zero to something in two hours so we
actually work with the docker terminal
the CLI we do docker commands will
create a docker file we run containers
will create a docker compose WordPress
app publish a blog kill the containers
show persistence of data stuff like that
great stuff so a great way to get your
feet wet yes absolutely well if you'd
like to find that information if you
visit developer dot oracle.com slash
code and look for Atlanta in the listing
of event you'll find a link to the
presentation that we just discussed here
and you'll also find information about
the remaining dates on the Oracle code
tour plus how you could information on
all the sessions that have been
presented so far I don't remember the
exact count I think we're something like
ten or twelve cities into the Oracle
code tour so there's plenty of
information about the sessions that have
already been presented and information
on how you can see the the next batch of
events on the tour we're going to South
America and Asia Pacific region after
this so check it out for the Oracle
technology Network I'm Bob rube art
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
