statement here presentation is really
based on development teams should be
responsible for tracking themselves
through metrics that are easy to obtain
and communicate that's our thesis we're
gonna go through this throughout the
presentation quick thing about me I work
at Nike been hacking developing for a
long time wrote a book about this stuff
yeah okay so a few truths to start off
with oh wait a sec where's my where's my
clicker here we go actually first look
how many people are developers in this
room right on okay good that's what I
hope for somebody wants you to develop
faster if you're like no whatever I go
to work every day and nobody expects me
to really do any more do anything faster
okay I don't believe you that's that's
not true
software is not a slow industry as we
all know anyone who's been developing
for even a few years these technologies
constantly changing architectures
evolving tools evolving you know
everything everything's changing
constantly databases aren't what they
once were
frameworks aren't once they were what
they once were and they're even even
here at JavaOne I mean and that's really
one of the reasons why we come here see
what what's going on and this world bit
is constantly changing another truth
that I'm putting out there is agile
development is more of the rule than the
exception these days so is anyone anyone
in this room not practice agile
development of some kind does it have to
be pure textbook okay there are two
hands three hands Fork and agile means
something different every single team
I've seen implement it but kind of the
idea is that you know you're honing it
as you go you're not totally sure what
you're doing it's not like building a
bridge where you can say I know exactly
where the bridge ends and exactly is I
know how many rivets are going in it
like most we have no idea we're building
so a lot of the concepts I'm talking
about are within the framework of agile
development and yeah there's no there's
no standard agile practice I've never
seen anybody implement it the same way
even you I've seen the same team to it
differently depending on who was on the
team and really at the end of the day
everybody wants happy developers I mean
were the ones that are actually getting
stuff done
DevOps continuous delivery agile all of
these all of these principles all of
these practices focus on the developer
the team you know empowering the team
making sure people have what they need
to to be productive we're pretty high
paid really smart usually pretty
creative resources and you know we're
the ones actually pushing this stuff
forward so really at the end of the day
everybody wants their development team
to be happy because that's really how
you keep fostering a good team that's
doing good things
so for quick analogy thinking about
agile and thinking about how we measure
it you know first of all imagine
yourself on the highway yeah you know I
I hate being on highways that look like
this first okay but you know everybody
is in a car everyone's taken the same
tests everyone has a driver's license
you all know what the signs are they're
the same no matter what road you drive
on anywhere across the country
everyone's gauges are the same in all
the cars so if I told you I'm driving
down the highway at 10 miles per hour
you know exactly what I'm talking about
you've done it before you're probably
doing it right now everybody's using
that same same type of measurement same
concepts everything the same you know
the problem with agile development is
it's nothing like this at all
you know realistically you have people
that make up the team from all kinds of
backgrounds you've got software
engineers
you've got scrum masters sometimes you
got project managers product owners all
of these people come with completely
different backgrounds and really
different definitions in their mind on
how
measure things what things mean to be
good what things need to be done and
that you know that bar of measurement is
one of the things that makes it really
so hard to measure in the first place
that you can go back and say oh yeah I'm
tracking velocity okay you know I've
been on teams that have like a velocity
of 30 and teams that have a velocity of
like 300 which one's better I don't know
you know what you don't know because
it's a relative metric it's totally
relative it's really hard to pinpoint I
mean and really most agile definitions
are not straightforward like if you kind
of go through and you say oh yeah I
understand Angela I know all I know all
the agile principles like first of all
working software is the primary measure
of progress okay what so what is working
software what is that what is that even
me again it's totally different for so
many different different people you know
is it working in the QA environment is
it production are consumers using it
like what is what are you even talking
about then this one's one of my my
favorites directly pertaining to what
we're talking about any measurement
you're currently using has to be cheap
okay so if I pay a bunch of money for
JIRA and it tells me velocity and burn
down so like is that worth some money
that goes out we're talking about is
that cheap you know the value from the
improvement associated with the metric
higher than the cost of collecting it I
mean that's assuming you're actually
using the metrics to improve your
process in the first place but I mean it
is a useful tenant you know that the
point is you don't want to spend tons
and tons of time collecting these
metrics and we're gonna take a look at
how it actually can be really cheap to
collect these metrics with most of the
systems used today on agile teams you
know and the last one I have up here
there
many more tenant of course only measure
what matters and this is one of those
you know sticky ones okay what well what
matters does it matter that I'm happy
yeah does it matter that I got suffered
it but you know what so what are you
talking about measure how do I even know
what matters and you know this goes
we're gonna get to that more in a second
essentially at the end of the day you
the developer know what matters
you're the ones building this stuff if
you look at how we can collect this data
data is everywhere I mean as we all know
every system that we build clearly
captures data oh really do you have
system is to just kind of collect data
and do nothing with it all of the tools
that we're using in our daily lives as
developers are collecting data you can
tap into it pretty easily
you got your project tracking tools
where you're managing your tasks and
bugs source control continuous
integration your deployment tools your
application monitoring all of these
things are collecting data constantly
and being able to tap into this really
allows you to answer some of these
questions that come out of that
ambiguity of agile definitions are you
meeting your commitments how fast you're
going how much code art is getting built
how well is the team working together
how long does stuff take how fast are
you getting stuff to consumers how well
is your system performing and what do
people say about it you know
individually all of these boxes can
answer these questions parts you did
part of the problem especially of you
know in cases that I've seen is very
rarely today they come together in one
place you'll have project managers
looking here developers looking here
developer / ops people looking over here
instead of bringing all the stuff into a
single place to really get a good
cohesive idea of what all this data
means together
because if you do combine it you can
answer a lot of those bigger questions
some of the questions that are a lot
harder to answer that can be ambiguous
and relative in some cases how good are
your requirements you know if you take a
look at your project tracking data plus
your source control data and and again
we're gonna dive into this a little bit
more in a minute but you can get a much
much broader picture of of how the team
is performing what kind of data you're
using to get your requirements done
build your code get your get your stuff
out the door you know when you combine
application monitoring and source
control taking a look at okay based on
exactly what we're doing our things
getting better is this good and taking a
look at project tracking and application
monitoring together you can see like are
we even delivering the right things
seeing how consumers are using the site
seeing how well it performs tying that
back to changes you make can help there
where a lot of these things on their own
don't they kind of get around the answer
but but it's sometimes really hard to
nail it
yeah sorry presentation fail my icons
too don't fade - so some components of
data analytics you know it's not it's
not hard I guess is kind of part of the
point is it's not hard to do this stuff
yeah this data is everywhere it's all
over the place
really getting it into a central place
where you can look at it together to
help answer these questions on your team
it's really kind of one of the keys to
success here all of the components are
pretty common things components of data
analytics first of all API is to get
data out of source systems I'm guessing
you work with ApS all the time you guys
are all immersed if you're not working
with api's at Java one that I'm again
I'm extremely surprised everyone is
working on ApS somewhere
databases to store a dated bit store
dated okay you probably know how to work
with a database bit of a strange I it's
hard for me to even remember an
application I've written at any time
ever it didn't have a database of some
kind and some kind of application to
normalize and transform this data and if
you've gone to any of the talks around a
lot of the different languages on the
JVM these days which are getting really
robust and becoming more popular you'll
see that there's lots and lots of
frameworks that make this stuff really
easy and of course now if you don't want
to actually look at data and analyze it
it probably some kind of charting
framework of some kind again there's
lots of charting frameworks out there
that make this really not that tough of
a task and the charting frameworks are
becoming extremely common and they're
really good and just a quick kind of you
know high-level general architecture the
system that would do this kind of stuff
new your applications your interesting
data it's all out here you know it's
like your source control your project
tracking all that stuff the system do
you use in your application lifecycle so
there's kind of outside the boundary of
the system and then dotted lines the
boundary of the system collecting data
save it and and visualize it so you're
probably like okay well whoa whoa I
don't have time I don't have time to
build an analytic system what are you
talking about like I've got enough stuff
on my plate this is way way too much
luckily no one walked out the door right
before I got to this slide so but um you
know I I'm actually here to tell you
actually you do this this is really not
that hard to do and and really why would
you not measure yourself
I mean development teams are closer to
the data you understand it you have the
context spotting trends for you is way
easier than it is for anybody else
anybody that's kind of looking at the
trends on how the team is performing and
what you're delivering and again we're
gonna take a look at how developing this
stuff is really easy
and the final point which I really
wanted to accent here I think the only
way to have a truly autonomous team is
to measure and report on yourself you
know if you look at I mean I've been on
agile teams that have like a project
manager a scrum master the tech lead big
like an engineering lead all of these
extra roles and and the whole point of
it is really just because leadership
wants to know what's going on and what
they're getting it kind of goes back to
feel like human nature a little bit you
know we grow up in a world where we go
to school you take tests you're measured
every everything is measured you know
somewhere someone in your company is
funding what you're doing someone's
writing your paycheck and you know you
know your level every day maybe you're
thinking how do I solve these problems
you know how do I solve how do I use
code to solve these problems in an
interesting way somebody somewhere is
saying how do I get the most out of my
team how do I know that everyone's
performing well even if you have like a
nice flat velocity and you're like oh ya
know see everything is moving great
everything's nice and consistent okay so
is that as fast as you can go how do I
know that I don't know you know
maybe things can give me be better how
do we get better everyone always wants
to get better and that's why we employ a
lot of the agile practices that we do so
we can constantly keep iterating and
improving as we go and you know if you
don't doesn't like who will because at
the end of the day right it goes back to
people actually care about how your
teams are performing and what what
you're delivering the whole reason why I
started getting into this whole space
because quite frankly I knew what my
team was doing I knew how we were I felt
felt like I knew how we were performing
I could see a lot of problems but I
found it really difficult to communicate
that in the right way and so you know
leadership would keep putting people on
our team to like look
over our shoulders ask us questions and
you know didn't quite frankly it just
got annoying after a while we're just
gonna annoyed at those people saying you
know okay well why don't just ask us how
we're doing well why do you have to add
all these tools and all this weird you
know stuff all around the team to try
and figure out how well we're performing
it doesn't doesn't make sense so I
thought all right fine well I'll just
start doing it myself and you know the
key data source is here again you've got
if you don't have this stuff you should
probably go get it project tracking
systems
you know Giro rally stuff like that
these things all I mean
JIRA I've done a lot of work with it's
got a really nice API it's really easy
to work with rally also does most of
these tool mote most of the project
tracking tools do today AK so soft
telluric they all have ways to get this
data out that's not really cumbersome or
tough source control hopefully you're
using it I don't know anyone still
subversion users subversion is still
pretty common okay anything like CVS or
anything yes okay well I get anyone who
else is well seriously that's it okay I
the reason I really like get in this
context for collecting data is um the
workflows that are enabled by it and a
lot of the metadata that's commonly
associated with it so and again what
we'll see some some graphs and examples
in a little bit but you know the idea
and to I guess you know a lot of the the
paradigms are similar you know if you're
using subversion you want to do a code
review you can do a code review but
there's really not a kind of subversion
idiom for that you would typically have
like a third party tool that sits on top
of subversion and says hey did you and
it you know decorates with the metadata
around it like actually I'm totally
blanking on some
some tools that help you with that but
you knowing sorry what yeah
fisheye fisheye this is one and there's
a crucible which goes long fisheye yeah
thank you
and that really kind of helps you add a
lot of this stuff to your source control
data but with get its built-in I mean
the whole concept of a pull request
adding comments you know all of that
workflow there's really kind of part of
the default metadata and get really
helps you get a lot of really great
useful information out of your source
control system that with subversion
alone it's kind of a pain in the butt
plus you know github stash bitbucket all
the common ones they all have nice HTTP
api's as most recent applications do
whereas subversion is certainly not ours
it's an application and I've worked with
fisheye to try and get data out of it in
the same context and again it's a huge
band but you get like a CSV file you've
got a parse that and I last man this
it's just easier to do HTTP stuff but
anyway that's my take on source control
I've done a lot of evaluation of
different source control you know
platforms for my teams and you know
trying to convey you know I used to you
know where I am we used to use
subversion for everything and there's a
dis yuge kind of developer uprising and
everyone's are I'm getting a little off
topic here but Moragne had a schedule
slips again you know there's kind of an
uprising and people would say man we
want to use git so I was leader of the
team I went to my boss this if we want
to use git and you say okay
why but because that everyone thinks
it's cool he's like that's not good
enough go back so we had to you know do
a little bit of homework one of the
things I always like to put you know in
my evaluation of these tools is we're
looking at it was like what kind of data
can we get out of it how rich how rich
can we how rich of data can we really
get to see how well the tool is working
how much we're getting out of it and all
that good stuff so source control
continuous integration continuous
delivery
I know continuous delivery is more of
like you know mindset a way to operate
or feel a continuous integration is
really frequently associated with
specific tools like Jenkins teamcity
you know I feel this is pretty Atlantis
and you know JIRA bitbucket we got
bamboo up there thought works go was
actually pretty cool was open sourced
this past year the paradigms not one or
a little bit different but this is where
a lot of the I mean this is where the
sausage is made right this is the
factory you've got your tests run in
here you you know ideally if you've got
really kind of robust testing framework
where you're testing for performance and
security you know really kind of going
beyond unit tests you can collect tons
and tons of data from your CI system to
really kind of help you get better
insight into your code and production
monitoring data you know kind of going
back a little bit to the the thought of
continuous delivery if you think about
you know the whole concept behind
continuous delivery where you know
develop the you know ideal state develop
a write some code runs a bunch of tests
and poof it's out in production it's
magic go sounds so it sounds so easy it
sounds so easy and you know in that kind
of scenario your production monitoring
data can give you some good feedback to
your system pretty almost immediately
you know realistically actually can you
know deliveries really hard to get to
and I think even two-week iterations of
moving code out isn't even so bad today
even though lots and lots of people are
trying to move and be more continuous
and more fluid you know at the end of
the day I feel like these first three
project tracking source control
continuous integration product
production monitoring you know this
stuff is tends to be more reactive so
sometimes it's just easier to use this
as kind of like well we did this over
here and then we learn this and it's not
it's not as suited for real-time
learning unless of course you are in
continuous delivery world
yeah and now now I'm dying sorry who
here practices continues delivery okay
yeah sorry I'm more of you than they use
get Wow that blows my mind a little bit
but okay so let's take a look at some of
this data and you know you really kind
of for the sake of time I'm just gonna
really dive into project tracking system
data and source control data and really
kind of looking at the two and some of
these are lessons learned from some
stuff that you know I've worked on
taking a look at this at this chart if
first of all it's all over the place so
yex that kind of looks scary probably no
matter what you're measuring there it's
this there's spikes all over the place
his lines are going in different
directions so at a glance usually like
that that kind of doesn't feel right
very dynamic looking chart you know if
we take a look at these lines the blue
line represents the total number of
tasks complete so how many you know if I
kind of used that the term cards I'm
thinking about like a you know story
card how many cards actually got moved
of those the red line is bugs
that's yex you're killing a lot of bugs
I'm not sure if that's good or bad from
this the yellow line which is down here
a little bit hard to see that is how
much stuff comes back from the QA team
now that's what we called it at the time
recently I've also heard this called
recidivism rate or if you think about
how you're moving code across out into
production there again unless you're in
like a DevOps model where you've got
like one team that's doing stuff they
deploy stuff they did check that you
know the system tested and all that good
stuff no you still usually have the role
of a quality person even if it's an even
if the quality engineer or another
engineer on the team that's making sure
everything that you did is cool like
there's this stuff right does it meet
spec whatever all your tests are making
sure all that stuff is
working so it's pretty interesting to
track how much comes back from you know
in this case what I'm calling back from
the QA you know the whole idea of this
metric is you know how frequently do you
say something is done and it's not
actually done which is actually it can
can point to a lot of a lot of things
and then points you know so story points
your estimates how did you estimate this
stuff so essentially the green lines
your velocity so if you look kind of
does this bad velocity is all over the
place but really this chart is kind of
weird if you think about it first of all
the sprint points the Green Line doesn't
always match the task complete like it
kind of starts to follow it over here
but like what what is this you got more
points done or actually you know looking
at this again like this is this is
totally backwards how do you get more
tasks done than points if every task has
greater than one points in the perfect
world you're get your points are gonna
be way higher than your tasks you know
in this case I think it's pretty plain
to see well maybe it's not playing this
again again it comes down to you're
closest to your data you understand it
better than anyone
for this specific team they didn't
estimate bugs so the fact that this bug
count was so high was the reason why
they were getting so many tasks done but
really kind of in the scope of things
estimation wise they weren't getting
much done but it looks pretty pretty bad
most of the tasks complete are bugs and
if you you look at this from a project
manager perspective or a scrum master
perspective you know one thing I'm
saying like okay you know well actually
this looks okay here feels like we're
kind of getting back to normal bugs are
going down my estimations are growing up
so my features like okay dude this this
is bad but then you know I don't know
man you know from a project managers
perspective that we're getting more done
that's great stakeholders happy great
this huge dip is horrible that's really
really really bad so what what the heck
happened there a team what's going on so
this is where you can start adding up a
little bit more data to really see to
get get a broader picture you know add a
glance it looks like a huge drop in
productivity here
yeah ghin sorry these numbers are a
little bit weird
these are sprint numbers this was like
sprint 56 so here at sprint 56 actually
if you look at our source control data
and this is data from get your and maybe
even just if we don't have a ton of get
people in the house just to kind of talk
about what these lines all mean pull
requests so every time you do a pull
request the the flow that this team
followed was anytime you had any kind of
feature that you wanted to do you'd
submit a pull request so you wouldn't
actually just commit it straight in you
would say you'd you know work on it in a
branch or something like that and then
you'd submit a pull request and say hey
team I've got this change everyone
review it please you're cool with that
and then comments that's when everyone
from the team could jump in and
collaborate and say hey you know maybe
this shouldn't be a static type variable
or whatever something like that I don't
know they can give kind of feedback they
could you know maybe iterate on a
brainstorm a little bit and then merges
is how many of those pull requests made
it back into your main line and if you
if you look at just source control by
itself you see comments going way up so
you see the team's actively
participating and they're doing more
pull requests and you know it's kind of
like a kind of a gentle curse there's so
many more comments it's hard to see but
this is actually a pretty significant
jump go from like there's around a
hundred pol requests to close to 200
pull requests and a couple sprints you
know doubling the amount of work you're
doing plus it's not like you're just
putting pull requests out there merging
them people really are commenting
these tasks to see like they're
collaborating so not only are they doing
more work but they're collaborating more
at the same time so so this really shows
a productivity or you know the amount of
stuff we're doing is going way up then
if you combine that with this gigantic
dip over here it's like okay project
manager there's not a dip there there's
a different there's a different problem
this isn't a this isn't a Productivity
problem this isn't there you we're not
getting a lot of stuff done problem
think we're doing more stuff so what is
the problem you know in this case I
cheated a little bit you know as we as I
built this thing out I just created a
quick crud based form so I could put
something in here called the narrative
and essentially what it is is you know
really kind of the driving forces
leadership leadership likes to see
quarterly reviews so if we're delivering
every couple weeks there's a bunch of
sprints in a quarter and quite frankly
you know if a quarter starts in June and
ends in September I like I can't
remember what happened to June I'm sorry
me maybe it's me but with the amount of
stuff that we're constantly doing
constantly iterating every couple weeks
checking and adjusting and all that you
know if I go back and look at this chart
I'm like yeah I remember talking about
it but I am totally flake you know what
the problem was and so I went in and I
added these these events in here so in
the context of this data over time as
we're presenting it later on we can see
all right well in sprint 56 and these
narratives our first sprint 56 are kind
of copied and pasted these from my
interface I'll show you the interface
for real in a sec sprint 56 was a
release okay so first of all that's why
the huge dip because we released a bunch
of stuff out into production and kind of
the way these things work does we're
kind of sat there and watched our
monitors for a while so yeah we got
fewer things done and then also after we
did the release everyone said okay we're
gonna do this feature next four four
four
great we're gonna start working we
started working and they said no stop we
don't wanna do that feature we're gonna
do a different feature so he said okay
fine we'll do a different feature and
kind of this line alone explains why
yeah we actually put in more work
because we're trying to make the
business happy and get this stuff done
but it was a huge dip in how many story
points we got done it was a huge dip and
how many tasks we got done because
midway through the sprint we dropped
everything that we were doing and
replanned and then move forward so you
know I was not sure if this has happened
to you this seemed to be like a common
thing in my life so I feel like it would
be common to most people okay but um you
know this is the kind of stuff where you
know without without combining this data
together it's really impossible to see
what's going on under the covers here
you know if I were to add production
monitoring in here would be an even
better picture because essentially you
would start seeing a completely
different pattern emerging right here
right when we did this release and then
you kind of see what like okay this huge
giant spike here pushed two productions
massive heroic effort to get our stuff
out the door you know trying to cancel
tech debt so our consumers weren't
getting crashes and stuff you know did
it work did it pay off was there a dip
and crashes or something like that this
is a mobile project so um that was
something we were looking at okay
so let's get to it it's actually take a
look and see how we kind of can do this
stuff let's get data from an API we'll
get into a database and we'll get some
nice charts so right sounds it's pretty
simple pretty simple stuff so the
technologies that I'm using for this so
you can love it or hate it I don't care
I Cal I'll tell you why I chose this
stuff
here's we're gonna use first of all
Grails why because it's easy
there's lots of great plugins just makes
development so much simpler convention
over configuration I love this stuff you
know I was a Java developer moved to
Ruby and then move back to a Java shop
and they were they were like okay
everything must be Java and I was like
okay and I got back into Java and I was
like huh man right over Bros this stuff
was hoof
even without annotations and everything
that's that's kind of what drove me to
Grails I'm like okay Ruby rails groovy
Grails runs on the JVM so I can kind of
at least sell it back and say it runs on
the JVM Ram is kind of what you guys
want and it's really easy to use we're
gonna kind of go through just a few
commands to see how fast we could build
something like this I'm also gonna use
Mongo again it's easy it's just easy to
use you download it your own command and
then your database is up and running and
if you combine that with your plugins
this thing is just like magically works
with Grails it's super cool and it has
built-in MapReduce so in this talk I am
not gonna go into MapReduce or really
talk about it too much but I'll suffice
it to say that you know Matt MapReduce
allows you a pretty simple way to take
lots of different data from different
systems and turn them into a nice
normalized set of time series data time
series data is what we're gonna use for
our charts and so I like I like Mongo
for that it's built in argue about
performance all you want but again we're
using this to measure my team not to
handle like web-scale Twitter traffic or
something like that and Google charts
yeah you probably guess why I picked
this because it's easy and there's lots
of different charts it's actually really
cool if you haven't seen Google charts I
would say go check it out it's well
supported to project it's constantly
evolving all the charts I've shown so
far are all Google charts and we'll take
a closer look at how they all work and
really kind of just double-clicking on
the system super simple like I'm not
trying to reinvent the wheel or make
anything insane here you've got a weapon
face which is Grails that's how humans
interact with the system your database
and then you know in this case I drew
this separately originally you know I've
literally kind of written this system
like four times over the last couple
years just cuz every time I change teams
requirements I just rewrite because it's
pretty easy to do
you know I had this separate but really
this can run up in your Grails
application as well so project setup
now again I'm cheating here for the sake
of time instead of bringing up my my
command line and start typing this end
I'm just gonna kind of show you this
stuff and anyway it makes it easier when
people download the presentation later
they can go check out the code so with
these you know four lines on your
command okay actually are a quick caveat
I'm assuming that you've installed
Grails I'm assuming that you have Java
installed on your machine and I hope
everybody in this room has Java
installed on their machine if not why
are you here but these kind of be some
Microsoft conference or something going
on somewhere so if you there's actually
a tool and I've got in my references
called gvm it's the Vegas groovy version
manager or Grails version manager
something like that GBM and it's really
great tool for managing your Grails
dependencies and all that you can just
download that and then you can install
Grails groovy Gradle bunch of groups
kind of things and very easily
yeah but it's pretty convenient once you
have that you know using your Grails
command line you create the app that
essentially creates your scaffolding for
your entire web application really at
that point you could run it and you've
got a web app it's pretty nice so now
that you did that you created a
directory in this case because the app
is called project lifecycle intelligence
that's the directory we're going into
and then you create a few domain classes
so my domain classes essentially
represent
yeah sorry I thought domain classes
limit domain classes to the next slide
okay and then before I get to the domain
classes a few things you add your
plugins and you know this is as easy it
is to get your your you can attach to
restful api is with this here's all of
your object relational mapping with
Mongo right there and there's your
Google charts so three quick lines of
configuration and all that stuff is just
plugged in it's really easy to use at
that point so here's our domain classes
so you know in this case and another
quick caveat you know for the sake of
the presentation I used an early version
of of the system you know and I built
this thing I literally hacked it
together and I guess that's really kind
of maybe part of the point here you know
it's okay to hack this stuff together to
you know show some simple things at the
end of the day you're using your tools
as an engineer your tools as developer
to be able to communicate stuff better
across the enterprise and so you know in
this case I just created properties for
all the different things I wanted to
show on my charts this static map with
Mongo that takes care of all my object
relational mapping essentially so now
that that's there when I just do you
know source control data save on my
object it just magically saves into
Mongo pretty convenient the static
mapping I just put that in there to pre
stored stuff it actually doesn't work so
well on the server side so I kind of did
that on the client side too but and then
right another reason why I love groovy
so much no getters and setters like I'm
sorry but after doing this for a while
getters and setters just to annoy me if
you think about you know the
object-oriented theory encapsulate okay
so why would I encapsulate to kind of
hide logic or whatever yeah okay but be
your knots but that's poor practice now
so why it's just so much easier to do
this way fewer lines of code
okay you're right you're right
that's true but it's so much easier to
not have to worry about them are you
okay okay
fair enough
and then pretty much at this point you
just come compile it and then you can
generate all of your scaffolding with
another few lines of code and then at
this point you've got all of your crud
forms set up to pretty much do whatever
you want and a couple more pieces the
first is just kind of like a common HTTP
request you know and again it goes back
to all the data that we're trying to get
in my specific case it'll be different
maybe depending on what systems you're
connecting to have restful based HTTP
based api's so it's pretty simple the I
mean is you know it's not two lines of
code sorry but it is pretty simple to
just take get a URL get some JSON back
you know and then implementing that
based on each type of system you want to
get data from so in this case I'm
getting data from github again very rich
API tons of data in the github API
really like it also have used stash a
bunch they've got a great a bit bucket
has a good API all of those I've I've
worked with all of those I know there's
probably more out there but essentially
you your get your JSON back you just get
whatever you need out of it populate
your domain object so you guys are here
I'm printing it out but you want to save
it at that point and then really same
thing from your project tracking system
data where you're getting your data from
JIRA and again just kind of
parsing it so really it's just kind of
this this bit of code here that's gonna
be different based on whatever system
you connect to just gonna have to look
at your Jason structure and figure out
how to get the data out put it into your
objects save them and almost done the
last part is actually putting all this
data on the page itself so another kind
of formatting glitch there but
essentially and this is these are
actually in two different pieces the
first unformatted ugly text at the top
would be the text you would put in
what's called your GSP page basically
your view in your web
model-view-controller and then the stuff
below is what you put in the controller
of your Model View controller where you
set up your columns for your graph you
get all your data from the objects you
just saved whoop and then oh my gosh is
beautiful then you can do all kinds of
different stuff you know at this point
you know taking a look at you know
a couple examples here this actually
I'll let me get to this more in a second
let's kind of break the data down a
little bit so if we take a look at a
couple different views I'm sorry for the
ugly for banding again took people's
names mostly out so who wasn't putting
real people in the presentation but you
know if you take a look at just a few
more examples of how this data can be
combined so in this you know going back
to productivity developer productivity
if you add project tracking and source
control management data and so I'm
looking at you know these these two guys
specifically you know this guy Dave ok
he's he's pretty much our rock star you
know but because he's getting a ton of
stuff done but it's kind of interesting
how he does have a lot of stuff coming
back from QA you know that if I guess
the real interesting story here is when
I look at Adam you know from again from
the project manager's perspective he's
really not getting much done at all so
that's bad so you know project manager
hat on Adam what's going on you're not
getting stuff done this is this is bad
but again if you pull that pull in that
source control data also you can see
that he's actually reviewing a lot more
code than most of the rest of the team
so he's not moving a lot of tasks
himself but he is contributing to the
success of everybody else so you know
all kinds of reasons could go into this
you know in this case believe it or not
Adam was a senior developer so seeing
this kind of productivity drop it was a
bit of a shock to some people but
realistically it's the work that he's
doing is making everyone else more
productive and I think it's pretty clear
to show that here and you know another
example really this is kind of from from
a product owner perspective and they're
really the story behind this data is
you know we had a feature we had to go
out the door and so management came down
and said okay we've got another team and
they're gonna join your team they're
gonna help you get this stuff done right
more people means move faster like okay
when are they starting the next week
okay great well where are they gonna sit
we're out of space well they're not
gonna sit here they're actually far away
in a different time zone okay that makes
all that harder manage so how are we
gonna do this you know I don't think
this is gonna help us be more productive
no it will we're sure of it
okay and if you really look at how
things start off you know these guys
here are these this other difference so
here we have that Adam and Dave look how
their productivity now is kind of way
down and these guys up here are getting
a ton of things done revealing that what
they're getting done they're all bugs so
that might not be great and if you look
down here at source control management
you have the exact opposite trend where
you've got the internal team or it is
doing me look at the amount of code
reviews that they're doing as compared
to like these guys are each other's code
so I mean no wonder why they have so
many bugs this you know so so-called
like oh we're gonna get better we're
going to move faster is it's completely
counterintuitive more people you had on
the team the bigger of a strain it is to
the original team we're spending all of
their time reviewing this code and then
even if I take this the same team you
know a little while later you've got the
same exact trend continuing like it
never even really normalizes where
you've got this other team and okay so
finally they're getting story points
done great and they're they're getting
kind of more tasks done than bugs so
it's they're improving from that
perspective but but then if you look
down here the number I mean they're
they're still not really participating
in the team they're not reviewing each
other's code and they hit that it has to
to these guys you know this internal
team here
pretty significant you know we're still
spending most of our time reviewing code
instead of doing pull requests and
actually getting things done and you
know the the kind of important thing of
showing this you know the first chart in
the second chart is being able to show
this data over time because if of course
like one sprint worth whatever a month
worth I don't know it could be an
anomaly but showing this trend over time
really kind of helped us drive the point
home the leadership like okay we're
totally open for having a bigger team
and working with our partners but I mean
you know this this really isn't isn't
working so well for us kind of the way
we're organized now people are set up to
collaborate and work together it's a
huge drain to the team and you know and
then and then maybe the last interesting
thing is these guys over here they were
off and away in a different time zone
look at how many things came back from
QA I mean they're pushing stuff over the
line again it I think that really
pointed to having maybe not not very
cohesive management to a distributed
team because you know these guys are
like way ahead of us you know different
time zone getting stuff in throwing it
over the wall and then the basically the
next day our QA team comes in and says
nope send it back so that's not good for
productivity you know where again they
were just how'd that shop work well they
just put in more time that's not a very
healthy way to treat your team so you
know they were able to show that they
were getting a lot done but again
digging into the data we were able to
really show like I mean maybe this isn't
the best way that we should operate um
so just to kind of wrap up here just a
little bit of communication advice you
know as you're building some of this
stuff out I know this I've found as I
build these things myself a lot of times
I started geeking out on it and like
haha man cool I can find this and I
could do like real-time bug tracking and
all this stuff that's great
but uh you know
your leadership team doesn't care about
that probably you know the higher the
link in the chain I originally said pay
grade but I kind of hate the term pay
grade so you know the higher link in the
chain the simpler the data has to be so
I'm not saying that leadership is dumb
but you know they're worried about
different questions you know they're
asking different questions they're
they're thinking about data differently
they want to see trends they want to see
aggregates they want to know you know
you know what what is that big picture
and if you're gonna commute communicate
something up the chain have a point like
if I just took those lines out of
context and I wasn't talking through
them you guys would probably be looking
at that and saying what okay you made a
chart Thanks well I have no idea what
you're talking about
so it's important that you use only the
data that you need to get your point
across instead of just being like oh
cool look at all these things I can
chart no people probably don't care but
at the same time you know this is
supposed to be a tee a tool for the team
goes back to the title to talk we're
just you know democratizing these
metrics you know it goes beyond yeah
it's important to be able to communicate
this up to leadership but at the same
time it's also important to use this in
your daily practice to make sure you're
using this data to improve as much as
possible you know the girl we're back to
kind of the code review part you know
seeing how that's working you know we
got on the call with that other team you
know eventually we just have to keep
drilling engines I'm like okay guys we
kind of want everyone to participate in
this look at this data like the data is
not lying and we really would love to
see this this trend getting better um I
know for me yeah to get like I can geek
out over this stuff sometimes I like to
see like the daily blips on the screen
but that's me and ensure that data is
actionable you know and this goes back
to the whole time thing and keeping it
easy like I again like a couple times
I've gone off and I've found damn like
ooh I've got this data I've got this
date I've got this data it'll - it all
says together but I can't do anything
with it if I can't have any
action on it or from not really if I
don't have a question a lot of times
it's just noise so it's great to have as
much data as possible just worry about
like and again it goes back to you guys
being as close you're as close to the
data as you get this is a bit about how
you're working as a team so make sure
you're using this in your planning
sessions to make sure that you know
everything you have is actionable and
this last thing I find to be
controversial and I don't know why
because I love me like I love
meritocracies I love them some people
love them some people hate them you know
I've I've had lots of arguments about
about this kind of stuff I'll say
because it's my opinion the
meritocracies are okay it's cool I don't
see like it you should be able to foster
a healthy competition within the team I
guess the the key there is keeping it
healthy like not not trying to you know
put people on the board so you can throw
darts at the music oh yeah the bed
should commit you broke the building
whatever yeah okay everyone breaks the
build you know right it's it's not bad
to take risks risks are actually a good
thing to take from time to time
but I think you know using this kind of
stuff you can help build like a
meritocracy to kind of help see how
people are affecting trends and stuff
you saw how I slice the data in a couple
different ways one was by team that's
really key to how the team operates near
the other one I sliced it by team member
the whole reason I even did that was to
get the point across to leadership to
say hey you know this model you have
it's not really super great maybe I
could have even aggregated like team a
and Team B to make it even more clear
and so that's it here's the references
there on the slide if you want to go
people you can download this one it's
done
also yay there's the book it's actually
a code up there you can use you can get
extra discount on Manning's early access
program books if you use that it's a
Java one code so that's all I have
anyone have any questions yeah
huh
so how do you deal with the challenge of
dashboard you know what I'm measuring
differences right because they draw the
wrong conclusion yeah
so yeah you're absolutely right kind of
the way I've done it is I just you know
it's a web app I just create different
pages for different kind of views here
cuz yeah again like I love seeing the
data like daily leadership hates that
they like to see it quarterly the
project management team likes to see it
per sprint so aggregated every couple
weeks so typically what I'll do is I'll
just create a separate controller I mean
in this context I'll create a separate
controller which represents a dashboard
and I'll just throw different charts on
there based on who I'm communicating it
to or who I want to see it but if you're
asking like ah like what was that did
that answer the questionnaire
on any projects I've got a triangle
right I can make you faster yep and I'm
constantly trying to figure out those my
- words are really normalized so I may
at some point I'm gonna take a risk here
and introduce bugs yep and so that's
really hard tells a story and yet
management may want to consume that
information yeah yeah no you're you're
right it's hard it's hard it takes
explaining it goes it goes back to that
whole concept of the narrative where I
try and annotate the charts with like
this event happened here and this event
happened here sometimes with the context
that you're talking about where it's
like well I mean you know if I think
back like if you've got a release you
know typically I just teams that I've
worked on right before a release like
the sprit before release you're not even
working on features you're just
hardening things so you're fixing bugs
are killing tech dead you're trying to
make sure that this thing is not gonna
crash when you give it to people and so
from that context you know if I can map
releases with that that kind of trend it
does show like you know right before a
release killing a huge amount of bugs
like that's that's normal for us and
kind of if you look at the production
monitoring output afterwards
crash rates go down with every release
but this is actually a good trend to
have it kind of does tie back into
though like how do you want to operate
cuz it that it's this is a great it's a
great question cuz I've had this same
exact like I'm thinking back to
conversations that I've had where it's
like well you're you you're bug your
bugs are off the charts like well yeah
but it's right before release like well
but but but your clothes are off the
chart like well yeah but I mean kind of
if you look at the span of this release
and the Sprint's that it took to do this
and you look at this trend over time
like this is totally normal for us we
typically accrue tech debt to get to
move faster to basically get to this
false sense of positive this false sense
of security like the features done you
know really like marching towards a beta
or whatever something like that just
stop everything you're doing for like a
one or two spritz like months worth of
time just to kill all these bugs you
know that that is actually a great
example why I love this kind of data
because that kind of helps people
realize some of the behaviors they've
had over time you know and realizing
like I mean in this specific instance
saying okay
well maybe you know if we kind of reduce
that sprint to sprint expectation we can
get out the door like we can kind of
plan it better instead of always putting
like a month's worth of buffer in the
end that months worth of buffer is
really because we're doing a crappy job
of realistically managing kind of our
tech debt over time that makes sense
it's kind of your best turns like that
when you start getting in those complex
trends over time it's a it's it's hard
to just point to a charm like oh yeah
unless you accept that on your team
we're like oh yeah there's no like we
always have a month's worth of buffer
because you know if this is just how we
work or and maybe that's okay like you
know mate because again you know maybe
you have like a beta period or something
where you don't care if it's buggy but
you don't want to be tweaking features
in the beta period so like you allow it
to go out there with a ton of bugs with
the full intention of cleaning it up
while you're getting that user feedback
so
yeah it's great good question yeah yeah
oh sorry what you can find them it's
somewhere you know what that's a great
question I am not even hundred percent
sure it is on the it's somewhere on the
Java one website yeah yeah okay so that
is a great great question
and like just so you know my current
role is I'm I actually moved from the
engineering department to the QA
department specifically because the
really kind of the department I'm in
wants to engineer quality better so
instead of using kind of traditional QA
people they said well I'll just put a
bunch of Engineers in front of QA and
maybe they'll make it better yeah woo
it's been exciting and fun but that is
such a complex question how do you
measure quality because it's almost like
what part of quality are you trying to
measure like when I think about quality
you know I take it back to you know
where I am our CTO laid out the
principles of how he expects things to
work and he says things need to be
secure that's to be maintainable them to
be reliable available and they have to
perform well in that order and so what
we've done is we said okay well then
that's how we define quality if these
are all the principles of how we're
supposed to operate well and what makes
good software to us that's quality and
then the tough thing is how do you
define all that stuff so and then you
know trying to automate all of that
through our deployment pipeline so you
know maybe you know you have some kind
of specific security threshold based on
what you're doing there's some kind of
you know performance is another kind of
nebulous thing like well is it a webpage
is it some data collector you know what
what kind of quality metrics do you care
about may it's a combination of you know
whatever you know and then you know
ideally you can get into a world where
your development team is writing tests
along with their code like ideally that
essentially becomes your quality
definition so making sure that all those
tests are passing they're kind of
meeting the thresholds and criteria
yeah but that but then also tie that
back into production monitoring data to
see how people are using your stuff how
frequently they use it see like how well
a feature was designed or thought of you
know there's all the you know crash rate
and all that so cousin of that and then
maybe the kind of the final piece is you
know team quality like how well is the
team working together and that goes into
goes back to the recidivism rate and
like things coming back from QA you know
like if that number is off the charts
high your team probably isn't a quality
team like you're not operating well and
having a team that operates well ends up
usually translating into good will or
well built software and then well-built
software you know assuming that actually
meets the needs of the consumer is
usually good so that's it that's a great
super complex question yeah yeah totally
another great question you know to me it
comes back down to like the team should
be responsible for it I feel like you
know for the team should report out I
mean I think kind of the metrics that
I've laid out to me are kind of I've
seen them be pretty standard across
projects where I can use these specific
metrics to point to trends that I I know
and understand but you know different
teams are gonna look to different things
you know I'm all for sharing code
between teams but it's a great question
like if I then go to my bi team that
does all Python development and they
know how to use Django and they don't
care about Grails with a JVM at all like
well you could do all this stuff with
Python and Django like you don't have to
do it with Grails or you can use your
language of choice if you know it's so
so sometimes it's hard I mean I I know
that how hard you miss leadership of
things the end of the day I feel like as
long as you convince them that the
ownership belongs to the team you know
it's the team's responsibility like you
tell people what you care about and
leave it to them to report it back up to
you and maybe you can have like
standards or a specific project that
people could use if they want but you
have to give the developers have to have
the freedom to be creative and report on
this stuff in their own way yeah that's
it's my take on it but exactly yeah
totally agree exactly yeah I was an
engineer that's like a credo of it you
hired super smart really expensive
people to sit in these chairs trust us a
door cut I don't yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
the system at some point where they say
yeah you know actually you know it's
it's funny because you the first time I
built this I put this out there and you
know I showed it to my manager at the
time and you know he kind of said the
same thing he's like well how do you
stop people from gaming the system and
as I've seen like so I've been using
these techniques for a few years now I
think as long as you make it a tool that
help people understand how they're
working and get better then they don't
game the system
I think people game the system when this
is like some overarching and Nic
initiative where where someone from
leadership says you must have this pull
request rate you must have this you must
have that been people like okay well I'm
gonna do whatever I can to get those
numbers yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah exactly yeah make it a tool
for the team and as long as it's
valuable to the team then people won't
game the system because they'll
understand hey these are good things
that I care about making better so sure
all right yeah yeah it's a good question
you know yeah work smarter not harder
I'll say yeah this is just because I'm
you know I go back to like in fifth
grade I had a math teacher that told me
like the best mathematician is the
laziest mathematician and you know yeah
yeah I'm lazy I want the shortest
possible path of the solution you know
if I I know if I'm working on a project
by myself if I can plug into this and
it's super simple then maybe maybe I'll
look at it but typically I won't I don't
use this stuff I mean the real key thing
is using it as a communication and a
collaboration tool so if you get into a
point where you've got like even a multi
developer distributed team if you get to
a point where you do you have people
kind of jumping in and out or a bunch of
part-time developers this actually
becomes really really valuable and I've
seen it work in that context because um
what I know and again this is kind of in
a large company context maybe not like
the open-source world where people are
just jumping around as they kind of want
to but you know I've seen all kinds of
stuff where you see like one developer
be like horrific on one project and
