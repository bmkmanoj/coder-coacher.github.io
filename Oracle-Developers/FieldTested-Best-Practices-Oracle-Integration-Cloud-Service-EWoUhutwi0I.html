developer lounge here at the
intersection of Oracle OpenWorld and
Java 1 I'm Bob rue Bart with the Oracle
developer community and I'm here with
the authors of I have to look at my
notes forgive me
implementing Oracle integration cloud
service this is Robert Van Vulcan and
and Phil Wilkins gentleman thanks for
being here Phil trummer you're doing
double-duty today this is your second
interview in about an hour so let's talk
about integration cloud service you guys
are presenting a session here on that
talks about integration cloud service
what are you going to cover in that
session today's session there really is
going to take some real world practical
challenges of using ICS and showing how
to address them how to do things with a
lot more ease than perhaps you might
expect like configuration control
dealing with very large gamers from
third parties and things like that yeah
and other things we do we have the use
of JavaScript functions to extend your
integration that's a that's a very cool
one and we're doing also extending
integrations or connecting with your
database to and REST API so we're going
to use the REST API so that you can make
with Apex
and also with the rest data services
from Oracle so where do people get it
wrong in went in what context here
you're talking about in your in your
presentation you know you certainly talk
about best practice yeah so where do
people often what trips people up about
using integration cloud service
it's not so much tripping up but
sometimes it can be a little bit less
obvious how to do certain things take
configuration management for example if
you run in a separate instance for
development fees production you want to
be able to control when things go into
production into the Umbrella production
service and it's not necessarily that I
just had to do easily and cleanly and
there are tools out there the api's and
there's the a-teams ripple tool that
allow you to do very cleanly very simply
so we're going to be talking about that
here's some tricks these are the things
that you might want to consider to try
and make your life a lot easier you're
here yeah so we're trying really to to
give some examples and how to approach
certain things the best way instead of
you know giving the the audience some
tricks and how how to do it easily and
not find the strain struggles we have in
in projects with ICS so the data so my
our main focus is to really let the
audience know how to yeah
if a those maybe those trips interesting
interesting now you've got
like forgive me for looking at my notes
but you know I'm old and the print on
this is really really tiny you've got a
book coming out I think in the spring on
blockchain talk about that yeah yeah so
writing a book about blockchain or
across Oracle's so that's it we'll go
through the steps of also talking about
what's blockchain in the context for
Oracle customers and developers what's
what will it change for us how to impact
our lives and also our customers and of
course we'll talk about blockchain and
what it is what the building blocks of
watching and besides that also look at
and implementing it and using the Oracle
blockchain cloud service that's
announced this open world and I also
have some chapters looking into view
implementations in certain industries so
let letting the customers for the juice
Oracle in those industry know what you
know what it will change for them and
how it can change for them for the for
the best so you guys are as we mentioned
you're presenting a session on
integration cloud service you just
mentioned you're interested in
blockchain what you guys are here for
the week
what sessions are you looking to attend
what are you looking to get out of this
event what topics are really top of your
list so I'm personally looking to see
and hear how are people making use of a
POS and ICS and cloud integration in
general yep I work with a number of
clients but it's good to hear how other
people are making use of these
technologies and see if there was some
interest in applications that I hadn't
thought of yeah so look for inspiration
and ideas and hearing how people have
adjusted it's quite often good to hear
that people have arrived at the same
answers as we have in demonstrating
ideas or solving particular problems
because it validates the
yeah we're on the right path and not to
mention the opportunity here to talk to
the product management about what's
coming so we were ready for it we
understand how to leverage it and what
challenges might be confronting us in in
their future so that we can go in there
our customers going for us yeah so for
me yes I'm really into the emerging
technology currently but still on the
integration space so for me the main
topics are are the market services also
API management the whole service
functions and civil stack that Oracle is
going to provide natively use of talker
communities stuff like that so that
mainly the main sessions in my agenda
this week yeah and of course blockchain
so your session is coming up I think
what right after this right 3 o'clock
what one point do you want the people
who come to that session to take away
what's the one key takeaway if they
remember nothing else by the book what's
the one thing you want them to take away
I personally I hope they took away the
fact that ICS is a really effective
integration tool with the new features
that are coming we aren't going to focus
on those this time but there's some
really exciting features coming on ICS
or integration cleared is is going to
become but if they take it away
you know it's easy to use the the
challenges are more just step back think
of before acting and it will come easy
I'm on hopefully they'll take that away
and hopefully perhaps if they don't buy
the book then come visit the website
that we maintain where we're compiling
ongoing ideas and there's new features
of release we try and address those
features so they understand and can see
that there is a source of knowledge that
we're pulling together for for people to
use in where do people find that that's
Oracle into Oracle - integration but
great Robert what about you what's the
one key point you want people to take
away from your session yeah show them
how powerful integration cloud service
is that not only does simple one day to
be integrations but that you can do
process map yeah you can really make
orchestration work with it that's really
powerful and with all the 100 plus
adapters that are now currently
available there's no integration
challenge you come to with ICS guys good
luck with your session this afternoon
thank you for stopping by Dixon and
thanks for watching I'm Bob brew Bart
with the Oracle to dark Oracle developer
community thanks for watching and stay
tuned for more interviews from Oracle
OpenWorld in Java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
