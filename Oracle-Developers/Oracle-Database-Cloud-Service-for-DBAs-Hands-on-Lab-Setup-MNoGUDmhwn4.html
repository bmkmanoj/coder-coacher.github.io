services workshop setup this is the
self-guided version and as such it needs
some steps to set up the account we also
offer an instructor-led version which
has all the environment set up for you
in advance so this this video walks
through the setup process for those
wanting to run the workshop on their own
in a self-guided fashion when you first
access the instructions you're going to
come to this site and it's going to just
notify you that we do have in this
particular workshop two versions the
instructure version and the self-guided
version it's just a notification and
then once you go here you'll have to
make a change to the instructor-led and
select the self-guided version and the
self-guided version it makes a slight
change you'll see in the drop down list
setup steps for the self-guided labs and
it's the setup steps that I'll be
walking through today once you've done
that you can proceed on to lab 100 lab
200 300 and 400 so let's go on to the
setup steps themselves and the first
thing you need to do is to log into the
cloud console and create a DVCS workshop
image you're going to go to
cloud.oracle.com you're going to log in
and when you log in you've got a couple
of different options depending on what
type of account you've got when you sign
in you'll come to this screen it asks
you to select your account type and
you've either got cloud account with
identity cloud service or a traditional
cloud account
today I'm using the traditional account
cloud account I will select that and I'm
also using a u.s. data center
information on which data center you're
assigned to will be will be provided
when you secure your services through
the trial accounts or through your
organization's cloud account so I'm
going to use the u.s. account I'm going
to go to my services and in my services
I'm using identity domain 1 1 3 5 8 and
since I I'm going to log in here I'm
using the cloud dot admin account and my
password and when you arrive you're
going to come to this particular screen
we're going to customize our dashboard
and what we need to do is to make sure
that we can see the database service the
ones that are showing up or ones that
are that have been used or have services
in them that's why you see the compute
one today we're going to use the
database one and we're going to go into
the database select the database service
and you're going to open the service
console and you can see here now that
we're going to create an instance select
create instance we're going to call this
one workshop instance workshop image we
don't really need a description the
other key field is to select it
software release it's important to
select Oracle database release to the
rest you can leave as is we do need to
put in the password and we're going to
standardize on this because we've got
secure access through our keys which
I'll show you shortly
and at this point you're going to select
for the ssh public key and we're going
to create a new key once we've
downloaded it we will go to backup
destination we're just going to pick
cloud storage only and for the storage
container
let's give it a unique name we'll call
it oracle - data duh storage - one
username is cloud admin and the password
is and we'll type in the password I
encourage you to copy and paste into a
notepad your passwords and your and your
identity domain and at this point you
can check the create cloud storage
container I've already done that but you
will be checking that that's important
and at that point you can just hit next
and create it's gonna take about 30
minutes so when I come back after 30
minutes your insensibly up and we'll
we'll start configuring it in the
meantime you'll see the message here
status creating instance and you can
always go there to see what's happening
there's also the activity up here
activity gives you a status of the
various steps that the cloud services
performing to make this available and
you can see the steps down here activity
activity submitted activity started in
the meantime we're going to download a
couple of things from the internet that
will be used when we do the
configuration on the instance I'll go to
my other browser and I would like to
suggest you open up the documentation
dock so that you can cut and paste the
URLs and some other things and make make
it a little bit easier to navigate
through the setup steps so we're gonna
go download the Oracle backup module and
the Oracle Adobe yum repository so first
of all let's go to oh let's go to the
oracle website to download back on jewel
and when a copy dot URL there i'm going
to open a new tab i'm going to enter the
URL in this and we'll download this and
this is just going to prompt me briefly
to accept the license which i will do
you can read the license terms and we're
going to go to all supported platforms
and it's going to have me sign in and
let's let's log in it's going to save
the file
i've been saving it to workshops will do
that and that should be fine let's go
back to the workshop steps scroll down
and let's go to the Adobe site to
download the repository copy that URL
there again we'll go back to here paste
it into a new tab and in this case we're
downloading from windows I just want to
point out that we're actually going to
be installing into our platform our
workshop image Linux platform so you
need to select need a flash player for a
different computer not a problem to
download Linux while you're on Windows
the operating system is Linux 64-bit in
the version you
YUM and we're going to download that as
well save file again we'll go to the
workshops directory and we'll save it
there and that should be it
so we'll go back to the database console
and we're gonna get the works the
workshop image IP address I should point
out that the documentation I put
together or is done through a couple of
sessions with different IPS so when I
mention an IP address this particular
number down here you'll see some
inconsistencies but just the wire that
I've called this the workshop image and
that's the image IP I'm talking about
it's this one right here so let's get
that IP address right there and I will
actually in fact copy that and I'll be
putting it into my WordPad so that I can
easily paste it when I go to other
documentation now one thing is with the
keys that I generated I need to convert
the key the keys that are created by
default work for Linux they don't work
for Windows I need to just make a
modification and convert that key into
like a Windows PPK key so let's import
that key now first you would had to have
extracted it it gets downloaded as a zip
file I've I've already done that so when
you go to go to import key I'll go to my
workshops directory it's this SSH key
bundle that you downloaded and I've
extracted it and it creates a public key
and a private key and so I need to be
connecting to the instance I'm going to
select the private key and I'm going to
save private key and it just says yes
without a passphrase that's fine
and now it's going to be called private
G dot GP k save that and we're done
now the next step looking at the lab the
documentation copy files to the work
show up image and this is going to
involve using winscp again that's a
program that you can get on the internet
okay we're gonna walk log into putty
using putty into the workshop image the
remote workshop image and got the IP
address saved here already and we just
need to go down to SSH we've got to go
down to the authentication we're going
to use the private key that that we
saved already and it's this one here
open and we're gonna log in as OPC in
this case and we're logged in remotely
now we're going to switch to my work the
documentation and let's just go straight
there install scripts and we're going to
we're going to run these as a as a set
you can just simply highlight them all
edit and select copy go to your window
here and execute them which will take a
little while now that we have run the
install script we can start the VNC
server you can set the geometry by
specifying the screen size I'm going to
leave it as the default so I'll just
have to log in as Oracle
and just type in VNC server we'll put it
to port 1 and I copied the password from
my desktop notepad and so you should be
should be good to log into VNC but you
just have to at this point the next step
would be to open the VNC port 5901
we're going to go back to the desktop or
the cloud console and we need to open
the VNC porch so go into access roles
and we're going to create a new rule
I'll just call it open 50:50 901 source
is going to be the internet destination
is going to be database you might see it
just say DB instead of DB underscore one
it depends if you created databases
previously in this particular account so
and destination port is 5901 and it's as
simple as that it only takes a few
seconds to to create and open the port
through this open 5901 rule and we're
going to log in with our workshop image
IP address and it's on port 5900 1 short
for I can use this shortcut 1 and let's
let's connect it's going to ask me for
the password so I believe I can paste in
so there you have it it's just a couple
of final things that need to be done one
of the first things you have to do
fairly quickly is go into system
preferences screensaver
and disable the activate screen saver
when computers idle we do that so that
it doesn't screen lock up and prompt you
for the for the password we're using
keys so that wouldn't work so I'll close
that and now the last step which is to
put a sequel developer shortcut on the
desktop all you do is right-click create
a launcher and it's going to be called
sequel developer and the shortcut is
actually in the documentation it's right
here
and I would just cut and paste this
directly from the document to make it
easier copy to here and for the icon
it's a little bit different we go to go
to file system and it's really under
just a new 0 1 out Oracle product 12.2
DB home 1 sequel developer and sort this
in descending order it's right there and
the icon is actually right at the bottom
it's it there open it say ok and we're
going to double click on the sequel
developer to start it up just say no in
this prompt
and once it starts we can close this
window when it starts connections we're
going to do an import connections it's
going to be picking up the sequel dev
dot XML file it was part of the import
file set of files and encryption key
we're just going to remove all the
exported connections okay
next and finish and that's yet from here
you should be able to move on to lab 100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
