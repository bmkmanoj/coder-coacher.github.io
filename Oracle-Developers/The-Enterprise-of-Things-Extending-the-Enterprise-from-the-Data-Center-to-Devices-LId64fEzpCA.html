is not a typo that we were told by Cisco
and other sources that there's 14
trillion dollars with atty in value to
be grabbed through the Internet of
Things market over the next 10 years I
mean 14 trillion dollars that's fourteen
thousand times billion dollars it's a
lot of money I think that that creates
opportunity for all of us including
taught you I represent Oracle and every
one of you so that's really what our
story is predicated on I'll introduce
myself my name is Phil ring yo and I'm
vice president of sales and marketing
for hitachi consulting which is a wholly
owned subsidiary of big Itachi Itachi
limited which is a device manufacturer
in a lot of cases Java device
manufacturer I'm sure many of you are
familiar with them I'll introduce my
colleagues introduce themselves here my
name is ken Santoro I manage
partnerships and alliances in North
America for oracle and as part of that
you work closely with hitachi consulting
and hitachi CTA on the implementation of
their technologies along with java i I'm
Paul Michelle I'm the vice president of
business development for the machine
machine initiative at hitachi
communications our sister division
hitachi consulting how we're part of the
communications group that allows for
some java based products that i'll talk
about a little bit when we go through
the IOT solution so I'm just going to
speak very briefly here at the start in
and then I'm going to be turning it over
to the candidate Paul here but here's
what we want to walk through today we
want to talk first of all about where's
that opportunity of 14 trillion dollars
really coming from and it's coming from
the collision of a collision of a couple
of different opportunities some of which
is happening at the technology layer
someone which is happening on the on the
business side but the the the alignment
of information technology with
operational technology we believe is
really at the root of the Internet of
Things
taking off and allowing corporations to
turn themselves into the enterprise of
things which is the next section the
next topic that we'll talk about some of
you how many of you were in the edge
shreve and keynote this morning any of
you in that you see a lot so you heard
there about the IOT in motion
demonstrations people counter solution
number he was talking about that we
built that so we're going to show you a
little bit more about what that was what
the experience was like pulling that
solution together and what some of the
lessons learned from that were and then
we'll conclude with some proposed next
step so what would it take for you your
cells or your your clients to to enable
this vision of the enterprise and things
quote here pulled from from Oracle that
that spoke to me because in pitching the
Oracle Internet of Things they're not
talking about it as a pure gee whiz
technology kind of solution but they're
highlighting the fact that there is real
business value to be gained from m2m
services and indeed the whole Internet
of Things platform and the idea of
enterprises transforming themselves into
an enterprise of things lies at the root
of discovering where that where that new
business value will be coming from so
with that I'm going to turn it over to
Paul paschall was going to give a little
bit of a backdrop on how it is that
we've come to this exciting place great
thanks Phil so well touch upon a little
bit about IT versus OT and some of you
may be familiar with those terms I'll
close the eye t side of the house but
the OT cited house where fits since this
is a developer organization won't spend
a lot of time but depending on any
number of Industry Analysts the machine
to machine market is is the anticipation
of that is as large it's growing the
anticipation is being hyped up we have
commercials on TV during crying time
from IBM of a smarter planet or Cisco
about the internet of everything as an
indication that the investment of
dollars is being
done in that market space based on the
number of analysts predictions of where
the machine to machine either by a
number of connections amount of smart
devices in the industries that are best
served by moving in this in this
direction one of the interesting things
that we've been looking at and part of
the the challenges moving forward is the
is the movement of more and more
intelligence to the edge of to the
machine to them to the device this is
some data that shows the evolution of
32-bit microcontrollers down to the edge
so you're starting to see that slow
evolution of you know initially 8-bit 16
there's still a lot there's still a lot
sold out there for machine-to-machine or
Internet of Things applications and
whatever our devices by 2017 they expect
to be 32-bit microprocessor expected to
be fifty five percent of all
microcontroller say low sales out there
in the market so this shift it's coming
so the excuse before is you have to
write something very efficient very
small to the target environment either a
medical device some sort of other type
of machine sensor out there to market
but these are now at price points in
processing power we can have a full
stack running down on the edge so a
little bit on the market dynamics don't
want to toil too much on on this but
you've heard the numbers these this one
by fifty billion devices of one that
Ericsson puts out again kind of
reinforcing that processing power is
making it easy for those devices to
provide a number of some additional
intelligence the other part is the
interconnection of those machines to the
Internet of Things wireless technologies
either on the on the land side zigbee
z-wave bluetooth bluetooth LE still a
lot of proprietary are all making it
easier for interconnecting of smart
sensors still the traditional rs-232 422
485 USB Ethan are still connections but
more and more connectivity with full
stacks are moving out in the marketplace
and then I'm going to win on the win
side still even that is a predominant
depending on
Enterprise but as you've watched all the
ads were verizon AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
Deutsche Telekom and others
machine-to-machine is big part of the
cellular carrier market so connectivity
through some sort of cellular 2g 3g LTE
wimax or satellite in some situations is
coming somewhat ubiquitous at price and
cost models that make sense to make
things internet connect quickly so the
goal here is to drive business value so
you got you got the confluence of
intelligence connectivity now how do you
start extracting the value out of those
device and the discussion here is Java
plays an important role and the IOT
solution demonstrators is a
representation of how a solution can be
built using tools that are made for the
enterprise but now ready for for the
embedded so what we're trying to compete
against is an antenna solutions using
Java have been traditionally inherently
complex to build someone built C code
they tied to connect to a proprietary
gateway they do it to proprietary
application sitting in the network it's
also much single-threaded you make one
change here you have to recompile your
code you make it mean a poor ol Joe who
wrote the app and the enterprise leaves
he knows how to hook or pull the devices
all these things are still a way of
which the industrial complex still works
out there and it's tons of rs232 devices
sold per year that just convert rs-232
to Ethernet out in the marketplace
millions are sold per year just on that
so the movement of taking those sensors
bringing entitlement to a network do
some transformation of data are all part
of the Internet of Things solution so we
call this as a number of jargons out
there and I'll talk a little bit I
information technology operation
technology alliance alignment and better
technologies machine-to-machine that I
said data center Internet of Things they
all are model the same way in terms of
getting data from the device into an
application and making it actionable so
the IT OT alignment we've been using
this is a term from gartner and Gartner
record calls out the operational
technology is really the physical
equipment oriented technology
that's in part of manufacturing and you
see it every day it's in transportation
for fleet tracking rfid meters energy
monitoring smart grid activities health
care you went to hospitals health care
devices are being connected today to the
nurse's station so you can get automatic
reading financial retail ATMs
point-of-sale terminals and then
industrial controls all are part of the
IT many of those were done in
proprietary operating systems
proprietary chipsets proprietary
solutions but the enterprise moving down
is forcing an opening an inter
connection where information technology
is now mapping this operational
technology any of you've designed in
this space know the tools and and
capabilities of interfacing to a higher
level application are still challenged
because things aren't defined the tools
aren't there people are speaking
different languages when trying to tie
the two together so as a result there is
a complexity natural complexity for
interconnecting these devices to the
enterprise fairly quickly projects run
long the ability to extract value take a
while slugs Kibo so we're seeing this as
the next wave you have been around
awhile I guess I have this much gray
hairs everyone else here the the
integration part from the 60s all the
way out from mainframes to application
integration where wasn't a single
integration to business integration we
started put process to where we are
today with enterprise integration where
we're tying together web services and
doing the integration it's all about the
system and the next system wave we
predict is device integration or the
extended enterprise if you look at xanh
the numbers by other analysts majority
of IT spends out there are going to be
for devices and things outside the dmz
are outside the firewall trying to bring
all this integration capability using
standard based tools to do this next
wave but we're calling it enterprise
integration
and as a result we see this alignment
and the tools needed to do this
alignment is a really alignment of IT
and OT convergence trying to make that
operational technology and in the IOT
solution we've been presenting is is a
representable of that with IT with using
standard base middleware IT tools that
allow the ability to extract things much
faster must be much quicker can it yeah
exactly so we've got this kind of go
forward concept you know the the
enterprise of things and in and what
that does now is if you're in a real
world situation you're going out there
and trying to accomplish these sorts of
things you know how do you take these
things on and so part of it is you know
there's there's a there's a whole
process here of planning architecting
and executing these kinds of of go
forward plans so there's real challenges
here for enterprises and service
providers and people that are trying to
accomplish these types of systems you
know there's organizational expertise
you know organizations know a lot about
you know their internal IT and things
like that what they don't know about is
devices and how these devices are
integrated and and and you can go out
and take these kinds of things on but
you really want to really kind of avoid
I'm just going to put a whole bunch of
point-to-point solutions and add them
together you know there's no once you
start doing these kinds of things you
start running into roadblocks you know
there's no consistent security model you
know there's a your systems become non
flexible and non scalable and and
there's also you know one of the things
you really should start worrying about
is what I'll call the bomb conundrum
what that means is hey it's going to
cost me an extra buck or two bucks to go
ahead and put the kind of software I
need in these devices and when you go
ahead and do those kinds of things
you're you can save some money up front
but longer-term it's not going to do you
any good because you can't upgrade those
things you can't do lifecycle management
forum so as a consequence yeah maybe you
save a million dollars up front but your
long-term costs become a lot more
daunting so to speak and you want to
make and plus you want to get business
value out of this so you want to really
have efficient integration with your
enterprise systems you got to get these
systems out there quickly you got to get
them out there cost effectively and to
do it you need help right you need an
ecosystem of players out there that can
go ahead and help you do that and that's
device manufacturers systems integrators
etc so so to that end Oracle's come out
with you know a complete m2m end-to-end
platform which we're calling the iot or
the Internet of Things platform it
delivers end-to-end security supports
integration with IT systems coordinates
partners in the value chain and
addresses cost-benefit constraints and
delivering within time frame and
end-to-end compatibility so so what
we're going to talk about today is you
know taking some of these best practices
and actually applying them to this IOT
in motion solution that was demonstrated
at the show so you know using the Oracle
IOT architecture that I just talked
about but also a key component of this
thing is is driving the Java abstraction
layer as close as you can all the way
down to the device so Java goes ahead
and scales from deeply embedded to
server class hardware but it also gives
ease of programming you can take people
that don't know about communications
that have them immediately productive
you know because things like RF and
Wi-Fi and all those things are
abstracted in Java it extends the reach
of the Java security model all the way
down to the device and and the
extensibility that's in jobbing ensures
the lifecycle management capability that
you have here and you know all the
standard java stuff wolf of standards
tools programmers ecosystem partners and
inherent cross-platform application
compatibility so this is you know kind
of what what it looks
like in the enterprise of things you
know getting getting real business value
on enterprise data and applications
integrations with the devices you know a
cloud for the embedded devices
themselves and taking taking into
account that all the ecosystem partners
can easily get integrated in this these
types of solutions neat thing about Java
is it now scales all the way down to
very deeply embedded devices if you take
a look at the family of Java all the way
up from large but all the way down to
Java card sorts of profiles that can fit
in very small constrain devices so you
have the ability like i said earlier to
drive this Java abstraction all the way
down to the deeply embedded edge so we
took these concepts you know because we
had the show coming up the show is
coming up very quickly we really wanted
to show the real strength of this
enterprise of things approach and so we
took the you know the these best
practices that I talked about earlier
and actually applied them to to this to
this solution so I'm going to call Paul
up here and he's going to go through the
solution itself so if any of you saw the
key note here that was the people
counting sensor of that city sitting out
there and as you know use them
stereoscopic type of lenses out there
with infrared to go ahead and do a kind
of a cone of measurement that allows
tracking of objects that that allow
inaccurate counting beyond the threshold
names in that account information back
upstream and for us you know we sat down
and said well you know let's pick an
application that some somewhat
significant out in the marketplace in
transportation that you think may may or
may not be a big location but it surely
is and in apply to a lot of a lot of
different use cases in the marketplace
our partner who has that that sensor as
well as the Gateway Eurotech has already
a number of these implementations in
progress today and retail we tracking in
and out of stores and then trying to get
information to determine
what's the maximum amount of sales
agents you may need at a certain
particular time or had a transportation
or area they're already looking at
opportunities force cruise ships
counting people who've come on and come
come off there's applications in
Singapore looking at the queues in the
in the line of a taxi stand that's
reporting back to the taxi headquarters
they'll know if queues are coming up so
they're continually sending taxis to
that location because the queue has a as
a length of or a wait time of to be
expected so the the people counting
implementation here can be applied to a
lot of different market segments so I
wanted then kind of get down a little
bit detailed of how this was put
together at how this is representative
of an IOT implementation so the really
what we're trying to distance this
demonstrate is configurable software
components and many of the applications
many demos that are being done someone's
banging away at code and I think the
world is moving many of them me alone
many people think it's like an ERP
system where everything was hard code HR
finance all these systems were done till
you pick Best of Breed solutions and
those are applied to a particular market
segment either accounts payable
inventory well you can almost see IOT
being the same scenario if you had you
had a solution like warranty p or SL
lays you're trying to figure out how
often your equipment fails that could be
a that you tie these pieces together so
this is representative of an IOT
solution and the mark lets you have
collection which is the aggregator of
pulling the data from some sort of
sensor like a people counter a
thermocouple whatever the scenario is
for collecting the data so it's grabbing
the data from the sensors aggregating
them usually have some physical
challenges and I'll show what the
physical challenges were with the IOT
solution we put forward but a lot of
those are being overcome by new wireless
technology so before you can string a
wire it to a hostile environment and get
data from a thermocouple on an oil pump
in in that is sitting in the Gulf
Mexico how do you bring that information
back is in a hostile environment how do
you get it back to you tidy
communication system it tied to your
satellite system all that is all
custom-made hardware but today the tools
are available to make it configurable
vs. programmable the transport is a key
part standard protocols are being
developed for implementation data models
are being developed to transport that
effectively from the sensor up to the
cloud the analyzation tools and the
analyzation tools at hitachi consulting
had put together dashboards the javafx
as a graphical tool of being used but
those are just the analytical tools
eventually this data works into the
business process of an enterprise so you
can you can do s la's from equipment
you'll see how it affects warranty it
ties into your CRM systems you can call
the customer saying hey we're getting
close to violating some sort of SLA all
part of how you bring this data and tie
it into the enterprise and a
manageability as canid mention managing
software deployments in today's market
environment that are rapidly changing is
difficult to do especially have to do
firmware upgrades all the time because
someone changed aboard someone changed a
chip something has to be done how do you
abstract that out and make
programmability as part of the solution
in the marketplace so if you looked at
what was done we have these people
centers that people counters that were
that were at the three different halls
at Moscone at hilton and then at the
registration Center and we had some in
the booths of Hitachi Eurotech and
Oracle these were neatly hidden
sometimes because you didn't know they
were there so that's part of the
mechanical issue of interconnecting
sensors are just getting data in the
case they still the variety of different
ways to interconnect we interconnected
them laia 485 which provides the ability
to to bring the information back in a
serial fashion some special cabling that
allowed us to put power to it so you
have to put a power cord next to some of
these some of these devices so the
mechanical laying out the sensor know
step one you have the physical
interconnect the physical deployment of
these devices now you have that done how
do you start bringing that data
well we have in here the aggregators and
that runs a full Java stack it runs
Hitachi's super j osgi framework and if
those are not familiar with the OSGi
runs on top of java as an application
framework and then as a result our
partners Eurotech we're able to write
software modules on top of the OSGi
framework download those dynamically to
do the interconnection between the
device data and the cloud one of those
bundles is a protocol that's making a
significant input into the machine to
machine or IOT space called MQTT for
those interested is an MQTT org site
showing the resilience of of that
protocol especially in an environment we
where the connection may not be stable
it's also low overhead where you can do
somewhat I never say real-time near
real-time acquisition of data especially
if you're going over IP networks
providing a robust way of doing it and
there's some other enhancements they do
above and beyond that just a
communication protocol a publish and
subscribe capability where you publish
this data publish it into the cloud
someone subscribes it and that's really
where the enterprise of things takes off
this data is made available not to a
single purpose application through
security mechanisms to anyone who's
needed this data so if we looked at the
people counter in this instance and we
saw the capacity of if they deployed in
every room we see the capacity in the
rooms at some point time they may exceed
capacity well does the municipality want
to know that information you know do
they want to send an inspector and just
trust that this restaurant or a location
doesn't exceed their capacity there or
do you or you implement some sort of
people counter senate system that makes
you control your cues but also has a
feed to the municipality so they can
theoretically check during different
times and days but they're different
systems they may have an archaic
mainframe system
sorry about that well I like to use my
hands a lot or you know something more
up to date a client server based
solution in this scenario we we then
sent the data to Eurotech cloud pass it
through a restful api to the Oracle
cloud and then made it available for two
different analytic engines to be done
the dashboard engine using the Oracle bi
dashboard and then newly formed for
graphical displays jawa XX FX but this
could have easily been done or sent to a
business process as part of a ERP system
any questions on this part yes the bids
they could be around the world
theoretically right but you're right if
you're if you're you're aggregating
these are semi intelligent devices so
they're not putting in the protocol MQTT
so these were co-located we they were in
in the racks and I have a showing where
we put him especially in the Moscone
Center but if you're using Ethernet as
an aggregation and these come with
ethernet ports on these people counters
this can be not co-located as long as
you have an ethernet hub or switch or
something nearby you just time through
the the infrastructure ideally this
could also have wireless interfaces
place them some of them you know the
topic is it a Wi-Fi getting more length
out there or something nearby where
cabling as it needed but you still need
to run power to it like a like a zigbee
interface as well these multi-purpose
gateways can speak any of these devices
so they are any of these physical
interfaces and then you write your code
to interpret that data again these are
intelligent or semi intelligent too dumb
in terms of the information you get
transforming those to a protocol or
communication standard that something
upstream in a cloud can understand is
where where this is done the
programmability of downloading that
dynamically based on what your inter
connecting to is important and
interfacing to legacy systems so if you
you can put a protocol on there like
Modbus or canvas that are traditionally
speak to devices in building automation
or industrial automation that is a osgi
Java bundle that can be loaded onto this
device and right hand and then now
enabled in real time and part of osgi is
the dynamic loading unloading stopping
and starting of these bundles Java
bundles so they can effectively be
deployed on a singular device or across
all your devices in real time good have
you been contributing somebody does so
I'm also involved in North standard ha
I'm just wondering if you contributed a
lot of proceedings of these very good i
didn't pay you money for this one
there's initiative we haven't met
there's initiative with Eclipse
Foundation and there's a new project
core up k you are a that will be
starting up it's in the face and your
participation or asking england's
participation we're using java and osgi
based tools for m2m developers so
that'll be a repository people
contributing because at some point in
time these tools that you're putting
together are going to be used from
everyone you don't you know that sort of
standard libraries in another software
development how do you go back because
when you're building this antenna
systems there's things that you do that
are naturally have to do them every time
such as a watchdog timer right so you
put a watchdog timer in there it's an
osgi bundle and if your process breaks
it'll tell you it's broken like
something's broken it can restart your
process you don't the sense of when they
should do the restart that's a natural
how do you do it how do you do it for
different implementations clocking you
know how real time do you need to clock
in the man where's the sources from so
those would be part of contributions to
that and it's just starting out so
participation here is will be key
correct no these gateways these these
gateways here rs45 I thought that was a
hard connection there were you think it
doesn't need to be are connected
community correct that when you build a
counter and to keep a low cost you try
to you do what you can to you could put
a cellular interface or a Satellite
interface if you wanted to and if you
paid your otech enough money they would
do it
third
it there's a variety of different what
we try to do is do a publish and
subscribe and publish and put into some
sort of restful api that's exposed to
these you could do standardization down
to the far end it's it's up to the
developer I think those will be part of
the discussion in the open source tools
I think we're what people have been
working on is how do you connect here
where you're using standard XML to
interconnect and in understanding what
the data formats are the points here to
here are a lot of you tie into
proprietary so it could be Modbus as a
low protocol for a industrial automation
interaction and then we do you do to
conversion you know as a conversion on
here and then that's just another module
or in a lot of cases today the
conversion is done at a server upstream
then you have to pay someone to kind of
rewrite the code the goal here is to
extend it as far as you can and the
standard open these protocols
so if you look at the the software stack
that was in there huh I forgot I slipped
this one in our goal here was to within
the device or gateway here is the stack
that was there we had the hardware
talking to the Gateway if we on the left
hand side eating my and then the
hardware it's running a Linux win river
linux on this box oracle oracle java SE
7 virtual machine our hitachi super Jay
osgi framework and the neuro tech has
their modules which they call exterior
cloud that they provided some additional
software to do these MQTT communication
they're bringing it into the ureter tech
cloud and it's an open standard cloud
where they have an M cutie broker and
they do kind of the communication we
pass it on into the Oracle cloud cloud
to cloud communication where some of the
Oracle device intelligence capabilities
were placed and then finally threw for a
display for visualization and we had the
displays around the different booths
serving the during the conference even
at the open world are we do it for time
so part of it if you looked at the
moscone center we blended in up above
here the pupil counter so they weren't
even there I think we have a more room
to play with here to put the people
counters above channel everyone through
it because they have kind of a cone of
accuracy so that's what you have some of
these barriers here it's not brought to
keep accurate a day a couple meter with
scenario and some of these things are
adjustable who in the threshold of of
going it's bi-directional so you know
someone coming in and out through this
and the people kind of it and then those
gateways their card tucked up there what
I don't have a picture of is the ones we
have for going into the job of one
exhibit we had tensioners that were in
you know if you did a p90x you can order
those not feeling like you see it I
don't do it but if you p90x healthcare
help you can buy when it was pull-up
bars you put in your doorway you tied
them up I mean you do your exercises
same concept we had a big tension bar we
tighten it up the fitted in the doorway
put a nice job of one logo in front and
then put the people counter behind that
so you can do the counting we took the
cabling and so it was kind of
transparent in the way way to do it some
part of you know any good grabbing of
the sensors putting into places would
you have to do for aesthetics if you're
in a retail environment for industrial
environments more forgiving you just
obviously have to abide by any standards
and then the different dashboards here
this is one the hitachi consulting put
in here we were counting the people in
moscone center I guess everyone heard
we're recording this one okay yeah so
and then with javafx where it's going
sorry you have a graphical display and
that the people kind of we had it in the
hitachi booth we had in eurotech booth
and we had in New York or booth ideally
with with some of these graphical tools
either the peak will get higher or a
lower based on how many people in the
booth if you implement how you implement
the graphics in the end of this play so
we still ok
okay okay I want to go through one kind
of use cases where osgi is effective in
the marketplace here's one we're working
with eurotech and oracle with so here's
the bus for a people counter the rely on
tech boxes has a GPS GS has a gsm gps
capabilities in there so as soon as you
put one on a bus it's capable
transmitting data it also it can
transmit the location of the bus so you
put one of these devices you're tracking
your tracking the bus and where it is at
any point in time the location so for a
bus company they can do route
optimization they're looking at time of
day it's supposed to be at this location
it's not there why is that as a traffic
have we picked up too many people well
the way you figure out you picked up too
many people you have a passenger counter
so you know where they're coming on how
many are coming on at what stop they're
coming on and so you can do route
optimization based on time of day
location people amount of people coming
on and you may want to read up redo your
outs they're also looking at tying it
into the where you take the payments so
you can do fraud detection you know how
many people have come on the collections
at the end of the day don't match that
hey something's going on you know poor
old Joe the bus driver 30-year it's just
less his family right for free every
time you know is it's it's it's caught
or they deducted from his pay that's
right which is the next one the camera
there's a camera oh yes yes yes
bi-directional x direction there's a
camera there transmitting camera
information over cellular network could
be expensive but someone could hit a
panic button which means okay normally
these buses or taxis have some sort of
video storage in there that's why you
see these on YouTube you know
something's getting there you know being
hit there so they storage a lot of times
they're stored be the but they're not
transmitted in real time they go back to
back to the garage at night then you'll
file transfer and they collect it and
the only time they look at them if
there's an incident report to go back
and say okay Hayes there was a five I
got mugged or I lost you know something
on there the guy
rude they'll try to go back and take a
look at the camera here you have the
option of if there is an incident to do
you know kind of a real-time transmit
and do a real-time feed with the with
the bus ideally tie it into the vehicle
diagnostic system where if there's
anything wrong with the bus you can make
the determination you bring it right
into the garage or it's something that
you can make it through the end of the
day get it in and fix it and have the
parts available when when the bus gets
back in and then clearly where some of
the folks are going you know the
location are you know how many people
you have you have display terminals
let's download an add to that person so
you have digital signage as an
opportunity here the next stop there's a
subway if anyone who gets off in within
the next 15 minutes you buy a six-inch
meatball sub you get a free soda
whatever the case may be but the goes
from optimization fraud detection to
revenue opportunities for the bus
company all these can run on one gateway
all our different modules bundles that
can be loaded running simultaneously on
the Gateway so this is kind of a
representation of using osgi in this
market environment and then the action
plan
thanks Paul I didn't ask before most of
you raise your hands when you said that
you were java developers how many of you
have actually done embedded Java just a
small handful of you it was interesting
to see the keynote on Sunday Adam if you
were there where oracle is announcing
that that Java and Java embedded will be
coming together and I assume that that
what that means is that maybe next year
when we ask this question that everybody
raises their hand and says they've done
some job will work but I'll be
interesting to see how that evolves we
take a step back and just just digest
the story that Paul just told we took a
business namely the Moscone Center you
know their business they're not own work
out there standalone business who are in
the business of running conferences I
don't know if you could imagine a more
analog kind of business right they just
shuffle people back and forth from room
to room there's a lot of technology that
gets applied there but it's not exactly
a business that you would think would be
very device rich but what we did by
implementing this solution was take this
analog conference organizing business
event management business and turned
them into an enterprise of things
because they were now using these smart
devices to enhance their business
they've they've derived insights that
some of which they allowed them to make
real-time or near real-time changes in
the way that they were managing the
event like changing their staffing plans
or logistics arrangements or whatnot but
what we've also done is give them given
them now a repository of data that
allows them to do some retrospective
analysis as well so what are we proved
here by putting the solutions to get the
solution together few things first that
it's to use off to use phrase it takes a
village to to pull it put a solution
like this together right now in the
market there's very few integrators or
technology companies that can really do
do an end-to-end thing here
and and this effort was testimonial to
the fact that you often need to bring
multiple parties together like this and
orchestrate the the effort across
organization so inherent than that can
be some challenge but we've proved that
it can work in that it can work in
relatively quick time frame as well so
we had four different companies involved
we had Oracle involved we had eurotech
involved tachi communications and itachi
consulting and really moscone as well so
be the fifth company actually we haven't
we had unions involved too who are doing
the installation of the people count
Orso takes an ecosystem to put something
like this together despite that it took
less than two months to from concept to
execution to get this in place the
actual coding of the this this
integrated solution took four and a half
people six weeks so you know roughly
half the menu or so to pull this
together that was just to do a proof of
concept basically so I think that that
proves the value of Oracle's vision and
the actual actual technology inherent in
the Oracle Internet of Things platform
which basically is an aggregation of
technologies that have been proven
elsewhere already in their own discreet
fashion but here together can work as
well that's what that's what we proved
whether it's talking about the or you
know Java on the device side on the
Gateway side is critical piece to this
but we didn't touch very much on the
rest of the Oracle technology that's
part and parcel to thee to the IOT
platform namely Oracle vents processing
the whole so back end and the new Oracle
bi dashboard of course they've been used
thousands of times of different
implementations rarely thus far brought
together in a true end-to-end IOT
platform but if four and a half people
in six weeks can pull something like
this together just imagine what can be
done with a little more time a little
more budget the last thing quite
honestly when we started this project we
thought we'll people counting huh I
don't know yawn you know people know
maybe maybe not that exciting but we we
knew that it was we had these these
these counters available we thought it
would just be a quick and easy way to
just prove the concept that I that
Oracle IOT works actually turns out that
this market for people counting is huge
and very diverse and we see now the live
use case in moscone Paul talked about
the applications on buses for examples
but as many other examples that we could
think of to like any any venue where
we're a large number of people where
large number of people congregate like
transportation hubs like airports and
train stations bus stations so so forth
would have an interest in it concert
halls sports stadiums you know they have
all kinds of use cases that would that
would have an interest in it so big
market out there any fans of the the the
movie Minority Report seen that remember
that one remember when Tom Cruise is
running down those hallways and there's
retina scanning going on and they're
changing in real time these digital
dashboards in the marketing that's being
targeted towards them well that may be
that may be a little scary but because
but if you if you could imagine that huh
it can be done it actually can be done
if you imagine a world where there's
maybe an opt-in version of that where
where it's happening where their sensors
located around that are that maybe sense
the digital signal coming off of your
cell phone for example doesn't have to
be a retina scanning per se and that
that it detects your maybe it's your
gender and your age and starts to adapt
the the marketing messaging accordingly
when I would that's what we would call
proximity marketing it's just another
incarnation of IOT and literally the
applications of this are multiple
hundred Foles if not thousands oh I
mentioned before that in building this
solution we gain some real-time insight
and the event organizers were able to
shift around some of their plans and
then
some retrospective analysis too but I
this one we just got a kick out of out
of this particular screen shot because
you guys remember that Larry Larry was
supposed to deliver his keynote the
other day right obviously he had a few
other things on his mind with the
America's Cup don't blame him at all
this is not to it not not meant to
chastise him but it was interesting that
at that particular point in time right
after the announcement was made that
that Larry was not going to be there in
a span of 22 minutes the room went from
5,000 people down to just under 3,000
people so i think that the rate was 9
there was 90 people per minute were
filing out of the room and gradually you
know there was just a lot more empty
seats there which unfortunately may have
been a bit disrespectful to Thomas curry
and he was doing his very best to stand
in for Larry but of course Larry is a
one-of-a-kind celebrity personality but
there it is I mean that was the the
proof right there we saw it in those
people counter so who knows what kind of
strategies you can employ now that not
now that you've actually seen this seen
this evidence party yep I'm sure they
did yeah if you if they had I was
actually out at the race yesterday
afternoon and if they had had people
counters installed there I think there
would be a glowing red-hot because of
all the people that were there was very
exciting atmosphere so what do we prove
here besides the fact that we could take
like I said a fundamentally analog
business like an event management firm
and turn them into an enterprise of
things we did that but by using the
Oracle IOT platform specifically as
opposed to going with something custom
and complicated something that will
require a skill set that would be
dedicated beyond the development of just
this proof-of-concept we we really
lowered the cost that it would take to
put a solution like this in place at not
to mention support a solution like this
on an ongoing basis because we were
using solutions that like I said have
have a proven history whether it's Java
and better
the on the device side to the oracle
fusion middleware platform that
basically was the backend plumbing for
this whole solution or the oracle bi
dashboards they've all been proven
thousands of times over and there's a
lot of innovation that an Oracle
continues to vest in each of those
products on a standalone basis but we
knew that bringing them if you bring all
these proven technologies together
they're all written on the same code
stack we know it's going to work and
thus we were able to we were mitigating
the risk which by the way was pretty
significant for this particular proof of
concept development because we couldn't
actually do testing with live data until
Saturday just what five days ago because
we had to wait for the people counters
to physically be installed had we been
writing built this whole solution with
custom code there's no way that we could
have comfortably entered the event
knowing that we wouldn't be able to
start testing until Saturday and of
course we sped things up and hopefully
for Oracle in this case or or Moscone
Center we're delivering quick quick ROI
from them so conclude here with a very
quick semi commercial I don't think I
really have to talk anymore about why
oracle it was pretty self-evident from
the solution the fact that Oracle's
Oracle technology was embedded
throughout throughout this particular
solution on a go-forward basis you know
the billions literally that Oracle's
investing in our d make me as an
integrator as a third-party completely
comfortable with the fact that or boys
is the right partner with is this kind
of enterprise of things strategy pursuit
as far as itachi why us you may or may
not know that you know there are 25,000
different partners in the oracle
ecosystem that are tiered according to
how significant let's say the
relationship is with oracle well there
there are only 11 firms that operate at
the very top tier there those are firms
called the Oracle diamond
Partners tachi happens to be one of
those 11 so given that if you're working
on an IOT strategy or an IOT solution
partnering with itachi you know that
you're working with one of the most
experienced and trusted partners of
Oracle who have considerable access into
into Oracle as well whether everywhere
from on the R&amp;amp;D side to joint go to
market to support and that clearly is
very important for for clients Paul
mentioned before that this osgi
framework is platform that was used in
these Eurotech gateways was built
leveraging the itachi super j framework
which is again testimonial to the fact
that there's a lot of innovation coming
out of Hitachi that when you combine it
with Oracle I think makes for a pretty
unbeatable combination and then lastly
you know we do everything from pure
operations and management consulting and
analysis for our clients to hosting
solution so if you take an IOT
opportunity we can do everything from
working with clients to to put business
cases together why this would be a good
good idea to move from an analog
business to to mentor prize of things to
actually building the solution for them
and potentially hosting and running it
for them on an ongoing basis as well we
we invest considerably and itachi
consulting to make sure that our skills
are kept up to date and that we can look
our clients directly in the eye and say
trust us we've got this covered because
because of all the investments that
we've made in training which are then
symbolized in the form of these
so-called Oracle specializations that
we've earned with official monikers
received from Oracle where they say that
you know these are particular
technologies that we are exceptional at
and that we've proven our abilities in
not just by way of training our people
but actually implementing real solutions
and the ones that I circled in the
specializations on a circle here
actually all of the ones that are
directly relevant to
and an implementation of the Oracle IOT
platform we've got that completely
covered all right so with that see if
there any more questions or comments or
ideas to share yes sir super jigga osgi
Frankie's problem yes okay and it is
that probably sounded one of your it
does it only used internally no no it's
it's sold on the open market here so
it's on our website hitachi
communications technology there's some
more details but exchange card if you
have any more questions on it's one of
the major commercial osgi solutions out
there in the marketplace there's open
source versions of it out there no
marketplace this was specifically built
for commercial embedded applications
there's osgi also you'll see it on and
the enterprise as well this specifically
made so lower footprint this other some
performance characteristics we doomed
yes sir so the role of the gateway is at
just aggregating the sensor information
and then
translating that out to to the clouds
basically yes that's right yeah yeah
yeah yeah low Linux is a there's a
variety and that's you know part of the
slides that put only the 32 bit
processor applications they're all going
out there and that one it was built on
an intel atom platform this this
particular but you'll see a lot of arm
based solutions out there there's number
of chips of vendors you know between
intel freescale and others in a
marketplace marbel putting solutions in
these my controller solutions and for
these marker where they you know the
tying I oh and processing into a
specialized function so clearly you hit
it right on the head it's collecting so
there's io on inputs i dial on the
outside and then all the protocol and
driver is necessary to make it work and
and and not just the connection portion
of it but the data and data formatting
version and there's ability to do
business logic in there so like the
Oracle Oracle event process event
processor and can be run on the where
you can do business logic and don't send
this data unless these conditions are
met so there's a variety of Oracle tools
that can go on top that make this an
interesting and designing a solution
architectural trade-off so what can be
done locally sometimes you know how much
do you store because if you lose your
link if you're in a bad location or
storms or something affected whatever
the case these things they can do
locally and then things that are best
served by sending it upstream yes it's
an intelligent multi-purpose gateway you
know neat thing about it is you could
think of this same concept you could
take this and it could be a residential
gateway it could be a telematics gateway
in a car you know it's got all those
kinds of capabilities and easily is is
usable and all those other scenarios but
it's all based upon the fact that it's
you know it's oh s GI and Java and there
is abstracting all this communication
and everything else so at good point
just then that's why we try to do this
model this going to collect aggregate
transmit analyze and function that you
know that's how via if you have these
home control systems coming out from
aedt or
eighteen t digital life or xfinity from
comcast they have a gateway in the house
it's a special person they're made by
other folks but they're running osgi and
so you're running a home control
application you may be running an energy
monitoring application or where the
heading is running an eHealth
application so you can monitor your
glucose or pulse oximeter real-time at
the same time as you're turning lights
on and off in the house so the
architecture of collecting data you know
aggregating and sending an upstream
where you're actually processing you can
you know if it's a health data you know
sending it to someone who who's going to
take a look at it like a doctor or
something someone else or home control
it sends it up the cloud where you on
your handset can go up and turn on and
off your lights to spook your cat or
your dog at home whatever the case might
be same it's the same architecture and
it's same horrible tools are used in
providing that intent solution yeah you
talking about
correct what the osgi is inherently
itself has the ability as part of the
standard to update control and then
either you build a management server
hitachi bills one there's other third
parties that would control the bundle
distribution so you can check on
versions of you know updating those you
do dynamic load you can do an upgrade of
a bundle out there all these are part of
the life cycle management of
applications and its key out there for
especially a fast-changing development
environment so think of a like a BMW
right there using osgi in some force
I've lost track of them that's not our
outlook shy I think it may be some
homegrown stuff that they've done but
you have you have all these different
systems you have infotainment you have
heating that you have diagnostic
information comes in it comes to a
common display and you can do you know
look after you need an oil change you
can change the temperature you can see
if your air pressure is low or you could
change your Santa to the channel for
your satellite or or FM station those
are being written that's offers being
written by different folks they bring it
in they integrated to do a unified
interface then they have different
versions that you have a one series BMW
3 series 5 series 7 series so each one
has different more value-added the more
you pay and then they got to get ready
for next year's models so that's a
perfect environment where dynamics offer
for for development modulation testing
integration and the dynamic you know
change of these things are perfect in
that type of environment yeah it goes
back to what I was saying earlier about
this this bomb model right so I mean
those guys to go out and build those
boxes and put them in the cars or put
them into homes and things like that but
but hey what happens ten years down the
pike or a smart meter it might be out
there for 20 years so you need a pen
ssible platform that you can go ahead
and do this on and this this model the
osgi model lends itself nicely to that
kind of application
trusting that not only correct correct
now and there's a variety there are
certain security models authentication
models that are in variety of different
development schemes out there there's
some secure things you can do and talk
about it over line a little bit later
but there's also implementation of of
authentication schemes that are being
developed today and our hopes are in the
eclipse foundation providing trying to
reuse some of the schemes that were
developed for the cellphone market and
others that provide you know same level
of security so something turns on its a
trusted agent out there that comes in it
ties it it's really tighten into your
bus how do you know it's here how can I
make it available you do do you do a
virtual single sign-on scenario so you
see ongoing product enhancement from
mitachi you'll without showing the
roadmap I'm as our editors we're a
partner see the roadmap on tools coming
out for the ilt and security for
authentication and other security
measures we're definitely interested in
the whole concept of device identity in
general right that yes yes all the above
so you'll see some neat stuff coming in
that area I can you know better I can
even confirm nor deny that we even doing
it at all any other questions well thank
you very much for your interest in
joining us today and hopefully to
inspire some thoughts on what the next
enterprise of things could be thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
