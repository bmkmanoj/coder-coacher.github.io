it totally squirely affected programmers
and as a programmer you can decide
whether to use the new paradigm or do
you completely ignore it that that's not
the case with Java 9 though with Java 9
modularization every single library
every single vendor who is providing
solution on the Java platform is going
to change because it fundamentally
marginalizes the code the JDK is already
modularized and people deploying
applications creating jars are gonna
create modules so if I'm a developer
using Java 8 within a fairly short
amount of time I'm gonna have these
libraries upgrade but in the past when
libraries upgraded I could use those for
most part with the versions I was using
unless they had a disruptive feature
that was dependent on that particular
feature but mostly people work through
that fairly well to avoid such
disruption but with Java 9 when people
start using modules I am going to be
forced to rethink about how I you know
deploy my own application dependencies
really make the difference so when the
world around you changes to using
modules you don't want to be the one
left behind when the in the old world
that's one of the reasons why it's gonna
force you to move forward plus also you
know all the things I mentioned about
improvements and additions those make
you as a programmer more productive so
as you are becoming really stronger and
using Java 8 you will eventually grow
into the position where you say hey Java
is it is great but I'm beginning to hit
these rough edges
oh of course Java 9 has these solutions
I might as well move as well that may
not be the most critical reason to do
but but with all the other things going
on that would also be a driving factor
if you really look at Java 8 versus Java
9 Java 8 was disruptive for a relatively
smaller group of programmers compared to
Java 9 which is disruptive for the
entire ecosystem if you ask me put my
finger on one Java release that's been
the most disruptive ever
I would say that's Java 9 Java 8 was
significant I praised its you know
capabilities all over but but it was not
disruptive it was a game changer in how
we developed applications but I didn't I
didn't force you to move sooner than
later but Java and I needs going to be
very disruptive and I see that as a
positive thing I'm not seeing that as a
negative thing
Oracle being a very powerful very big
very successful corporation and
supporting a language is phenomenal if
Oracle had not taken over if another
corporation which is not as strong both
in technology and financially had taken
over I am not sure if the world would
place as much trust in so while we say
we don't really like a few things and
there will always be people who say this
let's not underestimate the power of a
big corporation throwing the support
behind a language and for most part you
know Oracle has given the wings for Java
to on the technical front to innovate
which which I think is is very
significant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
