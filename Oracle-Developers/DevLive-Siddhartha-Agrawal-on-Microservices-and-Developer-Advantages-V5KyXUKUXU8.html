team here at the Oracle code event in
New York City and I'm here with Sudha
Siddhartha Agarwal and he's going to
give us a little bit of background about
what's going on around here it's been a
big event today there's tremendous
energy here
lots of people wanting to listen about
micro-services API chatbot machine
learning etc and we had the morning
kickoff with Chris Richardson who did a
keynote and micro-services it felt like
being in a classroom back at college
where you're getting the one-on-one and
what micro-services is but then he took
you into the more deeper concepts around
why it is you know why micro services
are useful the fact that you can
leverage technology fast that small
teams can build applications very easily
they can do releases really fast at the
same time I thought one really
interesting thing he said Laura was that
Microsoft is not a silver bullet and
what that meant is that you know their
challenges also that come along with
micro services so things like making
sure that you're not taking care
distributed programming then you have to
have event handling taking care of that
eventual consistency as opposed to
two-phase commit those are some other
things that you have now start thinking
through in going from writing monolithic
applications to writing they distributed
programs right and give you all those
capabilities and those benefits at the
same time you need to address these
challenges it's more of an advanced
architecture isn't it you have to plan
ahead quite a bit yeah I think that
there's planning but you know you want
to get it done fast so you want to be
able to build the micro services deploy
the micro services within short periods
of time that's the whole benefit is the
agility around micro services and then
we were able to take that and build upon
that because we showed a really cool
demo of a Warriors fan I know in New
York City that might not be at any staff
and that was definition of how you could
buy a ticket on a chat box to a
warrior's game where we showed how api's
can be designed on the web
and sorry this is a I don't know how to
turn okay so this is lives this is what
happens in your life so how you can
create API implement those API with
micro services and then use a chat for
platform very easily build chat box with
natural language processing ai under the
covers and use Facebook messenger as
opposed to mobile apps to be able to
engage with the warriors mm-hmm yeah so
and it seems like that's just going to
level the playing field make this micro
services available on so many different
platforms rather than being just
deployed in a single environment yeah
the main thing is being able to from a
chat pod perspective being able to go
across multiple channels so being able
to leverage getting input from Alexa for
example look Siri when someone speaks to
Siri
it's converting speech to text and then
we're able to take it from that point on
we pre-built the integrations into those
platforms or for example connecting the
Facebook using facebook Messenger or
whatsapp or we check and not having to
write code that's specific to each
platform because we're taking care of
those platforms
for you you just come in build your bot
and then your bot happens to work across
these multiple platform mhm
anything new that has been included up
in the past of offerings for our
developers we've got my sequel yeah oh
my god now yeah absolutely so we're
doing a lot for developers in the cloud
and in the roadmap itself so one today
we announced that you know if your lab
developer and if you're using my sequel
we're giving you my sequel as a service
that already existed where you don't
have to worry about backing up and
patching that service but the same time
now we're giving you high availability
also available Enterprise Edition so now
you get high availability as a service
from Oracle so that's one thing we're
also working on things like Tosca Kafka
is an inventing mechanism where you want
to take all the events that are coming
up microservices consume events
functions or server list computing
community events and it takes a lot to
be able to set up the Kafka
infrastructure so we're providing Kafka
as a service so you don't never have to
worry about that and you can just
consume the event and also providing
spark and a service so you can do
analyze big data workloads and not have
to manage spark
we're providing reddit's as a service so
that you're able to you know access
memory you know not have to set up
reddish clusters so working a lot and
how do we make the lives that developers
very easy where they don't have to think
about the underlying infrastructure in
order to write the next generation of
applications with micro services with
API with mobile well thank you so much
together for joining us it's always fun
to chat with you
Thank You Lauren thank you great being
with the audience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
