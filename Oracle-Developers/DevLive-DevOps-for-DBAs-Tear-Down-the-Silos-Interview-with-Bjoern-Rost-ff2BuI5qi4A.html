Toronto I'm Bob revoir with the Oracle
technology Network with another
interview with one of the session
speakers from today's event and that
session speaker just happens to be
Oracle Age director buin Rose you're an
how you doing I'm excellent well thank
you thanks a me you tell me a little bit
about what you do with Pythian so aptly
and I'm a principal consultant I was
internally with our managed services
teams where I met my job really is to
make sure that we leverage all the
knowledge that we have good apathy and
managing Oracle databases or any kind of
databases over the years be more
effective at how we manage them and then
also to find out in to figure out and to
need the rest of the relation through
how we want to be managed database in
the future so top is like automation
come up for me or how we monitor
database is smarter these are the topics
I generally look
and speaking of topics the topic of your
session at this event is DevOps for DBAs
give me a compressed two-minute version
of that session that's all really lazy
of you a really fast
I already did talk very fast when I talk
and I have a whole exercise for for that
so I did a session would cut that off
the DBA is where I talked about first of
all I did it give a little bit of
definition of what DevOps is but I found
that hard because I think that is
something means different some different
things for different people and then I
talked about I get some it specific
examples where I say these are drivers
that the business is demanding of the
database practice to be more agile to be
more fast to be more reliable
reproducible introducing basically the
product and the product is a service is
whether it's a profit cloud database as
a service or just an internal offering
and then I explained or I gave some
examples of projects or we have done
this for clients or we either automated
the provisioning of databases or we
chose rapid cloning of databases and
integrate up with the continuous
integration lifecycle for developers and
then in the end I also gave a little bit
of a very very created rush direction to
get puppet and ansible which are in the
tool that I use most
okay what obstacles stand between DBAs
and DevOps and how do you propose to
make those obstacles go away there's I
think us two one is one it's just a
matter of keeping up with technology and
I'm just learning about these new things
and I find it that really only works if
you put yourself out there test
something try it out and see it for
yourself it's really hard sometimes to
explain it just learn from listening
somebody or just learn from reading a
book I think with some of these
theologians have to try them out and
then lose that that fear of the unknown
and the new so I think that is be the
obstacle for every PDA out there and
then for from an organization
perspective we are still very much
signed out into our different
departments like your DBA you don't do
devops
you're an SME you linux up and you don't
do integrated database your developer
you don't even have to talk to DBS and
that those are barriers that we have to
break down and I think the best way to
do that is to communication and
collaboration to work together with
these different groups talk to it
developer over lunch break and ask them
hey if there's one thing that I could do
from my DBA from the Oracle management
perspective what could like you make
your life as a developer easier and they
might have an answer for you and then
you can work together to to achieve
stuff because they might not know about
all the possibilities that you have to
DBA is eventually with all the new
features and Oracle 12 and likewise we
have deviate sometimes I was way too
isolated from what the organization of
what our developers actually want a mass
wedding talk to people communication
collaboration and that should serve as a
good starting point to tear down these
barriers it's interesting that you
mentioned of the effort to stay on top
of technology because you are a frequent
face as a presenter at a lot of user
group events and in other events both
here on this side of the Atlantic and on
the other side of the Atlantic what
steps do you take what resources to you
use to stay on top of those
technological advances
well the easy answer is the internet
there's just so much kind of out of that
yeah I think it's going to be a big
thing you think
know so yeah but we live in if we live
in a generation where it's super easy to
have access to all of these things like
15 20 years ago you have to go to a
library to find something out you have
to print a manual and then read that and
today we can just access all of these
things on our phones or from wherever so
I think that makes it easy but the hard
part now is to figure out exactly what
you need where to get started and then
you have to also have to sit down it's
just also very very easy just be
comfortable and just read them something
quickly so you have an idea that's the
first thing I do is I read about
something I look at Wikipedia what it
does and then I know this answer will
does automation and then I feel like I
already know enough about it but you
actually have to take a time to sit down
with it come up with just a simple demo
project or is this a simple proof of
concept of hello world kind of
application do that test it and then
apply that also to to things that you do
in your daily work so I think it's
really the hands-on that's really really
important and also show-and-tell so
that's another thing I encourage people
to do is to show and tell us with your
colleagues show them the things that
you've done and look at things that
they've done it might just be very very
valuable and getting new ideas on how
you can do things but also explaining
what you've done it also helps you
understand them better and then also get
the message across all the things that
you have what's on your calendar where
are you speaking next so I'm like I just
moved to Canada so I'm still busy but
I'm taking all my stuff from here I also
I've been organizing the OTD media tour
for a number of years now and there's a
new amia tour coming in just a month so
we hit show you a little bit just in
time I've just moved in time to just
booked another transatlantic slide and I
go back to Europe so yeah so we're
hitting Helsinki Azerbaijan Baku will be
in human Yana Slovenia will be in Madrid
Spain then we'll be in whistles off in
Germany for their annual database
conference and then I'll be back over
here and clean a little wing all over
the map and that's quite close Amira
it's every second we can be skipped
Africa it's just Europe and Middle East
Wow Wow well thanks for stopping by and
talking to me it's good to see you again
if you'd like to attend
an upcoming Oracle code event you'll
find a complete list of those events on
developer or Golduck develop developer
oracle gob slave code there in addition
to a list of those events you'll also
find information on how you can submit a
section proposal so you can present your
own session edit oracle codes event for
the Oracle technology Network I'm Bob
Lubert
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
