DevOps easier like docker containers a
lot of these methods let's face it these
methods aren't that new are they I mean
they had containers and partitions and
stuff way back in the day some form of
with virtualization containers have
existed for a long time I was really
excited I was I was a very early adopter
of Solaris zones when that was
introduced with Solaris and I guess
version 10 yeah and I love zones and I
didn't get why not everybody else would
do it and now everybody else is doing it
or something very similar with docker
yep and yes these sewers are available
it's being able to quickly spin things
up it's it's the ideas of untangling
your application from from the ends and
just having functional VMs that do one
thing that you did thing that you want
them but rethinking Morphin that's what
that's what this building block needs to
do then you get that building block
together if it's container or VM or
whatever and then split up that's mm-hmm
but yeah that's been long way coming but
just like I said Solaris 10 was
announced more than 10 years ago yes and
zones have been around actually my very
first conference presentation was about
our Solaris zones cool that's very cool
so things are changing then for the
database administrator and moving toward
DevOps so with things in the cloud who
was I talking to earlier today I thought
I asked this question they you know if
we cannot get under the covers and move
things around tables and all this stuff
the way we want them to and it's we're
back to just clicking on the icon right
it's just it doesn't feel like it's
really gonna get done does it scare you
have to give you have to give up some
control but I think it's giving up some
control and and just accepting that
sometimes things also work in different
ways than they have always worked right
and and they do generally and sometimes
they don't but sometimes to do we just
have to keep trying and new things do
come along what's new with Pythian
Pythium there's except well obviously we
are focusing on so many different
technology areas that's all Rick Ulis
used to be the it used to be to take the
primary thing that we did and now it's
it's one of many many service offerings
that we do around relational databases
no sequel databases well we're getting
more into the product space where we're
now thinking of taking what we've
learned from from our consulting
engagements and Terk taking that stuff
into products so we've done that with
with analytics we have launched what I
called kick ass kick analytics as a
service nice we've done is we've we've
just reverted back on the projects that
we've done for our clients or if
implemented analytics platforms we
identified common building blocks and
and we're now changing the way we do
business back from or away from
consulting gigs where we try to
understand what clients are doing and
then come up with a solution where now
we come in and we say this is well this
is a common design pattern that we see
we so like the reference architecture
this is what we generally do we can spin
this up easily because we have all the
DevOps workflows to spin these
environments up quickly on either and
any kind of cloud provider anything as
much cloud native technology as possible
and then connecting it and ingesting
data sources from our clients and that
that then gets the discussion going very
very quickly into the direction of I
actually want to use my data away from
which technology should use we just come
up with a suggestion on this technology
to use it's a trial that we sell as a
product but it's really just reusing
cloud services interesting
that's very cool congratulations that's
a big step yep you know good strategy to
starting from the data what do you want
to what do you want to find what do you
need to know yeah and then reusing
recycling is really big keys you don't
want it again we can't give up as an
industry we can't keep up if you treat
every new engagement as its own unicorn
thing and we start yes fun to do it
needs to be done sometimes but I think
it's an industry we need to be better at
actually getting products out getting
standardized workers out and repeating
things that we've already done so not
reinventing the wheel and but but then
on the business side that also that's
also different because now then same
thing with autonomous database then you
have to make the conscious decision of
giving up some of your flexibility for
taking the benefits of reusing things
how many of us are ready for that
I mean it's certain industries they
probably are not that comfortable with
that whole notion let's start with
health care they're not gonna be well
maybe they would like the black box
approach but there are other industries
that won't like that approach they're so
promiscuous with their data they wanted
everywhere everywhere that's not the
problem the problem is really more do
you really need to have your own very
very custom built system or it's your
hospital just running similar to every
other hospital does do you need special
workflows just because somebody someday
said we will do something a little
different and then you hire a consulting
company or a development company that
implements this specific work so or is
it worthy to say what are other a lot of
other companies - to be doing and can I
just reuse what they're doing without
going into this customization craziness
that we have and and also let's face it
nobody very few people are running IT
because it's so much fun to run IT most
people are actually yeah but how many
businesses and industries set up their
their differentiation is their data
center and how fast they can get ATS
that their data and what they do and how
they analyze it I mean that is their you
know their differentiation so if you
level the play on the playing field
yeah but you don't have to you have to
customize everything a bit of it there's
there's certainly and again take
healthcare a lot of health care is
actually delivering healthcare it's not
yes IT can help you do stuff smarter
there yeah but just and there are
certainly some players that will
revolutionize the space and that have
good ideas about what to do there right
but does every hospital have to run
their own very very customized versions
of data bases in their own customized
versions of of products probably not
probably pick one or two and really reap
the benefits there and and use that but
I think we have to just get a lot more
things standardized nice alright then
well food for thought and we will be
catching up with one another on the road
during the year I'm sure I'm certainly
well I'm planning to attend a lot more
all Kiko diamond these have been so
fantastic I've had the fortune of being
at two which is not that many compared
to how many that were right but I really
really want to attack or
next year it's a it's a really
refreshing format where it's a good mix
and a good blend of some of the
traditional Oracle folks and then some
younger newer developer types that may
have not been working with our key
technologies but are interested to see
what has Oracle done what can we do with
them and how can we leverage the very
very solid technology statical Oracle
has but some of the more modern approach
to software development so I I'm really
keen on going to more code events and
seeing you there hopefully right on
alright well we'll see ya excellent
thanks so much it was great talking to
you beyond Thank You Nora all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
