Shaw and I'm from Oracle here's a little
bit about me I've been doing this web
thing at Oracle for a while I created my
first product in 1998 it was the first
web product at Oracle had and a lot of
people got really mad at me because
Oracle forms head competition and they
thought this web browser was clearly a
passing fad I mean the whole idea that
you know you'd run something you know
over the internet was a bad idea at the
time but but I persisted and I'm very
pleased that given a few more years that
it turns out that people actually like
to build applications in a web browser
it seemed really foreign you know back
then but we've been at this for for a
long time so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to walk through an entire process
I'm going to create a database I mean in
other words the tables and generate some
random data then I'm going to build an
application on that data and deploy it
and I'm going to do it using what we
refer to is like a low code app dev
process some of the things I might say
if they're future or let you know and if
they are futures they might not come
true or they might and so when you talk
about code so how many people here are
actually developers how many people
write code every day that's all I could
say I even though I've managed quite a
few people and quite a few projects I
still code I still enjoy it and I still
break the build I broke the build two
days ago and it's kind of annoying so we
have this like this image of a broken
cup we give the cup to the person who
broke the build so I own the cup but
this morning someone else broke the cup
broke the build so I got to relinquish
the cup and give it to Allen anyway
sorry insider joke there all right so
when you're developing applications
there's this spectrum and so like you
could have no code like just check a box
saying yeah please give me one of those
things you could have low code maybe a
little bit of if then else where you
could have full control where you write
some JavaScript or Java and from my
perspective the absolute best is
to actually code the least right this
whole idea that I should as a developer
even though I can code that I should
recode everything I need if I need a
really cool report and searching and
filtering why should i redevelop that
every single time I want to create a new
instance of that that doesn't make any
sense
so I know I want to leverage as much
stuff declaratively as I can so we'll go
through that in fact why we just dive
into the demo no one like to see
PowerPoint do they okay so okay so
everything I'm doing here is on the
public Internet it's all free free
forever
no one's going to call you this all just
just just have at it and so the first
the outline of this presentation is
documented on Apex oracle.com slash load
code and I use Apex but you could be
using other technologies as well and and
basically the idea is to get hooked up
with an environment maybe it's local on
your PC maybe it's a cloud environment
the next thing is to create data or a
database thing that you want to actually
interact with and build a web
application on then you build your web
application you need to pull yet so
those are the four steps so the first
step is I would go to well I would get
an environment so I'm going to I'm gonna
click here and if you don't have an
account on Oracle you just click create
an account if you do have an account you
can just sign right in and you can gain
access to Oracle application Express in
this case I'm going to run this
application called quick sequel and so
how many people here know sequel write
sequel quite a bit why everyone pretty
much that's great and so I've coded a
lot of sequel I joined Oracle in 1988
and I positioned myself as a sequel guru
I studied really intensely for two days
I felt that I was abs I dominate the
entire language I do select insert
update delete I could do creates and
drops I had it all but but um it hasn't
really changed much and so it's really
great I of course
a lot more sophisticated with analytic
functions and things like that but one
of the things is that it can be a bit
tedious and so let's say I want to
create a table called department and
maybe it's got an ami maybe it's got a
location then I want to have employees
that are a child table of the
department's table so I'll just indent
it a little bit maybe employees have a
name and an email address and so it
generates the sequel as I type it so i
zoom in you can see I just so as I just
type this stuff so my name maybe I want
to have that to be like only 200
characters long and and I'd like to have
maybe a third table underneath that
called skills and a skill zoom out and
it generates all the data model for me
on the right now let's say for example
that that's interesting but there's no
data so I just say insert 10 generate
then it will actually insert random data
for me and if you use English and you
use things like names first name last
name or whatever it will attempt to find
cities and states and countries that
kind of map to what you have so it
shipped with apex but to make it
convenient for people so if you have a
cell phone or something like that want
to try it right now is I won't be mad
you can go to apex at Oracle comm slash
quick sequel and I guess you could
dictate to Siri but that might not work
but but um how do you say new line to
Siri like departments new line space
space space name new line
I have to get someone to help me with
that so of course you can save them as
well
so is this product ships with apex and
you can get it with 8x if you're running
apex application Express on your on your
work Alexia are free database or inside
of your company you can run it there but
you can just use the free service it
doesn't do anything other than create
this window on the right so you type
sequel on the left and it creates sequel
it creates sequel savers on the right it
doesn't actually run the sequel
statements just just generates to see
what you could run it someplace else so
I've saved a model here and it's called
right here so so basically what it's
going to do so we're going to create so
first I'm going to prefix it for DC
washington DC and I guess a drop two ran
this before and I can use identity data
types so I work well you can just say
identity but I'm going to use triggers
to get unique identifiers for each grow
four to populate my primary keys and and
and the way the system works that
there's there's robust help and twenty
different examples and such but it will
actually create the primary keys for you
so I did enter a primary key it will
just create one but you could create
your primary keys if you want to in this
case you can also do like check
constraints so for example I have skills
and proficiency that's the pipe number
and it's very promiscuous you can
basically say num number number you can
buy the full full syntax is just
intended to be sure and so so if I if I
if I um so I just go through everything
here so when I generate data for
countries it's going to say choose one
of these values so slash value says dis
choose the US the Mexico or United so I
put United States many times and then
theory it since it will be selected
randomly I'll have more United States
maybe someone else has another country
they want to have favorite country
someone's gotta have a favorite country
India alright Modi
so we should get some people generated
from India okay then this last part here
I guess I've created too much sequel but
no don't don't ask me again yeah so so
you can create a view which is like a
saved sequel statement and it's going to
join the department's table the
employees table in the skills table and
so the syntax it gets generated for that
is right here of course I could type all
this in but the pain in the neck and so
for example there happens to be columns
that are called the same in multiple
tables so like the department ID is it
might be in two different places so so
it actually generates a name that are
that is fully qualified so that they're
unique because all the column names have
to be unique interview and so it
generates insert statements create
trigger statements index indexes for
unique values you name it so that here's
you click here there's gobs of examples
and syntax
it gives tells you how to do it alright
so now I've got all this sequel
including people from India and now what
I want to do is I want to run that
sequel statement so I'm going to log in
to Apex Oracle calm so a free service I
pre created myself an Oracle code
account but you can sign up for one and
on the video on this low code site I
have a video of how to sign up it takes
like one or two minutes depending on how
fast you type and what do you know what
you're doing and okay so I don't create
an application yet because I don't have
any data so I'm going to go to the
sequel workshop and I'm going to upload
a script sewing as they create and I'll
call this a DC live I'm going to paste
this in and so if there's my five
thousand five hundred and sixty seven
lines of sequel which I created just for
you guys
and I'm going to try and run it so it's
going to parse all that sequel stuff and
it tells me there's 368 unique sequel
statements and 96k of text so I'm going
to say I want to run that so it's going
to run all those statements now it's run
them let's see if it worked oh my
every single one failed what did I
possibly do wrong reference table oh I
know what I did wrong I'm sorry so I
wrote this code myself and I know the
bug if you notice but this this this
primary key was missing somehow like
when you click it every once in a while
it just goes through some path and
doesn't generate the ID so I can do that
again apologies go back to scripts and
I'm going to create will call this test
to paste this in run this so I'm just
running all the create tables insert
statements that will populate my data
model and I don't see how I did this
time okay I've got three area errors
inside the table didn't exist which is
all good because I'm trying to drop a
table that didn't I was unable to create
the last time so now I've got my data so
I can look at my data go to the object
browser and the tables are prefixed with
DC so in the quick sequel tool I just
said I just used like department name
but I told it the prefix is DC so it
just went prefixed all my constraints
everything which is prefixed so and I've
got my employees I can look at my data
looks like a lot of keys and all the
randomly generated data okay so now I've
got my data and and and I want to build
an application so I click on the
application builder yeah
seriously
and probably not is that the common
table that we have been using from the
hood but it's based on the type of a cat
yeah so what I do and I actually ship
the codes you can look at my code and
see if you think I'm a good programmer
or not probably in the middle someplace
but what I do is I have a I'm going to
guess around 50 different keywords I'll
go off like Department location country
city and I have a whole bunch of random
data that I create that I collected on
internet and I also generate I took a
big chunk of Latin text and I just index
into it and so if you said something
like comments or description and it's
like Savarkar 4000 I'll just take an
average length do it proper words and
I'll index into the Latin text and just
give you random Latin words if you gave
me something like you know conference
room ID or conference room and it was
safe our car 30 then I'll just get a
Latin word so depending on the size I'll
just put Latin text in so it's not the
world's most sophisticated ener if you
I'm on Twitter among a lot of places you
can email me Michael hit rhetorical calm
and I'd be happy to build out whatever
feature and deploy it on on the Internet
but so it is data type so if you for
example have a date like I had a date
called hire date it doesn't know what a
hired it is so what it does it says and
you can do dates timestamps timestamps
with time zones all those types of
things will just generate random stuff
but but let's say you want all dates in
the future well I don't do that I just
generates random dates you know in the
past so I just assume that most people
want to see dates in the past so that it
has its limitations right but what we
you get is a sequel file you don't like
the sequel file you could just whip
through an editor and search replace and
say oh but I want to use a partitioning
I don't support partitioning we'll just
go and create the partition you get the
sequel you can you can futz with it yeah
okay so now we've got our tables they've
entered the data and I'm going to build
an application how many people here are
familiar with application Express I'm
going with like more than half maybe 60%
and so application Express is a
web-based application development tool
that kind of specializes in building
applications quickly assuming that you
kind of know sequel so accurate for the
people that know like that so I'm going
to create this new new type of
application called a blueprint app it's
the same as the old app and you can the
application you create here will run on
any apex of five one database so even
though this this new wizard is not
available to you on premise you can run
it in our cloud so if I want to add a
page come parents that I'd like to add a
page maybe it's a report maybe is on a
table so let's pick a table DC employee
skills there we go
I'll do this and then let's say I want
to have a color scheme maybe I'll take
this color scheme if you want to icon I
don't know people have preference of
icons maybe database icon choose your
color
I'm sure the smarter chef good colors I
can't see it so I'll create my
application so it creates the
application and now I've gotten
application it's a URL it's on the
public Internet if you went to this URL
you would see this application and I can
log in and there I go so what I've
created what is called an interactive
report and so let's say I want so we had
this proficiency which is one through
five select fives a guru and ones like a
novice so I'll just say five and so we
want to have people that are proficient
with five in India and they have to know
let's say Oracle apex so here are the
four gurus Indian gurus of application
Express so I like this report so I'm
going to save it save report public
Indian Apex gurus
that's cool it's going to reset it now
so if I shared this with my colleagues
just by sharing this URL other people
would see Oh a primary port and there's
another public report called Indian Apex
gurus they just click that and bingo all
the filters come in I could have ordered
it differently I can actually have this
email me every week or every month or
every frequently as I want so I might
like create an exception report like
well for example I developed various
cloud services and I want to see I pull
by my service and so I run a every night
I have a job that goes out and says me
interactive report of everyone that
bought the x8 Express or database schema
cloud service and I get to see that and
I can filter is like oh how come it's
doing this how come we're selling more
through the store through the partner
store or whatever I could slice and dice
into what I want okay I'm just going to
delete this application because it's
it's interesting but it's not that
interesting so I'm gonna try and create
something that's more interesting so
that means I can try this again and I
can add pages of different types so I
can have a blank page dashboard page
chart pages and such as this cool new
feature called blueprints and so what
every time I create an application like
I just created one two minutes ago it
creates a blueprint and what a blueprint
is is just a JSON document so it's just
a standard JavaScript object notation
document zoom in here and and and and
what it what it is is it kind of
describes everything I point is in
clicked on this application has well
it's not interesting as it only has one
page but we just load up another one so
I say blue sorry load a blueprint so I'm
going to load this one up it's got eight
pages so I create this one a few minutes
ago
31 minutes ago and so I could have
edited I could have created all this
stuff but but and clicked on it and such
but but I'm just for the interest of
time and I I'm using a blueprint so
basically it's just stored that but I
could edit the JSON or I could edit it
online so if you're into text
you could let's say you want to create
an application with 100 tables and you
could just cut and paste and change your
tables or if you're smart enough to
write like a shell script like generate
an application is a little bit of JSON
you could create applications with
thousands of tables in seconds so I
haven't done this yet but I want to try
it's like Oracle got the dictionary so I
should be able to create an entire
report on the data dictionary with
drilldowns to everything in a few
minutes just just by querying the data
it extremely and generating the sequel
from sequel anyway
haven't tried that yet so would have
been a good demo I guess so I can fuss
with various things it also had this
thing called features so I build a lot
of applications a lot of applications
that are used very widely within Oracle
and I've been doing this for a long time
and one things I've learned is that when
you create an application it's great to
be able to say oh here is a report and
here's a chart but you also need to have
access control because you just say well
these types of people can do this these
types of people or administrative of the
app these people were just read-only
users these people can do updates you
also might want to have activity
reporting like for example how many
people use this report is it used all
the time how many push pages in the
Apple in the report people use you might
want to have like an email system that
says oh I'd like to email everyone
certain things or I might have events
that I want to whenever this thing
happens I want to email people this
things happen so we have an email
framework we have activity recording we
have all these features built-in so I
can I can check you know individual
features or just check them all and I
have advanced settings where I can put
in like other other things as well so
and of course all this is just I can do
it in the GUI or I can do it in this
blueprint I can cut and paste and edit
and change that or a contingent here so
I'll create this application this will
take a little longer so it's going to
create probably about 50 pages it's
going to create reports and charts and
it's going to create a component that I
like quite a bit we designed last week
in the weekly for called a new master
detail and we all have Macs and it was
basically modeled after email so I'll
show you that in a second so hopefully
creates
so it's going to create the reports as
well as the forms to edit edit my data
so there we go
so let's see is create my application
I'm going to run the application so I
have log in and I got these pages and
what it does is a head like a home page
and it puts this we call it a kind of a
card list
on the home page so for every every
other page I created I just simply
create a card for that so I create a
report called departments and one called
employees so it just simply creates a
car if you don't like it you can just
remove it so let's see what we got
so first thing we got you have click on
departments and notice I have drill down
reporting so I didn't code this at all
right we created the tables a few
minutes ago and now I built this
application and it's got these locations
they're randomly generated and I can
drill down from one to the next and so
okay I've got drill down reporting we've
got filtering I can just filter on any
random data so I've got that going on
here's here is the master detail so in
this report what we have is we have
employees and that each employee has as
any number of skills and so we have this
person I'm going to give them a new
skill let's say they're really good with
tennis I don't know maybe a three or
four so we add them there so now they've
got that so in in this much JSON and
just a couple points and clicks I Mel to
create a master detail report that has
the this disability too so for example
if I want to filter everyone maybe I
want only people that their country
contains India so I'll add that filter
and all these people are Indian
employees and I can click and it's
pretty fast I mean I'm public internet
sharing with thirty thirty five thousand
other people so but it works I can
create new employees edit existing
employees reset my filters just get back
to the where it was
so it also can I also create some charts
so of our randomly generated data tennis
only has one value so it's clearly
outlier there and in the countries
remember I put like the US many times so
the United States is is dominates the
pie chart there we have this this
randomly generated I had a higher date
so if we've got a quick sequel here hit
on date hired and so that got translated
into the sequel as date hired so so you
don't have to put like underscores and
things like that so if you if you used
Oracle reserved words like you said
created or description things that
you're not allowed to use it puts like
Vout in front of it so that it is just
kind of smart to prevent you from doing
something that won't actually create
okay so this is interesting so so what
you can do is so I'm going to click on
this employees and so if I'm using this
system remember I had those features and
one of those features that I didn't
discuss was called feedback so you get
this little feedback link up here so you
look at this report and someone leaves
feedback and says you know why can't I
click on an employee to see their skills
okay so I've entered that as an
administrator of the application I could
look at feedback and I could look at
this feedback that was just entered so
you know what they're absolutely right
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
edit this this this thing I just created
this report and I'm going to find the
employee name column and I'm going to
make that a link so I want to drill down
and I'm going to define the target of my
links when I click on the employee name
I want it to go to this skill finder
page 50 and I'm going to need to pass
50 ID and I need to pass the employee ID
and it clear the cache for page 50 and
I'm going to need to give it the name of
the column okay so now if I run this
report the name is now hot and I'm going
to click on Marvis oh my hold on I screw
something up so I'll fix up set it
couldn't find a date item ID so pull a
name target page
that is the wrong page I did choose the
wrong page it's page 40 there we go
my previous application it was 50 so
it's kind of like taking a mental
shortcut there so now I'm going to drill
down on Marvis and it went right to two
Marvis and so I don't know if you
noticed that but I'm easily amused by
certain things and and so if I just go
and click on a random person's name on
the left hand side if we wrote some
JavaScript it's going to scroll the left
hand side to put the name where it's
supposed to be right you won't want to
see the name not shown so I click here
and it Scrolls the JavaScript right to
that person and does that so this is
kind of like the value of low code like
you can all write this yourself you
probably if you can't do it yourself you
know someone that could do it for you
but like why write a thousand little
features why not just leverage something
that someone's elf is already written
and so that that's that's the value here
so now I've got this this this
application with various feature
functions all done so I can show you a
little bit about the additional features
we're doing so when you create
applications I create lots of
applications and often I write one
application that give too many people
and one of the things I like to do is is
I have it feature-rich everyone that
says hey I wish the application would
have this or that so people have project
trackers and they say I want this
feature in that feature and I say yes to
everything and so now the system is
unusable because you run the project
tracker it's got 50 features and 50
buttons you don't know where to click so
we have a solution to that problem so
what we do is we have these things
called build options and apex for those
people that know apex but basically you
can flag things like pages or buttons or
regions things on the page use flag it
say this is part of this quote build
option so maybe it's activity reporting
so if I want to disable that you just
turn it off and so what what I'll do
then is when I distribute applications
you people can just choose which feature
function they might like to have
sometimes our developers are building
applications and they're building new
features out plus they are going to
build five new features for the next
release and let's say say only three of
them are actually ready
two of them aren't quite ready yet not a
problem we'll just disable those and
then go live with the other three but we
but we can ship it with everything in it
we just disable the feature so what when
when I created this application there
was nothing no smoke or mirrors but you
could you can create if you just every
click I did you can create this
application yourself I didn't
there was no extra code hang and I know
you would have all these things just
just available to you so it's got it's
got that it's got this ability to have
application settings so for example one
of the things I've learned is that
whatever you name your application
someone's going to have a different name
later on so we call it skills track
maybe simply want to call it skills
tracker and there you go so now the
names called skills tracker and it comes
up here with this and so so you have the
ability to change the name and the
little blurb underneath it the
application also came generated with
help text and so I can show you when I
I'll come back to that when you're
creating it in the JSON or otherwise you
can put help text on every page so what
we do is we we pre populate the pages we
generate with help text for like the
interactive reports that you saw we
generate some help text that helps get
people going they might not know how to
do the email subscription part so we
point them to how to do that but you
could also add you add your own your own
help so the other thing is we if you
don't have to choose all these features
but if you did you could say yes I would
like to allow my end users to change the
colors because not everyone likes gray
like gray because it lets the colors of
the application pop but other people
like other colors that's not a problem
so we just go like this and say yes I
want to allow people to change the
colors and now it's in a completely
different look and as a user of this
application I can just come down here
and say customize and say I would like
to have it in red so there we go got it
in red so so if you choose to just
deliver your applications that way so
another feature I like little bit is so
when you create applications you let's
say I create an application say it's on
you know three or four or five tables
it's nice that you'd have search so at
the home page of the application or on
any page you can just click a search
dialog and I'll search stuff in it by
default this will just search every
table that you used and so if I look for
a name see if we have just typed in a
name and it finds Ali
there he is and presto I can search on
them drill down I find out that Ali's a
excellent sequel no he's a beginner of
sequel and so so basically what that
allowed me to do is it built out
searching and I can certain what by
default it just searches departments
employees and things like that and and
of course I can write this this Google
style results a little more robust and I
can edit this page and build that out
but by default I got something was
reasonable right so you if you work in
your company you've got a bunch of
tables reviews you just literally just
create reports on them build one of
these apps and just click search it just
searches every column in every table and
bingo there they are and you link to
them and just shows you where they are
you can write this yourself but why
bother someone's already done it if you
don't like this you can tweak it okay so
click go to administration so on this
report I click on top users and I like
this report cuz it's kind of hard to see
but basically what it shows you is is
who uses the report in which hours a day
so there's 24 hours in the day starting
from 0 23rd hours by the time of 24th
hours starts it's really the next day
and so you can see that I did the user
Mike the login is nobody but the user
Mike did 165 page gives on the 21st hour
of today whatever the time zone of the
server is then I should probably make
that a little more easier to comprehend
you can look at the errors that the
applications raised and remember I got
that Eric's I said that was page 50 when
it's really page 40 X oh there's one I
could see the performance
and so from a weighted performance
perspective page 40 was that was if you
multiply how long it took to render
every page by the number of times it was
run that report was the slowest and it
took an average of 0.06 seconds to
create and so if I want to put two new
SAP Lakai ssin I should tune that
because it takes 2.06 seconds and it was
run 97 times you multiply those two
together and and then you'll get the the
performance I can do it by you know
different different time periods this
report app was just created so if I do
it for a weeks not going to mean
anything and I can drill down and see
like I want to know someone calls me up
and said you know I clicked here and
just didn't work so I'll just go and
I'll filter on their user name and I'll
be able to see which page views they
went to and I'll say oh you must be on
the search page and you probably didn't
click the checkbox on the left and and
they're like how did you know like no or
I got you covered
anyway okay so those are some of the
features there the email functionality
is it we're still building it out but
what it what it shows what it provides
is a number of templates that we have
our graphic design team build out that
are capable of being rendered and pretty
much every email client and and you what
you can do is you can then call AP is
that we document that that can send the
emails to do this if you want to send
somebody an email saying you know your
projects past due or you have you
haven't taken compliance tests or
whatever happens to be you don't have to
build that from scratch so we don't we
don't actually build out the entire
feature for you but we build out the
framework so for example if you want
have an opt-out message people get
emails from you they don't like it they
click on op opt-out they don't get any
more emails from you and so so you
anyone can do that
just takes time takes effort takes
testing and so so we built that for you
so if I want to add users to my system I
can do them one by one or what what
we'll do is someone might have an email
chain you might have 50 people on the
email chain
you just paste the email text in here it
parses out all the users gets rid of all
the text of the email like can you meet
Thursday at 3:00 just gets rid of all
that just take the email addresses and
then assume your users or emails your
user ID is our email email address
format it'll just parse all that out and
create all those users so internally
we'll just take a big district email
distribution list paste it in and then
presto I've got an access control list
for my entire application I say Oh
everyone's a contributor and they are
all set up so this takes seconds to do
that so when people use an application
it's nice to kind of see their picture
and so built into this is a user
preference feature so you have
preferences looks alright not the
Preferences that's like your time zone
and whether you want to see emails or
not so they have profile sorry and so I
have no pictures I just created this so
I could say update my profile and then I
got my picture handy right over here
it's going to drag that over and my
email is michael dot hitch wha-at or
goal com
and now there it is and we can we
haven't done this yet but we can show
you how to use this picture and like
like if you have like a little like a
fritter discussion we could have your
picture throw up in that show up and put
a discussion but you can just look to
see how its rendered on this page but
the idea is that it makes applications
you build more personal because you'll
see everyone's picture they use it so
many people upload pictures of their
dogs or their favorite cartoon
characters but it's all good because you
get you get some visualization about the
personality the people you're dealing
with not just just the abstract thing so
to go back to this this idea of low code
is is that you should be able to get an
environment easily and so you can do so
by going to apex at Oracle com sign up
answer a few questions about whatever
and then you're good should take no more
than a minute once you do that you can
use quick sequel it's linked here so you
go to Apex oÂ´clock home slash load code
quick sequel is linked apex Dhokla comm
slash quick sequel you can watch the
video so you had to do it can look run
the examples I had to email anybody the
example I use for this this presentation
then you develop the application and you
can use apex and apex is very capable of
building very sophisticated you can code
JavaScript you can do your own CSS you
can write your own templates just a lot
of advanced stuff going on there but
you're not forced to use it and in my
opinion you should not use it unless you
need to use it and then you should use
it but you should you should only use
build stuff yourself if there's no
widget that provides that feature
function and to deploy this application
I'll show you how you do that so I built
this application I've customized it so
I'm going to export it I click export
and export it downloads show in my
finder here it is it's not very
attractive but it is a complete
encapsulation of this application so I
can import this out
location on any to apex environment you
have apex five one you can import this
application if you don't have the data
it will return like table of you doesn't
exist but if you do have the data it
would work great and if you want the
data of course you just grab the data
from quick sequel so so and and to share
that that you just share them the URL
right oops right there so what do people
think about low codes people people buy
into this idea that you should use
higher-level widgets or people think you
should code all these things
individually and any comments you like
high-level widgets it could make you a
star right because let's say you stay up
all night and you figure out this
JavaScript there's got Kyle over here we
stayed up all or you work very hard a
number of these widgets right
and Kyle wrote some of the JavaScript
here so you could do that and you're a
hero right but then like what did you
not do like when it would be better if
someone else just did it for you Kyle
did it for you no one knew that you did
it or didn't do it when they get the
application see I like your application
they didn't know whether you coded every
last JavaScript widget so it's nice that
way so question yes so the question is
if yet if you have Excel data which is a
top use case for low code i've got data
and spreadsheet I don't like doing the
data in spreadsheet I want to upload it
to this let me show you how that works
so good application Express sequel
do what a dick we don't allow uploading
of PDF sometimes in PDF you can cut and
paste it if you can cut and paste it
into a spreadsheet then you can upload
it so if you get it in CSV or tab
delimited or anything like that it's
fine so like you might have a wiki page
like a confluence page you might find
data on a web that's an HTML table if
you could just cut and paste it you can
you can load that data and so I go to
utilities sequel workshop utilities then
data loading and I can load it from a
text file I can load it from XML I can
upload spreadsheet data and I can do it
through cut and paste or I can just do
whatever so what I did when I was
collecting names is I would you know run
various name generators on the internet
and all kinds of other things and cities
and I wanted cities that weren't like
London or New York I wanted to like
obscure cities and so I went trying to
find obscure cities and then that was
about five cities I'd like I just put
them into a spreadsheet and then I would
paste them and below them a table then
once in a table I could futz with them
from from there so so it's um it's it
and Oracle has other tools like sequel
developer that can load from
spreadsheets and then on the PDF it so
it's a little bit related but when I I
have my Apple my report here so I got my
employee skills oops sorry
skill finder and so if I can I if I have
a report I can I can download this and I
can download it to PDF or to email or
HTML or all these different formats if I
can download to HTML and that lets me
like publish like a static web page I
might like I might be into that I might
want to give someone to spreadsheet
because the analyst really just wanted a
spreadsheet format you don't want it PDF
because I want they don't people to be
but some of the data so so those are the
different options so this question I
care so it's free and it's not free
right so so it's a freemium model so
apex comes free with a database so
Oracles idea is that we charge a lot for
our database you notice that we have
like a my sequel database and it cost
this much we've got the Oracle database
and it costs more
depending on how many options you buying
things and so there's there's some value
for that and so one of the things that
it comes with is you know application
development tools and rack and data
guard and in memory and multi tenant and
multi version read consistency in row
level locking and hybrid columnar
compression and you name it right so all
these features that the Oracle database
has it comes with and and what we want
is we want to make you use and like the
Oracle database that is my team's
mission so everything we do is free the
real kind of the back story if you want
it inside the boardroom explanation app
is like the late 90s and I was with this
guy so he bossy were chatting with Larry
and that the tools business was just
going down like no one was buying tools
I'm like what's up with this we used to
charge for sequel plus I got to way back
so we kind of decided you know what why
are we charging for tools we should just
give it away jobless free PHP is free
Ruby Perl Python or free tools should be
free and and so some things in the tech
industry are free and others are charged
for so the database we charge for it's
kind of an arbitrary rule so what do we
charge for what's free well you can have
a free my sequel database but if you
want support for an or belated is you
charge for anyway so it's a long
explanation but but we want you to use
the Oracle database and if you do and
you'll like it you'll you'll you'll give
us plenty of money oh yeah that's just
that so what we want to do there is we
want you to be experienced with it so
you would not use our technology if you
didn't know our technology so what why
why do I put why would I feel very
comfortable with Oracle because I use it
and I like it I might there might be
other technology might be better but I
just not comfortable with it so we want
to be you what we want you to be as
comfortable as you possibly can with our
technology and if you want to use it for
Mickey Mouse things to show things off
please we don't we don't we have no
interest and you're not going to you're
not going ready to check anyway so so
what we've done is we have you have
Oracle skills and you go someplace else
you'll say yeah you know I like Oracle
it were
for me I know how to use it you should
you should put a unique index on that or
you should partition that table if you
want to perform better so so we want
that's the reason we have a text or comm
and we're extending it so that this is
part of the future we have a text or
combo we're going to come up with a free
database model so if you read the
license of Apex duochrome carefully it
says you can't use it for production you
can use it for dev you can use it for
test you can use it for education
thousands of universities use it for
that sort of thing but this new one we
plan to have it available for production
use and we are going to provide a
gigabyte of storage which can be
compressed so that would be like
millions and millions of rows of data I
have a project tracker I've been using
aggressively for six years we put all
our data in it's it's not remotely
touching that that limit yeah sorry ah
so you have to deploy an Oracle database
if you want a free Oracle database you
can use Oracle XE so you can download
Oracle XE for free you can run that in a
container you can run that into VM you
can run that in a Mac I personally run
in a Linux VM on here you can run it on
any Oracle database so what you would
need to do is you need to install
application Express in that database and
then you could run it and it so you
would go to import so I can show you
that so it once you're in Apex
and you had that expert files I just
exported so you go to the application
builder and you say import and I choose
that file on your server so you only one
port apex will have no applications it
will just be a raw apex and you'll
import that application and then it'll
just show up and you can run it and do
whatever you want so it's not option we
use that term like option to rock data
garden rack but it's a free no cost
feature it's a no cost feature you
already have it it's been we started
shipping in 2004 and so if you have a
database newer than 2004 you're all
hooked up that comes with every Oracle
database every Edition and if you buy
our cloud databases it's available on
every single one of them and customers
use it on every single one
work well a database can work with DPD
and so so we have a number of
applications that are deployed of that
there's a couple features of Apex and
there might even be some white papers if
you google the two but if you don't get
what you need please send me an email
and I can hook up with Jason Straub who
is our a tech savvy PD expert but a lot
of people do use that to allow everyone
to get their own slice the data it is
not and so what what was interesting
about the web and web technologies if
you're into it like open source angular
and and jQuery think about that they
change all the time and so apex kind of
insulates you for that but we can't do
it can't really provide backward
compatibility but if you created an
application apex in 2004 you'd be able
to run that same application today so
we're forward compatibility so as long
as whatever you grow is the same version
or a newer version will always import it
but we can't do is provide newer
technology and all it to run on an
engine that doesn't have that technology
in it it works on Oracle Linux it works
on Oracle AIX it works on Oracle Windows
it works on every Oracle database that
you can you can buy or or have free
since the 2004 doesn't work on Oracle 2
or 3
no it supports 11 - so yeah there is an
extra caveat there that when Oracle
database supports its virgins for some
number of years so 12.2 is we support 12
- 12 11 - 12.1 and 12.2 so if you wanted
to use an older version of Oracle
database you could still run an older
version of Apex but we don't in a newer
version of Apex might work we don't
certify it we don't we don't support it
because we don't support the database at
all because it's 10 years old or
something anything else yeah so Oracle
res data service is also known as boh
RDS is the mid middle tier and and it's
um it's it's integrated into apex so you
get a sequel workshop and you go to
restful web services and I got an Oracle
code I didn't show this part of the demo
but if I wanted to so what I did is I
created a restful web service on this
employee data that can test it and I
don't know if you can see this but when
you create an application it's nice that
you created a graphical user interface
but other people might want to interact
with the data that you're collecting and
be interested in your employee skills
and know who your Java gurus are and or
apex gurus are in India and so they
could get it in JSON format they can
integrate it into their JavaScript
application or maybe they build it
Android or iOS native application and
they would just consume the data from
JSON so you can do that so Oracle has a
service called Oracle resident services
it just runs in any Java container even
comes with a free Java continue running
jetty or or GlassFish or Tomcat or
WebLogic server or whatever whatever you
happen to run so it comes with its own
if you want to run something lightweight
or you can run it with WebLogic whatever
you want to do has no cost
supported with your database if you have
want to call or call for help you just
have to be a licensed user of the Oracle
database you can help
how does the JSON that's exported
compared with OData I'm not a guru on Oh
data so what I know that the JSON that
we emit is complies with the Oracle JSON
standards but you can change we have
like three or four different levels of
standards of the JSON has so for example
it's hard to see on the top of this page
but we have like pagination if you have
a million rows you need to have
pagination so there's a specific style
on which you would you would do the
pagination and so or SEO services forget
baby send me an email I can have someone
actually answer it there's what we want
to do with ORS is support various
formats for JSON so like there's au data
and then s ap has their own standard
it's called something else and we want
to support that too so it's not hard
right you just take data from a database
in this shape and put it in that shape
and ship it down the wire you get right
you can then you can you can then pass
in URLs or your eyes and you can run you
can run queries against that using
different cell query syntax yes Oracle
rest data services then see just Google
Oracle or IDs and I'll come up and we
should get lots of things and Jeff Smith
our product manager be more than happy
to give demos or anything you'd like and
there's no cost it's very popular and
we're using it throughout all of our
cloud and the next version of Enterprise
Manager uses it exclusively so all the
collects all the agents whether or not
they don't write like your own custom
agents they just do everything through
ORS it's it's much more efficient more
appropriate way to request information
from an Oracle database it's not by
writing your own agent but to do it in a
standard way through Oracle recitative
services and you get swagger based
documentation if you're into the various
documentation center it's very cool
other questions there you go there's low
code
