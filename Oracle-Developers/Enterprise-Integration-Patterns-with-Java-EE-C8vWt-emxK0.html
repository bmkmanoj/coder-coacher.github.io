consultant at a company in Germany which
is called in OQ and I'm here to talk
about enterprise integration patterns
today just one one thing to mention
first I'm on Twitter on the handle at
Gulch tilt and if you tweet about this
talk I would be would be very kind to
include the hashtag so I can get back to
you I will just sit through the tweets
later on today and then I will respond
to any questions that are there in the
tweets okay so let's start as I said I'm
going to talk about enterprise
application integration patterns and
just let me cast a quick vote who have
you already heard about the term eai or
enterprise application integration
perfect is there anybody who cannot
handle this term or doesn't know what
the actual benefits of this is about
perfect okay so basically this talk is
introduction to the enterprise
application integration in general and
why in my point of view this is quite
important to know about the patterns so
let's start when someone mentions
enterprise application integration at
least in Germany I often hear people say
something like oh hey I patterns in 2013
really are you going that way nobody
does it anymore and you know what
actually that is my problem many
solutions I saw didn't recognize
enterprise application integration
patterns though in my point of view the
things could have been much more easy
and I just have to say that integration
challenges are still around and in my
point of view they are actually growing
and why is that so
because actually integrations necessary
when at least two applications or
modules connect either one way or
bi-directional so actually machine to
machine is not only about exchanging
data but also about providing services
to maybe get unknown applications and
the reason for this is that today mostly
every customer can access companies
services for example via their mobile
phone or their smartphones and thus
company customers expect companies to
provide their internal services which
are actually only available via hotline
or via the desk to offer these services
as a kind of self care interface and
that is why in my point of view we have
more and more integration challenges so
we're going to talk about the eai
patterns and these not only touch
application integration architecture as
you know but they describe solutions for
common integration challenges and that's
why they are often called remedy for
integration pains when we think about
patterns
most of us first of all talk about this
20 year old design patterns book by the
Gang of Four which describes proven
solutions for common problems but I
don't know how many of you were at Java
one last time last year when we had
multiple talks about why these design
patterns aren't actually worth watching
anymore
my point of view this is totally
different for the enterprise integration
patterns if you don't know the the
classic on eai patterns yet this is the
enterprise integration patterns book by
Gregor hoppy and Bobby Wolfe and this
has been created under the guidance of
Martin Fowler and this not only
describes solutions but it actually
defines a common
capillary which was missing before that
book and it describes a common body of
knowledge for a synchronous messaging
and that is why this book is also called
the Swiss Army knife for a synchronous
messaging and you can find more
information about the book and current
information at eai patterns calm I will
get back to that page later on in the
talk and in my point of view the most
important statement in the book is in
forward when there are several
integration styles discussed by Martin
Felder himself and he said that we all
believe that Aston Connors messaging
carries the greatest promise so for the
ones more advanced this means that he
not only describes that asynchronous
messaging is actually the way to go but
the next step would actually be the
stage event-driven architecture which is
called or abbreviated as si de I'm gonna
provide a link for those of you not
familiar with Si de with the slides so
is it really about messaging so my
application needs a kind of inbox or
something like a postal service well
actually the benefits of a synchronous
messaging maybe aren't too clear when
you first of all her hear the term the
first thing that most people mention
when they when they argue about
asynchronous messaging is that
applications who rely on a synchronous
messaging are highly decoupled and that
is actually because of the message based
communication and also through the
messaging infrastructure for example the
message bus adapter we have the ability
to integrate heterogeneous platforms and
languages so it's no problem to connect
a java application to an SI p system or
our net application also we have
reliable communication when when we use
transactions and persistent queuing
where necessary so for we can actually
decide where we want to have this
reliability and we need it and where we
don't and through this decoupling
actually comes another benefit which is
called disconnected operation that means
any component of the system can have a
downtime without making the system fail
now we'll also get back to this later on
and through this disk upload decoupling
and disconnected operations you have a
throttle system which actually means
that you have a variable timing for each
component of your system so you have to
imagine that you have systems which are
decoupled into separate components and
that you can tap a time each component
at its pace which means if one component
can't work on more than 100 messages a
second you can easily scale this with
the a synchronous messaging ok now maybe
we got Y as mikanos messaging is nice
but why do we need the patterns while
the thoughts on enterprise application
patterns is that Gregor happy once
stated that real patterns aren't
actually invented by someone who is just
a genius real patterns are actually
observed from field practice and another
point is that good patterns don't solve
everything but just a concrete problem
and they provide ideas which means that
they give you an idea on how to approach
a different challenge or problem
and another statement I really like is
that good patterns evolve over time
which comes in for the AI patterns
especially because as I mentioned before
the AI patterns calm website holds
information on all patterns that are
available and the changes which came in
over time you remember the book was from
it was written in 2004 and all the
changes that happened from 2004 until
now are actually incorporated into the
into the website because this is still
managed by Gregg Araki himself okay
these aren't nice ideas but you may ask
why should I care
really okay I can do it myself better so
let's dive into a kind of real life
scenario there is a simple order
management system from a a so-called
fourth party logistics provider or 4pl
which I did a couple of years ago and I
don't know whether you all are familiar
with the four PL term and this is
actually a a service provider who has no
real logistics hardware or or trucks or
something like this who is just into
providing services and organization and
therefore 4pl is always about
integrating other business partners and
in this case the customer said okay I
need an order management system and
really all I need is a small basic Java
EE application where I can type on the
artists manually or were my where my
employees can type all the artists so we
created a small trut application based
on Java EE which was actually a
so-called information sealer so it had
no connections to any other system and
all the information that was should be
insert it had to be typed in manually
and all the information that should have
been extracted had to be printed out via
the web interface but as it happens
there are changes and it took only a
month until the customer said well this
typing takes actually a lot of time for
my employees I want you to enhance the
system with an order importer and we
have a external business partner who
sends you CSV data beyond HTTP POST and
this CSV data contains header detail
records and I want you to import these
data into our database so we can see it
in the web application and hello we were
into integration challenge so we thought
about ok we have a simple Java EE crud
application here why not solve it with
Java EE ap is so here's a simple Java EE
sample which solves the problem what
this does it's actually a a simple Java
servlet registered on the on the context
root of / auto / import and it takes a
post request reads the CSV data
parameter from the request and hands it
over to a CSV data parser which is a
self created class and this parser
returns a list of orders and then we
simply persist the orders with a Java EE
being so that was a simple change what
if we do to the system from
architectural point of view we just
added an HTTP endpoint added a
transformer and so the external business
partner was able to send a CSV data and
yeah it seemed good so far so is
everything okay here until now I would
say yes no problem works okay but you
know change happens and after about
another three months the requirements of
our 4pl service provider grew and grew
and then we had to integrate another
system of a for water I don't know
whether you are familiar with the photo
of for water term this is actually a
service provider for shipment and what
this should do is that new shipping
should be sent to this for water system
via FTP but unfortunately only the for
water system couldn't send us any
responses back so the employees of the
for water would create a mail put in the
their necessary data and sent it to our
system so we needed an SMTP adapter and
then the business partner from outside
had another requirement that he wanted
to see the status of an order and he
wanted to have a rest interface for this
so he could for example cancel an order
or things like this but unfortunately
the for water system wouldn't let us
change anything except for a soap web
service security and encrypted endpoint
so we had multiple interfaces which were
there to to implement into our and a
simple crud application so what do we
learn from this
change happens okay now would say you
can recognize an integration task when
it's staring in your face yep that's
easy and the solution might look like
this yeah if you want to build an easy
and maintainable solution for multiple
integration challenges that is actually
no problem but the solution might look
like this so when we think about the new
requirements that we had just let me
cast a few a short vote I'm interested
in this how many of you have seen such
an implementation in encode yet yeah
thought so and who wants to maintain a
code base like this okay perfect
Thanks so going back to our simple Java
EE sample I would ask against everything
good here or is something wrong is
anyone developing agile here so what is
about easily testable doesn't look too
good reusable mmm
maybe we can you reuse the CSV data
parser it should also be testable about
hmm okay it's this extensible easily I
guess not
so and this point in time we also have
to ask ourselves if this is not tests
not too good testable not too reusable
and not extensible how good would a new
team member
accept such such interfaces that we
created for a simple thread application
which grew over time
oh sorry
and the answer is mostly they won't
understand our yet standard based but
self-developed code that is where the
application integration patterns come in
so let's introduce a simple but very
common integration pattern called pipes
and filters the pipes and filters
pattern is actually about dividing your
task into small steps that is the main
point of application integration that
you think about what you actually want
to do and divide your integration
challenge into as small steps as
possible because these small steps he
referred to as filters are much better
testable extensible and reusable when we
think about this sample here which is
directly taken from the enterprise
integration patterns book what do we
have here I think we can easily see that
there is an incoming order and the
incoming order arrives as a message and
we see that the order is encrypted for
security reasons and to show ensure
integrity so we need to decrypt this
what else happens there we have an
authentication filter this means that we
have to check that this is actually a
trusted customer who deserves a special
treating and another point is the deed
up we won't we don't want to duplicate
orders in our systems so we also have to
check this and let's say when you have
requirement changes here for example you
introduce another step where you say ok
my incoming order data is changing and I
need to transform this this is easily
possible so we can just introduce
another filter for example between the
authenticate and deed
so that the data before we check for wk
ssin is actually transformed into the
format that we understand so you see by
applying this pipes and filters pattern
we have a very good structured
application architecture and what this
mean for for our sample let's apply the
pipes and filters pattern to our sample
that we had first of all we have a
inbound filter which would be the
servlet for example then we would send
the data through a pipe which is nothing
more by the channel and the channel
could be a persistent channel for
example persisted in the database or it
could be an in-memory channel just as we
think is necessary next we want to do a
transform which is a custom
implementation then we sent this
transformed data you remember the CSV
contains all the headings and order
details so we have to transform this
into just the orders with a list of
order details send these list of orders
into another pipe and outbound would be
AJ PA outbound adapter which just sends
it to the database and this is actually
easily this can easily be put together
by plumbing code in CDI now most of you
will argue that such a solution is
actually pretty hard to test when you
think about integration testing but I
can prove you wrong because you can
easily test this integration with the
arquillian framework and fitness so
don't fear the the benefits you get when
decoupling and dividing your application
to
model components you get easily testable
components in unit tests and you still
have the ability as you are using Java
EE ap is in general that you can easily
test this with arquillian with the
achillion framework which provides a
simulated java ee container for you
during integration testing so this is no
excuse for not applying the enterprise
integration patterns to your application
so actually we could say um when you get
the right tools to do the job everything
is fine right yeah everything is
infallible but maybe the solution won't
be as expected one could argue that this
is actually pretty nice because we have
all the adapters there and we have
multiple ways to enhance this and to put
other things in in there but there
should be a simpler solution and is
there a simpler solution I say yes
we have frameworks which provides you
adaptors for more than just the common
interfaces which are around these days
and this is where the so called eai
frameworks enter the stage so when you
think about the eai frameworks there are
multiple around and I'd like to
introduce to you the the most or let's
say the the best open-source eai
frameworks which are there which is
namely apache camel and spring
integration concerning the differences
between both they both one very fine
with the spring framework as a
dependency injection but camel can also
integrate very well with the CDI at the
moment
unfortunately spring integration is not
so widely distributed and the java ee
environment i got it running on a JBoss
5e ap with the JBoss specific framework
called snowdrop
but this won't unfortunately run on on
GlassFish at the moment but as we know
we have this CI extensions project and
they're working on exactly this that we
can actually start spring contexts
within a CDI container and that would be
a great fit for spring integration so
for further differences that are
actually measuring to us I would say
that camel has way more adapters
available than the spring decoration
framework which means that camel not
only has standard adapters for example
HTTP FTP file system but it also has
common adapters for things like s AP for
the Amazon s3 and for multiple multiple
other things you can imagine so if you
have really a large integration filled
with large integration challenges then I
would really advise you to take camel on
the other hand spring integration seems
much more flexible lightweight and
unobtrusive well sorry about that
so now just look let's look at a simple
sample for apache camel we have a simple
camel root here which actually handles
our scenario that we introduced before
and handled via our servlet
implementation so what this does is it
takes
requests from a HTTP endpoint which is
here located at the localhost / order /
import we provided a specific route ID
which is the name of this route so to
say and then we do actually the same
that we already did with our self
implement it sorry with our self
implemented servlet the first thing that
happens here is a post parameter
processor which does nothing more it's
actually a three lines three lines of
code which actually does nothing more
but extract the post parameter CSV data
and writes it into the body of the
message and afterwards this is say yeah
let's say camel specific that we extract
all double quotes from our string and
then this is built in service by Apache
camel as I said we can unmarshal our
incoming CSV data which is provided by
camel so you don't have to implement
anything this is really great
configurable and in this case you can
provide several several ways for
extracting the CSV data and what this
does is actually that you have the CSV
data and this is split into into a list
the same way that our self implemented
CSV data parser did it only with the
abilities of apache camel so we didn't
have to build anything ourselves and so
we don't have to test this because
apache camel and also spring integration
have a pretty decent test coverage and
all the things that you don't write
yourself you don't have to assure that
it works for yourself but the nice thing
is
see this is a very fluent API for for
apache camel camel also has the ability
to to be configured by an XML but it
also has the ability to be used as plain
java objects so you can configure it
either way you like it or which fits
best for your application that means you
can easily integrate your components
with apache camel implement the
interfaces of camel and mix your stuff
and test your components on a very
simple basis let's look at another
sample for spring integration so what
spring integration does here is actually
the same but splain integration doesn't
provide a fluent api yet what it does is
basically the same in the XML we create
a HTTP inbound channel adapter which
listens on the on the context root of
slash order slash import and only
accepts post methods and sorry only
accepts the post method when a request
comes in it is transformed into a
message this message is sent into the
orders in Channel the upcoming splitter
is listening on the artists in input
channel and you see here we have a we
have a reference to a simple spring beam
which is here this is a reference to the
order splitter and this calls the method
split so you see this is the way to use
your components with spring integration
this is another way spring integration
doesn't provide a a standardized CSV
import so I had to write it myself but
the nice thing is that spring digression
doesn't rely on that you implement any
interface you just have to write a a
simple class name it whatever you want
name the method whatever you want expect
an incoming string return a list of
objects and then you can use it this way
in your spring integration configuration
which means this is far more easy to
test then when you have to implement any
interface which has to be there in your
tests and you have a larger test scope
actually then when you just have your
plain java code another nice thing is
that spring also provides a our spring
integration provides a very decent way
to handle the the JPA entity managers
here as you see the JPA updating
outbound gateway will actually only take
our list of orders and call the entity
manager for this list of orders and
simply update or insert the orders which
are in the list so we don't have to
check for duplicates or things like this
if the order is already there it is
updated for us if the order is not there
it's inserted so that is a nice feature
of spring integration
so now you could ask so should i always
use an e aÃ­ framework actually that is
your choice it really depends and your
choice should from my experience depend
on your existing application which means
if you already have a Java EE
application and want to use a eai
framework or want to integrate the
integration challenge to your system
that would mean that you would have to
couple your application with an e aÃ­
framework which as I mentioned is at the
moment only possible with apache camel
but the other question is whether you
actually wanted to introduce an e aÃ­
framework into your java ee application
with JMS 2-0 it's much easier to just
send out in JMS message which can be
handled by a separate application this
separate application is actually nothing
more but apache camel or spring
integration so what you have is
afterwards you have your Java EE
application running just fine and you
have you have separate applications
running there doing your integration
stuff and that is the nice thing that
when you have such a decoupled system
that you can easily scale your system as
you need it you can easily pull out a
for example in an apache camel root and
put it into another application and
start it twice for example let's say you
have a a database back-end as I said
which cannot handle more than 100
requests per second then it would be
very easy to reproduce this database
back-end and to duplicate it and to
duplicate the application that is
actually putting the data into the
the database system so in this way you
have for example two integration systems
which both put 100 requests per second
into your database into separate
databases and these can be synchronized
afterwards so you have no problem to
actually scale and throttle your
application as you need it and there's
another point on the asynchronous
messaging that you can also say how many
messages may be cute in a persistent Q
this is for example necessary if you
want to have a disconnected operation
feature so let's say you want to
maintain one of these two integration
systems which right into your database
you can if you have a persistent queue
you can simply shut down one of them and
the other one will just run fine but
only at the speed of 100 requests per
message per saying sorry so as I said
your choice depends on your application
but it also depends on your
infrastructure if you don't have the
infrastructure and the network resources
and the people that actually can
maintain and maintain an operation those
multiple systems then the choice would
be that you had to actually implement
the integration into your Java EE
application to have as few systems as
possible but yeah this is not the the
way we actually want it to be and mostly
when we discuss with operation teams on
a consulting basis that actually comes
out that they first of all fear that
more systems would be would be an
overhead of more maintenance but
actually as these small integration
applications become very lightweight
it's actually a relief for them because
the maintenance time they need actually
is being reduced
because of the decoupled operation and
disconnected operation so they don't
have to wait until for example 8 p.m.
and the evening to shut down an
application but they can easily do it by
the day during the day and the third
thing your choice should actually depend
on is the know-how of your team if you
have a team which is already familiar
with Java EE I guess you wouldn't want
to introduce the Spring Framework if
your team is actually very familiar with
the Spring Framework maybe you wouldn't
want to introduce Java EE as an
integration solution so my advice is if
you have a Java EE application Java EE 5
Java EE 6 then start with the Java EE 7
api's me great and have a look at how
many integration challenges and
interfaces are actually there and then
afterwards if you consider to decouple
your components and to make them as
small as possible then you can easily
scale up with your created components to
apache camel or spring integration which
means you have your Java EE application
which contains your small components and
you can just pull out these classes and
put them into the spring integration
application and use them there without
implementing any interface without
changing your code this worked at a
larger customer telephone company in
Germany which was really skeptical about
this so further tips considering EA I
from my side as already said small
building blocks is actually the main
message I want to get over today because
the smaller your building blocks are the
easier the faster and the cleaner is
your feedback and that is actually what
we are talking about when we are talking
about agile development we want to have
a fast feedback we
want to have easy testable components
and that means create small building
blocks another point is on keeping it
simple please consider - don't have
shared mutable state in many
applications I see that there are like
global configuration stores or a global
cash system where multiple multiple
classes of the application read from and
write into if you want to parallelize
processing you have a big problem there
when you don't pay attention to
concurrency and if you use if you don't
use shared mutable state but immutable
objects you won't have these problems
and the next type is actually derived
from this use immutable data transfer
object objects which are an AI contexts
also known as messages I don't know who
many how many of you already seen this
message interface of offspring
integration or apache camel but they are
using the Builder pattern which means
you create a message via the Builder
pattern and you cannot change this
message anymore you can just hand this
message you have over to a over to a
message builder and then modify via this
message builder the attributes that you
want to have modified but you cannot
modify a message so everyone who has a
reference to this message can be sure
that this data won't be changed and this
is a very relaxing and relieving a
pattern when you actually think about
paralyzing your your threads because you
don't have to think about concurrency
and the concurrent modification problem
so use immutable data transfer objects
and by using you actually increase your
scalability
of your applications and make it ready
for scalable processing and for those of
you who want to have and let's say
advanced insight into this get familiar
with the so-called actor model the actor
model is actually a way of handling
state only buyer immutable messages and
as you see this is underlined here in
the slides there will be a link to a
very nice visual explanation of the
actor model and how you can actually
implement it into you in your
application so that's it from my side I
would say thanks for your attention I
hope everyone takes away something from
this talk though most of you already had
were familiar with the enterprise
integration patterns what I really love
to have is your feedback on the chart
because this was the first time I gave
it and yes I would really love to have
your feedback your questions and so
either ask questions now or you can also
tweet with the hashtag j1e AI if you
like so any questions from your side
yeah
you mean with the apache camel a CSV
configuration okay the question was how
does camel handle a different data
formats in CSV file you can actually
configure this most of this is handled
automatically which is pretty nice so
may even has a kind of sorry apache
camel has a kind of analyzing your data
and so it will recognize whether this is
a date or not but you can actually
configure this so you can say okay
column four is a date and use please
please use this date pattern to
transform it why is that advantage
because I can see okay
I decided for watching a few years ago I
am okay so the the question was how is
what are the benefits of spring
integration compared to Apache camo
as I said a my point of view the spring
integration is much more lightweight
than apache camel will not only
considered considering the dependencies
which come in but also from a point of
view of the application development
model i can show you a sample where you
actually wouldn't expect that there is a
spring digression happening there what
you can have first of all you are
absolutely right you don't have to
implement or you don't necessarily have
to implement interfaces when you're
using apache camel but what you don't
have with patchy camo is spring provides
a kind of proxy mechanism which lets you
inject a interface into your class you
can use it as a normal class calling
these the methods on the interface and
there actually is no implementation for
this interface so you just create an
interface for example with them with a
with a method that takes is actually in
your XML code and then or in your Java
code if you if you want to configure a
spring
in Java independent of spring
integration which makes it much more
easy to test so if you use the fluent
API of apache camel
you always have to test with the kappa
mechanical components in mind and you
have to create a matching test context
and this isn't the case for most of the
things you use spray integration for I
know yeah as as I said it's you're just
providing the information but it's I
know that that is actually the point but
you have to use these camel test classes
that is that is the point and what I
what I wanted to mention is that oh
right well with Apache County yeah yep
you're welcome
my opinion on mule ESB is yes I'm
actually a little bit opinionated on
this because we had a really large pain
when migrating an application from J bus
for ei p2j bus v EAP with mule one of
the problems was that we were using new
- prior to this this is about I guess
three years ago and mule - was
open-source you can use it for free but
moo3 isn't so that was actually the
first problem when we thought okay do we
want to pay for new just the the
framework not the ESB or don't we want
to do this and the problem here is that
actually we couldn't see the the benefit
as we were just using the mule
integration framework so that we would
have said okay
there are so many benefits that we want
to pay for the integration framework and
that was when we really got into
struggle when we had to integrate mule 2
into J bus five there was a lot to be
done and mule still yeah doesn't feel
too good in my opinion and as I said if
you want to have a SB product the mule
ESB comes into mind but if you just need
an application integration framework
then I would certainly say that mule 3
isn't superior to anything either spring
integration or apache camel i would
always choose both over the mule
integration framework you're welcome
any more questions yes
you seen the jameise 2-0 API okay let me
just think about whether I have assembly
the API got very very very very much
easier than JMS one and I think yeah
Aaron Aaron Gupta just published the
Java EE 7 samples which are related to
his book on on github he one I can give
you the link and you can have look into
this it's it's just a breeze it's really
easy and nice to use he has several
samples on different scenarios there and
actually he's always up for feedback on
these things so that would be what
probably be a way to to look at this
okay any more questions so as most of
the others already gone I would say
thanks very much for attending and yeah
let me know your thoughts on on Twitter
or yeah I'll be around the conference
for the next couple of days so maybe
we'll meet each other thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
