Weaver guy you're the James we were guys
Marin Gupta guy we both have our day
jobs in terms of you know we do a bunch
of Java stuff and go travel all around
the world we actually meet lot more
outside the US than in the u.s. right
but this talk is primarily about
introducing Java programming to kids and
the main goal of this talk the main
essence of this talk is purely based
upon our experiences on what we have
done and what I have done to teach my
kids and what Jim has done to teach his
grandkids are you say I'm older than you
are
no just good you know okay so these are
my fine
beautiful smart grandkids this is Caleb
on the left and Jillian on the right and
I've been trying to teach them to
program as a matter of fact it's kind of
a weird story I'm a job evangelist and I
kind of fell into that because I have a
passion for JavaFX well my passion for
JavaFX actually started in 2007 when I
was looking for a programming language
to teach Caleb when he was I think he
was about three and I was searching for
this programming language that I could
use to maybe build a really kid-friendly
like three-year-old kid friendly user
interface and then have it generate code
for him and then he could see the code
and and but that didn't really happen
and because I fell in love with the
language itself and became an evangelist
and it was very working for son and
Oracle and kind of got sidetracked but
now that he's you know they're six and
nine back teaching them how to program
so yes right and those are my voice
literally for me and my experience is
starting sometime last summer or so or
last winter when my son said dad my jaw
is broken I said what do you mean my jaw
is broken what you mean but what a jar
is I think maybe talking about some jar
I think but then we started having a
conversation he said oh my minecraft.jar
is broken so how do you know what a jar
is and then the conversations literally
about the winter timeframe flipped we're
when I'm not a gamer I don't play video
games so he started literally the
conversations on the breakfast table
which were annoying to my wife breakfast
table driving to school coming back from
school driving two classes completely
changed we were literally talking about
the concepts of what classes what a
property is what a variable is what a
public method is what accessors are you
know how do you decompile the code in
all those concepts and I was telling him
that and on the other hand he was
teaching me the basic minecraft skills
you know so like I was thinking about
how do you do them what do you mean by
mod so then he started telling me what a
mod is how do we build a mod so let's
look at the configuration and so that's
sort of my basic experience and
everything kind of around builds around
that so what you want to talk about is
what do you mean by introduced
programming to kids you know is there
any right age on how do you introduce
programming two kids now programming by
itself is a very abstract concept but it
can be very directly correlated to
real-life concepts like you want to
build you know you need to have those
analytical skills for example you want
to solve a problem so you need to have
the basic problem-solving skills if you
tell a kid that you know what let's go
ahead and solve this problem they may
not be so excited about it on the other
hand if you tell them hey by the way
you're having this toy you want to put
two blocks on top of each other and then
the third block on top of it that's
again a problem-solving skill so and
then correlate that to programming you
know how do you do that in Java effects
so for example in Java effects you want
to build a square you want to fill it up
with red color so you choose the colors
that are available to you very basic
programming skills that are very very
handy to you logic structure basic maths
so for example if you want to build a
game in the game you want to throw a
ball at a moving object you want throw a
ball at a moving object the object is
stationary here by the time you throw
when you throw a ball
is going here but the object is moving
so how do you calculate sine cosine
momentum how do you get those basic
concepts into your mind and how does the
kid correlate to that now if you take a
kid with you like a ten-year-old and say
you know what let me give you a first
trigonometry lesson if I go I don't
understand this but the moment you say
hey you know what let's build this game
and try to understand how this
correlates to the game then they
absolutely get it what's really nice is
is the tools available now I mean
Aaron's been talking about Minecraft and
Michael : we'll talk about green foot
and blue J and some other that we'll
talk about scratch some some facilities
to really help kids learn programming
back in my day you know am i I've got a
34 year old daughter that's the mother
of those two children you just saw I
tried to teach her programming when she
was seven so the tools I had to use were
a Radio Shack color computer with basic
does anybody remember the Radio Shack
color computer right and so I'm like I'm
all excited you know because I'm a
developer and I'm all excited and I
remember giving it to her for Christmas
and then we open it up and I said you
know let's hook it up to your TV and
let's let's draw some circles this will
be great and so you know we're coding in
basic you know and you know the
awkwardness of the editor and all that
kind of thing and she's like honestly
really just didn't you know lost I mean
anybody would lose interest in in doing
that except for somebody that was really
you know they're they're really destined
to become a programmer because they
loved a program kind of thing everybody
else would have been bored by that time
right so I don't blame her I blame me
and also the tools available at the time
they just weren't there
wait and in this talk what we will do is
we will focus a lot upon the tools so
like we'll talk about scratch Greenford
bluej minecraft modding Lego Mindstorms
we'll talk about all of those different
aspects how the tools are so advanced I
hear from parents all the time
why does my kid is so addicted to
minecraft sounds familiar
Wow minecraft or addiction line go
hand-in-hand so our thought process at
least the way I think is let's leverage
their addiction and passion for the game
and introduce Java programming to them
okay this is sort of the key motivation
for them and I may be jumping the gun a
little bit ahead but I had a workshop
earlier this year where they were like
15 kids we taught them basic Java
programming concepts these are like
elementary schoolers fifth grade kids
they were sitting in a room six hours
without any break just a lunch break but
no snacks nothing the whole motivation
to them was I wanna build a minecraft
mod they build their simple hello world
program they learn how to navigate the
code Java C Java compiler NetBeans
all those basic concepts were introduced
to them and because they wanted to build
a model yeah so so basically you
introduce those six year old kids now
how old were they nine nine year old
kids into unhealthy habits like we
programmers do every day right six hours
in front of the keyboard sitting no
breaks nothing right so let's get them
indoctrinated feed their addiction early
to where they'll be productive members
of society and and then right yeah okay
nice nice but keep it's tragic
good strategy yes we keep it fun though
we do keep a funk every right we throw
them a pizza under the door every once
in a while right that's good
nice always about motivation can we can
weed yeah I just you know when you think
about motivation Trisha Trisha G is
Trisha G here by the way as part of the
the London Java user group community and
just they're like changing the world you
know with adopted jsr and that kind of
thing but her blog says you know my
mission is only to change the world and
so I asked her what do you mean by that
and she said well you know this
typically you've got an audience of
programmers typically you know middle
aged males
young the middle-aged males kids women
things you know there are groups that
aren't traditionally into programming
and so people ask her all the time at
conferences well you know you're a woman
you're a programmer you know what can I
do to help you know to to make it you
know whatever and she takes a different
angle or her change the world idea is if
we can tell people if we get and you
know kids and interest you know people
that don't normally program tell them
and in kind of really display what what
coolness it is to to put out things like
Facebook because they use Facebook every
day right they use minecraft well who
develop that programmers right so if if
if we if we characterize it correctly
rather than the stereotype being just
geeks that you know that's sitting there
in their chairs for six hours without
breaks and you know and and in their
nerdery you know and that kind of thing
and actually developers are creating
iPhone apps and everything else that we
use today and it's it's a very it's a
very cool thing they're making things
that we use every day but also enabling
and in the case of Aditya your son being
able to then make it even cooler by by
making minecraft mod so I guess my
challenge my challenge for my grandkids
and what I want you to think about what
I'd you know if you will is think about
the the kids in your life and what are
some of the motivating factors what
would motivate them to consider
programming is it is it minecraft is it
some other kind of hook so that they at
least think about that think about
getting into that that discipline
right exactly apparently yes yeah I
think that's a hold and to buy time two
males just agree with the mail that said
that so see one of the important aspects
that I particularly pay attention to
like when we had this small workshop
with about 14 kids it was just one young
girl my goal was to make sure that
everybody is successful but make sure
that particular girl she is
understanding the concepts and she's
really enjoying it
for the first introduction you want to
have the experience to be not just good
really good because then this girl is
going to go and talk to her friends and
she's going to spread the words so I
agree I mean that's a whole together
different stream and maybe you can talk
to Regina I know about the J Duchess
program she's sitting up in the front up
Regina where is so these guys run a
program called as J Duchess where they
promote women in Java so and they have a
whole together different track they can
talk about it and keep it fun keep it
fun I think is definitely important oh
my gosh it's gotta be fun all right so
let's kind of focus on some of the tools
that we have used and this is again
purely based upon our personal
experiences I'm sure there are a lot
more other tools available that we are
aware of but scratch scratch is the
first tool it's a 2d visual programming
tool created by MIT you can go download
it from scratch dot MIT dot scratched or
ed Oh actually I think scratch.mit.edu
yes effectively once you download the
IDE
you know it's multi-platform you
download it it gives you an IDE
there is no Java programming involved in
there it's literally drag-and-drop the
blocks like I want to do if else so you
just drag and drop a block and if you
what do you want to do in F again that's
a block a four-year-old kid
five-year-old kid I've seen programming
fairly effectively in scratch and the
kind of things that you can do with
scratch are just mind-boggling you may
think is only for basic programs but you
can really go elaborate and the kind of
things that you can make with it
and literally really rapidly and because
it's all visual there is no text editing
that is involved it is very very
effective and so you're so you're
talking about
how visual it is but you're showing like
bullet points could they actually see
how visual it let's take a look I don't
know I'm sorry
so we have a history of of cutting up on
each other and we've dragged you guys
into this I'm very sorry but it'll get
me back I'm sure all right so this is a
what you see is a scratch IDE on the
right left side what you see is the
blocks for programming sprites they talk
in terms of sprites so for example if
you want to do an animation then you
create multiple sprites and the sprites
you will have different characters
characters like your these are pngs or
JPEGs that you can import easily so
these are a couple of default characters
that are available over here and then it
shows you what the sprite list looks
like and this is the main sort of
programming area so for example you say
when clicked I mean I'm not sure if you
can read it but if I can walk you
through the code here you say when
clicked on green which is the green flag
right here is say forever move ten steps
and play a drum with 0.2 beats and then
move negative ten steps so basically the
cat over there is moving ten steps
playing drums moving ten steps back and
playing drums very simple concept very
visual feedback you just drag and drop
the blocks play the green click on the
green flag and you get instant feedback
and we are geeks like as a programmer
when we do system.out.println hello
world and it actually prints hello world
we get excited talk about little kids
you know five-year-old kid if they look
at this and they get is in visual
feedback is like oh they get all excited
about it I'm excited
so so back to you know jillian
six-year-old girl she doesn't play
minecraft there's some you know games
that she does play but doesn't play
minecraft so I can't use that hook so I
thought well six-year-old that's
probably pretty appropriate for scratch
you know would you agree Michael that's
probably a pretty appropriate age and so
you know being a developer first you
know we went through about three days of
scrum training and you know I taught her
some agile methodologies and we had
stand-up meetings you know and six that
was I'm a cable 600 yeah I'm get my dad
with about ie yeah look around me
exactly oh yeah yeah did all that stuff
and then we got into now I'm just I
really I'm kidding least I said you know
what do you want to make look at this
cool thing we can drag stuff I mean a
drug drug a few things around I think I
did a little pong game for so what would
you like to make and she said you know
I'd like to make this game where you
have to drag clothes into a suitcase I
saw that sounds really good and so can
you draw me a picture
draw me a little diagram you know let's
visualize the UI a little bit I didn't
say on those words and so already I mean
she and I gave her a piece of graph
paper and that's what she drew she drew
some clothes she drew the arrows like
where they would be dragging it and I
said well you know that'll be your arrow
keys that you'll be able to do that she
drew this suitcase and then and so
already you know she's applying more
more design discipline than many of the
programmers today right because they she
actually did a UI interaction diagram so
so anyway
and so as we were creating that in
scratch then I don't know whether I
brought it up or she brought it up or
whether Caleb her older brother brought
it up but let's put a you know kind of a
some danger in there right let's put
let's make it hard maybe a game of skill
will make
which are wizards if it's dangerous be a
boy
yeah oh yes so it was probably me that
Brno I mean probably Kayla but right
there so this this wizard goes back and
forth between the clothes and the
suitcase and if it if it hits
if the wizard touches the article of
clothing that the user is trying to drag
then it'll give a message and a sound
and that was just really really easy to
do and scratch and and she had a lot of
fun doing it it was good I think the
basic concept that we're trying to tell
you here is let their imagination come
up ask them what they want to do that's
sort of their incentive and once you
show the real end project help with them
with the first couple of projects and
they're literally on their own just
dragging and dropping the blocks and the
meaning of it and they're all different
kinds of sprites that you can do with it
my boy is they players to play
Skylanders so they think in terms of
thumb back hard Eruptor and all those
characters so they were saying you know
what would be cool to build so they want
to build a mighty battle of these three
characters now there is a character
right over here on the bottom right here
then there is two characters over here
as these characters are moving they just
want to throw a fireball at the
character now if I were to show you the
game in the scratch in scratch itself
now this is how the game this is how the
IDE looks like so this is what I was
talking about these are all the
different blocks they can do so it's a
motion looks sound and sound you can say
play sound play sound until you know the
seconds you can record your own sound
which kind of makes it a lot more fun so
I think the fun part is very very
important here then you can play drum
play note you can record your sound as I
said earlier you can use pen know as you
saw in Jim's talk and other were the
socks for example it was drawn over
there so you can use pen to create your
own scratch sprites here and once you
have made the actual block all you need
to do is click on the green flag here
and then the character is just throwing
balls
at the two different characters over
there very simple and literally all it
says is just this code so they are just
dragging when you click on green flag
point in direction forever you know just
set the position just moving the
character in one direction to the other
direction very basic concepts but makes
them think you know in a mathematical
sense it makes them think analytically
that you know how I'm going to put it
into actually your structure sorry yeah
whether I would not do that so well I
don't know which one it's come back oh
there you go so you caught me so all
very simple programming concepts but it
gets them excited oh you know what
because they play with these characters
in a real or not a real life or the
second life so to say but when they
actually can manipulate them that you
know I will
telling come back to do what I want they
feel in control yeah that's that's yeah
sure yeah yeah well it is still a full
app right now so what I'm showing you
here this is not a web version of it so
I downloaded the scratch IDE and that's
what I'm running are you saying this is
only in the web version now yeah okay so
I need to to put on video what what
we've been talking about here so my
colleague here said that he heard that
you can't download it in Java anymore
and my other colleague here said yes you
can
so it's available in Java and well
wellhere's at least I didn't say this
yes yes you can
well I guess he good to scratch.mit.edu
information might be a little outdated
because we prepared these slides about
few months ago scratch I believe is
translated to other languages I don't
know the exact list of languages no
absolutely absolutely and actually in
the front you know why don't you guys
stand up there are folks here from
DevOps for kids come on Daniel
so there are folks here from the DevOps
for kids they have been running these
kids focused event all around the world
and are primarily focused in Europe
right now but talk to them you know they
have been using these tools for DevOps
for kids scratch allies and other tools
and they can definitely update you more
on the localization part of so Regina
Daniel Satya Saskia so sorry I will
never get your name right so scratch the
age the starting age I would say is
about four to five years of age and and
of course you can keep going as long as
you want to target it both towards boys
and girls Alice on the other hand is
created by University of Virginia and
Carnegie Mellon scratch is 2d visual
programming Alice is more like 3d visual
programming and the primary purpose of
introducing Alice was towards middle
school girls girls you know their
thought was girls are good at
storytelling so this is all about how do
you create a scene I have a tree I have
a character that is going around the
tree coming back so just the way you can
do it in scratch you can do the exact
same 3d visual programming in Alice a
the three main objectives it has is it
teaches the basic programming theory
just like you know the way it is done in
scratch it comes with an IDE so it's
drag-and-drop so there is no syntax to
remember per se although you can
generate the code which gives you all
the Java code backing which is
there and as I said the focus is lot
more on the middle school girls so get
more into that so kinda addressing your
point you know what is the barrier how
do we get an encourage more girls to
participate in the technology early on
as you can see there's a very similar
IDE for Alice as well this gives you a
scene view you can start these are all
the procedures and functions and
properties that are available so they
have a little bit of different
terminology but effectively you start
dragging and dropping these blocks over
here in the code editor panel and once
it's in there then you click on the
green Run button and it starts running
the entire thing in the three
dimensional now of course because this
is three dimensional so you have to
think in a little bit different terms
you know XY and z coordinates so it kind
of teaches you a different aspect of
programming personal experience the boys
that I've talked to they generally do
not enjoy Alice that much that's totally
a personal experience based upon the
boys the name itself is like a it's a
girl name I'm not going to do it second
is it's a lot more about storytelling
and as I was saying it's about the first
personal experience you know if you had
the very good first personal experience
they would love it if the first personal
experience itself isn't good then they
won't be getting a hook into it
Alice definitely supported by Oracle so
we we canna find the project very well
there are Vince dollars available on
different platforms there is beautiful
documentation available on help Alice
dot org and the main programming website
is Alice programming dotnet so we're
giving you references I know we are just
touching the surface basically but
giving you enough pointers so that you
can get started with that Michael and I
think we can have you up on the stage to
talk about green foot so with great
honor I would like to introduce Michael
calling if you guys don't know Michael
Michael is from University of Kent
Oh perfect yeah yeah Michael ISM
University of Kent and he's the original
author of green foot and I will let him
talk yes can i plug my laptop in maybe
can we do that on the fly or so too
dangerous to play with the technology
here put-put they put the technical
support on this phone okay
I think they're coming no I'll come do
it if I if there's a chance of it
succeeding because instead of just
talking at you then I can actually show
you something and I think that would be
much more interesting you'll see this is
all a bit at hook not really well as
well plan so we haven't really okay
thank you this wasn't really planned sin
until yesterday also Erin and Jim just
kindly asked me since they wanted to
talk about green foot and I'm here and
green foot is my project that I could
just as well do this thank you for
inviting me so what I'll do is I just
show you quickly just for a few minutes
what green foot is and then I'll take
off again green foot is environment also
aimed at programming for kids a little
bit older our age group is that we
targeted it's sort of 13 years upwards
and that is when you make the transition
out of scratch Wireless away from block
languages and start using text and it's
actually Java in there so I'll show you
what it is he has green foot up on
screen I have a project open already
here and while he's doing that can
everybody hear when he's turning his
head away or would you appreciate if
he's everybody can it's ok ok good ok
good
all right you I have here project open
already that I've written I have a class
diagram here so these are the classes
that are involved a class called one bed
here you know if I click on this ice
oops oh I didn't restart that after
sleep that sometimes happen I get a menu
there today and I can create an object
so from the class this is no job of it
starting talking about classes and
objects from the class I can
actively create an object what you see
here in the menu that says new wombat is
actually just calling the constructor of
the vomit once I have an object here in
my world I can click on this and I can
see all the actions that the one but can
do that is just all the public methods
it extracts the public methods from the
class and shows you that and allows you
to interactively call them so here I can
say move and the one but will move
forward into that again I can say turn
left and it will turn left and of course
if I have a woman wombat class like and
create mobile mats and so I can start
discussing concepts of programming
classes and objects like and also do
parameters for example here's somewhere
or return values here is a set direction
that has a parameter if the method has a
parameter it allows me to type in the
parameter and then execute the method I
have a method on the world the world
itself as an object of course that
allows me to put some leaves in and then
I have a run button because what's
happening here in Greenford is there is
one special method called act if I call
act that object will just do whatever it
wants to do and I've got an X button
here when I click act then the act
method of every object in the world will
be invoked and the objects do something
and then I have a run button and run is
just a loop around act so if I click run
the objects will just run around and
that is now they're sitting right on top
of each other here those two guys and
the objects will just do whatever they
want to do so this is how we start what
we're doing here is we let them play
around a bit for them it is playing but
what they're actually doing is they're
learning the main concepts of object
under programming they learn to
distinguish for the classes and an
object they see you know program
consists of classes from class we can
create objects objects have methods
methods can be invoked and then fairly
quickly we get from there into
programming it yourself because because
when you open these classes you know
there's Java code and
this is a different project now it's not
a one-bite anymore it's a crab but
that's not so different if I click run
here oh I was just about to say nothing
happens and it does happen because I
wrote this before so let's delete this
because how we hand this out is usually
like this
we this is how we give it to them first
you put the crab and you click run
nothing happens and then we open the
editor and see here's the act method and
there's no code in it that's why nothing
happens and then we start writing code
so we can write move in here for example
it's one of the answers and then I
create a new crab and this time when I
click act it moves a little bit to the
right when I click run it moves across
the screen and then I can combine this
in a write something like move and turn
let's say I want to turn four degrees at
every step what does it do when I have a
move in turn in their circle exactly it
runs in a circle and of course you can
have more of them and this is trivial
already but that is already when they
start finding it exciting you always
have one kid Nicklaus who then takes the
mouse and puts hundreds in here fills
the whole screen in there and I go run
all very quickly you to write something
like this after a little while long
after we've introduced if statements
they write something like this if
Greenford dot is keydown and I have a
say left is the name of my left arrow
key so is if the left arrow key is down
then I want to turn and then I can of
course do that duplicate that and do
that with the right key as well the
right key is done turn -4° if the left
arrow keys are and then if I do this Oh
I don't have my boots I don't have my
reading glasses on I can actually hardly
see what I'm typing yet this is typing
just from memory where the keys are on
the keyboard and now we get into you can
see what error messages look like in
green foot so and what I the point I'm
trying to make here is you get now I've
got the crab keyboard controlled and so
after after a very short time you get
keyboard controlled graphical characters
moving around the screen and it's all
pure Java and so what we do with it then
fairly quickly we get you know within
just just a few weeks we get to programs
like this where I can fly around I
should put my sound on I can't play it
very well but I can program it
so these are typical examples that you
can easily code with Greenford or we
have it doesn't have to be shooter games
you know simulations that we do very
often so for example here's an end
simulation where for two anthills and
ends are running around and collect food
and leave trails or pheromones so they
can program the behavior of the ants and
so on so this is the kind of thing I'll
stop my demo here and I'll finish up now
that's the kind of thing you do with
Greenfoot it is a project as I said in
following on from the project that Erin
and Jim have shown so far it comes an
age group to 30 now upwards and gets
kids then into textual Java based
programming but with many of the same
ideas very graphical very interactive
very engaging and interesting examples
and it has some of the same effects as
the other project
no absolutely so I think one of the key
things that I want to highlight here is
which was very very helpful for my son
was going through the joy of code series
you know Mike Michael is very humble
about that but he has done an excellent
series of YouTube tutorials search on
the name joy of code GREEN foot and if
you google that you stay here so stay a
joy of code GREEN food and that
gives you immense tutorials there are
about 33 tutorials that are available
which walks you through exactly starting
from scratch how to build a simple
application and literally you know you
can finish that you know in a couple of
weeks time frame maybe three weeks time
frame but once you have finished that
then you know you can see how your kid's
mind is running wild all over the place
is all kind of games that they want to
build with it and I think that is very
very encouraging so you saw the
interactivity over here you know how you
can drag and drop and say you know how
easily you can control how you can
introduce the basic programming concepts
keyboard inputs you know FL structure
and then connecting them to their real
life that you know as you do this is
making a change when we designed this
there's actually we designed it from two
different viewpoints there's the kids
viewpoint in the teacher viewpoint or
you being the teacher maybe from the
kids viewpoint it's a game making
environment you know that what they are
thinking is you know where we are
building a game from the viewpoint of
the teacher we wanted it to illustrate
important programming concepts well so
it is designed to actually visualize and
make interactive all the important
concepts so they see concepts such as
class and object and Method and then
they see if statements and they see so
they don't think about it like that they
think you know I'm making a game and in
fact that's I think the trick to do with
lots of kids especially girls may be
that you don't go to them inside today
we're doing programming then they just
roll their eyes if you say today we're
making a game that sounds a lot
different now that the fact that they're
doing programming that is sort of bits I
decided well we're honored and it's a
very special thing that you're here and
that you did this I mean after after all
your experience and having created
Greenfoot in bluej i'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity by seeing
if they honest has any questions for you
that we can maybe open up a little
dialogue one of the four back yes
sorry I couldn't hear it available for
download and what operating systems it
is available for download it's open
source it's free if you google greenfoot
you'll find it easily
it runs on on the usual major systems in
Mac OS Windows Linux so we have versions
for all of those it's a TSA download
it's a java application so it's a just
great Java SE
yes we have we have three different
export functions one is you can just
export it as a jar and you get a jar
that you can then give to your friends
and they can execute and their machine
if they have the JRE installed we can
also export to a webpage which creates
an applet and the HTML page that
includes the applet code so that if you
have your own web page you can then you
know copy out the the applet code in
there and they upload itself and put it
on your web page and it runs as an
applet and the third option is we're
actually running a what we call the
green foot gallery on the green foot
website is a gallery of green foot
examples and you can export directly to
our web server so you just click a
button fill in a title and your short
description and click a button and it is
live on the web server so you can think
about it like a YouTube for green foot
games and they're just like the YouTube
model anyone can see them and play them
and then you can create a free account
in a few credit in account you can vote
for them or leave comments or publish
your own so there are thousands of green
foot programs out there on the green
foot website running life in the web
browser my colleague here has a question
yes
yes we have done that I said you repeat
the question or I should repeat the
question think the question was do we
have experience in using greenfoot to
teach programmers to switch from non
object oriented to object oriented
programs of programming not kids we have
done that we have done a lot of teacher
training and most of the time the
purpose other the intention of the
teachers was then to teach it to kids
but they actually used it to learn it
themselves there were a lot of teachers
who grew up with Fortran or C and then
having program since and who used it to
learn object onto programming themselves
and that works quite well because it
does create the mental model that you
need of thinking in terms of you know
those structures in terms of objects and
classes and gets you away a bit from the
linear iterative programming model so we
have done that in seeds to work can you
take one more question
yes I said ok we have one question here
yes yes we've done we have interfaces to
all sorts of devices there is one sensor
board called the Pico border scratch
ball that was actually developed by MIT
for scratch and we have an interface for
that we can plug it in and read it of we
have a an interface to the connect so we
have examples with a Microsoft Kinect
for those probably most of you here will
know it's a sensor ball that allows you
to just wave your hands around it it
captures your your movement it was
developed by Microsoft for the Xbox four
for video games so you can control your
program just by standing there and
jumping around and waving your hands
around we have examples of that you can
program that from Greenfoot in a really
really easy way the code looks really
nice and easy so we can write programs
with that we have an interface to a
couple of small robots the Finch is one
of them the Raspberry Pi we have a
printed running on the Raspberry Pi but
we haven't published that yet because at
the moment performance isn't quite good
enough it runs but it runs too slowly to
be nice it's annoying but we are working
with the Raspberry Pi T meant with the
arm drag
a team to to get optimizations and to
make that better and we hope with work
that is currently right now being done
on the JDK for graphics optimization
that that will get us to state where we
can publish it thank you thank you for a
go ahead actually if you can give a
quick introduction to bluejay as well
you know transition from green foot to
blue jay because that's a typical
question people ask you know I heard
about green food blue jay how are the
different target audience yeah how do
you so blue jay is a second environment
a different environment and the question
before what have we done teacher
training with blue jay we have actually
done a lot more of it blue jay is the
one we have used actually also in
training commercial program as blue jay
it's a separate environment it's also a
learning environment so it's also
intended just for the first few months
of learning to be a programmer or
learning object on the programming but
it is aimed at a different level it was
developed for introductory university
level and it is also used in some
schools it is less visual less graphical
so but it's a generic IDE so you can
gluta you can write any java program
where's green foot is specialized to
these two-dimensional graphical
interactive programs a green foot is a
subset very specific class of Java
programs it is designed mostly to create
motivation in the first place and then
teach you programming green foot oh
sorry blue jay has in its main window a
class diagram and then an object bench
it is also interactive you can also
interactively create objects but it is
not specialized towards these
two-dimensional graphical applications
it's a generic IDE lot just like any
other ID and it leads into learning
programming eventually with something
like Eclipse and NetBeans into the
professional environments but the tools
are still different the tools in bluej
are educationally motivated so it still
has program visualization and
interaction to allow you to learn the
concepts of programming in our sequence
how we use it it comes off the green
photos so if we reuse blue jay I teach a
work and teach at the University in our
first year we use blue jay for a year
and then we move them on
into netbeans or eclipse and we use
Greenfoot in school outreach in our own
teaching we use blue J and then NetBeans
thank you very much for for coming at
such short notice now there are couple
of more folks from the green foot team I
believe they are sitting at the back so
if you can raise your hand please - one
hand I see but it is one person if you
have any questions by all means for
green foot blue jay reach out to Michael
is going to be here for the conference
or you can reach out to the person in
the back ask them any questions around
that switching gears Legos you know I
mean that's how we have all grown up we
have played with lots of Legos the
company was going bankrupt at one point
of time they completely cannot change
the gameplay now they have all those
kits but Lego is not just about static
blocks so what I want to share with you
but how many people have heard about
Mindstorms ok all of you cool so then
you know what exactly mine storm is is
basically an extra break with bunch of
sensors and bunch of connectivity over
there connection cables what you do is
basically a weird geek right so we take
a break the brick comes with NXT OS and
you can program NXT OS you know I'm
going to show you the programming
interface for that but as a geek you can
actually rip NXT OS and replace it with
Legos which is called as a java
operating system so with that you can
actually write Java programs that would
run on an NXT brick so you're writing
java programs putting your jar file and
putting into the NXT break and then
coordinating it that way by default the
programming environment again is still
pretty graphical so you can create your
blocks you can create the motions you
can create loops essentially once you do
the programming the program actually is
being fed into a NXT bot so this white
thing here in the middle this just this
white block over here is the NXT break
these are the different connectors and
everything over here comes with the
Mindstorm kit and you can see here there
is a color there's a light sensor here
and there are wheels over here so you
feed the program
into the NXT brick and then you guide it
where does it want to go you can
actually build sophisticated program
where you make a random line and it will
just follow the line and that's a pretty
complex program it was actually done
with University of Stanford so some of
my son's friends but actually working
with University of Stanford to create
that program so very elaborate you know
how do you get feedback to the wheels
you know this right wheel should or
right wheels should slow down and left
we you should speed up so those kind of
concepts the mechanical concepts cannot
come into picture as well something else
you know where this concept is actually
being used what they had is called as
FLL you know this is more at a
elementary school but what as FIRST LEGO
League so all of that concept of NXT
programming Lego Mindstorms is applied
to the FIRST LEGO League so let me play
a video for a quick 30 seconds maybe so
you may not be able to hear the video
but in the video what you're seeing over
here is so right over here this is sort
of a big field it's a 4 by 8 feet field
this is the bot that is moving around
the field they have programmed the BOTS
to achieve certain missions and the
missions are more like you know the bot
has to go push this dog or pull this dog
into the home base the bot has to go
there are these four medicine bottles
apparently and they could be arranged in
any order the bot has to go it has to
sense
oh this is the green bottle and once it
sees it senses the green bottle go pick
it up and bring it back to the base so
basic concepts of programming very
easily introduced to the kid they have
tons of missions that they need to
accomplish within this short feel like
4x8 field and all these missions need to
be completed in 2 - I think 2 minute 30
seconds the idea is as you can see all
these boys there are in a part of a team
so not only they are learning the basic
concepts of working in a team but the
simple concepts you know handoff ok you
are handing off the bar to somebody else
make sure you take your attachment or
your jig out so that they can put theirs
you know what we have seen that problem
real software world so this is I think
another fantastic way my son has been
doing it for a couple of years
it totally enjoys it and I can see the
excitement around it you know because
this is a simple bar and once again here
you can program it very simply you know
let it run on your floor you know in the
living room floor just follow the line
or just make it go turns make it go
circles simple programming concepts but
very powerful and very excited all right
this is the fun part yes right okay so
how many of you play Minecraft on a
daily basis well that's alright you know
there are some folks who really believe
Jeb should be the president Barack Obama
but there are some folks who say no it's
ok he's John Kerry that's fine what is
minecraft
when minecraft is a game that was that
is built by Mojang it's a game where you
basically place and break blocks that's
what it's all about think about it as an
infinite bucket of Lego you're playing
this game there's a desktop version
which was originally which is written in
Java and then since then it has been
ported on Xbox Raspberry Pi iPhone and
Android so they're all these different
games you can download the game for free
play it in a single player mode nope any
charge but the fun for the game is all
about when you play in a multiplayer
mode where all of these bunch of players
are connected to a server which is where
the minecraft server is running you are
joining the server and then you're
collaboratively building the structure
those structures could be very simple
and very elaborate elaborate and if I
show you a simple sample here this is a
somebody who built Europe on our 1 to
1500 scale you can literally know once
you see this structure you can click
click click click deep go deep into it
you can see the countries the counties
and all those details very fine another
one this is purely built out of
Minecraft blocks and what I'm showing
you is literally a tip of the iceberg
you know when these kids get to
they're on a minecraft server the kind
of structures that they built is just is
just unimaginable with that I would like
to actually introduce briefly putting
Dan green on the spot he is a volunteer
educator who has been teaching minecraft
workshops for a few years now he knows a
lot more about minecraft than I do so if
you have any minecraft related questions
by all means feel free to reach out to
me or Jim and dan green is a certainly
excellent resource it Twitter dang Java
geek and Java geek now the concept that
people need to understand more is so
minecraft is a game yeah you it's not
just about shooting and killing people
it's a lot more about building structure
but the fun for the game is where you
can actually change the game from which
it was originally designed for the game
is originally it's written in Java the
desktop version and Mojang is working on
official mod API that's been kind of
going on for a while in the meanwhile
there are other third party API is that
are available you can use those third
party API is to modify the game what do
you mean by modify the game for example
add a new character to the game for
example you want to change the explosion
like you know you drop a TNT the by
default the explosion is like three
blocks or four blocks you want to make
it bigger boys love doing bigger
explosions so all kind of things and
what I'm showing you is literally a tip
of the iceberg even in terms of mods
there is a server-side mod which is
installed on the server which all the
players have access to or there are
client-side mods which only a single
player have access to or there are
client and server-side mods which can I
transfer the state between client and
server so all these different
combinations are there believe me these
all these concepts of Minecraft may
sound like a game to you but they really
allow you to introduce basic computing
concepts to your kids very easily so
let's brag on your son okay let's get to
the point where we're bragging on your
son okay now you get there get there
this is okay so this is a tutorial
series which is on okay good so this is
the bar work this part where I brag on
his son all right his intestins name is
Aditya you saw his picture he's 10 years
old and his son taught my grandson who
is 9 years old to program in Java but
they've never met so his son created a
set of 9 videos it's there at
youtube.com slash Java and it's the
minecraft tutorial series easy to find
and to a series are videos 1 through 6
are about how to set up the modding
environment and play he has to teach you
how to play it right before the modding
even makes sense but video 7 through 9
teach you in a very pedagogically sound
manner how to how to mod it takes it's
very very nice the videos are well done
the videos are very consistent in the
way that Aditya announces them you know
my name is Aditya Gupta and I love to
play minecraft or in seven through nine
my name is Aditya Gupta and I love to
play and mod 'minecraft and he always
then summarizes so it's not like stupid
videos that you know just anybody
produce it's they're really nice ones
that that are that my grandson then
watched and learned how to mod
'minecraft so the first
so there's several mods that they go
through and you know in level of
difficulty I think that everyone might
have helped with some of this I don't
know I guess not so the one we're going
to show you is one that's not actually
in the video series but the one that
we've both played with and it's called
the TNT where you can have a TNT block
you can put it in the world and then you
can take flint and steel and you can
ignite the TN
tea and it will blow up by default it
blows up in a small explosion but the
mod then blows up you're not a much
bigger crater right so if you'll go into
the development environment like so
before that okay
now the way you would modern so there
are a bunch of different options by
which you can mod 'minecraft the one
that I'm showing you here is Forge so
you can the video actually explains
exactly how do you download forward how
do you set up for all that stuff the
idea is with fold you point to a
Minecraft it D office gates the source
code and D compiles the source code
gives you the entire source code for
Minecraft so you can either tinker with
the source code where you're changing
the source code running it all over
again but those are four hundred plus
source files you are eventually opening
them in Eclipse IDE you have to be able
to move around those source files and
make you make meaning out of it okay so
let's take a look how the project looks
like when it's open in Eclipse so all
the source files are encrypt and any
minecraft player knows that there are
there are entities in the world there
are blocks there are items so these this
TNT that will place in there is a block
and it has some behavior some the
default behavior that we'll see when we
when we go into the or the project
Explorer and find that particular entity
called TNT block or TNT block something
so it's T Prime okay entity T and T
Prime and we'll go in there and we'll
look at the list of behaviors and
attributes and so the behavior that
we'll be looking at is explode so by
default as you were saying the by
default the explosion for a TNT block is
four blocks so let me save it here and
run it okay
so this is how they would see they would
see eclipse they would see the entire
source code and when they run the game
this is how it looks like I'm going to
go in a single-player mode here well my
son pre created these games for me I am
NOT a gamer per se so better and the one
I'll try my best to play the game
properly okay so this is just a simple
plain flat world in the game itself what
you have over here is for example a hot
bar over here where you can put your TNT
flint and steel now if I go back to the
game then I can point to say I'm going
to pick up a TNT and right click and I'm
going to place it here then I'm going to
put to pick up flint and steel and I'm
going to explode it so if I lit it takes
a while but then it explodes okay now if
if we go up and take a look at it this
sort of explosion and it kind of shows
you that this is about four block bang
okay now let's go back to my game or
let's say kill this particular instance
of the game now because the kids know
that TNT is a block and the game is
logically arranged in the package
structure they know exactly where I need
to look for a particular class so you
are literally converting their logical
structure of the Minecraft game into the
package structure and you're talking
about all those concepts and now they
know I know this is an entity T and T
Prime and if it's doing an explosion I
need to look at my explode method and if
I'm looking at my explode method again
follow with the basic agile methodology
don't need to know understand all the
details all I want to do is change the
basic explosion radius to 20 blocks so
you introduce the basic concept of what
is a Type O this is a 400 by default as
a double you have to typecast it to flat
float so you start introducing those
programming concepts to your kids so
here you just make it to 20 you run the
game again
go back in the single-player mode go
back to the same world and if I'm gonna
walk around a little bit
well let's drop down first walk around
little bit yeah you're not a gamer I
mean you know how to navigate minecraft
I think you've spent more hours on this
thing than you care to admit
Gogu I like to forget the w-w-w that's
what I'm saying huh well you're stuck
hit the spacebar
I guess I've played it I guess I I guess
I played a time or two to see I'm a
programmer I'm not a gamer guys I used
to be really productive before I fell 9k
so so once again you plays the TNT here
you take a pintle steel place it here
let it explode and then yeah get out of
the way boom so now when I go up I can
see the explosion is much bigger so that
whole concept of how you can very easily
change the game is very exciting again
instant gratification is that's what the
kids are looking for now this is just a
one simple line change you can do lot
more elaborate mods over here there are
mods that completely adds a new
dimension to the game a new world to the
game all possible things and I mean you
can add a new item a new block a new
character change how it behaves so there
are lots of different aspects of the
game but the idea is you are leveraging
their minecraft passion connecting it to
the source code and linking it
one-on-one yeah they're basically two
types of modding that the one does the
initial modding is where you're taking
the the existing items and blocks and
things like that and either changing
attributes or behavior just like we did
here and then really the next step and
it's not really covered in the videos
but the next good step would be to
create your own blocks maybe take a
block and and create another one
you know copying the source code and
putting it in there and along the way
you also learn about things like
inheritance and walking up inheritance
trees because al
there is a very rich hierarchy of
classes so the hook for Caleb you know
when when Arun
told me that Aditya had created these
videos I watched the videos and it's
like yes is perfect for Caleb he loves
to play Minecraft so we downloaded the
forged files together we downloaded
Eclipse and then I had Caleb watch the
how to play minecraft videos because he
knows how to play but there are some
things that are specific to the mods
that are going to be set up so you want
to want even a few even if you're the
child that you have in mind has already
knows how to play minecraft still want
them to watch those videos and then we
watch one mod that Aditya did and then
we sat down together and said okay Caleb
this is this is how you use Eclipse and
let's follow that mod and we watched
another one and then he just did it
himself based upon completely from
adityas instruction and they're probably
9 or 10 mods then that the Aditya did so
it was it was a really gentle fun way to
get Caleb passionate about program now
it bugs me all the time when are we
going to get together grandpa and do
some more minecraft modding so it's like
it's a thing we do now so you're the
most wonderful family member for him now
that's exactly right
excellent I know Emmett and it's due to
your son no absolutely I can get good
brownie points with your kids nephews
nieces for this point believe me parents
have been telling me my kids are jealous
because they are visiting this
particular session on minecraft modding
so the last thing that I want to say
here is there are lots of resources
available on this website java number
for kids
java.net i've conducted a few minecraft
workshops we did a workshop earlier this
year to about 140 kids those 140 kids
80% of them had no prior programming
experience we taught them how to build a
minecraft mod from ground up so for
example here you can see some pictures
from the event that we did there were
140 kids lots of girls or boys and then
at the end we had a show-and-tell which
was extremely satisfying
but these kids who some of them have not
even played minecraft these kids who had
not played minecraft had no prior
programming experience in that five hour
window they could churn out some really
good minecraft mods that was extremely
satisfying so next time when your kid
says I want to play a Minecraft
say how do you want to build a mod so
let's talk about that I think we're
pretty much out of time I will
definitely take questions but outside
the room right thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
