from Switzerland and I'm gonna tell you
a story about how it's important to step
backwards when you're cutting we at the
school were during this final project
for the year and it was really really
tiring
you know exhausted and we came into a
bug and that was really a comic but
because it was a PHP problem and the
error code was like something really
funny and we were just wondering what is
happening and we need we needed to take
a break and then I came back to the guys
and I said hey let's plate the code in
parts and maybe let's do it you know in
three parts before doing it's one part
and at the end it works so thank you
very much and I don't know why I told
this story but I'm happy to tell it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
