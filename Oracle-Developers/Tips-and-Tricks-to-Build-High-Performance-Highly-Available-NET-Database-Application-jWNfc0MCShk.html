today I'm going to cover some tips and
tricks to help you build
high-performance hiya bill bill dinette
database applications and I'll explain
what some of that means in a minute my
name is Christian Shay I am one of the
dotnet product managers at Oracle
responsible for guiding Oracle to make
sure we do the best we can for dotnet
developers so that's my email address
and that is the link to our dotnet
website I am not really sure where these
slides are going to end up I assume that
they're going to be on the Oracle code
website at some point but there's a lot
of material here I don't expect you to
digest it all as we go exactly you're
going to want to refer to it so you're
going to need the slide deck so if you
can't find them you can email me but
check out the Oracle code website
alright so today we're going to point
out some of the key performance trouble
spots that we see developers run into
over and over again and try to help you
avoid those trouble spots and we're also
going to talk about some of the easier
ways that you can write dotnet
applications that get good performance
some of the easier things you can do to
get good performance and we'll also talk
about what does it mean for dotnet
database application to be highly
available what does that mean and what
can you do to make your database
application highly available all right
so let's get right into it so probably
the most important thing when you're
writing dotnet code and you're using a
database any database the most important
thing probably to pay attention to is
your use of database connections if
obviously that is going to be the
biggest bottleneck probably that you
face
in your coat why well it's pretty
obvious establishing a database
connection can take and on the order of
seconds to achieve so anytime that
you're unnecessarily opening connections
is going to be very costly to you and
also applications tend to connect and
disconnect rapidly especially on website
so what's the easy solution to that
obviously use a connection pool because
what it can actually pool does is it
holds a bunch of connections that are
already open and you just come in and
say may I have one of those it lets you
borrow it and when you're done it puts
it back in the pool you don't even have
to make a real physical connection to
the database it's already been made but
in order to use connection pooling well
you need to monitor the pool and see how
your application is using it under load
to make sure that when everyone logs in
at 8:30 in the morning to check the
sports scores they don't crash your
system because you don't have enough
connections in the pool so by way of
example we'll talk about the the Oracles
dotnet data provider we call it ODP net
that's Oracle data provider for dotnet
this is Microsoft's standard ato net
driver and so anyway by definitely by by
default when you create a connection
using arc R ODP net you automatically
get a pool and it's up to you to to set
the sizing for it we also make it pretty
easy to monitor that pool so let's what
I'm going to do in the first part of the
session is I'm going to go back and
forth individual studio and show you a
few things let's take a look at what a
connection pool might look like
okay so I have some code sitting here so
well by way of introduction I've added
the the Oracle OTP net data access
driver here and I've added it as a
reference now you can go to the nougat
and get it yourself it's really easy you
just go there and go to search type
Oracle I can spell it and you can see
it'll show up there and it'll say the
official Oracle data provider for dotnet
okay
so I've already added that I don't
really need to do it this time but you
can add it there alright so let's get
back to the code here and so by
definitely when you create a caption
with the Oracle data provider for dotnet
you get a pool now if you take a look at
the connection string up there you can
see that I'm specifying the minimum pool
size the maximum pool size there's a lot
of other things that you can do to tune
that and then I mentioned performance
monitoring so we have some performance
monitor metrics you do have to turn
these on but let me run this app here so
that so that we get some metrics but you
can actually monitor your connection
pool right here from performance monitor
so I'm going to scroll down to the OD
p.net manage driver I'll zoom in on that
so you can see it and let me let me take
that down a little bit so you can see
some of the metrics that are available
so you can see that there's different
types of monitoring metrics that are
available to you so you can watch and
see how many of the connections that are
in your connection pool are actually
being used and how many are and how many
are are idle and stuff like
and this applies to any kind of
connection pool really that's out there
so just the best practice the number one
best practice is to use connection
pooling we'll talk a little bit more
about the Kinetico DP net connection
pool a few other things you can do with
it
connection pool tagging in the OTP net
connection pool that allows you to
basically assign custom tags to
connections like this is one that has
the language set in Russian this is one
as language set in Japanese things like
that so that you can um you can have a
set of them in the pool and then you
don't have to change the session
settings every time you use one of the
connections you can just ask for a
specific type of connection that you
want that improves performance we also
if you're using clustering on the back
end if you're using one of Oracle's
clustering solutions you have multiple
nodes of Oracle we actually will take
care of load balancing for you so if you
turn it on by saying load balancing
equals true we will we will basically
get notifications from the database
telling us which nodes are heavily used
and which ones are lightly used and we
will basically send we will wait the
amount of connections that are in the
pool based on that so we'll have more
connections to the nodes that are
lightly used so you get this for free by
using the connection pool and one other
thing that you can use is a database
size connected pool so if you're using a
database that happens database from a
vendor that happens to allow you to
create a connection pool on the database
side instead of on the client side that
might be useful to you because then you
can share connections across processes
and you can really scale up sometimes it
depends on what you're trying to do but
but across processes instead of having
everything in one for one user in one
session it can be across machines across
processes all sharing this connection
pool in the server so Oracle has one
it's called Oracle database resident
connection
another really important thing for you
to be aware of is to watch out for
references the connection that you leave
open accidentally or but basically
accidentally or leave them leave them to
the garbage collector to dispose okay
because what we've seen is that
sometimes when a web application is
getting hammered really hard the garbage
collector doesn't really get involved
until it's too late and so what you can
see happens sometimes is that memory
usage increases dramatically but even
worse your usage of the database goes up
because these connections are not being
disposed and so the connection is not
being closed and so that's very costly
for database performance as well so what
we recommend is besides obviously
checking your code out and looking for
mistakes where you're holding
connections too long or when you don't
mean to also try to either use the using
clause or close and dispose all your
objects just to just to make sure that
the garbage collector does this job
immediately and again going back to the
code here I think at the end here I have
an example so I'll just bring that up
yeah so at the end of this code you can
see we're being good citizens and we're
deleting the connection the command
object we're disposing the connection
the command object and the data reader
so that's a good practice to get into or
as I say use the using clause
Lyonne variables so when you're
interacting with the database bind
variables are very important to
understand I think most of you probably
know something about it because you only
have to do this wrong a few times before
you learn your lesson so what's going on
here so what happens with databases is
they have to parse the sequel statement
that you provide them and figure out
where the data is and and and and and
how the best collected and so there's a
it has to parse it it has to strategize
on how to collect the data and that
takes time so to optimize most databases
will store the parse of that plus the
plan to extract the data will store it
in the database now if you are
constantly changing something in your
query say the where clause select
employees from you know select employee
name from the employees table where the
department number is some department
number and you're putting a variable in
there so if you just construct a string
and just tack on the department number
to the end of that sequel statement
every single time that comes in the
database may not probably will not
realize that this is the same sequel
statement so every time that comes in it
has to parse it again and so you get a
performative so the point of buying
variables is you put a colon or question
mark depending on the database colon the
bind variable and then you just populate
that bind variable with your data and
then the database knows hey it's the
same it's the same statement and it
doesn't have to do that extra work so
let's take a look at the code for that
so I have an example application right
here excuse me
okay so you can see that I've got select
country name from countries where
country a D is equal to and then I have
: country ID so if I had just
concatenated the country ID to the end
of that sequel statement every time that
went to the database it would reparse
but here you can see that you can see
that later on I'm setting up this bind
variable Oracle parameter P country ID
telling it what type it is varchar' to
and then I'm adding the value to that so
let's see where is the value set country
there it is country ID value equals UK
so instead of concatenating UK to the
end of my where clause I'm putting it
into the parameter and then I'm
executing it and the result is that the
the result is that a parse does not have
to be done every single time
a sequel statement caching so again
talking about what has happens on the
server-side parsing these statements so
typically a database will will retain a
certain number of the statements that
you are parsing so you have to
intelligently think about you know which
statements or how many statements do I
want the database to keep this may be a
collaboration between you and the DBA
but if you control the database you
could you could handle this so you need
to think about how many sequel
statements do I need to retain and which
ones now in the case of ODP dotnet we do
it for you by default we just keep track
of how many we think that you're using
the most and we make sure the database
retains those okay another really
important thing to pay attention to is
data retrieval okay so depending on what
you're doing if you bring back too much
data if you bring back too much data
you're going to end up with a lot of
memory being used or processing that
data and wasting time if you don't bring
enough data back then you have to go
back and ask for it later and that might
also cause you problems so you have to
intelligently think about what's the
best way to handle data retrieval so one
way you can do that to start with is to
control the fetch size of the data
reader for example like how many every
time that you go and read from from the
data reader how much data is actually
coming back from the database at that
time so in the case of ODP dotnet we
have a concept of fetch size and we
allow you to set it to a multiple of the
row size in bytes and then that allows
you to say well I think every single
time I fetch I think the ultimate the
optimum spot is a thousand rows that's
about enough for me and enough for me to
handle and to last me a while and I
won't spend too much time downloading it
and I won't spend too much time
processing it so let's take a look at an
example of that
stop this just a second
okay so let's see all right so I've got
an example program here that compares
fetching with a fetch size of 1 which
admittedly is ridiculous and effect size
of 100 which is starting to approach a
normal amount of fetch size so if you
look down here you can see that the code
says it sets up a data reader and then
it says reader fetch size it's equal to
row size times 100 so 100 rows and up
here it says fetch size equals row size
times 1 so we're comparing a fetch size
of 1 to effect size of 100 so let's take
a look when we run this
okay so there's obviously a big
difference this is a little bit
contrived because there's one row is
ridiculous making one round trip for
each one but I wanted to amplify for you
but this is important to take advantage
of
okay another really important aspect of
data retrieval is paying attention to
large objects large objects can be
things like image files in fact that's
what they usually are things like that
or documents large text documents
possibly but any case with a lot of
databases once you exceed a certain size
for examples you know 32,000 or 64,000
you can't use the standard character
column size anymore
you have to use a specialized column
type called the blob binary large object
CLOB character large object you have to
use that specifically to handle the data
so whenever you're using that in a
database you should pay close attention
to how you're using these buying these
lobs because you could get yourself in
hot water if you're downloading too much
of it or if you don't download enough
and then you have to keep going back to
the database and asking for more so as
an example the Oracle data provider for
dotnet has a few things here that you
can do but let me just mention a few the
other things here other things you can
do so you can download the entire LOB
with every row that you bring down or
you can you can bring down just a
portion of it a small amount like the
header so you want to look at image
files and see what the header says you
want to look at the document and look at
the header you could just tell it every
time you bring a row down just give me
the first three thousand bytes of that
can talk that's all I need or you can
say give me nothing and then when I want
it if somebody asks for it or if I need
it I'll go back and get it or I could
take the whole thing there's also the
possibility of manipulating logs through
sequel so some databases will allow you
to say copy this lob from this table
over to this table and that's all
usually a lot better than bringing it
all down and pushing it all back and if
you need to do manipulation on the lob
if you need to modify it sometimes you
can do it in the database perhaps
through a stored procedure
and finally some database vendors offer
lob random access so you can just get a
pointer to the lob and say jump forward
in it to the 20,000th bite and give me
that so in the case of Oracle's data
provider we have initial lob fetch size
which hangs off of the data reader and
the command and so the default for that
is zero so by default you'll never get
any data every time you bring a row that
has a lob we'll just get a pointer to
the date to the love in the oracle world
that's called a lob locator and we map
that pointer to a oracle blob class
oracle club class you can also say as I
mentioned give me a chunk bring down say
the first three thousand bytes or you
can say negative 1 which is give me all
the data and and then I said also Oracle
supports doing update insert deletes
using blobs that you get from one table
or one column one row and move it to the
other one depending on the database
you're using support for a statement
batching can help you with performance
so in the case of Oracle the data
adapter update batch size will basically
allow you to take changes you made to a
data set and kind of put them all
together and send them up to the
database all at one time so in the case
of Oracle we use what's called anonymous
PL sequel to handle that we send a block
of insert statements all at once so that
you don't have to hit the database
multiple times
so talking about stored procedures since
we're talking about that somewhat oh
when you need to move data a lot of data
to and from the database it's usually a
good idea to use arrays however some
arrays are more performant than others
and it depends on the database vendor
which one so for example in the case of
Oracle we have something called an
associative array so the best practice
at least when you're using the Oracle
data provider is to use an associative
array because that gives you the best
performance to go to and from a store
procedure so what I'm referring to here
is that you may have a store procedure
that accepts an array of 10,000 values
which are going to manipulate inside the
store procedure and put into various
tables and so you since you have a lot
of data going up there you want to make
sure you do it as performant as possible
so in the Oracle case we say don't use B
arrays don't use nested tables these are
other types that are similar to a race
but that they're not designed for large
amounts of data another thing that the
database that you're working against
might support is called parameter array
binding so that's where you you you do
say an update statement update employees
where you know set the value to this and
then you can have a parameter a bind
parameter like we discussed earlier but
instead of just a single solitary scalar
value you can bind an array so that one
update actually ends up doing hundreds
of updates and then you have to go and
check an array to see which ones
succeeded which ones failed it's a
little can get a little funny but bottom
line is that this if your database
vendor happens to offer bind variables
bind parameter array binding this can
give you good performance
so talking about store procedures
they're a good way to offload work if
it's you want to get close to the data
it might be a good thing to do you can
reduce the amount of data that has to go
back and forth and as I mentioned use
user ray binding
now if inside the database store
procedure that a select is being done so
select star from employees and that data
wants to be returned back to the
application what's a good way to do this
so a very commonplace way to do that is
called a database cursor so for example
what sequel server if you've used that
they automatically create a cursor for
you it just sort of pops up after you
execute the statement in Oracle's case
it's a little bit more explicit we
actually bind the ref cursor so this is
one of the differences people have to
think about when they're changing from
one database to the other but Oracle
tends to bind a specific cursor but the
idea is a cursor is a pointer to a
result set it's not the data it's a
pointer so then you can get that pointer
and later on fetch fetch fetch when you
decide you want it it just gives you
more control
so oracle has what's called the ref
cursor class and so a rep cursor is a
buying type you can bind to a store
procedure that returns a ref cursor and
then when you bring it back down it
turns into a data reader so let's take a
look at the code for this I actually
forgot to do the demo for array binding
so while we're in there we'll do both so
we were talking about our a binding
before let me just show you what the
code looks like for that ie okay so I am
calling a stored procedure called my SP
and this stored procedure takes a
parameter of type two parameters of type
var char and these are bar char arrays
so let's take a look at that that stored
procedure really quickly here
okay so it's it's a stored procedure
that takes an input associative array
and returns an output associative array
and then scrambles up to contents so
we're going to call that from.net and
you can see we're passing in Oracle code
2017 and then we set up the array and we
execute it and then down below we read
the array as an Oracle string and output
it so let's take a look let's run this
and so you can see that it it rearranged
it to 2017 Oracle code okay apology for
my lack of understanding of how this
zoom works all right so the next demo on
this here is the ref cursor one so let's
take a look at that so the final demo on
this one is I'm sending in an anonymous
block but it could be a stored procedure
and I'm opening cursors based on select
statements with different Department ID
so I'm opening three cursors and then
you can see that I'm binding to those
three cursors as Oracle database type
ref cursor
finally you can see what I'm doing I
have a data reader it has all three
cursors inside of it
data reader one and what you do is you
go to the first spot you read read read
till you're out of data and then you
call data reader next result that moves
on to the next cursor we read read read
read to you're out of data data reader
one next result read read read read
you're done let's run it and there's the
output
okay caching very important obviously so
but when you use caching you typically
use it when you have mostly read-only
tables that have very few updates don't
use it for data that changes a lot so
it's better if the database controls the
caching in some way if you just have a
cache that doesn't know anything about
the database you're going to have to be
hitting the database a lot to find out
what's changing it's better if the
database sends notification to the cache
saying some of the data has changed you
should update your cache so that's the
best kind of cache you can use with the
database so Oracle has a few cache
options available to you one is called
client result cache another one is
called continuous query notification
which is more customizable and times ten
in memory cache so client result cache
is probably the low-hanging fruit I was
talking about this is one of the easiest
things you can do if you turn it on on
the database side all you typically need
to do is to include a hint a result
cache hint to tell to tell us to use the
result cache and what the result cache
is is it's stored right there on the
client with ODP net and we piggyback off
of network traffic so every time
somebody pings the database when there's
a standard ping to the database or an
update statement or anything at that
time we get notification saying these
columns have changed and we keep the
cache consistent for you so basically
you get this for free so if it's turned
on on the database side you typically
use this you use this hint you see here
result cache unless it's set up so that
every single query ends up in the cache
sometimes that's true but probably not
all the time
so in order to use the cache result the
sequel text must match if there's
already a result in the cache the sequel
text must match to by and variables must
match the sessions assessment settings
must match
and different sessions across the
machine can share that cache but they as
long as they use the same user settings
but they must exist in the same client
process different users never share the
same result set so let's show you a
quick demo of that
okay so I have a demo here that first
issues select first name last name
salary from employees such as the data
calculates how much time it takes to
fetch the data then little later on here
I issued the same statement again except
this time I use the result cash hint so
we're going to compare the timing
between the two and see what kind of
performance difference we get all right
so let me close that here so the first
one I think takes about ten seconds
okay and then with so with caching it's
about ten seconds to do what we did
thousands of rows and without caching
it's about one and a half seconds so
there's a huge difference in performance
there so then just to show you the cache
changing there is a little bit of a
delay remember I said that the cache is
consistent meaning every date all the
data in there
you won't it's consistent from the point
in time however it will be a few split
seconds behind the database so if I go
in here to server Explorer and I look at
the employees table
and I don't know let me move this over
here so that over here I won't be able
to zoom in because I'm so I'm going to
change the value here from twenty four
thousand to twenty four thousand one and
when I do it'll take a split second but
eventually you'll see it pop up on the
Left window change there it goes
change it back there it goes
so if you tried this without caching
it's instantaneous there's a little bit
of a delay because know what dates are
being done know round trips are being
done but rest assured the cache is
consistent the other type of caching
that's available is called a continuous
query notification the best way to think
about this is whenever database changes
whenever a query would change based on
changes to database the database calls
you back in dotnet code you have a call
back and you control setting up the
cache in fact you can disconnect from
the database completely because we have
listeners that handle that so you can
disconnect from the database completely
and you control the cache completely so
you set up the Oracle dependency object
you issue the statement when the data
data changes oracle calls you back and
you modify the cache yourself the other
cache op solution we have is a
enterprise cache called oracle times ten
the main point i want to leave behind
with that is that we have a data
provider for that as well so it's the
same as ODP net it just connects two
times ten which sits in front of oracle
okay
moving on to application high
availability which is the second part of
this session so what is high
availability and why should you care
about it if you're writing a web
application and the typical junk that
happens in the real world happens to
your servers you're going to run into
situations where you have tcp/ip
timeouts where connection requests hang
when the service comes up you're not
able to connect because all the
connections are bad you get errors that
when the when they knew the database was
coming down or they knew the service
we're coming down you still get errors
basically it just is it's just a big
mess the causes your users a lot of pain
it causes you a lot of pain so it's
important to consider high availability
when you can so what happens is your
application has to the application has
to handle those network failures and the
database failures gracefully so how does
Oracle handle it so we have something
called fast application notification
which is where the database or data
guard or other Oracle products have the
ability to directly call back to the
application you don't have to wait on
the application to get a connection and
get some information we actually call
back to the application and the benefit
of this is that the application finds
out really quick what's going on and can
take maneuvers so fan can send things
like hey instances going down we're
planning to bring it down it's coming up
here's the load you know this this is
where you should connect you should
connect to this node so all of these
things make high availability much
easier for you as a developer
so for example plan maintenance if the
administrator knows that the database is
coming down he can put it in planned
maintenance mode and so what that does
is the fan sends a message to all of the
connections that are interested and oh
DPN is one of them and as you recall we
have a pool and so what we do when we
get that notification is we stop
allocating connections to that node we
slowly just we don't allow any more new
ones and basically they age out until
there's no more connections and then the
database can come down so this makes for
a smooth pool draining a smooth
experience for the end user so they
don't get bad connections so in order to
take advantage of this if you're using
ODP net there's a connection string
attribute h.a events equals true and
going forward we're going to turn this
on by default if you're using data guard
with standby databases and a switchover
happens there's a delay as one database
comes comes up there's a period of time
where people can't connect and the last
thing you want is is this mess where
everybody's trying to connect and can't
connect can't connect and can't connect
it gets errors so to make that smooth
there's a concept of pool draining with
data guard so ODP net has service
relocation connection timeout and what
we actually do is we block any request
from the connection pool we just make
them wait we don't give an error we just
make them wait for a period of time and
that prevents errors you just sit there
until we think the database is going to
come up and then if the database comes
up early we give the connection in
complement to read to that there's also
networking configurations you can do to
prevent errors when the database is
coming up there's a retry count and
retry delay in DNS names Dora so what
this does is typically for a connection
you might have multiple connect strings
that can
move through to try to find one that
works and so you can set these to
basically give a application that's
trying to find a connection a fighting
chance of doing so when the database is
down for an extended period of time what
happens if the database just goes down
unexpectedly
so in that case fan tells ODP dotnet hey
note it down and so we don't want bad
connections in the pool because that's
another source of pain not high
availability so we'll immediately clean
out that pool and close idle connections
and that prevents errors from people
coming to the pool and requesting one
okay
so transparent application failover so
when when there's a failure if you have
this turned on what can happen is you
can get a notification saying well what
what happens in the background this is
an underlying feature of the Oracle
client what happens in the background is
we basically put you on a new connection
without your knowledge and we take your
cursor and we put it back where you were
this is read-only by the way this is not
transactional this is just read-only we
put you back where you were and if
you're lucky you won't even know
anything happen that's transact
transparent application failover we will
also give you a call back in case you
want to do something else in dotnet and
then another option is called
application continuity this is new so
this is something that that you can take
advantage of by going to the Oracle
cloud using one of the new 12-2
databases but what this does is in the
case of unplanned outage we will attempt
to take transactions into account even
and replay a work for recoverable
cover for recoverable errors and do that
all on behalf of you to the best of our
ability to basically do this so you
don't even know that the database went
down and this takes into account
transactions as well where the transport
application filled over was just read
only this is you know you're doing a
you're in the process of other trance
working on our transaction and we
actually log all of the things you're
doing we reconnect you and we replay it
now this has certain limitations
obviously we don't want to be going
crazy here and and in doing replays when
it doesn't make sense
so there's look there's the sensible
limitations to application continuity
and so there's going to be some cases
where it won't be available to you and
then I'll talk about what you can do
about that so before I say anything else
in order to turn on application
continuity obviously pooling has to be
on it's on by default but application
continuity equals true in the connect
string we'll turn this on so again these
are new features so you want to be
connected to the 12-2 database which is
what you'll get anyway if you're using
Oracle in the cloud now you really need
total control you can use transaction
guard so transaction guard basically
keeps track of what you're doing with
result with regard to transactions and
then gives you that information after a
database clip goes after the connection
goes down and you reconnect you can
query for the information about what
happened with your transaction and then
you can make the decision about whether
you replay it or not
so transaction guard gives you full
control of that so what happens is um we
get an event connection went down and
then Cody p.net automatically goes out
and fetches information about the state
of your transactions and so you can
write code like what you see here on the
screen that will let you decide what to
do about the work that was not completed
so suppose you're in the middle of an
insert and then the database goes down
first of all you have to find out did
that thing commit
or did it not commit and if it you know
and if it did commit if it didn't come
if it did commit wait if it didn't
commit is it something I can I should
retry so we have we pass you an
exception and inside the exception we
say we provide information about whether
or not the transaction is recoverable
and whether or not the transaction
committed and then you can decide
whether to resubmit the work or not and
so you can use this along with
application continuity or you can use it
on its own to give you full control so
this is application continuity in a
nutshell these are the the kinds of
things that you can do and does these
are the kind of things you can do to
make sure that your end users do not see
bad connections do not see errors and
that you don't have inconsistent States
in a database from resubmitting in in
the case of transaction guard if you
didn't have transaction guard and you
didn't know whether something committed
you might actually end up with database
corruption because you do it again you
may shoot the statement again without
knowing whether or not you could do that
so with transaction guard we keep track
of that we tell you whether or not the
statement committed and whether it's
recoverable okay the last thing I wanted
to mention to you is that you've seen a
lot of the promotions out here talking
about the Tri Oracle cloud and all that
so I just wanted to point out to you
that one of the options with Oracle
cloud is the compute cloud instance and
we do have Windows 2012 images in 2008
images and you can pretty easily spin up
a dotnet application server on there but
to make it easier we've actually written
a white paper say do this do this do
this do this do this run these disome
run these design commands to turn on is
to turn on web deploy to turn these on
and so this will take you right through
that how to set up your own dyno web
server up on the Oracle cloud and then
if you decide you want to just connect
to the database
we also have a couple webpages to talk
to you about what you need to do to do
that so for example Exadata Express
cloud service if you're going to connect
to that you need to set up what's called
an Oracle wallet because obviously you
need to be you need to do authentication
so you have to setup an Oracle wallet
and just to make it easier on you
because you may not have done that
before we have step-by-step instructions
on how to set that up and lastly if
you're going to just use the non Exadata
Express the Oracle database cloud
service there's another set of steps you
do you create an SSH connection to
tunnel to it and connect but just to
make sure that you don't have any
problems getting started with that we
also have instructions to do that so
with that please go ahead and get the
slides check on the Oracle code website
if you can't find it in Oracle code
website give me an email and I'll do my
best to get them to you and then you can
follow us on Twitter you can check out
our YouTube videos and the OTN Neto TN
oracle ComNet website is where we keep
you up to date with the latest news
latest downloads latest events etc so
thank you very much for coming and I
hope you learn something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
