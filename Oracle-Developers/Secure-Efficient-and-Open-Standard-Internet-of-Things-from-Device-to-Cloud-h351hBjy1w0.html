funny company to come speak at JavaOne
but I think it'll be less funny after
you hear my talk arm is actually doing a
lot with Java in particular arm is doing
a lot in the internet of things these
days and we're really excited about it
so we'll tell tell a lot about about arm
the Internet of Things open standards
for the Internet of Things and I
actually won't talk very much about Java
I'll just explain why we're using Java
as a tool so we're an end-user of Java
we're not one of those oh we have this
Java platform or web application server
or something that we want to sell people
around Java we actually use a Java to
build real IOT systems for enterprises
and we think it's a great great solution
for that so we're gonna focus more on
what we're doing and then why we do some
of that on on Java so my name is Zack
Shelby I'm the director of technology
for IOT at arm I'm located here in San
Jose for the past two weeks the whole
two weeks I've been in San Jose so I'm a
newcomer to the Bay Area so kind of a
local but but not and we're quite a new
acquisition to arm so I was the founder
and CTO of a company called sensing node
for the past seven years was based out
of Finland and California and we were
acquired by arm this summer and so we
bring a new dimension to the business
that arm has around software not
hardware course so actually we're
involved a business that has nothing to
do with designing cortex cores or the
arm course that you're using in in your
phone or in low-power servers today we
actually do software products for the
Internet of Things we'll talk more about
more about that what we're doing in Y so
um you're a lot of people talk about
what IOT is and they think I would tease
all these applications or it's this or
it's not I've been doing this for four
10 years so I can tell you exactly what
IOT is and you know it's nothing really
special and I think that's what's
different about IOT this time around
when when IOT was a hype thing around
2000 early 2000s everyone was like Ohio
T's all these automation buses Siemens
had their own and Honeywell had their
own or it's my sensor network and I have
the coolest wireless mesh network that
nobody else can do it was all this
special stuff everybody had their
special sauce for IOT I'm gonna kind of
went down and people figured out well
the Internet's actually really cool and
we can use the Internet and the web to
build all these things and what's
happened now when IO T's come back is
actually IOT is becoming nothing more
than the web again in the internet again
and I think that's what's special about
IOT now is that people that realize that
we can and should use Internet tools
transport their security all the crypto
infrastructure that we have out there
and a lot of the web infrastructure to
build these things so it's nothing
special anymore IOT is the web but we
had to do a lot of smart engineering to
make that happen so it's not that
straightforward we just say it's the web
but we've actually done the engineering
to make this happen what I'm gonna talk
about standards and open IOT or talk
about all these standards that we've put
together to make web based IOT a reality
and so my big thing about IOT is that
you know what we're doing is connecting
smart objects this can be any kind of
device at arm we tend to specialize in a
lot of enterprise applications outdoor
lighting building automation smart
metering telemetry vehicles and
otherwise there's a lot of enterprise
applications of course there's things
that happen in the home home automation
and all this but those are coming more
in the future as there's there's more
momentum around these open standards
home needs a lot of ecosystem to make
that work and what's the goal right we
make all these devices these things on
the Internet what's the real goal with
devices it's the service if we can't get
a device working with us
servus we don't have a business we don't
have a purpose for the consumer that
wants to use this or the enterprise so
we need these things talking to these
services that's the goal so we should
never lose track of that and what we see
happening is that the narrow waste of
all this stuff it's really converging
around web technologies a whole range of
rest protocols web linking web semantics
so a lot of technologies that we use to
put these together and it turns out
they're they're very similar or reusing
the technologies we use on the web today
for enterprise applications or just
consumer web pages so it's objects
services we use web technologies to
connect them together now something that
we're really excited about it arm and
how we describe what we do is that big
data is how we're gonna make these
services enabled we need the Big Data
technologies to actually make use of all
this information we're getting from
devices make something useful decision
for an enterprise or for a consumer so
big data is important but big data
without an information input is nothing
right
today's big data systems you're getting
your inputs from all kinds of enterprise
databases you have consumer purchasing
information we have all kinds of logs
that we can import into Hadoop that's
our big data but in IOT it's the little
data that we need first so that the big
data is job and that's what we do an arm
we're the little data people so we
really like that term it describes what
we do really well and our goal is to get
that little data into the places that
enterprise developers need to to make
big data so that's the overall theme
here it's little data into Big Data and
ok while m2m has been around for a while
we've been doing m2m we've been using IP
but m2m was in a little bit of a chicken
and egg problem they were using a lot of
IP technologies yes but it's been very
stove-piped it's been my devices and my
application and when that happened
even if you're using internet protocols
over cellular for example there's this
tendency to to invent your own stuff why
not it's my device and my service why
don't I invent on my own own protocols
and own tools and own semantics I can do
that if you get a bunch of engineers in
a room and they'll invent stuff that's
what we do we're good at that that's one
other thing that's different about IOT
because we're we're having this
technology available and because we're
needing to get a lot more value out of
this big data and I'll explain a little
bit later why we need to leverage this
big data for value we're really no
longer in the stovepipe Mobe we're in
the web mode we're in the we have
devices we're able to connect those into
services and we're able to combine those
devices use the same device and two
services use one device or use two
devices in one service all combinations
of these and I think this will be a big
business enabler in the future it'd be
great for developers great for device
manufacturers service providers so
there's really all upside to this some
people ask well but I still see like my
nest thermostat talking to the nest
cloud service and so there's still
stovepipes and I'd say that's gonna be
true from the consumer point of view
you're not always gonna see this this
might be hidden under the hood of these
these things that you buy if you buy a
home automation system in the US for
sure it's gonna be locked down into some
providers cloud service but all that
technology under the hood might be
sharing that information it might use
the same protocols same software tools
same enterprise cloud components to make
that so under the hood we're going to be
using shared devices shared services web
technologies
something else I think that's important
is to understand that when we're doing
this end-to-end communication or this IP
and web communications it's really
important that we do it end-to-end so in
the past another kind of pitfall we've
fallen into with all this stuff is said
that well because everybody is using
soap XML XML rest JSON rest and the web
world the enterprise world we need to do
that all the way down to the devices and
then we need to Gateway all this stuff
we'll make this application layer
gateway we put it on a embedded Linux
box we use Java 400 SGI and we'll tie
all these devices in using an
application their gateway well that
didn't work that was a very broken model
because as soon as you change anything
on that device your application gateway
just broke now you have to change it
upgrade it it's it's a huge amount of
stuff to maintain it I can tell you that
customers don't want that so we've had
to go away from that model and what it
means is that we actually need to do
this communication with web and security
all the way down to the end device and
that means to the little sensor device
that you're actually getting the data
from all the way down there we need to
get them and technology-wise we've
gotten to the point that there's no
barriers anymore for us to do that
processor technology even very low power
is there security technologies there and
now protocol technology's there I'll
focus on the protocol technology in this
talk the other reason is business so
what we've seen happening in a lot of
these these IOT telemetry systems is
that cellular so the actual number of
cellular devices the cellular endpoints
going in there it's linear it's not even
growing that fast and so to get in the
business and actually gain some value
from from deploying these systems you
actually have to be working down with
the local wireless devices so we're
seeing a really big ratio arm in outdoor
lighting systems it's anywhere up to
five hundred to one one cellular router
500 local mesh devices that's the ratio
actually required by the OEMs
manufacturing these systems to make the
cost point just right that mean this
apply
we'll buy these things and deploy them
so we're seeing a 500 to 1 ratio of
small local wireless mesh devices their
small microcontroller based devices tens
of kilobits per second of bandwidth that
these things have to talk IP over and a
small number of cellular devices so
end-to-end will really help us to to
access all of those devices manage them
update them it's good for operators who
deploy the systems they can actually
charge for these things so end-to-end is
important so not only to avoid gateways
but to leverage as many devices as
possible now not all IOT applications
are created equal so will have
applications like smart meters or
wellness where you know there's a very
clear value there to the to the end user
to the consumer you can charge for that
you can charge for the service to a
smart meter you're you're avoiding you
know in the old days used to send guys
around to read the meters remember that
I grew up with that used to send the guy
to my back yard he'd read the meter on
the side of my house we've gotten past
that we've gotten to automated metering
you can read you can do demand response
load control you could actually save
monetary savings to a utility and you
can charge for that so the value of that
is high but the number of those
applications is fairly low those are the
ones that everybody is going after right
now because there's an easy market there
but as you get down here to the long
tail you have a huge number of IOT
applications that really don't add a lot
of value their cool things I'll turn my
lights on when I come home oh I have my
cool gadget or I know what temperature
is up in my yard
yeah there's stuff that everybody would
feel feel nice about having but it's
probably stuff that nobody's gonna
charge you for well what you're gonna
see happening is that aggregating all
that stuff and using a lot of Big Data
technologies you can actually start to
add value to that information so you'll
see people getting into a Google of IOT
type of
base where you know Google does this
very well with with advertisements they
aggregate a lot of that tiny pieces of
information
tiny advertising streams into something
bigger you'll see the same here so by
aggregating all this information you
might be able to tell things like where
did somebody buy something what are they
doing with it how are they behaving you
know when are people coming home in a
neighborhood and some of that might be
new services advertising or otherwise
some of it might be just better
municipal planning right how do you plan
the the traffic flows in a city based on
how people come home at the end of the
day things like that can be derived from
from this big data so lots of kind of
low value IOT applications will need a
lot of big data aggregation to actually
gain value from those that's another
trend that we see happening now we've
had a pretty nicely growing market
around around this internet in general
so we've seen you know between mobile
phones and Internet devices markets been
growing pretty nicely and what we want
out of IOT is we want a lot more of that
right we want to see lots of these
devices get deployed integrated into
services can use those but there's a
risk and that risk is if we don't
actually achieve what the vision I gave
you in the beginning which is that we
actually combine all these things
together with web technologies we make
these reusable all the technology easy
to to gain access to if we actually
continue on the m2m path where we're not
really doing anything new there we're
just kind of doing status quo a lot of
stovepipes everybody wants to do their
own protocols what we're gonna see
happening is kind of a mediocre growth
IOT won't really take off it'll be a
bunch of stovepipe applications it'll
stay pretty fragmented and that won't be
good for developers or anybody in the
industry but if we do a few things right
we think you know at arm and I think a
lot of people in the industry agree with
us we think that we can make that that
grow a lot faster and there's some
really simple things
so we need the scale absolutely need to
scale and scale doesn't mean that just
Oracle or just an IBM deploys a bunch of
stuff for one enterprise customer that's
not enough we need scale as in everybody
in the industry is deploying stuff
really quickly and we need to enable
startups to deploy stuff very quickly
it's really important in this space a
lot of the cool applications in IOT
will come from startups they have the
cool ideas and they're not scared to
actually try them out and to do that
scale we really need standards so that's
why I'm talking about standards for for
a lot of this talk standards are
important but we also need to share
because if we want to achieve if we want
to achieve a lot of this aggregation if
we want to actually make use of data
across multiple places we're gonna have
to be able to share that data in sharing
that data is going to need trust so
trust and security is something I'm
going to be talking about a lot as well
and Trust means that we actually have
the trust relationships in place between
the device and its service between the
service and the user between the device
and its user between devices we need
those trust relationships in place and
there's no fancy crypto security
technology we need to do that yeah we'll
have to do a lot of smart things to put
those in place but those are problems
that have been solved in the past but we
need to have the mechanisms in place and
the mindset of everybody in the industry
that they're willing to use those things
right not try to reinvent them but use
standard mechanisms so sharing needs
trust and to do that trust we really
need security I'm not talking about
half-baked pre-shared keys and every
device that are easy to crack over time
hard to maintain an upgrade I'm talking
about full-blown PK based crypto on
every single thing and the
infrastructure behind it to make use of
it provision them bootstrap them update
them and then take care of all the
authentication and management of that
that we need to actually make those
things participate in services in a
secure way
from day one I think that's another
really important thing is that we can't
overemphasize how important security is
and we definitely we shouldn't be
cutting corners in this space so that's
our vision with with little data getting
in the big data and and growing now
let's start talking about some standards
what are the things we've done with this
IOT web stack to make this really usable
for all kinds of embedded devices so
typically when you look at a web stack
and protocol stack and I mean I'm an
IETF guy just know my background a
little bit not a Java guy I use Java
I've made a company using Java and all
across products but I'm an IETF protocol
guy this is where I spend my time and
and my brainpower is working on on these
protocols and what we've done at the
IETF is we've said that well we have a
lot of people come into the IETF and
they're working on these things they're
deploying IOT based systems they need
efficient protocols efficient security
and over the past four or five years the
IETF did a lot of work on actually
enabling these technologies in much more
let's say suitable forms for for the
applications and the devices and the
networks so we have now ways to do for
example web in four bytes of header it's
a new protocol from the IETF called the
constrained application protocol coop
which does HTTP for small things and
small networks and so this this does
rest and in a small binary header over
UDP I'll talk a little bit more detail
about that
that's one way that we can actually get
get this web IP technology into a small
space we can do a lot with binary web
objects there's now ways to do a binary
JSON that's actually a new standard for
binary JSON from the IETF if you didn't
already know about it it's called C bore
CBO are just ratified by the IETF pretty
cool stuff you can actually do complete
binary representation of JSON style
structures and that's a one-to-one
mapping so we can do binary web objects
Izzie
simpler ways to do that as well we've
done a lot of work around DTLS in the
use of UDP both for getting that a
synchronous transaction model that we
need in in IOT but also to really
minimize the overhead of using
full-blown security so TLS is definitely
a core building block of what we're
doing in IOT but we want to make it
really efficient so we don't have that
kind of argument when people go and
build a system they say well this is so
heavy you know I don't want to spend the
the packets to do a TLS handshake I
don't want to spend the bytes to have
that that record layer to protect and
encrypt my data we want to make that as
compelling as possible make that as low
overhead as possible so we don't have
those kind of security workarounds right
I'll invent something simple because
this is hard or big and we're getting
there D TLS is getting pretty good for
IOT and we have a new version of TLS and
details coming out called DTS 1.3 TLS
1.3 something the IETF is working on
right now and that's for both things
like web RTC so real-time communications
and for IOT so things like zero
round-trip time handshakes we're gonna
be enabling with TLS lower overheads for
for handshakes raw public keys so we can
do public key crypto without
certificates just to name a few new
features that are coming so what we end
up is the ability over all kinds of IOT
kind of backhaul
cellular networks satellite networks now
we can do easily under a hundred bytes
of overhead for doing real completely
secure rest object based communications
and we can do even better than that so
when we get into specialized RF networks
so I talked about RF mesh there's a new
standard that's actually not so new it's
been out for five six years already
called 6lowpan and 6lowpan allows you to
do ipv6 over very low-power networks
eight or 2.50 not for Bluetooth smart
low no narrowband telemetry radios sub
Hertz radios all these radios that
people used to think oh I need this
proprietary z-wave thing or I need this
proprietary ZigBee thing in order to use
those radios well it's not the case
anymore with these new classes of IP
protocols from the IETF the overhead is
on the range of 4 to 7 bytes including
UDP that's nothing so even when you have
128 byte frame in some of these radios
we still have plenty of space for the
rest of our our web stack so when we get
this together and start going over the
low-power wireless network we end up
with a web stack that's tens of bytes in
overhead for the complete packet in
order to do really useful things with
web I'm not talking about just a dummy
packet this is a command to to turn off
your your HVAC machine for a period of
time with these parameters we can do
that in a packet this size so this is
the new style of web that we're seeing
deployed on Internet of Things
applications today IETF I mentioned this
is one important place where a lot of
this is happening if you're looking for
specs in the space it's definitely a
good place to look so there's things
like 6lowpan there's a lot of web things
going on like co-op rest advice how do
you do rest interfaces for these types
of systems a lot of web linking and
things like resource directories so how
do you do search engines for for the IOT
those are being done at the IETF and
that's so that's actually a group called
core a lot of work on security I
mentioned DTLS in the new DTLS 1.3
effort that's going on we'll see a lot
more in TLS as well we're seeing work in
cipher suites but there's other
organizations that are doing a lot of
important things too oh ma OMA is
typically known for things like device
management Oh a man is just just
finishing a new standard in fact I
should be in Thailand right now
finishing that standard I decided to
come to Java 1 because I thought Java
was pretty cool it is pretty cool I'm
glad I came here
they're actually finishing a complete
device management architecture and and
system for for IOT using IETF protocols
like co-op and DTLS I have one slide on
that explain what that does or the IPPS
alliance the IP smart object Alliance
which is working on promoting these
technologies and defining the actual web
object so the semantics what is location
what is temperature what is a light
control command very simple things but
somebody has to define what's in there
right how does it I was it format it so
if so in all oh ma together are doing
many of those things
ZigBee even though I mentioned ZigBee is
one of these old proprietary things
igby's actually modernized itself we're
now a member of ZigBee and it's working
on things like ZB IP in ZigBee IP nan
which are actually IP stacks
ZigBee is reinvented itself into doing
IP stacks and using the ZigBee
certification process for making those
interoperable so it's actually IP stacks
coming from ZigBee these days and you
can do very low-power IP networking and
I mean end-to-end from the internet all
the way down to the music B device using
these standards and finally there's
something you might hear about called
one m2m you hear about it don't worry
about it too much because it's something
mainly focused on operators so this is
kind of the IMS I don't know how many of
you know what IMS is but it's kind of
the the big bad back-end infrastructure
that an operator might need to put all
these things together complex billing
systems complex signaling systems with
GSM networks but where we are working
with them to make sure that these kind
of open standards are supported because
we don't want devices to care right
device shouldn't care if it's an
operator network or a private service
that it's using it should look exactly
the same so lots of interesting things
going on in standardization and I think
my my main point here is that these are
mostly done we've been doing these for
four five six seven years already and we
start to have a pretty good toolkit I'm
not missing a lot of stuff and I'm
pretty picky I want a lot of these
technologies I'm pretty satisfied by
this there's stuff going on but there
like incremental improvements to things
so I think we start to have that the
toolkit to go and deploy a lot of
systems and not just like a company like
arm who has resources I mean anybody to
go deploy small startup go take a few
technology kits and go deploy stuff
that's what we want to see all this
mouse is weird random direction okay
this is about the acquisition that
happened in the summer so we used to be
an independent company called sensing
node arm saw what we were doing in the
open standards arm what we were doing in
the use of java across these these
platforms for actually deploying
software and was very interested in
continuing this so so we are now part of
arm and what that means is that we have
now a much bigger player helping to
promote and provide technology around
these IOT open standards and that's
exactly what arm will be doing so when
you think of arm in this space don't
think of us as as a processor technology
company think of us as a software
company doing security and
communications tools for you we're not
doing solutions not vertical markets or
things like that but we're actually
providing really nice software tools
from the cloud all the way down the
devices to help people to deploy these
systems and we as armed does we build an
ecosystem around this so arms very good
at ecosystems not just one provider
doing something but building a whole
network of companies
the cool thing about arm is that there's
a whole range of processor technologies
so many of you will know arm from you
know mobile computing gateway so this is
cortex a processor kind of class that's
what you're using in your smartphone if
you're an Android developer this is what
you're developing on but arm actually
focuses a lot these days on cortex class
processors so cortex is the class of
process that you see in very small
microcontrollers a cortex m0 might be
like the the tiny tiny tiny processor
where that comes with a temperature
sensor just so you can do that that that
little bus that it uses a talk or a toy
for example up to a cortex m3 or m4
which we can use for a very
sophisticated IOT street light with
public key crypto and the whole works or
even a router we can do on a cortex m4
with Ethernet and a full ipv6 stack so a
lot of a lot of focus on this and
something else you see happening is that
arm is doing a lot with servers as well
so there's a new class of a class
processors which are going into real
servers so power efficient highly cord
server clusters and you can actually see
one of those with the arm booths you
come visit at the arm booth we have one
of these arm servers up and running and
this is one of the things that makes job
are really nice on servers is that when
you deploy this kind of technology for
the server side of IOT using Java it
really doesn't matter isn't an Intel
based server or an arm 32-bit arm 64-bit
server it just doesn't matter you can
still run your same Java Java code on
any of those I think that's an important
thing about Javas it makes this kind of
platform independent the other thing
cool thing about arm is that we finally
start to have a kind of standard in this
IOT space for processor architecture so
even though Java does a lot for us we
still in the cortex-m space do a lot of
native development and Java ME
development and in order to do Java ME
and get it on a lots of places we
actually need to have
platform for it Java me doesn't run
without something underneath that ties
it to the hardware you need this native
piece and arm shipped almost 2 billion
of these cortex-m class processors last
year or arm Parker's arm doesn't
actually make chips it's all the arm
partners that make chips out of a total
of around eight point seven billion
processors in all and we think that that
you know a vast majority of these
processors are ready to be connected
connected to services connected to
things so it is a really big market and
it's a uniform market right this is the
same architecture of chips if we can put
Java EE onto all of those chips or at
least make it available that's huge
that's a massive device ecosystem that
we can develop java code on and I don't
know if you follow the latest Java me8
announcements from Oracle this week
I mean Java ME eight has become Java
again it's very close there's some ap is
that we don't have some api's that are
slightly different but the core of Java
is now the same as in Java SC 8 and
that's that's a big big change so a huge
number of devices that we can target
with Java ME or with native code when
it's appropriate we have nothing against
doing a mix of native and java when it
makes sense
those are processors so you can actually
you can actually get cortex m0
processors today the whole processor
$0.50 they're becoming very cheap you
can even get like cortex m3 m4 s which
are 32-bit processors we can do PK
crypto on them we can even run Java ME
they're like dollar each side of the
dollar so these these process are
becoming very inexpensive and so you can
build some cool devices with that kind
of that kind of technology and you can
run Java ME on a lot of a lot of those
kind of the upper half of the of the
processors
mmm in this whole processor space arms
driven you know built in an incredible
partnership network and we intend to do
the same with IOT so that's really the
way you should think of us so that in
IOT is that we're providing tools a lot
of support to make sure that there's a
huge ecosystem out deploying systems
that's important for us we want to see
this whole IOT space grow it's good for
us and processors it's good for us and
software as well but I think the
important thing is it's good for for the
whole industry so that's what we saw
happen in mobile Mobile grew because
there's a really strong ecosystem around
it we'll see the same thing happen with
IOT there's no there's no one gorilla
that's big enough to grow IOT there's
not an even an apple who can build a
walled garden there's just nobody like
that I don't think there ever will be
because IOT has so many different market
segments so we shouldn't treat it the
same way we think of mobile that oh
there's an apple that will control the
device and control the service and the
music and the no we won't have that
you'll have big players they'll be
important they'll have a lot of
technology like Oracle is a good example
a lot of enterprise technology Java
technology but you won't have anyone
that will control the whole end-user
application or enterprise application so
partnerships important we need to
actually build an ecosystem around IOT
okay let's talk about some details of
these of these protocols so co-op I like
to call the web of things protocol it's
um
not meant to replace HTTP so co-op isn't
just a binary compression of HTTP that
would have been a mistake because HTTP
actually has a lot of complexity no no
how many of you are deep down in HTTP
but modern HTTP not the one that you see
in textbooks it's complex we do a lot of
stuff with web browsers to actually make
HTTP work as it should and doing a
direct conversion of that into a binary
UDP world would have brought all that
complexity in almost automatically
you'd have to support all those
different options and things what we did
is said is we started with a clean slate
we said well we want rest we want
something that's
compatible with HTTP semantically get
post put delete URI media-type that's
the important kind of core of rest those
things we want the the equivalent of
that but we have some very specific m2m
iot types of requirements some of those
requirements are things like multicast
we need to be able to actually do
multicast requests we can do that with
co-op very low overhead between small
devices and very low complexity it has
to be something that's easy to implement
we needed a synchronous interactions so
in IOT applications it's not this
synchronous poling all the time we can't
do that we actually have to be able to
do a wake up one off notification back
to sleep without setting up a connection
without doing anything it's got to be
that fast so that's the reason why we're
for example using UDP for a lot of a lot
of the communications and finally we
need things like discovery and
subscription built into the protocol
these are headless devices we can't you
know how does discovery work in HTTP
does anybody know actually what's the
discovery mechanism HTTP and why there
isn't something really built in it's a
really dumb one it's kind of a trick
question index dot HTML that's it you
didn't need discovering HTTP because
everybody went to index.html on a
webpage I remember that the really old
days when we used to do that and type it
in by hand that was your discovery right
you're a human you can see the HTML
markup you see the links and you go
there but we don't have that in these
headless sensor devices so what we did
is we built in something similar a kind
of list of links that a device offers
you but we build it in the protocol with
a standard format so now it's kind of a
machine-readable list of index dot HTML
links and we get this some
out-of-the-box with every device that
uses this protocol so very cool protocol
and the other cool thing is it's really
easy to proxy in the HTTP we have a full
demo of this I have one slide to show
that at the arm booth in the the
Congress area
and be happy to show you how that proxy
works what's happening I actually have
my colleague here Xin I think could
raise his hand from arm his ends at the
booth at the arm booth so it's gonna be
happy to show you what stuff we're doing
there the practical stuff there's also a
lot happening with 6lowpan this is this
RF mesh protocol standard from the ITF
and the way I just like to show this is
that there's a lot of variety here so we
talked about IP for IOT it's not just oh
we have ipv6 in the ethernet router in
the Wi-Fi router and thus it works for
everything but there's actually some
variations of it for different market
segments because these market segments
are pretty different building automation
outdoor neighborhood area networks
industrial control home automation they
have very different requirements scale
response times energy consumption and so
we're seeing a variety of technologies
to cover this but the cool thing is we
start to cover it and so I really want
to show by this is that we actually
start to have a standard for outdoor
applications called ZigBee nan we have
BT smart which we've actually been able
to enable with IP technology something
you'll see coming to the market and we
have things like ZigBee IP and something
called ZigBee IP 1 dot X which is
something where we're hoping to bring in
and improve how applicable this is and
even some industrial control standards
and these are all based on ipv6 so even
though we have different variations of
these across market segments we can run
IP over all of them which means we can
do things like like a web protocol and
web security over any of these so we
don't have to change how we communicate
with devices even though it's a
different market segment and that's
important for a web developer right
you're a web developer you're developing
an enterprise application and you're
like well I got to get some info from
the streetlights in the city because we
need to do this and now I have to get
something from the consumer around smart
energy and energy consumption you don't
want to have to do that in two different
ways
you want to be able to do that manage
those devices using the same sets of
technologies yeah your payload might be
a little bit different it might use a
slightly different payload standard
that's just a media type all right
that's not not a big deal but you don't
want to do it in a completely different
way for one in the other so I think this
starts to look really good we start to
have IP networking everywhere little bit
more about the IPPS alliance so if
something around web semantics for one
of these applications is interesting for
you this is an alliance you might want
to get involved with so if so Alliance
has been around for five years it's an
alliance of currently about 55 vendors
in the IOT space
everybody from Google to Cisco to arm to
a lot of smaller companies energy
companies chip vendors there's that
there's a really good variation of of
people here and they know about IOT so
they really know what's what's happening
in this space and something new that's
happening is that it shows actually
publishing web objects that define how a
lot of this automation gets represented
and we're using these at the the arm
booth and the demos that we're doing
we're actually using these web semantics
so if you go there and look at how we do
temperature or acceleration it's
actually using these standards so this
is something that the Epsilon's is gonna
do more of smart cities building
automation different types of
applications in this space so if that
interests you it's a good good
organization to get involved with it's
not very expensive to be a member they
just did a new like thousand buck SME
membership as well SME and university
membership so it's pretty cheap to get
get involved please
it's the media type payload content yep
so actually what if so does is they
actually take well I'll show it here so
what what if so actually does is if so
reuses a standard that's been created by
OMA
so OMA has this all-male lightweight I'm
do have standard that defines that
interface between a device and the
server more than just the protocol the
whole interface how you register how you
configure the security how you do
bootstrapping of your keys and server
configuration info like kind of the
whole device management lifecycle and
part of that is that if so MA is known I
don't know how many of you know device
management for mobile devices but device
management for mobile you use these
objects they're their DM objects we've
we've created a similar concept in in
OMA lightweight but these objects are
very small very very small binary rest
objects so it's like a collection of
URIs under a base path each of which
isn't as integer ID so you might have
for example temperature might be object
ID three one one there's a registry of
those they're uniquely assigned by OMA
that's the temperature object so slash
three one one would get you to the
temperature object and inside that
object you define resources and so / -
might be the temperature value / three
might be the maximum value / four might
be the minimum value and so by doing a
very simple URI / 3 1 1 / 4 you've got
the temperature and because it's an
object we can serialize it so you could
just get the that the temperature itself
and when you do that we do it very
simple way text plain media types texts
explain the temperatures 22.3 don't do
any conversion just put it in there as
22.3 and ascii keep it simple but if you
serialize the whole object we have
different kinds of serialization binary
serialization and Jace
you can so if so actually does some of
that so when when episodes defined these
there's a lot of sharing between these
because like you have like a analog
maximum value you have that in almost
every one of these so what they do is
they have something called shared
resources so actually our shared
resources like this kind of minimums and
maximums are used all over the place and
there's a range of resource IDs that's
reserved for that so if you share them
across a lot of objects you define a
shared resource so then if you want to
create a new object you can reuse those
so OMA is actually working on a website
for the registration of these where
there's tools to actually design your
objects so you could actually reuse like
say yeah there's already temperature
there's already this I'll just combine
them together and a new object and those
can be from a standards body like if so
is a separate standards body from all
may or they can be form an individual
you don't have to be a company or from a
vendor so there's kind of a vendor
individual space for objects so this is
very cool stuff and I think it's
especially be cool because this defines
that whole security lifecycle it's not
just about the the web semantics it's
about actually being able to configure
the security of the device and that
includes bootstrapping from a SIM card
or a smart card bootstrapping from flash
or bootstrapping from a server a
bootstrap server and it includes both
problems of public private key
certificate based security and pre
shared key based security so you can do
both so this is cool stuff if you're
looking to build a system and want your
devices to be manageable in addition to
the protocols you might want to consider
doing something like this on top of that
right so how do we put all these
standards together this is important um
it seems like there's a lot of these
things floating around but it's actually
pretty straightforward
we have devices and we're seeing those
devices speak IP in a lot more play
you'll never get away from this kind of
peripheral bus specialized things like
Bluetooth though still will exist they
have a space but as soon as you want to
build a more complex network you really
can't be the feat the toolkit we have
with IP we can build real networks with
routers and it's pretty easy to do so
everything from ZigBee IP to Wi-Fi the
plain 6lowpan networks we're seeing a
lot of IP we're running security
technology like DTLS down to the device
we're not gate weighing the security so
that's a really bad ball nÃ¼r ability
here if you start gate weighing that
security you're in trouble at your
gateway it's a very vulnerable place so
run the security end to end and then
we're running protocols like co-op these
days on these devices that gives us web
in a small package of course it's a
Wi-Fi device you might not need
something like co-op just run HTTP if
the overhead and everything is fine with
you run HTTP it's all rest in the end so
it doesn't matter which you use back on
your backhaul to a service we tend to
use things like co-op or HTTP with D TLS
or TLS and this is where something like
oh I'm a lightweight comes in to kind of
standardize that that management of a
device we can do it over cellular so it
turns out cellular has similar
requirements for saving bandwidth
overhead so we're applying these
protocols over cellular as well and then
if you're an operator doing something
more complex you might consider using
something like one m2m definitely not a
requirement you can do this in a
standard Java web infrastructure you
don't need anything special to do it and
then finally we have web applications
and I think this is very important that
we provide interfaces for web
applications that are easy intuitive for
a web developer and that's really HTTP
REST so what we do in our products and
on the whole standard space that we work
in we really encourage the use of a
simple HTTP REST API the use of TLS and
the use of appropriate security models
so a lot of the time especially in our
products we're managing the security
domain here this is a complex thing to
manage all the provisioning and
bootstrapping of keys and
here we would deal with accounts we do
with web web application accounts what
domain do you have access to at what
level so something that the users here
the developers here understand we really
match those two security domains this is
typically on the same server the same
server or the same cluster so you're not
not usually very far away is this how we
put these things together in the end and
and what you get is end to end rest
that's that's what you see in the end
from the developer point of view so it's
kind of a transparent rest down to IOT
devices this is the demo setup that
you'll see us showing at the arm booth
as well as the Oracle booth so we have
pieces of this and both places we're
showing some pretty cool things so
starting from the from the embedded side
we have on the world's first set of
these protocols working on Java ME we're
showing that for the first time at Java
one so you see a job at me this is still
Java ME 3.3 me8 was really just released
we didn't have access to that until now
but our next version will be will be
supporting any eight fairly soon and
that's working on both Kyle and
Freescale k70 boards we have some
embedded sea based devices as well using
a native library there's a very small
cortex bass chip and the cool thing
you'll see there is it's the same
protocol the same web objects the same
interface so it didn't matter was it a
Java ME based device or a C based device
what matters is the developer got ahold
of the technology that worked best for
them we have a Java SE embedded based
gateway this is a free scale IMX based
processor running Linux and we're doing
some distributed directory technology so
we have directories we use for keeping
track of all the devices we actually
distribute some of that from the cloud
into the Gateway and we run that on Java
SE embedded so these guys actually
register here they don't know about the
cloud they don't care about the cloud if
the internet connection stops working
these still function and Oracle has some
work they've done
complex event processing so doing some
event processing producing new resources
out of things that happen here we're
speaking co-op and lightweight I'm doing
em all the way through back to a cloud
platform this is one of our products is
the connector for the cloud we don't do
application servers or full vertical
applications we just do the
communications and security connector
and that's a Java SE component we are
working on Java EE as well so to run
this as a container and we do things
like load balancing we scale out across
big clusters so this is kind of a
millions to tens of millions of node
type of scale server component nodes I
mean these guys so we think and we think
in terms of street lights or electric
meters how many of those can we talk to
with one server cluster and finally
we're showing some web applications that
is something we just provide a source
code it's just normal Java JSP that we
use to do a web GUI and something we
provide as a reference application to
developers and just to show how normal
this development is it's nothing special
it's no different than any normal JSP
vyas project the only difference is now
you just use this rest interface to
access IOT data rather than something
more specialized and we have some future
roadmap stuff we're working on so we're
working on things like identity
management integration of Oracle tools
we're working on big data integration
with the whole suite of um no SQL Hadoop
based technologies we have Java FX based
you is if you go to the Oracle booth
there's a demo with this this one box
talking to local sensors a local Java FX
based UI that's a very cool part of this
demo too so you can see that at the
Oracle booth so lots of things going on
in this space integration of IOT with
the Java and Oracle ecosystem
and finally I recommend people to go
check out the EM bed project as well
this is something we're doing to kind of
provide a we like to call it kind of the
Android for IOT we're really providing a
very simple SDK that you can use across
all cortex based devices at about two
billion in growing that's a pretty big
device space to get access to and we're
including things like these protocol
stacks 6lowpan Co app we're actually
providing those libraries in the near
future on em Ben and I think we'll see
more things around Java ME support
things like that with embed in the
future too so there's a Java connection
here as well so we want to see Java
running on a lot of these devices
running in then so em bed org easy
development for embedded devices finally
a summary lots of stuff I know don't
worry you can look up all this stuff
you'll find these slides there's
something that interests you you can get
definitely get more information you can
always feel free to ping me I'm always
happy to answer people or for example my
colleagues in at the arm booth and we're
happy to talk about all this some more
some things I like people to go away
with you know pretty simple you know IOT
is just an evolution of the web so if
people talk to you about IOT this that
is a big thing just yeah level head it's
just it's just web and Internet
technology we're just applying it to a
new domain that's it
so we know how to do this we've done
this before market growth so our scale
it'll be driven by standards and time to
market so the combination of these
things if somebody tells you that
standards are not important they don't
really know what they're talking about
because this is such a complex ecosystem
we need those standards to be able to
scale scale these systems but we need to
make the tools that get this stuff
faster market right it's not enough to
have standards if the standards are very
complex to use and deploy it didn't help
us anything right I mean it just made it
worse so we need standards and tools
and finally in addition to the standards
trusted security we always have to
emphasize that so both for the consumers
and for the end users like enterprises
and just so that we're building
technology that really is manageable
so going out and hand updating devices
because you just compromised
you know 300,000 electric meters that's
not fun
companies have folded because of this in
Sweden for example there was a case of
this and there was a whole company that
folded because they they just got caught
in a maintenance nightmare with these
IOT devices they had to go out and roll
trucks to update devices that had
security issues and some other
reliability issues so you have to be
really careful with the kind of
maintainability and security and final
finally you know big data needs a little
doubt and that's what we're here to do
we're little data guys so we want to
feed all this data and make it available
for for big data enterprise developers I
think that's where we'll get the cool
stuff building neat applications over
this that's it thank you so happy to
answer any questions we had a couple
during during the talk
it's a good question so um yeah I don't
particularly like MQTT all that much
personally but we're all you know we're
all techie nerds right so we all of our
personal opinions I don't typically like
it because mqtt is one of these
protocols that it's been around for a
long time it's not new it's legacy as
this as legacy as you could get I mean
we're talking late 90s and it was one of
these things that they said that well we
want to do pub/sub so how do we do
pub/sub we reinvent everything
architecture the infrastructure the
protocols that you really reinvent it
all and I don't think that's a very
productive way to design protocols and
get them out there so I think there is a
place for pub/sub but do we need to
reinvent the entire stack to do that and
have special tools special brokers
special protocols know people do pub/sub
on HTTP today on rest and it works just
fine people can do pub/sub on coop right
now you can do pub/sub it's just a rest
protocol and it will work just fine so
do we need to invent a new protocol to
do pub/sub probably not you have things
like XMPP as well that work fine the
secondary thing about MQTT to understand
is that MQTT is actually not solving the
problem that co-op's solving I don't
actually see co-op and MTT competing at
all MQTT is competing against the use of
HTTP for solving a lot of these systems
and as a different paradigm a pub/sub
paradigm so if you want to do pub/sub in
particular and you want to use that as
an alternative to http
we lost our battery it still works
though huh Wow
how is that even possible
oh it's wired okay good so if you want
to do pops up in particular and you want
an alternative to http that's where mqtt
would be useful but for really small
devices like we've been talking about
here small networks mqtt is still too
heavy for for really use in that space
so what I hope to see in the future is
that some of this pub stuff really gets
brought back into the web world so we
can do pub sub over standard protocols
it'll be so much easier right you use
reuse your jetty infrastructure or your
web application server infrastructure
for serving all this stuff up load
balancing and then you use you don't you
use rest semantics for pops up and then
you're fine so XMPP does some really
cool pub/sub stuff and there is security
built in but it's pretty heavy I mean
it's a little bit like a MQTT in that
way that it wasn't really thought up for
really small devices it was developed at
a time where you're working with bigger
devices so they're pretty simple I mean
XMPP uses an XML stream to do those
things
mqtt has its own framing that's about
the the difference both of them have
some ways you can do security etc so
XMPP is popular for a jabber type of you
know chat applications but it's got
found a lot of new applications so
co-op's a fairly new protocol but we
have a pretty rich open source and
commercial library selection so there
are a bunch of open source projects
available for coop on Java there are
commercial tools available on Java so
for example arm provides commercial Java
libraries for se for use in the cloud SC
on gateways and now Emmie so it's pretty
complete
and there's projects like californium
that's a pretty good one for Java SC
that's open source and will will be much
more active and open source in the
future as well I think for co-op
especially will get a lot of support
DTLS needs some more support too
so we've been encouraging Oracle and all
of our partners to do more on DTLS
because the DTS support in Java today is
a little bit it's a little bit if the
receiver cannot receive the transmission
to make a second request not exactly so
co-op actually builds in a reliability
mechanism into the protocol so it's true
the the protocol has to implement its
own reliability mechanism but it's a
simple binary exponential back-off so um
TCP is trying to do something a little
bit different so the way TCP does
reliability it's trying to maximize
performance really as a stream so the
binary back off and coops a lot simpler
just per data gram and one data gram at
a time so there's no there's no flows
there's really just one packet at a time
its n star D equals 1 in caught so it's
not trying to maximize performance just
trying to minimize overhead it's a
different goal
Oh auth probably doesn't go down that
deep we see we start getting into Oh app
like at the edge of our cloud connector
and that's when we start to need to hook
into user accounts but it's a good
question because we are gonna see the
need for more and more authentication
technology down to devices it won't look
exactly like ooofff
but it may have some of the same kind of
features so we do need to do things like
get an authorization token to talk to
another device so if we two devices want
to talk to each other we have to talk to
our mothership and figure that out there
is a lot of talk right now in the IETF
about that kind of thing so I think
we'll see more of it the other is a
question I missed from the back sorry No
okay great thanks everyone live with the
audience for this time in the morning so
uh welcome to the arm booth and the
Oracle booth to come come by and say hi
and otherwise and enjoy your day at
