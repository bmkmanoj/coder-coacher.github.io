Otsuki I come from the cloud services
provider in boring insurance pace and we
help people getting their life back if
there was something at in service I'm
going to talk about retrofitting
security and in particularly
retrofitting after interest web services
and I gather that's what is interesting
for us today the sample used in this
code deep dive is available on github so
don't worry if you're not keeping up
with the amount of code I'm going to
show you you can always go back download
it wave of it and use it for your own
purposes that's the hope so before we
begin let's just get to know each other
so I'll ask a couple of questions you
raise a hand and it's kind of
complicated questions if the next part
of the equation doesn't apply to you
just lower your hand and I'll know how
deep I need to go how much you have to
explain so anyone here use a plan to use
rest Web Services that's my crowd and do
use it for a sensitive information okay
yes okay and how many here familiar with
what all is about awesome and I'll guys
by any chance planning to yourself for
your s web services to protect your
sensitive information awesome and there
are many open source tools out there how
many of you use spring spring security
spring security oh okay
great then we'll be speaking the same
language what we are going to do we'll
just talk a bit what's security cause
people don't like doing security it's
not a feature you cannot bring it at
your sprung spring demo doesn't give a
thing to show it's not Flores we will
talk about also just rehash what are the
terms CD for authentication flows and
then we'll do the code deep dive the
numbers here are numbers from 2013 so
they're outdated and probably the cost
is higher then you see surprisingly the
cost per record runs in almost $200 per
record if your daughter is going to be
compromised
you was almost 3,000 records on average
if you the company appropriate if it was
more and your customers wouldn't love
you the internet will be reporting all
about the disgrace and the bigger you
are the bigger they disgrace so that's
the reason why people do security
no one does security from pure love of
doing it after all started in 2006 by
IETF group and it came to help us to
protect various clients mobile clients
applications the web desktop accessing
HTTP services and it's a protocol that
HTTP based and it allows us to authorize
access
essentially protect the sensitive
information that they have and prevent
malicious intruders getting too much
data in their hands then we talk about
of the most important thing is they
think we're protecting it's the resource
this service call they may be the
granularity of data that this service
called will return and then we talked
about resource there is a resource owner
that would authorize access to the
resources usually it's the business user
that would be asked to authenticate and
we'll be presenting the big fashion of
your grant application so and so
inability to access your email your
friends list your many things and this
person would say yes and the application
will be able to access the information
then there is the resource server this
is their the resource itself lists and
every time someone asks for resource the
server will take the authentication
token that the client got from their
source on the rental take a look at it
and say oh does that mean that the
request can go through or not and
they'll make a decision will be yourself
guards there is a concept of scope scope
it's an artificial grouping of objective
objects
allows kind of an aggregate if you have
call a call vehicle see you can throw
scope concept and say if somebody is
calling in B its scope read and if
somebody's calling see its scope right
and then I'll take decisions who can do
what then there is a client a client is
an application that was given by
resource owner a permission to access
the
there are two end points in the picture
there is a physician end points the one
which froze the beautiful again page
there the user would put me information
and what do they offer ization and then
there is the talking end point it's less
obvious then you use this is their the
access token is exchanged from our
ization grant this is their tokens can
be refreshed all of the behind the scene
logic the tokens access token the one
which supposed to be on every call and
has the information about the resource
the owner that granted the permission in
his chat the Refresh token that is used
in some of the earth indication flows
and northing the others and allows us to
extend the life of the access token if
needed open get a access token based on
the BAM you've gotten before but maybe a
smaller scope identical and whatnot in
then there is the authorization grant
then resource owner was asked can
so-and-so do this on the owners data
usually the grant is given and then it's
up to the client to exchange the grant
for the access token and refresh token
so this all the terms that we are going
to see on our subsequent slides while we
are talking about the flows there are
four flows and some of them are used in
one situation and in others in different
situation there are four of them there
is the one that you probably experienced
as a resource owner in your life the
authorization code grant if you've been
asked to authorize with Google with
Facebook it's most probably what
happened
then there is the resource owner
password credential flow that we will
talk about the plant prudential flow
those two flows are actually very good
for retrofitting security if you have
something that is already working and
has its own security
those two flaws can help you to get the
business going and then there is
implicit grant flow for which is very
similar to a physician code brand but
it's catered for a secured clients like
JavaScript by bother giving JavaScript
in a physician grant and it's so exposed
let's just give the topsis token from
the get-go and never give it JavaScript
application in the Refresh grant and so
on and let's take a look how it all
working so this is the authorization
code grant flowing this is our resource
server the one that protects our
services our resources this is a
physician server the one which has the
physician endpoint and talking endpoint
this is their client up is living this
is a protected up and there is a web
service and we control what happens on
the web service this is their the
exchange will happen there is a browser
of course and there is a user so user
accesses a browser request goes to web
server and user wasn't of indicated web
server decides to start off process so
browser would redirect authorization
server to a physician endpoint and the
user will be presented with the form to
feel credentials the data would go back
to relation server
the server would issue therefore zation
code the ization code would bubble for
redirects back to web server the
refrigeration code will be exchanged in
to refresh into access token and access
token from now can be used to access
resources or resource server it's
probably the most complicated or flow so
don't get alarmed okay
the next one we're going to talk about
is resource honor password credential
flow it usually works then you trust the
client like Hillary's application it's
simpler the assumption is that the
client already has the credentials of
resource owner of the user this client
can intercept the credentials and take
the credentials and with the credentials
both of the afforestation server which
would check is it the legit resource
owner is it the Ridgid client and
they'll get back an access token to be
used with all the arts or sister
resource server so they must simpler and
that's what we are going to talk about
today client credential flow is the case
then you have a client you trust you
don't care who you user is it's just you
want to protect resources on your
resource server client works with a
physician server with the tow connected
to point get that's talking develop the
Refresh document and uses the access
token to access resources last month on
our theoretical part of the lecture is
implicit grant flow it's very similar to
a physician called grant with
modification for clients which are not
secured so user browser JavaScript
appreciation server web server resource
server it starts with the user
JavaScript
that it needs a token JavaScript issues
the redirects a phrase Asian server
presents the form a phrase Asian server
checks the information issues an access
token returns it is a fragment that
JavaScript understands JavaScript
retrieves the access token from the
grant fragment and can use the access
token in communications with resource
server so you know after all those are
the flows and we are ready for our
sample deep dive so no more boring terms
no more complicated sequence diagrams
pure code we made it sample deep dive is
available on github download play with
it there are three parts to what we are
going to see today we will start with
something which we had and probably
something that you have because you want
to return it we have a web service this
web service was living in the secure
environment was never protected was
never accessed from the external clients
and as years went by product managers
realized their legacy application is no
longer attractive it doesn't have rich
UI it needs Java Script widgets talking
to rest Web Services and that's what our
client are after so that will be our
beginning point we'll see the port will
see the use of spring security in the
legacy not the off then we'll take a
look at
protected widget example so the service
will put bring security of protected
will see the changes to the client the
physician here there there the access
talk it would be possible and both talk
what are the restrictions were cornered
ourselves into and then we'll see
something which is a protected gateway
and it's built for spring integration
and also spring security off however not
on the server itself and they'll talk by
it might be better in your case so let's
start with our unprotected service it's
built a forest controllers spring in VC
doesn't have to be the actual service
was done with rest easy it's just
additional plumb being you have to put
in place to get two frameworks to work
together
they're with me this is the unprotected
service as you can see here and it's a
dictionary that's a good example we have
very sensitive words in the dictionary
our plans are paying taxes the
dictionary and we charge them or amount
of words they're getting we restrict the
bandwidth and do many other things
and as you can see in this particular
browser I can go in and I just can get
ten times the amount of words that I was
supposed to get although other malicious
fix or get words from another client
there's no end so bad things people come
up with
so all the basic lines which will cost
widget that would talk so insecure
service is built with spring security
and we will see how it knows about the
users it's a real life example the users
live in the database and we will talk
about spring security filter chain
demand which does the checks for our
users the annotation enable web security
authentication manager builder is used
in Java configuration web security HTTP
security builders
okay
arrest me for a second
is it big enough do I need to make it
bigger because I have the powers better
okay so this is the JavaScript this is
the call anyone can open and take a look
at it and copy it paste it in the
browser and do malicious things as we
just did
this is their the persistence leaves we
need the data source we're going to
access database and it's a sample it's
hard-coded don't be alarmed that's not
the call you'll put in production this
is a very interesting part we happen to
use my signal data so data source in
production in it leaves Nesta Fred's
running around so there is a very
important thing you'd like to do then
you're shutting down your application if
you're not using my sickle you're good
this particular class okay
he's using a JavaScript initializer of
spring and what happens there a spring
security filter is added and spring
security filter is the magic which
allows to Prolog inform for you connect
the dots though the checks
now we're ready to do the configuration
for our client
and we'll put the datasource and all the
information needed and this is a
real-life example it even has the
password and quarter with sha-256 so
once we told spring what all again JSP
page is and that we have index GSP and
that we'll be using a username and a
password
which will look like this this is
index.jsp and there is a beautiful
public library spring security so but
you mark the part of the page is
protected and if you don't have
permissions you will not see it if roll
user is granted then you may proceed and
oh god and again so we have the form the
spring will do the hard work will send
the username and will send the password
and will do nothing about our JavaScript
so how will it look like
please meet the client you are asked to
again this is the legacy page GSP you've
been loved in in there are no
restrictions on what you can do you just
pull and pull information and no one
would stop you so essentially this is
there somebody sits things about things
and says whatever doing guys this is not
okay oh he's third party security firm
come in does the audit stop to engineers
and says you know this is not okay and
this is why and here is the forty page
document of all the things in priority
order that you need to page to fix so we
know it's broken what are we going to do
about it
so we've seen all the bits and pieces of
the legacy just for our general
education those are the tables in the
database there are the default spring
security tables
it's probably not your production data
store because three fields for a user I
don't know that would meet the
requirements but this is something to
get started with and to build upon you
add fields as needed and that's pretty
robust implementation out of the doors
the users the groups the group
authorities the user of forages so many
things
the tag liebe library of Z with virus
starts the ones we've seen in the sample
is roll user Chuck very handy and that
concludes the unprotected widget piece
of the talk now we are ready to talk
about protected widget and we've
protected widget we are going to do all
we will do resource honor password
credential flow we have the user the
user authenticates the user puts in
username and password and this is what
is available for us so we just can go
and ask nicely from the thank you token
endpoint to give us an access token to
do that we would need information about
clients and we will inject that from
plan detailed service consumer we will
need to put the plumbing in place for
our physician server information about
the endpoints information about the
users and we will see then we'll create
a security protection role but there are
some shorthand things available for us
once we use of the method security
expression handler with simple notation
we can request that only all for it is
with of those particular scope good old
being off clients oh but then we need in
our real life which is
the sample we can screw right it nicely
concisely
when we will talk about the resource
server piece the resource server
configuration is essentially who can get
there
if we are using cross-site request
forgery prevention from spring security
there is a bit of caveat there it
shouldn't be applied for our physician
and yes sure so we started in the
situation where we had the login prompt
we had the GSP so this is a real life
situation a legacy application client
server side based usually has already
authentication and authorization in
place it's what happens then you start
bringing it into rich web experience
what happens then you move it from the
server
do you I logic from the server pages
into JavaScript if users want smooth and
slick UI nowadays and you are expected
to provide adducts calls and you expect
it to refresh parts of the page and do
many things on the client before you
send back your data and this is there
it's exposed your existing security no
longer applies and that's a problem
so while we are prompting the user for
logging as we used to do we are doing
additional something which we'll see and
that additional something results in
access token and every objects call
every call from JavaScript will carry
this access token and the configuration
on our resource server it's essentially
the same application server or the same
tomcat with additional logic that shares
if the call can go through based on the
access token okay so there is no magic
in the world and all this wouldn't
happen just because we wanted to happen
we will needs to wire up is stored for
our tokens store for a physician code
store for approvals and we will do it in
the database we will use only a token
store in the demo because we are
retrofitting security and we're using
resource on our password credential flow
however spring security spring security
off toe is the tools which will get you
there if you need to it's just outside
of what we're doing today and this is
how the database looks like there are
number of tables tables of the
information about the clients
what's client ID in what's client secret
this is how a physician server validates
the client if we are using a JDBC you
can customize it you can implement and
register things of the nature of your
application if JDBC is not the way for
you to go what is
the scope comma-separated list of values
this client works with telescope so if
your see request signed by that client
ID in by deaths secret and disco don't
match no such luck
there are authorized grant types this is
their one would tell a physician server
a bit about the client does it support a
physician code black grant does it
support resource owner password
credentials grant does it support client
credential grant comma-separated list of
values the duration in seconds of how
long the access token would live how
long the Refresh token would live if
there are authorities rules associated
with the client this is the table there
this information resides auxiliary
tables which would store the generated
tokens approvals code grants are the
rest so now we are ready to go back into
the demo gold
the implementation is already available
and this is the default implementation
web default tables and if you'll
download the github example there is a
script there that fill get you going
don't create all the tables so it's just
a matter of connecting the dots this is
your data source go work same goes for
the token store same goes for the client
Prudential store
once we configured the in the talkin
store decline little service
refrigeration code service all this
information they are ready to build our
authorization server and there is a
spring security of configure adapter
that helps of that so our clients are
JDBC this is the store if we have the
user approach and arrest they have the
total store if they have the
authentication manager which we already
built for all the base application the
physician endpoint will use all that
information to service our after all
needs
oh sorry
we're building our resource service our
resource service we want to work with
one resource ID have that particular
service for very sensitive words that we
are protecting you can extend it did
that again and this is the part we've
been waiting for if you see the request
for word list check that it has the off
talking with the scope words and the
identity that the resource owner yes
they're all of the user and then and
only then let the go through so if
they'll go back to a browser
and we'll we'll try hitting it will get
nothing you just can go out of the web
and hit it
the JavaScript changes a bit
just a second
so what happens we went through the
motions we did all the configuration
right how do they make it work we need
to put the appreciation hitter on
alcohol and it's a bear and we need to
put the token the access token the
random string of characters which was
issued for that particular user in there
and that would allow for calls to go
through so I'll have the same response
as we just got from the browser you are
not authorized so this is what happens
then you protect the service once you've
protected the service all the requests
to the service have to be authorized
requests and this is the reason we are
going to talk about security gateway the
third part of the sample so first let's
just finish with the second part and
then we'll talk about the Gateway how do
we get the information about the talking
to our JavaScript client
that happens
with the help of extension custom
authentication details we will extend
the default web of indication little
source and the above indication details
and the purpose of this extension is to
allow us to carry over the information
about the token where do the tokens come
through so we have a post authentication
listener usually what happens with
spring then authentication is done the
information about the credential is
removed so then we configured our
education manager we ask that explicitly
not to do so why because we wants to use
the credentials to get the token this is
the component which is registered from
the start of ice-cream and it extends
application listener abstract
authentication event it has the resource
honored password access token provider
and if it sees a success event means we
got a user in it takes the information
about the user the name and the
credentials and it fires up with a
request for access token
and starts the information the value of
the token in the bearer field of
customer vindication details and then
read it again at the end we make sure to
raise credentials it's important not to
let them sit around in your JVM
and what happens on our index do speed
we will put the information about the
beer this random stream in the meta tag
and JavaScript knows to go there and
look for it this is how all the dots got
connected and if we go to the browser
so always if your client Jake
it's hard to drive it from the tangle
we're still getting the data the data is
still coming and we know that the data
is coming because the user was
authorized because we got the token and
the token is HTTP request and fill open
developer tool we'll see that header
there now let's go back to our
presentation
and we'll skip
to the gateway the limitation which we
just seen is all the costs have to be
protected and we have many other
services calling this service and that
means we'll have to go back and though
the changes yes please right
it's really up by a basis it depends on
first of all your business requirements
if it's a medical application and user
is inactive for ten minutes you're
supposed to walk the user out and if you
just want to prevent somebody getting
data but it's not that critical it
doesn't have personal identifiable
information in there you can let it be
active for 24 hours the last thing users
want is to go through again process
again security is a compromise no one
loves doing security everyone wants the
ease of access everyone wants happy life
and they do security because they have
to because the government told them or
because their clients are demanding so
if it's okay for your business so users
have an open session for eight hours
that's okay
then would you use refresh token so
refresh token is can be used then you're
refreshing but that means you constantly
monitor the user session and you do
certain call-outs and you replace the
information in your browser
also refresh talking can be use do do
user gets in the application once but
you don't have single widget you have
multiple widgets and those widgets do
different things and you don't want the
user who launched widget a if for
instance access token got compromised
you don't want the stock in to be used
for visit B so you can use different
scopes for the widgets and you can use
refresh token mechanism if your
transition user from the widget to the
widget you can use a refresh token to
Sheen you're talking for a different
scope very good question
so what are we going to do if we still
want to pull our service unprotected
internally we can build a gateway it
will have all these security logic which
were put in the service and it will just
be a pass through the actual service
will be in the same state it starts at
the journey with the insecure state and
the internal calls will not be changed
the external calls will go for the
Gateway the external schools will have
to have the access token and the
external calls will be validated spring
integration allows to build it through
configuration in the fast way it
supports inbound and outbound HTTP
gateways and it's a message flow
architecture you create your flow your
plan minion it just applies the security
rules and if security rules are okay
hence the work over to your service the
interesting field things we can do with
that is sorry using the range enforcer
for instance of our clients get a
different amount of words based of
amount of money they paid us we can put
in enforcer there we can create a custom
expression handler the same way spring
security of two created pairs and
they're able to write his hope and his
client and his client role beautiful
things with not much of a hassle we can
do
the same thing and we will need a HTTP
request trust factory the default one is
a simple one in you may not want to put
it in production and you may need
outbound header mapper just to make sure
that if you have a load balancer which
takes care of the request it will not
complain about it was coming from
unknown places so before we get to
resources we will go back to the code it
is a code deep dive we will start with
the header mapper the only header will
actually want to exclude it the cost
mapper it's Rob's load balancers the
wrong way there is a default HTTP header
mapper that spring integration comes
with it's just a matter of letting it
know but we have a header to exclude
our range enforcer we can intercept the
request and before handing it over
though modifications to the request so
we had the toy from parameter we can go
check the rolls for instance if we have
a Demerol and production role endemic
intimacy towards thousand words and
production can see everything this is
there we will make sure that the range
is OK
this is the factor substitution
okay come on Eclipse
okay
this is the bull and we say okay I see
in and climb in your quest send it
please out and while you're sending it
out make sure that my requests are okay
and redirect the requests to my insecure
my original service and you can have
many involved calls one outbound call
and that would do certain magic so a
different user actually she actually
doesn't have a role
note the Demerol and not a production
role ashley gets nothing
we have another user and this this is
our demo user 1000 words you got to go
this is how much you paid us for and
then they have a different user
this is our production user and I just
can stand here in school till I reach
the end of my word file letters BC so on
if you need additional resources by
researching the sample researching the
topic information about of information
about Sprint Security's pretty security
of the demo itself and if you're
interested in infinite scroll in
angularjs which is not part of this stop
this is place to Bowl
you can build beautiful things with
spring security in the century compare
the words the word you can build an
identity provider and you can integrate
various tokens with spring security it's
all there just a matter of assembling
the puzzle correctly and you can satisfy
your clients with non-standard
requirements of some encryption and
whatnot I hope you learn something today
and you'll be able to use it that's my
goal oh okay and if you have questions I
would love to answer them for you sure
of course for pleasure the PDF version
of the presentation is available online
