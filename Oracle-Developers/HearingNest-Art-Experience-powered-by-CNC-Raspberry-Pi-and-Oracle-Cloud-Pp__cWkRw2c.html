going to talk a little bit about the
hearing nest art experience which was in
the the Java hub all of these folks were
unfortunately involved in the project in
some way so I I somehow drag them into
what turned out to be a much larger
technology demo and art install than you
expect how many of you folks saw the
hearing nest in the hub ok so for
everyone else we have slides slide oh ok
so this is the hearing Nestor oh you
guys saw it ok awesome you just didn't
know the funky name we called it does
anyone actually have their cut out here
like the little badge cut out that they
made I do oh nice ok what what's that
supposed Oh glue on all right I get it
company branding yeah very good
alright sorry you're also spot no it's
not supposed to have a let junk on you
when you're talking I think so what you
could do with this experience is you see
those um cnc cutters in the backgrounds
who knows what cnc is by the way okay so
I'm going to explain it for everyone
else to you guys who raise your hands
apologies so it's computer numerical
control thank you computer numerical
control but basically it's it's a three
axis cutter with a router at the ends
and it's the opposite of a 3d printer so
in a 3d printer you build up things by
adding materials in a CNC router what
you do is instead you remove materials
to make shapes and designs so these are
fairly precise machines you can actually
carve out three-dimensional models and
sculptures with them the one limitation
is that you only have one direction of
cutting so the drill bit goes down they
also have 5-axis cnc routers where you
can actually rotate the bit and then hit
the the object for multiple different
angles so those are more complicated but
you can do some special shapes which
aren't possible on a standard cnc router
these are just a 3-axis cnc router but
the nice thing about them is they're in
an enclosed case and they're fairly
quiet so you could actually have one of
these on your desk at work or at home
and be you know cutting out little
functional parts or other stuff it just
next to your computer and they're
designed to be hooked up to a computer
as well so most of the software for
these runs on a standard desktop
computer advance the slide let's just
something different these are the
hearing helmets that miriah has created
I think maybe it would help if you could
describe your artwork a little bit
Miriah just for the audience the type of
artwork you do Cimmeria comes from
Germany yes
and she she's an artist who specializes
in things which have to do relate to
hearing and also sculpture mm-hmm with
my work I work with a theme of hearing I
miss Carter and I try not to use sounds
I I try to transform noises what we hear
in in visual forms and in these hearing
helmets there is no sound in it it's
only that you hear yourself louder and
you hear the other noise is a little bit
more a little more less and it is so
that the self perception is getting
stronger so and yes did anyone try to
put one of these helmets what do you
what did you think what was your
impression of the yeah
yes
okay so let me repeat what he said for
folks on the on the recording or in the
room we couldn't hear so like you rather
than hearing things outside or
directional here you're actually hearing
yourself so like sounds of your own body
and actually I asked Miriah the same
question when I met her in Germany so we
were on a motorcycle tour visiting wolf
because he was here last year doing the
my matrix project and miria let me try
one of the helmets actually you were
with me too right Sebastian yeah yeah I
keep forgetting and I was wondering why
you know you were hearing yourself
instead of hearing outside because it
looks like the ears should be functional
and you can explain this better than me
probably marry it but I think what you
told me is the shape of the ears on the
helmet is to signify that it's related
to hearing and so you focus on the act
of hearing but then it's actually
designed to reflect your own sounds back
at you maybe you can yes it's and I
don't speak so good English therefore
okay is the video switcher up here okay
okay one one time I went in an industry
to where are many shops and I in
Stuttgart and I wear the helmet and it
was it was very interesting that the
noises you normally hear the noise is
very loud unto yourself you hear very
very less and when I go with the helmet
and the street I it was totally
different I I hear myself louder and the
noises less and this is I think very
nice ok and this is one type of artwork
that Miriah does can you bring up some
other sculptures and things which Mary
does for her hearing nest maybe oh wow
that's crazy yes it was my last
exhibition in my book it's a big
artist Hall and the people use they like
to use these helmets and cabins and so
on it's also a little bit for
communication form oh yes so when you
when you talk inside of one of those
things do you hear the other people
talking yes you hear the other people
but different way in a different way and
there the feeling is something different
or also it's not all only that you're
here with your yes you are here with
your whole body okay and then here are
some examples of your your hearing ness
can you describe this a little bit yes
the hearing nest it's almost invert it
is so that I I sit in a room and and and
protocol a long time the noises i hear
it so eight hours a day I can sit very
long and and only hear what happened and
I noticed this and and the noises who
always always repeat I use and cut it
out in in route it's then like a bird or
a church gong or yes the noises why what
I hear much and then I put these
together and and you can when you look
at it you can remain you can feel so
just to describe what you guys are
looking at yes these are the protocols
so those are actually words which are
written out as murias listening and its
really really tiny but then there are
different different colors based on the
street like the loudness and no no
this because I have to be so fast maybe
you can oh you're your ink is running
out okay and then also ones with
different colors yes this is this is
outside and inside color as a the yellow
is inside and the blue is outside so it
gives you an idea of some of the other
art pieces which Miriah does that are
also connected to the art but the one we
were most closely related to was the
hearing nest hmm which is the first one
there okay you want to describe this
little bit yes like mustard or flat yeah
yes this is this is a work with 800 and
noises I cut out with students and they
they use a CNC machine to cut out these
800 noise make us these are cars and I
hear I hear two days in in the
exhibition hall where I have my
exhibition so I start always with an
exhibition that I hear they're long time
and I I did then for this room with
these noises I here is such a big
hearing nest first vote yes these are
some examples of Mira's art let's switch
back to alex's machine and you can see
the the hearing nest she was creating in
the Java hub so this was composed of all
of the attendees shapes so you could
either on the machines there were touch
screens you could draw a shape and it
would cut out what you heard or you
could use the mobile application which
jose designs for the same purpose so you
drew on the mobile application and then
it would cut out the shape and it's a
it's a nice example of a collaborative
art project that some of you
participated in during the conference so
if you're one of the folks who have one
of those shapes on there you should be
proud that you are part of the creation
of this of this piece of art
give yourself a round of applause come
on so this is a little bit more about
the technology behind the demo we're
using these carbide 3d CNC cutters as I
mentioned earlier um the material we
were cutting out is acrylic plastic
normally Miriah uses wood for her art
projects but we specifically chose
acrylic for the conference because for
folks who have dust allergies or maybe
asthma that gets affected by fine
particles since we're an enclosed area
it's better to use plastic since plastic
doesn't produce fine particles you get
on large flakes that come off of it
instead and we also designed basically a
2d cut out so it'd be faster although we
do we did support adding in initials and
words you could write on it to kind of
customize you the center of your cutout
so they're cuts out two lines the inner
line gives you a shape you can keep and
then we poked a hole in it to add to
your lanyard the outer line cuts out an
outline which then we added the outline
to the sculpture that Mary was creating
in the Java hub so you had a piece to
take home with you and also a piece to
add to the collaborative sculpture 450
to 500 pieces so in total we got about
500 pieces for the overall sculpture so
that was exactly our target for what we
wanted to get coverage so that's very
good we had the printers running in the
Java hub and also at the otm lounge at
open world although javaone attendees
did much better than open world has had
these we were clearly we know who's
geekier there you can see the prototype
machine cutting out on the printer so
this was when we were testing the
printers in my garage with the software
which alex designs the initial version
was fairly rudimentary but it was
functional
it cuts it out in seven passes on the
plastic and that way even though the CNC
router we're using is not particularly
powerful by doing a few different layers
you could cut through fairly hard
materials you can actually mill soft
aluminum on the CNC router as well so
you can do wood plastic aluminum a
variety of other materials as well and
here is some of the source code for
hooking up with the CNC router we were
using a library called the universal
g-code Center all this code is written
in Java and we're communicating using a
raspberry pi how many folks know to
raspberry pi is everyone well almost
everyone for the folks who didn't raise
your hands you should have come to my
session yesterday but it's a small
embedded computer and the reason a
raspberry pi is more suitable for this
purpose than a full desktop computer is
it well it's less power consumption and
it's also a dedicated computer so if you
have a computer hooked up to it it's
possibly doing other things it might
crash it might have problems with
contention by having a dedicated device
like a Raspberry Pi which is only
working with controlling the router then
you get more stability of the system and
we were also using these two just power
the touchscreens as well using a JavaFX
user interface so it served as both a
control panel for the display and also
feeding instructions to the CNC routers
this shows the initial setup to simply
get a connection so it's creating a new
girl controller there's some locale
stuff you have to use especially if
you're from a foreign country otherwise
it uses dots instead of periods and
weird things Heinz Co boats notice this
when we were over in Europe adding some
listeners to it opening up the port the
port depends on your own particular
device this one will work on a Raspberry
Pi TTYL a CM 0 if you're testing on a
Mac or Linux computer you'll probably
have different differently labeled
serial ports
and then it just opens a connection yeah
this is the user interface for the
universal g-code Center feel free to
jump in and expand that anything you
want Alex so the universal g-code center
library also comes with a user interface
and this is particularly useful for
testing your printer and doing some of
the leveling stuff that alex is going to
talk about so simple controls to move
the different axes with buttons
resetting the zero point and below this
it shows a list of the actual g-code
submit commands that are being sent to
the computer g-code instructions are
kind of like kind of like assembly for
routers or for CNC machines it's
originally when they designs g-code they
thought this would be like a language
that people would actually right in to
control devices and the full g-code
specification has like variables and
control functions and all of these
really complex programming concepts
built into what they thought would be a
manual process it turns out nowadays a
nobody writes g-code by hands and be
none of the devices support higher level
g-code functions so most devices treat
g-code as a dumb language and they
simply execute it like assembly one
statement after another and most of the
time people don't manually create g-code
what they'll do is they'll use a visual
tool or they'll use a modeling software
it will use some package which is going
to admit g-code instructions which would
tell it you know start here create an
arc drill to this depth turn the spindle
at this speed so all of those things are
usually done inside of memory instead so
as I mentioned earlier we're controlling
this via a Raspberry Pi the devices
we're using hooked up to the printer now
our Raspberry Pi tues you could also use
a raspberry pi 3 or even some of the
older browser
grape eyes it really for this purpose
most of the small embedded computers are
sufficiently powerful go ahead and
advance Alex running on the raspberry
PI's is fairly easy as well so directly
from the NetBeans IDE and the same is
true even there's plug-ins for
intelligent Eclipse to do the same thing
you can run your code on desktop you can
test it on desktop and then you can just
switch your run settings to run against
a embedded device so this is the remote
configuration dialog for setting up the
device IP address or the hostname in
this case username password and then you
tell it the location of the JRE on the
device and then you're up and running
and then just right from the desktop you
can run it'll automatically deploy the
code and run a device you can debug and
put breakpoints in and that also works
from the IDE so it's fairly user
friendly and easy to test and get things
up and running as a developer oh yeah I
would like to add that for the JavaFX
app that we were using the trick was to
use a pseudo prefix to all the commands
like Ron commands etc so I think we've
got my slides now oh ok go ahead out so
yeah I was uh I was too tall
I was going to look at them so anyways
very somebody so yeah I was the one who
was am I too far so while I was the one
who was developing the software that was
running on the Raspberry Pi to control
the CNC gutter so let's start with CNC
gutter first it has some nice features
like very good mechanical resolution
over there and well just for general
information it has the area it can cut
off 8 by 8 inches and that's what we
used as a acrylic material and it also
has a height of 3 inches and it's quite
fast it can go up to 100 inches a minute
and it connects using USB and yeah as
Stephen mentioned it is being controlled
by gr BL 0.9 which is open source
standard for controlling and such
devices let's go next slide and yeah so
ok trick tricky part number one how to
find where to cut so first of all when
the machine is turned on it has to
perform to coordinate system settings so
first one is called homing it's where
when machine goes up right and back to
the sensors where it can repeatedly
locate the specific position of the
moment and then it goes down and touches
the special control pain to measure the
two lengths by doing these two
measurements we can exactly be sure
where where and how far we can move the
machine when we are doing the the cut so
in this CNC cutter world there are two
coordinate systems that are used one is
called machine system and it starts from
the homing position which is top right
back corner that's the image is shown on
the lock on the low so and the axis
because of the position all the values
of the of this coordinate system are
always negative so that it's easier to
distinguish them from another coordinate
system another coordinate system it
called worked work coordinate system and
that the origin of that like eight it is
somewhere on material for some for some
you know systems they would choose some
point on the top of the material for our
goal we were using the bottom of the
material so by measuring the two lengths
and knowing how how far the the sensor
is from the top of the waist board you
can calculate exact position of the top
of the waist board and that's that is
actually the bottom of the material so
let's go to the next slide yeah now
without going to the deep detail on how
we do that in G code here is an example
of G code commands so basically this is
this is all commands that are used to
cut any shape that we use so before so
we've got some initials I mean several
commands to initiate the session so to
speak and then there are some movements
rapid positioning linear interpolation
and linear
now that's it so basically setting the
feed and either linear moving or just
wrap it moving and as I as I put here
like a for loop statement so for each
continuous path fragment we first
position the let's go to the next slide
we first rapidly move to the point above
the material then slowly go into
material and go along the path to cut
the layer and then we go up and move to
the next point so pretty much the task
of controlling the way the cutter would
cut was to generate these g-code so
let's move to the next slide okay so the
easiest representation of any path in
javafx would be path so which consists
of path elements such as move to alight
to it could also connect could also have
elements like a cubic curve two or quad
curve two but I have found that it's
much easier to avoid those because jiko
directly does not support anything
besides arcs so i will show you later
how you can avoid those parts of the of
the path so and having these move to
online to path elements it's very easy
to map those to the commands on the of
the cheat code so let's go
okay so well once the g-code is created
we should use g-code universal universal
g-code Center API to send the commands
to the to the machine and that's exactly
why it was used to just avoid that layer
completely in the design of the system
and here is some examples of commands
that it's a board like perform homing
cycle or q command begin streaming or do
reset or something like that and then on
the next slide it has a listener
interface and listener interface
contains a number of callbacks that are
invoked at different times during the
operation and because the prodigal is
more human-oriented that machinery ended
some you know the interaction is
slightly weird you pretty much need to
parse different type of messages from
the system to understand what's going on
so I highlighted here for different
callbacks that were actually used during
the operation and I'll go going to show
I'll tell you what they were how they
were used so whenever you create a
sequence of commands and send it to the
cutter by the end of the sequence will
this callback will be fired and this
exact callback was used to proceed to
the next probing sequence for example
and in order to measure the tool length
as i was telling you before there was a
need to to perform some more advanced
commands on the cutter and unfortunately
those comments were not publicly
available for the nomads so i had to
run some software that would intercept
communication of their general hardware
their Nomad something I forgot the name
carbide something and these are the
commands that I capture so basically
what they do is they position the
position the machine above the tooling
pain then move half of the way rapidly
and then move slowly until the penis
touched and that's done by this G
38-point 38.2 command then it will
retrieve I mean raise the machine and
move again slowly to get a more precise
position so this is the second attempt
and you can see the feed rate here is
200 and it was 800 before so it's four
times slower and then it's done and then
this command is used to set the work the
work system command complete this one is
used to detect when it's time to switch
the state of the connection to connect
it stay then to home inc and then to
probing let's go to the next one message
for console this is more interesting so
there are some textual messages that are
returned by the system depending on the
state of it so when the probing is being
performed this message will indicate
what is the actual value of the
measurement and this one would indicate
that connection was established this one
would indicate that somehow the cutter
was turned off and then turned on again
and
it turned on its always come up comes up
in a locked state and you should use one
of these commands to unlock it and also
there could be some error messages and
just before job one I found that the
universal g-code center unfortunately
has some threading issues and sometimes
it throws errors out of out of the blue
and by catching these error messages I
was able to avoid it cutting itself but
as somebody may have noticed on the
keynote session they would lead the
device to reset so when our who was that
guy that Daniel was doing anything
Japanese Takashi yeah when he pressed
the cut button the machine started to
move and then suddenly returned to the
original position and that happened
exactly because one of the threading
issues happened so I was chasing them
like the night before the conference and
found one fixed one bug but the other
one I didn't have time to fix so that
was still happening and then the last
one is status string listener that just
gives you coordinates of the of two
systems and the current state so one of
the important stage is alarm that
happens if something goes totally wrong
like you hit the boundary or you know go
through the material to too fast or
something like that let's go so yeah so
what I found very useful is to convert
javafx path into java 2d path because
they have a nice method get' path
iterator that removes all the all the
curves from the path so once once you do
this conversion
and convert iterate the path to D using
this iterator it will only contain move
to inline two elements so that was the
easiest way to get rid of all the cubic
curves and other curves and then some
other tricks words you for example
import SVG path and convert it to a
regular path and this looks like a magic
but by making a union or substructure
subtraction or intersection no
intersection wouldn't work of original
SVG path or it could be text element for
example with empty rectangle you'll get
the path on the outside the only issue
with this approach though is that that
path could contain some what's good word
for that some bad elements some shapes
that would have no nothing inside like
empty so how they created nice nice
algorithm that was clean those up and I
was actively using it let's go to the
next slide okay so I quickly go through
the for the creation of paths for the
for the machine so originally when you
touch the screen you would get some
touch points they are connected in the
initial path but that's not the path the
machine will go because machine should
create something on inside on the
outside so yeah go ahead so the first
yeah
yes okay so so this is the target width
of our motive which is 33 eighth of an
inch and then we've got 180 an inch for
outside cut and inside God so yeah and
this is currently the trick currently I
show you the trick how to draw this on
the screen so first of all I would draw
the path that has things with as a
background and then I put another pot on
top and that will create a really close
image that will show you 22 paths along
the curve that you were drawing so the
question is what's wrong here why is it
not the correct path anyone has any
ideas okay anyone on the house I bet
nose a nose
okay so consider you have a corner like
this this sharp corner it looks like the
toolpath will go and cut this through
the you know make this nice corner over
here but it's not possible because the
tool has the tool that is cutting it has
a one-eighth in diameter so it will
actually cut something like this and
that area will become a part of the
motive so that's why you need to do more
more month there to properly show this
so let's go to a precise outline
generation algorithm so instead of doing
the original with will create for eighth
of an inch which is motive with plus two
radiuses then you will look that this
outline of the shape is actually the
middle of the tool path that will be cut
on top of it that will be something like
that this is rough drawing so how to do
that in Java yeah clean it up picture so
first of all yeah approach number one
java 2d so with java 2d you can create a
basic stroke with a dime diameter that
you want with round joints and round
caps well we don't need caps here but
anyways and basic stroke has a great
stroke shape method that will exactly
create this two lines of the of the
boundary of the shape this one and this
one and this stroke shape could be
converted into area and iterated get it
you can get path greater over it so
that's very nice and
where is short and precise method
unfortunately there is a bug so if you
look here or here in some particular
junctions it doesn't create a round
connections it would create something
like what is it gold I don't remember
something weird I don't think they even
have a connection like that so i had to
find another way to do this and here
comes library called ESR I geometer API
Java and they have completely different
API so you would create a polyline out
of the path and you would use buffer
operator that would actually create a
the area that contains all the points
that are not farther these distance from
the original path and then there is a
boundary operator that we create a shape
that would just take the boundary of the
shape and this is where this works
perfectly no no issues found so far but
slightly a more you know calculation
extensive I think they support more
generalized shapes and that's why
anyways that works so yeah so pretty
much that was it to create the path for
the for the cut and as I as I told you
earlier it's quite easy to convert that
path into G code so two other things
that we had were QR code reading and so
we've got a camera on our device to read
the QR code from them from the mobile
app and to do that i found the library
called JRP i cam and that library was
actually just executing common line
utility erasmus
deal and basically you create this air
pipe camera and you show you where you
want the preview window to be shown and
you can get still image out of it or you
can record video I think with the
standard standard options of this
library I had to extend it to create
sequence of still images I was trying to
read them from a output stream
unfortunately it seems like Java cannot
cannot do that reliably I was only
getting read only like every second
image so i had to use a output file so
each time still image is created it was
written into the image file and then I
was reading it from Java and processing
and to find the code inside the image i
was using that xing library and this
library works very straightforward you
just create create hybrid binarize ER
and QR code reader and you decode the
image and it would throw you an
exception if there is no QR code
otherwise it will just tell you what the
QR code encoding what what kind of
encoding does it have so I've got some
not solve task but it's not very
interesting let's move to constantly
right so mobile app you know boss safe
harbor statement
thanks Alex thanks Alex so basically for
the I don't need for the mobile app that
I think most of you already know about
it wrong a build digital one community
up so we could have all these
experiences available on any mobile like
Android or iOS and instead of showing
this these pictures i would like to
winsted just running it here so it's
better so we have the different
experiences available like going to ask
for a coffee and for this experience and
you can just go to your app and roll
with your finger so could just create
your own shape here and if you before I
release the mouse if you notice you will
see like all these different line
segments when I roll is it you get a not
only cures but also do you get the two
pads so basically on the app we did the
same that Alex already saw converting
the linear path you you drew with your
finger to a cubic curve then generate
the two different paths the inside and
the outside path and then after that we
created a SVG
save so this has PT and it's given by
the content so you can see this content
to anywhere so if you were happy with
the with the with the side you could
sell submit it or if you don't or if you
make a mistake the application complain
or if you cross the lines it would it
did stop throwing or if you were as I
say if you are already happy you just
click Submit and this part a it was also
we will talk about it now with Sebastian
or the cloud system we use here so
basically we submit a SVG to the cloud
and the cloud return it an ID with this
ID on the app we created we we create
this QR code in with the same library
that Alex mention and this QR and you
could scan it with a camera as without
there so from here and you were able to
with a raspberry pi to connect to the
cloud and we decided retrieve deck SVG
and create the path again ok so how many
of you guys have heard about glue on
before ok so for everyone who doesn't
know how they might be understating but
they have some very cool technology for
running java on mobile devices so this
is a great example of it with the java
one application with the otn experiences
in it but the the workflow and the
productivity is much better than if
you're doing equivalent in like um java
script or HTML to build an application
with a java api is they're using yeah we
are using just pure java and basically
for the UI you we use gel ethics we
actually we did a lot of hacking on this
at the j creek conference in crete just
in our spare time so it's quite suitable
for production applications but also
very high productivity and Sebastian's
going to talk a little bit about
the back end and shows an example of a
rest call switch touch me too it is yes
yeah actually that's fine for now you
can you hold it later when it shows some
code um yeah so being a member of the
JCP Council I of course implement the
back end using standards so and as you
probably think i'm using java ee as a
back end the application is sending us
i'm sending the information to us to the
back end and later the devices when
scanning it will fetch the data of the
SVG path what you draw in the app and
send it to the cnc cutter to cut it out
for that example so yeah as stephen sets
during Jake read during the JQ decreed
uncomfort I happen to be in the same
room as the guys hacking on the CNC
cutter and Steve knows that I'm in the
back ends and enterprise technology so
well why not contribute to that and
build an open source project using Java
EE to take a back-end and of course run
it on the Oracle cloud so that's what we
did that's what we implemented and what
I specifically did on the back end side
so I created at the back end using Java
EE technology it's using java ee 7
together with java 8 and here is the
project you can actually even check it
out it's on github here all the code
which i did on the back end and also on
the front and side actually on my github
account as tashna / Java hub demo back
end that's all written in plain and Java
8 post java ee 7 and running in the
Oracle cloud so the Oracle
infrastructure-as-a-service service
cloud is running a virtual machine with
the application server and our database
so everything you just draw if you did
that in the Java hub when Tori Tori
Oracle cloud was stored in a database
and really
later for cutting so actually I can just
do a short showcase on the command line
on the rest service what in the same way
that the app it's doing so it is
releasing rest as a communication it's
storing SVG path data which is in fact
plain text data in a certain format and
it's sending this back and forth and of
course storing it in a database so a
quite simple use case for the back end
side storing and retrieving it later on
just hold them like yep just thanks i
got my personal microphone stand how
cool is that so i could use who's who of
you has been using rest or enterprise
services HTTP services yeah quite a few
okay you I could use some fancy
restaurant but actually I would just use
the command line with curl right we are
all just command line hackers right and
that's the URL Java hot glue HQ com well
the URL doesn't tell you that's running
on the Oracle cloud but actually just
that's just a different dns so it is in
fact the Oracle cloud running that with
the context name Java app demo back end
so you know just the simple Java EE
example as a waffle running on an
application server here we have modules
because actually that back and consists
of several modules and that will be oh
well I can show you the for the full
example because we have several things
you use probably also saw the coffee
machine and using a nice hypermedia
approach with just linking to all these
modules which are available which are
here drawings and now you get a tons of
links these are actually all the
drawings which have been created to your
driver one it can be looked up in a list
but now let's create a new one right so
do it just like here from scratch
without the app using some data right so
this means we're posting to
identification right
as it is rest with students all here
from from scratch content-type text
plane right add as this plain text
having SVG information as an SVG path
and while hello java one because it
actually doesn't matter and chose the
headers 0201 created it worked and using
the hypermedia approach we get a link
back which is in fact just our drawing
we just created or actually information
about drawing and we can curl to this
and here you go hello Jabbar one this
came now back from the Oracle cloud from
the database running a java ee backend
and this is what the app has been doing
all the time and this is what happened
of course with different data with
encoded SVG data when you guys use the
app draw did your drawing and that was
exchanged using a java ee back end yeah
that's basically it you have any
questions yeah well thank you ok so
hopefully you've learned a little bit
about the background of the hearing nest
project from Miriah our artist and also
all the technical folks who are working
on the demo is I think it's a great
example of what you can do with Java
technology and the physical world by
using some cnc routers and also an
example of you know best practices and
rest we have the world leading expert in
rest technologies who built the backend
the world's best demo designer Alex
kouznetsov who he has designed the Java
one demos in the keynotes for the past
few years as well artists and the best
you I technology in the world as well so
you know only only the best community
folks and the best organized on I'm
traveling edible maker I just don't go
make dinner
boy so hopefully you guys have enjoyed
the session on your way out if you
wouldn't mind voting for the session as
you leave that would be appreciated we
also have a special treat if you'd like
to stay around for a few more minutes so
wolf who is Maria's husband was here
last year doing some artwork in the city
he did this wonderful my matrix project
for java one and he does a bunch of
walks where he photographs time lapse as
he walks around the path and composites
them into into artwork so here are some
examples of wolfs artwork around san
francisco so would you would you care to
describe some of your process and
inspirational yes so if it's possible
then I do not only sitting in such rooms
interacting with you but I like very
much I also go out by my own and
strolling through the place I am and
last year i did it with San Francisco
downtown and also around San Francisco
to know more about it and this series of
works is called walks and this is now
the first I did when I came in after the
hotel room just rolling here around and
took out of C's photographing experience
100 individual photos I did while I
walked from point 1 2 110 and layup them
one by one and at the end there is his
picture about San Francisco downtown and
the next one what I did was to go at the
next day to the Golden Gate Park there's
a very different experience there and I
had two walks over there is different so
maybe you got a nice lake in that
picture some water yes this was
san francisco by night this was my first
night walk yes and this was now Golden
Gate I walked both directions this was
from Sausalito to san francisco and this
was back to the bus you see on the left
side this this yields and also other
light and shadows and what i should show
this was from Sausalito back to san
francisco by ferry so this something and
this was at the end one by cable car i
looked for a place in the actus so I
mean one of the other interesting things
to note about Wolf's art is he works
with a university in Germany who helps
them with software that he uses for
image processing and Composition so a
lot of these examples of artwork he's
showing actually are powered by Java
image processing in the background this
is one I want to show you this is my
newest artwork it is done I photographed
3,300 individuals like you sitting here
in 13 different countries from China to
Indonesia to Europe different countries
and also Africa and then did I did it
resists Java program developed by
students of the Technical University of
Munich and nuremberg in germany layered
one by one so that every single portrait
has the same white can i save it the
same high height like the same yeah yeah
yeah so yeah and this is what I what I
am burning for is an artist to know more
about who we are alright so thank you
very much wolf and the rest of our
presenters and we
hope that you've enjoyed the
presentation and appreciate some of the
the artwork and technical stuff that has
gone into making this happen so you've
been a great audience thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
