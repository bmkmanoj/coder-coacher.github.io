whether you wanna Fresa how are you
hello I'm good thank you
so we're here at Oracle code Brussels
and I wanna just finished her session on
Python and data science or that went on
those Python Oracle database but you
could say there was some proper data
analysis are involved so tell me do you
see a whole lot more adoption of Python
you know in the in your data science
kind of you know community your world I
think actually python is based on
stackoverflow statistics is number one
language for these sort of applications
such as data science or data
transformation tasks actually this is
the chosen language of developers when
they want to have them they then also
says that they would have to handle now
how much do you use are probably quite a
bit
yeah RS the same as a respite and it's
like properly powerful statistical tools
again for a data science application now
if that's an open source language is
read yes and and the interesting bit
about our is that yeah it is open source
but it's also actively taught at the
university so there's a huge adoption of
our as the same as a size and because
yes it's open source everybody can start
using a digital ID on your computer and
you go so so not not too long ago
there's been some upgrades to Oracle our
our Oracle Enterprise and some of our
other suites are you using that
technology day-to-day are you part of
that whole space so and in fact Oracle
does have a number of number of things
we do with our so we do have our own
distribution which is optimized for our
for our system but the cool thing is
that you can also you can use our with
us all the big data systems and on the
safe side you can use them on the
relational databases so
as you have for example you might have
already years specific algorithms that
you want to paralyze or use on your
database system I need you to do that
yuanba that in your in your code and
that we shall show you the sequel and
then it runs on top of your all
computing power so yeah that's pretty
cool
how much do you get to drill down and do
some advanced analytics I mean is that
is that also part of your of your
playground and yeah it is and then with
advanced analytics I think it's a tricky
case because um of course like it's the
interesting bit right everybody wants to
be advance of their analytics of death
so um we do it very often like in my
team
but I think that we do reporting just as
often because you know there are
different stages and analytical
development of every company so
sometimes you do have to start small to
then be able to move on to machine
learning moving to advanced analytics
and yes so then you do it a lot because
in the end every company is interested
in to really drilling down into what is
going in their organization what is
going with the customers etc so as a
business analyst basically you are you
excited about machine learning and do
you think as an innovation it's coming
fast enough for you or or are you still
just kind of checking it out from the
side or what do you think of it I think
clearly there's a lot of buzz around
machine learning and artificial
intelligence I'm pretty sure that some
of the applications we still have to
wait years for them because the the the
amount is of information or the
complexity of these applications just so
huge that we cannot handle them at the
moment however if you describe machine
learning such as learning but anyway
machine know such as understanding by
machine what is your data structures and
applying a certain algorithm so that the
machine goes through this algorithm then
reiterates the model then yeah we were
there already I think um
an innocent way of thinking about
machine learning is that it would tell
us just statistics operationalized so
instead of having a physician looking at
a data set and trying to run tests a 8
SBDC we still do it you just have an
automated way of doing it and then your
machine can either follow a specific
model that you develop or it can and
it's called unsupervised learning or it
can say okay you just have these inputs
tell me what's going to be the Apple
tell me what's going on in the data so
and that's basically it
no look so there is more to it I'm so
glad to hear that yeah there's no other
than just kind of culture with a bad
yeah so I hope to see you again someday
do you get to come out to Oracle
OpenWorld
well hopefully Mandy we don't know we
don't know I really do is great talking
with you okay thank you very much have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
