a distinguished engineer I own our
architecture for what we're trying to do
cross offer group for mobility within
IBM itself I come from the application
infrastructure middleware group many of
you may know it as websphere and part of
what my role for the last three years
has been is to try to align and come up
with a consistent story for how we're
actually going to treat mobility within
within IBM and the problems that our
customers are actually facing as they
try to bring mobility into the
enterprise itself hopefully we'll see if
we can make this a little bit
interactive part of I what I want to
talk a little bit about is you know what
we're hearing from customers about why
mobility is is affecting the enterprise
today what means for a corporation what
it means to the enterprise developers
and really what capabilities that we
have to offer in order to actually help
solve the problems that certainly our
customers are actually coming to us that
they're experiencing if you look at the
number of devices from a mobile device
perspective and this is effectively
smartphones and tablets there's 6.5
million devices active today in fact the
last statistic I saw is that from a
penetration perspective like ninety
percent of the world actually has mobile
devices and it'll be actually over
penetrate from the standpoint of many
people actually have a tablet they have
a smartphone device as part of it but
you can't deny the the use of mobility
within the country today as a result
two-thirds of CIO is basically treat
mobile as a priority and they're really
struggling trying to figure out where to
begin from a mobility perspective now it
started off certainly when I got
involved with some mobility aspects of
it was really about the device about
trying to get applications on the device
trying to get and use the device as a
channel but it's really not about the
device it's really about the people
themselves the fact that people are
mobile and the device is really nothing
more than an extension for what they
want to do so the question that a lot of
the enterprises are asking right now is
you know how do we actually enable
the people who are mobile to be able to
effectively work within the company or
as consumers to be able to effectively
allow them to engage with an enterprise
itself now the five trends that we're
starting to see that are actually
important here for an enterprise is the
fact that Mobile is primary right ninety
percent of people actually have the
mobile device within arm's reach i read
a statistic yesterday that eighty
percent of the people the first thing
that they do when they wake up and the
last thing that they do before they go
to bed is actually check their mobile
device and that was certainly true for
the guy in the plane as i flew over here
second is insights for mobile devices
are providing lots of opportunities if
you look at where the spend is happening
within enterprises today it'sit's with
the line of business it's really about
trying to figure out how do i actually
drive new revenue opportunities and
mobile right with things like targeted
campaigns etc right provides a great
opportunity to get context about where a
consumer is and being able to reach out
to them in order actually right provide
a new opportunity to engage with the
customer mobile is about transacting
right if you take a look at what's
happening within enterprises today more
and more of the axis into the enterprise
is actually through mobile devices and
mobile channels and more and more is
actually getting spent through these
mobile channels themselves the fourth is
mobile has to create a brand experience
initially a lot of the companies are
starting off with mobile we're
effectively outsourcing some of these
things and you'll see that in the next
chart about creating a mobile channel
into the enterprise itself but now that
channel needs to get tied in with the
existing channels that they actually
have with them with respect to the web
channel we're starting to see mobile as
you cross lines of business within the
enterprise it's all part of the brand so
one of the one of the certain trends in
this case is to actually make it a part
of their digital strategy in fact we're
starting to see a lot of new titles
about head of digital strategy where
it's about mobile and web channels right
and effectively engaging them within an
enterprise itself and then lastly it's
not
just about smartphones and tablets we're
starting to see more and more uptake
with respect to getting involved in the
Internet of Things cases with a
connected car where we're working with
enterprises in order to actually get
data off the car bring it into you know
a lot of these car companies they want
to then be able to turn around use that
data provide information back to the
driver of the car via their smartphone
devices smartphone devices caterpillar I
was actually speaking with caterpillar
they are talking about using Android as
the base OS within their with it within
their tractors in order to allow them to
actually get access to standard skills a
standard operating system in order to
actually start to leverage standard
technologies as part of that health care
devices we're working with healthcare
companies and reading things off of
Bluetooth enabled devices sending it up
into the enterprise the customer and
then again using that smartphone devices
the channel to reach back out to the
consumer right and actually report
status and information about the things
that need to get done so all of these
are really driving the need for
enterprises to understand and actually
start thinking about building
applications for these devices
themselves now different customers are
at different levels most of and if you
with an enterprise we're really seeing
two really different audiences that we
actually target one is the line of
business the other is the the CIO office
the the enterprise IT infrastructure and
they're really coming at it from two
different perspectives the line of
business is really about engaging
opportunities right a lot of them start
off with creating outsourcing a
third-party application or an
application to a third-party developer
once that has a little bit of uptake
they start realizing its strategic to
the business you know going back to that
brand trend that we saw it's about
trying to effectively then engage with
the rest of the enterprise strategy so
then they want to bring that in the
house right from an enterprise
development perspective meanwhile this
the the the CIO office right the
enterprise IT is starting to do pilots
all right they start doing pilots for
managing devices just to understand you
know how will I actually keep
track of managing these devices within
the enterprises they move from those
pilots that start thinking about okay
what data is actually on the device
itself what they do I care about as a
company they start to figure out and
realize that there's you know company
information IP information on the
devices themselves they have to start
thinking about how to actually separate
the company information from the
personal information how do i secure
that information as part of it as more
and more applications are actually being
written whether they're for consumer
facing applications or their employee
facing applications companies then go
through a transition of trying to
leverage a mobile application platform
infrastructure whether they bill it
themselves or they actually get it from
a third party to help build the
application develop some standards right
offload some of the burden as I
mentioned I came from the website
organization and part of the reason that
I started looking into this is like
Webster is the basis for much of what we
do within IBM right we wanted to do the
same sort of capability same sort of
technology from a mobility perspective
for what we're doing for IBM and what
we're doing for our customers once you
actually start managing the devices
whether they're bring your own device
aspects of it or understanding how to
secure some of this information then
it's about creating applications
distributing that the applications out
to the employees enabling developers to
basically build apps and actually get
out to the employees and then lastly
it's really about you know treating that
as an integrated part of the enterprise
IT and many customers aren't there yet
most of what we actually see in talking
with companies is really a hodgepodge of
small factions without within the
companies are really driving an adapting
mobility they understand that they want
to actually aggregate some of these
things together to establish that mobile
center of competency but the reality is
mobile is moving so fast the technology
is changing the skill requirements are
changing it's it's really putting a lot
of demand and stress on on enterprises
today so I'm going to give one example
I'm going to try to pepper some of this
talk with some of the examples that we
actually have here here's a case where
latte is a credit card company in South
Korea they've basically seen tremendous
growth within South Korea of of the use
of mobility within within their society
and you know this is an example of
trying to really get creative and be
progressive on trying to figure out how
do I actually leverage the device in
order to actually improve my business
model in this particular case they're
actually leveraging augmented reality is
part of what they were actually building
into the mobile phone applications so as
part of the application that they've
listed they allow you to take the phone
basically point it down the street and
for the credit card companies that or i
should say for the companies that were
participating with their credit cards
they're actually able to highlight
something over the store itself to
basically say that hey they're
participating in some sort of offer and
if you use your latte credit card you'll
actually get a benefit as part of it but
the point is really about trying to be
proactive and progressive with trying to
leverage these devices talking to a
number of banks on very much the same
sort of thing is there's this feeding
frenzy of actually adding new features
new capabilities in order to actually
leverage these devices it's it's really
a a great way to start enabling of the
consumers kind of going forward now the
challenges that we hear from companies
when we have a mobile conversation is
kind of interesting in the the
progression of how the conversation
started I would go in talk a little bit
about what we actually have capability
wise talk a little bit about the the
mobile challenges of more requests
coming into the enterprise talking about
some of the back end things and when we
started having a mobile conversation
with customers the pain points really
all came back to the pain that they're
currently occurring on the client side
right and it's about how do I actually
test applications how do I actually
create applications how do I protect
myself across the changes that are
actually happening on the device itself
so it's all about developing and testing
applications the second one was about
managing those applications managing the
applications
Jim the devices managing the development
of the applications on the devices
themselves what capabilities you know
does this IBM with what capabilities as
I've been suggests from that perspective
securing the applications whether there
are a company facing bde applications
consumer-facing applications how do I
protect the customer data how do I
protect the company data how do i do
single sign-on across the devices
themselves how do i do single sign-on
into my enterprise itself are all pain
points that all of our customers are
actually facing and then last once you
actually have the application
understanding what's happening on the
application right if there's our
problems on the client side of a
application here's a case where you
don't really control that client side of
the application you don't control when a
client actually necessarily upgrades
their OS or for some of those
capabilities so it's really about trying
to understand what are people doing the
device and if there are problems whether
their usability problems or whether
whether they're technical challenges
right how do i actually get that
information off of it and these were the
four categories that we started to then
focus around and try to figure out you
know from an IBM perspective what can we
do to actually help customers in each
one of these spaces now as applications
are being developed you know one of the
biggest things that were seen customer
struggle with is really thinking that
from enterprise developer perspective
the things that they did in the past are
different from mobilities perspective
right a lot of those differences are
technology differences right the the
form factor the screen size is different
the network the amount of data that's
actually coming across the network is
actually constrained from that
perspective the data that's but some of
it is also kind of a not so much a
technical challenge but just the
behavioral challenge right customers
expect people expect the data to be
timely they expect the data to be
available offline they expect the data
to actually be able to be consumed very
much like they're consuming their web
browser but in a way that's simpler than
using a web browser itself right the
consumerization of i teed right all of
the consumer apps that are using today
they're expecting that same sort of
these abuse that same sort of behavior
which is causing customers
or I should say enterprises they have to
rethink their entire experience we think
about for these applications right what
do I actually have to do to enable my
customers it forces them to think about
right fit for purpose applications that
are task specific understanding the
context of what customers want what data
is being made available it right serving
up just that amount of data to deal with
and resolve some of these technical
challenges from a application
development perspective you know there's
a range of spectrum ways to actually
build applications starting from browser
based applications realizing that the
the website actually has to be tailored
for the mobile device so then stripping
it down tailoring for the mobile device
taking advantage of touch taking
advantage of geolocation leveraging the
offline caches in html5 but then that's
not enough right so customers then start
to write native applications native
applications are taking advantage of the
device characteristics the device
features and then there's the case in
the middle of hybrid applications about
leveraging web-based technologies but
but using them as native applications
they actually physically get on the
device still taking advantage of native
applications and this is where certainly
we think the industry is actually headed
it's why we participated in Apache
Cordova which was driving improving out
an implementation of the device access
specification html5 right but it started
off at trying to prove that we can
actually drive the technologies into the
web browser standards but you know what
we've effectively enabled via an open
community is a way to actually leverage
web technologies and then mix and match
between native capabilities and web
capabilities therefore there by
utilizing some of the skills that we
actually have within the enterprise
today and all approaches are actually
valid right for writing some of these
applications in the case of a native
application you know what we're starting
to see that each one of the devices
actually create their own set of walled
gardens right where each one actually
has a separate proprietary language in
order to actually rights to a separate
development tool a separate way to
actually deliver it
within an app store itself and even the
App Store has its own unique processes
with which in order to actually submit
an application that are getting tougher
and tougher so so customers are actually
looking for challenges in how to
actually write applications and again
there's not really right one right or
wrong answer for some of this set of
stuff so I'm going to give a couple of
customer examples just to kind of
showcase a little bit about you know
what we're actually seeing IBM our GBS
brethren with an IBM actually takes
supports building mobile applications
there's also a branch of it called IBM
interactive which talks about building
rich interactions from a design
perspective with customers themselves
well our IBM and GBS interactive and GBS
teams actually build our us open our
Wimbledon apps that we actually support
within the enterprise today in you know
this is a native app and if you think
about the amount of access that these
acts apps actually have right there's
over 100 million web page views that are
actually done to these sorts of
applications but the applications
basically inform the consumer about
current scores consumers can actually
track individual players the players can
actually get real-time notifications and
feedback what's actually going on
there's 50 reviews for when you're
actually at the US Open you can actually
see what some of the courts are see
where some of the venue activities our
but the point here is that you know it's
a very reached rich deep interaction in
this particular case it makes sense to
build some of these applications as
native applications now compare and
contrast that's to a company called the
roads roads and in shorts this is a
company that does electromagnetic test
and measurement devices that they
manufacture and they wanted a way to
actually reach out to their employees to
their business partners their customers
right a way to leverage mobile devices
and for them they had seagulls of web
technologies they wanted to leverage
some of the information on the device
they wanted to sync sales data sales
information collateral etc to these
mobile applications themselves but for
them it was
more efficient in order to actually to
write these as hybrid applications to
leverage some of the device specific
features but but leverage the the web
skills that they actually had within the
company as a way to deal with some of
the cross-platform support so you know
there's not really one right way that
one wrong way but certainly these are
some of the right reasons why to
actually choose the native approach and
we have this even within IBM today in
IBM we ourselves produce a set of
applications some of those applications
are native applications things like our
same time for instant messaging that we
actually have Lotus connections they
were all developed as rich interactions
that we're actually developing we also
have hybrid applications that we have
built with an IBM that we're actually
using internally ourselves in order to
get back cross-platform device
perspective from a native approach it's
a you know one of the key factors is
leveraging existing skills right now if
you can keep the skills sir and you're
really focusing on one platform
certainly you know choosing a native
approach is there ought to take it cases
where you actually have rich you I
requirements you know you more and more
your applications actually going to get
native what as we're starting to work
with some of our customers we're
certainly promoting a hybrid approach
where you can actually choose how much
native and how much web that you
actually want to approach in the hybrid
approach it's really the best of both
worlds and what we're starting to see is
a lot of the enterprises that we deal
with have plenty of web skills so by
creating effectively web applications
that run on the client side that run
offline that can leverage the native
device capabilities many of them are
actually having great success starting
out by writing an application leveraging
web skills and and that when and only
Nessa when necessary drop down in native
mode this is very true for a number of
the different industries that we're
actually dealing with so you know one of
the examples here is financial companies
many of the financial companies that we
are doing are actually cross deal they
have branches across in multiple states
they have branch the branches in
multiple countries right trying to take
in
eight native applications right for some
of the customers that we're talking
about they actually have two hundred
apps that they're actually supporting
well there's no way that they can
actually manage and deal with the two
hundred apps why two hundred apps while
each one of these countries each one of
these states had different rules and
regulations they need to be tweaked they
need to be modified you know a hybrid
approach is what we start are starting
to see more and more for some of the
financial companies we're also starting
to see it from some of the healthcare
companies again due to those rules and
regulations now that you have an
application what's the next challenge
that is typically in that space and it's
really about to test and this is what
this is effectively the biggest
challenge that we see customers actually
having right because it's about dealing
with the landslide of different devices
that are actually coming different
screen sizes different form factors
different power requirements different
levels of the OS that are actually on
their cases like iOS you could
effectively upgrade the OS cases like
Android pretty much whatever was built
into the OS when that device was
released is effectively what's actually
there and because devices are typically
only refreshed by consumers every two
years there's a wide range of devices
that companies actually have to develop
and actually test with let alone testing
about the various capabilities and then
the third part is really about the
different considerations with respect to
network connections etc dealing with
performance of the app right the network
challenges right to the app itself and
then lastly making sure that the
experience on the device actually was
what the company had actually intended
and developed is critical good enough is
sometimes sufficient so this is an
example of one of the financial
companies that were actually dealing
with built a mobile application it's a
banking application that they actually
built they released the banking
application and in-house across the 10
devices that they actually tested with
it everything was actually fine but 11
there was one case where the problem
ended up being that as they for cases
where a customer
an early version of their app they
upgraded it from one version to the from
one implementation to another
implementation iOS didn't clean up the
device correctly and it actually had a
problem now in most cases you would
think that well that's a corner case
right we handled the majority of the
apps but the problem is right if you
expand these things out to millions of
customers that you're actually
supporting rights two percent of a big
number is still a big number right if
you have a three million five million
ten million customers right a two
percent problem is still a huge problem
for a large segment of your customers
that that for that segment the customers
that's going to be a huge pain point
there for coming up with solutions in
order to actually help with testing is
some of what our customers are actually
looking for and these are effectively
the strategies that enterprises deal
with nor it actually helped test for
mobile applications much of the testing
is actually done is manual testing there
was a company that i was talking to that
for all of the new hires that would
actually come in they would take it
through a 300 step playbook for testing
all of the 300 features on the of their
application itself and that was part of
a what they did for manual testing and
be how they actually were able to
educate the new employees into the
company to equities understand what the
company capabilities are as you start
manual testing some of the things that
you're going to have to figure out is
how do i how do I virtualize my services
we need how do I actually get into a
case where I can actually start to stub
out new services as I add new features
or if I want to get into the case of
automated regression test how do I
actually stub off services so i can
actually start running the client tests
in such a way that i don't actually have
to put bandwidth and deal with the
backend issues as part of that security
testing how do i actually test for
security challenges security problems a
hacks from that perspective is another
set of tests that have to be done once
you actually have the app written it's
really about getting then access to
devices so it's about and there's a
number of different approaches that
companies use most companies that we
in fact in IBM we have parts of our
organization that go out and they
actually buy ten of the most popular
devices this isn't that different than
how customers dealt with the various
browsers that they actually had in the
past with respect to ie Firefox Safari
google chrome etc the difference here is
though the behaviors are different not
just on every one of these devices but
every iteration of these devices as well
as the the network conditions are
actually difference which gets into
things like performance testing right so
it's not just performance testing that
interfaces in the API is coming into the
backend system but it's performance
testing from the client side through the
network conditions themselves it's
performance testing and the devices in
understanding what are the behavior
characteristics the power requirements
right for leveraging the components on
the client side of icing themselves and
then lastly mobile UI automation we're
making significant progress in trying to
actually create automated test suites
for some of these applications so for
example some of the device access clouds
do character recognition and have farms
of these devices that are actually
hooked up so once you've gone through
and you've built your tests you know a
common practice that we start seeing
companies do is effectively upload the
application to these device clouds and
then use the device clouds as a way to
automate some of the tests across the
devices themselves a very costly uh you
know but it's certainly an approach that
we see many companies doing as part of
that okay so now that you've built an
app you've tested the app the next sort
of thing the company's face is really
dealing with DevOps for mobile you know
mobile apps themselves as we try to
simplify the things down it's really
masking a lot of complexity that's in
the back end enterprise itself again
I'll give you a little example for some
of this again another financial company
that we're working with right now
actually built a mobile application the
mobile application manages access to its
credit card company that mobile that
company went through and acquired a
couple of other companies so then they
got in
commercial banking they got into wolf
management aspects of it so now they're
but they didn't want to create three
applications it was part of that brand
construct for an enterprise itself so
they started then you know refactoring
the application and figuring out how do
i structure my organization to deal with
three different lines of businesses
built into one application but they
wanted to have that consistent brand how
do I deal with the technology of doing
single sign-on two to three different
parts of my business right and actually
give kind of a one company view as part
of that application very very difficult
but in many cases these mobile
applications are becoming again the face
to some of these back-end systems itself
some of the deployments are also
different from the standpoint of it's
now not just releasing the server side
of the application it's released in the
client side of the application it's
fighting through the App Store processes
to get the application submitted to get
it approved to make the upgrades to the
back end system at the same time that
you're making the upgrades to the front
end system dealing with the different
versions between the front end systems
and the back end systems as some of your
customers don't actually upgrade some of
the versions so building in some of that
version control capabilities or the
disablement capabilities for some of the
older devices to have them rights
download new versions of the application
all of these are considerations that you
that enterprises have to start thinking
about when they when they build the
mobile apps themselves just to give you
an example of some of the time frame for
for some of the dead ops aspects for
mobile as I said IBM already builds a
number of different mobile applications
today within their portfolio same time
connections just our Lotus portfolio
sell five different applications across
four different platforms last year they
released the 60-plus releases throughout
the year in order to actually provide
updates the customers now some of those
releases were due to changes in the OS
somewhere new features and
functionalities that once they get the
app out the door it had they got
feedback that things need to be improved
things needed to be changed but once you
actually have an app out there it then
becomes a mechanism for come for
customers to start basic
wanting more and more from that
perspective these are you make something
become the more people are going to use
it the more demand you're going to
actually have four new changes actually
drive unit so again it's a factor that
companies have to start thinking that
through right as they develop their
mobility strategy mobile security
challenges now most of the challenges
that we see in this space they exist for
both BD and be this a b2c a good portion
exist in the bde space that are
specialized to the bde space so with
bring your own device companies are
struggling with trying to figure out how
do they make the behavior on the device
such that the burden for employee facing
devices doesn't impact the burden for
the consumer facing devices right and
there's different technologies and
capabilities for that how do i separate
out the data how do i prevent a data
leakage out of my application into the
enterprise itself how do i provide
secure access into the enterprise from
outside the enterprise itself for many
of these applications what are the
policies that i want to enable for
people to actually use the device are
all things that actually have to be
built in how to develop secure
applications how do i actually and when
do i actually build throughout the light
the application lifecycle understanding
the challenges that our enterprises are
actually going to face from a security
perspective and then lastly how do i
actually forget about technology for a
second right a lot of the impact that
we're starting to see enterprises
actually have aren't just by basically
providing some of the tools and
techniques but also establishing the
right policies so for example within IBM
when we started rolling out pilot
programs for people using their own
devices some of those pilot programs
basically started had gotten rolled in
to leverage genes for some of the mobile
device management capabilities and there
we started to seeing what what do
applicate what applications do people
even have on their devices and do i
actually cure whether those applications
are on those devices themselves now for
some of the applications we noticed that
they had things they were using apps
like good reader and Dropbox
well good reader and Dropbox are a
couple of different applications for
being able to sync content offline into
a little facility in order to actually
make it easy to view it on a mobile
device it themselves so some of the work
was really just establishing the right
policies right engineering the right
reports right such that we can at least
inform consumers you know how to be
compliant within the company itself so
it's not all about technology it's
really about right a holistic model for
for security why you know do we think
that the security is a key important
factor well you know more and more
starting to see people use smartphones
in work itself right what the
Millennials coming into the workforce I
think I read somewhere that fifty
percent of work force is going to be run
by the Millennials in the next couple of
years so and these are these are people
these are employees that are future
employees that are just used to doing
everything off their mobile phone and
their mobile devices themselves and now
that these mobile devices are actually
there they're certainly more appealing
to hackers right it is a huge concern
for further prizes themselves now
there's different strategies for dealing
with these sort of effects from a
consumer facing sort of aspect of it a
number of different strategies there are
application level containers being able
to effectively put and build the
application in such a way that you can
actually you know capture all file
access controls encrypt all the data
from a file access perspective introduce
API is as part of that application
management capabilities that you can
compile until the application so you can
actually control policies and access
such that you're not dependent on a
mobile device management solutions which
tend to be the traditional bde sort of
capability so IBM has certain you know
capabilities for each one of these
things but they're all you know valid
approaches for dealing with security
within an enterprise today
okay so now that you actually have an
application it's sitting on a device the
next set of challenges that you're going
to face is how do you optimize it for
mobile now in most cases optimize it
really was meant to be analyzing
performance how do I actually get the
next turn of the crank how do I actually
improve the performance for some of
these things but mobile isn't just about
performance and optimization it's really
about that customer experience right
about getting that usage model there
right from a retail perspective we're
starting to see that the majority or i
should say more and more customers are
basically only coming into the
enterprise or only coming in to use the
capabilities through a mobile device
itself lasts a couple years ago with
single digits of mobile devices
accessing a lot of the consumer places
now with smartphones and tablets rights
twenty percent of the engagement is
actually coming from the smartphone
devices so it's really about how do I
actually understand the experience that
a customer is actually happening on
these devices the experience in many
cases is actually publicly to eat out
there right so if your mobile website if
your mobile application isn't good
enough you're going to start seeing
right through social media mechanisms
right a bashing of your mobile
application your mobile website from
those perspectives so companies are now
starting to actually have to really
check about brand identity and be
careful that you know as they introduce
new channels out there or as new
channels become popular like I said a
more and more coming in for mobile web
paying attention to what's actually
going on those channels becomes
important becomes relevant another
channel that people forget is that you
know when you distribute a mobile app
you distribute within an app store
itself now that that app store is there
it's a great mechanism to provide
feedback of mobile applications from
from end consumers so it was kind of
interesting a couple of customers that
we were working on first mobile
application that they released they put
in the app store right they were getting
two stars right that's like why am I
actually getting two stars right they
again because it's part of their brand
recognition right there's a lot of
high-level executives that are now going
to put pressure on companies to
basically start understanding how do I
actually improve this experience so
going back to that insight of how do i
optimize for the experience right it's
going to be a key critical thing for
some of the customers that we're dealing
with one customer that I'm thinking in
particular right when they did an
analysis they were actually getting
about a two-star rating for their
further application when they did
analysis really one quarter of the of
the problems where a problem with the
actual application itself one half of
the problems where the fact of their
application didn't have features that
their customer actually had right and
then the other the other quarter just
didn't improve didn't like right the
flow through the application they had to
drive through too many screens but the
point was right that it wasn't just
about a technical challenge with the
application itself it's all about a
notion of what is the experience what is
the expected behavior and actually
getting information and feedback from
customers on what they expect and then
being able to quickly react to those
expectations right a whole new set of
challenges that enterprises have to deal
with okay so that said hopefully that
gives you a quick flavor for the types
of challenges that that we see our
customer struggling with the sort of
approaches that they're actually dealing
with now let me kind of give you a
little insight into kind of what we're
actually doing to help customers in this
space starting early last year we ended
up aggressively pursuing filling in gaps
into this portfolio I started three
years ago my task three years ago was
basically take technology from wherever
we had it within IBM whether it was
research whether it was in a different
brand and start pulling it into an
application platform that's we then
acquired work lights work light was a
company that was specialized in an
hybrid development they actually started
off as a mobile web web company we
combined it kind of going forward as and
and use that as our platform for mobile
application development we released a
product IBM endpoint management in order
to actually do
mobile device management going forward
we acquired a company called tea leaf
tea leaf is used for customer experience
analytics they have a mobile set of
capabilities as part of that managed
services for outsourcing I am for
context based access into the company
right so trying to leverage things like
geolocation understanding where
customers are right before you they
access the company is again another sort
of risk-based access that we wanted to
add into the portfolio we acquired
urbancode this year to actually help
fill out our our DevOps our mobile
DevOps portfolio as part of that
recently a couple months ago we acquired
a company called Trusteer about using
Trusteer to actually deal with secure
transactions into the enterprise itself
trust there made a name for themselves
and it's used by a number of different
financial companies in order to protect
and detect against malware and theft
within client-side devices client-side
browsers from that perspective so we're
pretty aggressive at filling out our
portfolio earlier this year we came up
with a mobile first brand to know what
we're doing with an IBM holistically
around mobile and how we're really
treating it generically as nuts as
separate siloed brands but we're viewing
mobility right spanning all of what
we're actually doing with an IBM the
four problem areas that you heard about
application development management
security and test really are the four
key factors that were you know are the
pain points that customers are actually
facing in which is what's driving us to
do capabilities from that perspective
we're building GTS and GBS are our
managed service offerings our
application development services
strategy consulting etc all around
understanding these pain points and
actually coming out with solutions we're
working with SSG and part are our
solutions group and partners to then
come up with assets that are specific to
banking to retail to insurance right all
as trying to improve time to market and
being able to speak to the to context
again that's one of the key things about
mobile automobility it's really about
being able to speak in context with your
own consumers
and again this gives you an example of
how we're trying to speak in context to
our customers looking to to acquire
capabilities and partner with us to
actually develop some of these sorts of
things as I said we were we acquired
work like we started taking capabilities
from throughout IBM as an example
earlier this year Gartner named us as
the leader in the Magic Quadrant IBM is
the one in the upper right hand side
right for coming out with our mobile
application development platform a lot
of that came out of what we did to
combine what we were building
organically within IBM as well as the
worklight acquisition that we did at the
beginning of last year work light itself
has a development studio the development
studio has a range of capabilities to
help you with help customers with native
hybrid and mobile web developing
encoding as part of that part of what
we've done in that with that design
studio is integrate within the mobile
SDKs themselves so integrating with
Xcode integrated with android on whether
it's IntelliJ or eclipse integration
with blackberry with windows and
microsoft visual studio as well as j2me
devices what we wanted to do is provide
a single platform for which customers
can develop these applications but then
also make it very easy to spawn off into
the other sort of application platforms
if they wanted to basically build and
extend from a native development
perspective part of work light also has
something called an applications thinner
the way to think of it as an app store
for developers one of the pain points
that we started seeing is that when
customers when we were building apps
internally as sample applications we
needed a way to effectively distribute
the applications amongst our employees
so the App Center became a way for us to
be able to distribute versions of those
applications as a developer because this
is a task that we wanted to do it to
enable development right in order to
actually get feedback from other
developers and other stakeholders right
about the actual application itself to
be able to go back and forth between
versions of the applications that's all
part of that work light application
center
assets to deal with single sign end to
deal with security to deal with push
notifications there's a whole set of
capabilities that we actually built in
as the Vice runtime capabilities that
for native applications came out as a
set of frameworks and headers ritenour
it actually helped build an augment
native applications and for hybrid
applications came out as Cordova plugins
that allow javascript developers working
with mobile in mobile web or i said i
should say web technologies leveraged
native capabilities on the device itself
these client-side the vice runtime sort
of capabilities worked well with the
server-side server aspects of it so
again being able to build an application
that management building security
integration building geolocation right
data sync between the two devices are
all key parts of what we actually built
in and then an Operations council
wrapped around the whole sort of thing
the other sort of thing that we've been
working on is integrating more that the
set of capabilities from what we had in
IBM into that sort of application
platform so as an example that mobile
test pain point that we actually hit and
found what a lot of our customers were
dealing with is basically running and
using these devices clouds that were
actually out on the Internet itself
keynote and device our keynote device
anywhere and perfecto mobile are two of
the larger ones from that perspective we
built an integration into some of our
rational portfolio however those mobile
tests capabilities actually the way they
typically worked with were with
character recognition they would take
basically take an application deployed
on a device access cloud deploy it that
say hundreds of devices and then they
would use character recognition to be
able to script going from screen to
screen and in recording the output of
some of those screens as a way to
actually drive and automate some of the
screens but but these became a little
bit error prone due to the the changing
across devices the sharing of scripts
and you know when you made changes
through the application due to actually
have to change all of those character
recognition scripts
another route to take is that we started
working with our research folks and
capturing object identifiers and the
actual object interactions that took
place underneath the application itself
this year we introduced a set of
capabilities called the the automated
mobile app function testing and those
capabilities actually ship this part of
our rational test workbench offering as
well as they ship for this mobile test
workbench for work light so that
worklight studio that we actually have
which is our application development
platform ships with the same plugins to
allow developers to effectively record
native and hybrid applications for
Android and iOS the events once you've
recorded them they've effectively
surfaced them up as a set of scripts you
can modify the script to check for
validation points verification points
you know build a very rich set of
scripts and then be able to replay those
things back so as a developer right
being able to record a set of scripts
play those scripts back you know we
built that directly into the development
tool itself it's part of what we wanted
to do to help solve that problem work
late itself and the mobile tests were
workbench for work light is available
for free within eclipse within the
Eclipse marketplace so we wanted to get
it out there in the hands of developers
get it you's get feedback there you know
proof for itself that the capabilities
are actually there to actually help
accelerate development a developer so
companies can actually go download play
with this today in judge for themselves
on the value that we actually bring as
part of this part of getting started
guides for each one of these are also
freely available so one of the things
that we noticed about working when we
acquired work light is they didn't have
a services organization they did
everything as a small company by the
effectively creating a set of starter
collateral to describe a concept and
then have a set of training modules they
actually test right and validate right
as well as let customers run out of the
box proof points of how to actually do
that little training module is part of
that so there's about 60 Plus training
modules right for helping accelerate
customers getting started with
with mobile development as part of that
about two-thirds of them actually have
exercises and codes code that's
available out of the box there's a
training module for the functional
testing capabilities also so again it's
one of the ways we actually try to make
things nice and simple for our customers
there's also form support that we also
support for free that's also there again
as a way of enabling developers kind of
going forward other capabilities that
we've built in is part of I iBM has been
doing static and dynamic code analysis
right checking for security threats for
a while apps can source is another
offering that we came out with last year
actually while we came out with the
android version last year we came up
with the iOS version this year about
scanning for threats and vulnerabilities
from a mobile application perspective
for applications so in addition to
JavaScript that we standing that we
actually use for hybrid applications we
now can scan full Java full of
objective-c right looking for threats
and in cases where information is
actually being stored on the device
itself right in order to actually help
customers understand what are the
threats what are the secure exposures
that they're going to actually have as
they develop some of these applications
last point I'm going to make and again I
I think I touched upon this a little bit
earlier in the presentation but we did
acquire a company called tea leaf tea
leaf started off as a web analytics
company to basically capture network
traffic in order to make it simple and
easy for blind a business guy to
understand how users were using their
application itself they've extended that
capability outs to the mobile device so
for mobile web capabilities they also
still allow that same sort of capture
and replay of session information such
that they can at least start to
highlight what users are doing on their
devices they can replay back some of
those experiences they surface it up on
a dashboard to align the business allow
the line of business to effectively
delvin find out information about what's
actually happening for me and part of
what they've added in for some of the
mobile web Cape cases our heat maps link
analytics forum analytics right all
built in on the box ready to go as
third-party modules for a case of native
apps part of what they do is very
similar to what we did for the rational
test workbench for the functional test
capabilities we are capturing events and
information of what's happening on the
on the client side itself some of the
events could be crashes and crash log
information some of the events are
object events that are actually getting
passed back and forth there's an sdk
that gets provided to the developer to
actually set up different log levels for
event captures part of the SDK includes
API is to do encryption filtering of
some of the information so when you're
capturing some of the analytic
information if you want to secure it
hide it mask it whatever the
capabilities exist and then built into
there are also some capabilities to
effectively buffer the information up
you know the last thing you want to do
is be sending analytic information at
the same time you're trying to download
data you know which is effectively going
to ultimately affect the user experience
so part of what they've done is they've
actually kept some of the information
and they look at information like the
connectivity into the enterprise whether
you're connected on Wi-Fi or not they
buffer some of the data such that they
minimize right when they're actually
sending some of that information to the
backend systems but again out of a box
it gives you a set of capabilities that
we've built into our portfolio and some
of the Tea Leaf libraries themselves we
built into were quite right as kind of
pre enablement for some of this as a way
to help customers in fact that's one of
the things that we're actually using for
some of the crash log capabilities that
we actually have is part of work light
so it's an example of you know with an
IBM what we're trying to do is you know
break down the barriers of what we
actually had for brands and focus on
what are the things that matter for our
customers where are things that are
matter for application developers and
that's take all of the capabilities that
we actually have and put them in a form
factor that's
all pre-integrated in necessary and
sufficient for the things that we
actually want to do anyway that's
effectively what I wanted to just kind
of get a little high level overview of
what some of the capabilities that we
have for our customers what we're
hearing from customers that said are
there any questions on what I've
presented or talked about yeah so so the
only thing we could do is effectively
alter some of the timings for the
transitions right at the end of the day
that's why manual user testing is really
half the experience part of what we're
actually doing with some of the
partnership relationships that we
actually have another approach we see
customers are doing our outsourcing that
or crowd sourcing the testing aspects of
it right in order to actually leverage
the manual testing so they can actually
see the transitions crowdsourcing it
such that you know you can now start
putting people in the various geos
around the world to experience the
performance testing there's really no
easy ways that you can actually capture
some of that but with respect to some of
the device capabilities well actually no
there really is no easy way to test it
other than what you're saying so three
point
I've downloaded work light and get the
SDK also just use Eclipse with Kane
phone again just trying to see between
studio and between phonegap and clips
yep yep well IBM right is half
contributor2 phonegap itself it's easy
it's easy a point to things out a chart
than is the as I'm actually talking
about it so so work light itself has
built it into it the Liberty runtime
it's are lightweight Java Runtime server
that we actually have that's what we're
effectively hosting the work like to run
so from a studio perspective you're
actually getting an implementation of
the work light server as part of it
built-in built into this set of Eclipse
plugin so point number one point number
two is that a functional testing
capability that I just talked about with
respect to the mobile test workbench for
work lights the the same plugins that
rational test workbench works are one of
the additional features that we actually
plug into work light is part of that the
second is part of what we were trying to
do is make it as simple as possible for
the non experienced web developer to be
able to create simple applications so
one of the sorts of applications that we
started seeing companies produces these
little fit-for-purpose applications many
enterprise developers right aren't
skilled in client side front end
expertise so part of what we built into
studio is a set of WYSIWYG editors we
initially built on dojo last year
earlier this year we basically came out
with the jQuery implementation for which
we came out with about 40 different
screen patterns for handling logon
navigation capabilities that we've
actually built in as part of the WYSIWYG
drag and drop support aspect as part of
that phonegap really gives you access to
or ice to a phonegap Apache Cordova at
the same thing phonegap Apache Cordova
basically gives you access to device
specific features and capabilities part
of what we built into the cross device
runtime is
is a client-side libraries for an
encrypted JSON store basically we
encrypt SQL Lite under the covers and we
shred a JSON document to allow you have
an ability to actually capture the
information on the client side phonegap
stores things in the HTML persistence
store what we effectively do is we're
storing things with an SQLite itself
part of what we built in as part of that
device runtime support is again
integration into the back and security
model of that work light server so again
you don't you don't necessarily get that
with just phonegap aspect of it there's
a cross-platform compatibility layer and
an optimization framework that's
actually built in so a lot of the secret
sauce of of of doing cross platform
within work light is in the structure
that we laid out the project so for
example there's a common directory that
all common artifacts go into the common
directory and then for every environment
that you build in whether it's an iOS an
Android Microsoft the blackberry a j2me
environment we effectively override or
have a way to merge or override some of
the artifacts so for the case of CSS we
append all of the CSS things itself for
the case of JavaScript we merge the
JavaScript artifacts on top of it and we
compress that minimize it down right and
serve that set of stuff up so those are
cases where when you build updated
versions of some of those those sorts of
things you don't get that out of the box
with what you would actually have an in
phonegap you would have to build it
yourself the last aspect of it is again
for push notifications or for updating
some of these these aspects of it part
of what we've built into this is an
application management framework such
that you can update some of the hybrid
resources and then part of what you can
build into the application that is the
check for updates and then download
those updates as a zip file check the
security of the zip file that it hasn't
been tampered with compromised unzip the
resources and effectively go on and move
forward so again you know those are all
things that are effectively built into
us work light in studio combine the
development any other
we don't see much adoption because there
are practical limitations to that right
in fact apple recently recently like 6-8
months ago said that they can feel free
to throw out any of that information at
any point in time that's one of the
reasons that drove us to drive the json
stores as part of that sort of thing now
for some cases where you want to build
mobile web capabilities and start
leveraging some of that from an offline
perspective we do see some adoption but
right for any sort of serious apps right
everybody wants to effectively put their
information on some sort of physical
client-side store that actually has a
managed government governed lifecycle
associated with it and a lot of the data
that we see going in there is actually
secure information privacy information
you know from a consumer perspective as
well as the whole enterprise set of
stuff so you know once you're in for a
penny you're in for a pound right it's
you know once you have the capabilities
they're in it and they're simple you use
it's easier to just use it at all points
in time any other questions all right
thank you very much for attending and I
guess fill out your session evaluation
