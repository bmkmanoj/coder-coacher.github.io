I'm your host Javed Mohammed here at
Auto Coco Sydney and I have as my guest
today attic settler who is the VP of and
VP and the director of technology for
oracle labs Eric welcome thank you for
coming first time in Sydney are you've
been here before
oh no research lab in Brisbane
oh ok ok all right all right so it's my
first time to meet you and probably for
some of the audience here I was just
looking at your bio and you've got quite
a stellar background and good luck with
the obviously you come from a research
background 68 patents so some of us we
don't even have one pattern to a name
what what's the seems just out of
curiosity what's a secret of innovation
well Oracle lab I think one of the
things that makes us really effective is
that we do a lot of our work in
conjunction with the academic community
and so bringing some the ideas that come
out of the universities along with the
things that are driving customers nuts
you kind of put those things together
and a lot of those ideas come together
then you smash together and great ideas
happen okay you make it sound so simple
all right so you have a presentation
today you want to talk to us a little
bit about that work yeah so what I'm
going to be talking about is for all VM
which is a research project and
hopefully seen a product that we've been
working on for about six years almost
now in the Orca lab and what it is is
it's something that runs things that
runs languages so today most people in
our running node they run a separate
runtime nodejs for JavaScript
server-side applications you want to run
Python it's another runtime you want to
run Java or the Java languages like
Scala another one time for that Ruby are
all the different languages have
different runtimes and they kind of are
operating in different boxes and if you
want to move data back and forth
in those boxes Eric Rowan is hard to
vlog expensive and it's hard to stay
within one language and we finding is
that more and more languages keep
getting created and it makes life more
difficult for people that are trying to
deploy that and DevOps
like Odile management all these runtimes
and each of them how I know how much
memory to allocate each of those
runtimes how much work boat is going to
be given each of those runtimes if you
have it all running in the same engine
so you're sharing the language runtime
components the compiler the libraries
all those sorts of things that's
actually where a lot of the overheads go
and so we've done some benchmarks
briefly showing that you can fit about
eight times as many containers in a
single VM if the VM to run all the
languages and some people the
applications isolated properly it's a
really great opportunity to make a
DevOps from faster but more importantly
and I think the most important thing is
developer productivity it seems that
it's something that was very hard to
measure we don't know how to like say
hey this environment is twice as
productive in the polar environment but
having a choice of language and being
able to pull down open source packages
that have already done what you want and
pulling in every other application
throughout your enterprise run a min a
database name outside the database
whichever database you want
Robbie M is embeddable before you go in
so I have a bidding question so is this
what's normally the fit to as a polyglot
invariants with the polyglot environment
right but it's polyglot with all running
in the same engine okay so when people
talk about polyglot they often meanwhile
their cloud can run different languages
but it's really helped the developers
interact as a bug across all those
languages at runtime so this is really
write once run anywhere that we're
trying to deploy here with the pravinia
good so you mentioned that the mobile is
still kind of a research project going
to be product ID you want to give any
kind of a time frame and we can expect
to see doesn't some announcements in the
next few months about reviewing with LVM
we're going to have an open source
release we're also going to be embedding
it and
some Oracle product the beta based
products and things like that may want
to run something besides appeal sequel
or equal engine to run stored procedures
on run surface because JavaScript where
are things like that will be able to
show you how to do that I'm going to
demonstrate that today I'm going to run
some JavaScript or procedures that I
download from in am run em in the
database as part of her experience so
you mentioned that it it can actually
help in the case of a devops pipeline is
that because it's in different stages of
the consider the integration deployment
parts of the pipeline's you may be using
different languages C so you want to
just elaborate language enough for
example if you want to be data science
and analyze and use machine learning or
statistical analysis we use a language
often like our Python of the most
popular languages for doing those they
have a rich library and ecosystem for
that if you want to go right back in or
harden business logic you can simply
write that in something like Java or C++
if I'm doing a web front-end I'm
probably going to do it in something
like Ruby or no that's a yes and so then
I want to have data that's moving across
all those different engines for those
different have three easy particulars
pink I have to duplicate the data so it
means I have more memory that's being
allocated and what you find is if you
can share the runtime behind all of them
you don't need to duplicate all the data
you can debug it all in one place and
it's easy to manage right so it's going
to make it a lot more efficient and
faster to figure out there's more hand
how much memory I'm going to give to the
Java VM how much I'm going to give to
the JavaScript VM how much I'm going to
give to each of the different games that
I have in code and that makes it harder
to figure out how much to pack how many
containers I can pack into a server and
and how do i watch the data going
through all of them let's say if I want
to look for security issues I want it to
tainted data that's not been sanitized
flowing into trusted code it's nice if I
can walk watch the data go in from the
end user into the trust
because it maybe is operating with
elevated privileges as accessing
database data files or otherwise acting
in kind of a superuser way we can see it
all walking through the engine and
that's one of the nice things about
having a single place to wash it off
well it sounds very exciting and I guess
with both of us mmm and ourselves are
going to look forward to some
interesting and announcements and your
presentation today's what time 3:05 p.m.
3:05 p.m. all right okay excellent so I
started off with innovation like to kind
of go back to innovation so you know
some people say I'm not creative I I can
what do you do do you think everyone can
be innovative and if so you have any
suggestions of what people can do to
actually be more innovative well it's
the first thing to do I think is to look
outside of the box the rest that you're
used to being in and looking away other
people do things in different languages
different kinds of applicator academic
environment you know we learn a lot
database people learn from programming
language people they learn a lot from
the security people and you talk to
people outside your field often the idea
is you know that before using in
different fields you know it can be
reused and maybe a different way in your
own field so what I encourage people to
do is is to talk to people that aren't
just in the same just to linear in but
looking across cross functionally and
each of the different academic or
industrial domains that you're working
in it's a problem all across we kind of
stay in our so quite a lot of good ideas
that come from getting out of that sort
of fight yeah I don't I don't know if
I've gone across far as what using but I
love talking to different cab drivers I
was live so much alright thank you so
much for coming by and for sharing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
