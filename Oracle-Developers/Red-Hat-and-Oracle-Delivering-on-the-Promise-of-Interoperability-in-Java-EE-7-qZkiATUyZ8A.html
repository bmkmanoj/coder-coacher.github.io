day and that means I de at Oracle I max
Harrison rahat our quarry on the tivo
service to do set of Clips tools and
distribution of Eclipse Abraham and
basically what we are going to do is
show you what the experience of
interoperability between both TD run
times the server side that Oracle and
Bradford had provided namely jboss and
glass fish and also i'll fly right now
Vidya one far as well as the tools
namely eclipse-based chicos tools and
that means yeah okay this is the
standard Oracle safe harbor statement
okay okay so first we'll look at what
for was in past then we'll explore the
improvements in july six and most
important of java 7 and look at a
practical example of tables and
glassfish interpret the interoperability
so how many people remember this and
have four with this before so these are
the server specific deployment
descriptor service pacific and scripts
server specific cmp ejb two dot one
mapping file and so on so fortunately
these times are over you know now we
have moved on and can the good news is
that the the story so much personality
was several years ago so that's what we
are going to talk about and the good
news that week you can basically forget
now about all these sent terrible
external files
so let's say let's start with looking at
one one aspect that has made the
interval T much better on the
development tool site so basically
basically if we want your projects to be
shareable across several IDEs and if you
want to work in a team where everyone
uses a different ide for example a good
advice is to use mailing these days so
basically maven unifies dependency
management there is a java ee 7 api's
that you can get from Maidan central
that works across any servers that
support the e7 and it's 11 very
important thing about that is that
before I lost your weighted heavily w7
but javi 695 also had their artifacts in
maven central but you can only use them
to compile this if you ran a test or
something it will blow up because those
some lawyer who got involved and said
you can't deliver the implementation you
cannot even deliver the signatures to
API all right so it's great to compile
against we couldn't run your unit test
so therefore it was useless so J Maas we
had to do you have to do our own
distribution of it but now there's
actually a full of Java 7 is there which
is terrorized Sarah it's great it's not
broken anymore only six silver garrison
and stuff the e7 is not broken yes so
you are saying that in the 47 jboss will
not publish their own artifacts I think
we still have to because but but the
basic API and sort of stuff is better
done I'm not sure how much it's this is
fairly new but we go sauna stop utilized
in memorial ok
so you know to illustrate the point
about maven basically this is a project
that that's open in the NetBeans IDE so
let me just minify this and this was
originally developed for by jboss you
know by DJ was team it was to develop
against jboss and basically only only
for with jboss ID table stools initially
and how i brought it into that deals
with basically through this file open
project when you open a project you can
just point to any maven project which
directory that contains a poem XML file
and you just say open and that's all you
have to do so there is no project import
nothing like that you can very easily
bring over an existing maven project
into the nav insid by just opening it
and the ID basically figures out what's
in your form XML finds out all the
dependencies what are the sources and
tests and you know all these things and
basically analyzes the project structure
the device would expect without you
needing to do any specific import steps
or specify any specific metadata or
nothing like that so that's that's kind
of the first type of interoperability
between the ides yes
quick starts from the Red Hat work yes
except Oracle yes yes yes so yeah so
let's let's talk about those a little
bit so basically this is a web page
which contains many quick starts big
star term examples for various Hawaii
technologies provide provided by redhead
just right now it's a v6 that side yes
yeah v6 specification we should point it
up next here are the Java is seven
samples by by the GlassFish team namely
our group today the GlassFish
evangelista and basically these are the
samples provided by glassfish and both
the jboss samples and the GlassFish
samples are in the maven format so they
are through Mabel and you can basically
import them and open them in any ide
that you like okay so let's let's look
at this example again so again this is
the java ee 6 version that i just
imported into internet beans and
basically I have my glassfish server and
jboss server we just adhering bite
netbeans so right now it had been
supported such a buzz saw jboss seven so
that the e6 version so so this
application would run basically on the
JBoss server from here but what i did is
basically change them to work on
glassfish so basically if you get go to
the project properties you see that I
said that the server is glassfish but
the East version is still july six and
when I run it it just runs runs in
glassfish I should know that I needed to
make
some minor changes in this e 6 version
so you just want to say that at the on
the e6 level interpret ebay stores
already pretty good you know and most of
the things that work alter the box you
know you just need don't need to think
and change anything so the changes that
are made I needed to make our very kind
of trivial and not much change there so
let's say let's actually look at the
diff of what I changed so yeah I think
this is the diff let me try to make it
bigger ok so I think basically this
comes out to data source so data sources
are kind of a specific care on a per
server basis so there was the jboss data
source specified it is example I just
changed it to to a glassfish data source
a different name and which is available
out of the box there is the provider
which probably is not necessary but I
still add it and there is there is this
this property that added which did not
exist in the example to make sure that
when the sample is deployed the database
schema is populated and pre generated so
basically the only change changes are in
this persistence.xml related to database
configuration ok so by now the sample is
deployed and tear basically to walk
through what about the sam please it's
kind of very simple member registration
application so you can submit some names
you know like submit you
it's a minute
okay click register and now you can see
all the all the members that have been
registered so far it and plus plus the
rest URL which outputs Jason for for
this member and that's that's all stored
in the database so
okay and here is another one which I
register them to again JSON data and I
think that's basically the for the
function without the application right
yeah well you don't track fried put a
name and annabelle email something or
short phone number okay so there is
somebody shin myeon size must be values
javi 6-pin donation you can annotate
feel and it says you have to be with
anything there's a tenant whole
characters a kind of thing okay okay so
i think that was the sample yeah switch
over to come on so the next thing is so
oh that example use java 6 and only
change to get it from gay bars to class
face was the data source because there's
no standardization on the name of data
sources in before javi seven so Java 7
has a few highlights I think there's
more of these but these are sort of
something customer today there's
WebSockets allows efficient
communications between from the client
server there's a very small thing but
things can be useful you can parse and
right json simplified messaging as batch
which I'll get into much more concurrent
utilities as well as a talk just the
last session about yeah threading and
yeah concurrency and see the I actually
think she died you're not going to touch
my Watson CDI but just point out that
was a big thing in java 6 which was the
one allowed to have a common program
model that that means that we EV has for
some up things like dependency
injections and this kid gets a that
program model that he'd be promised to
have many years ago but never delivered
on and CD i kind of got there right um
and jax-rs is the rest services which he
showed the
the piece off then JTA has some some
subtle but very important changes tore
into mobility which are getting to and
support score but before I've seen all
those at the talk maybe one one thing I
would mention about the jax-rs which is
not really shown in this example but you
know I heard from many people that in
the previous version of jax-rs one not
one there were often proprietary 80s
that the people in equal to you here and
tear basically using the study api's you
didn't go to very far and often you need
to look at the kind of implementation
classes off of your runtime yeah
basically you need to write several
specific code base about having a double
sixes CD a cane came in CT a CD I came
in gave her a unified programmer but
actually came in i would say late
because took some years but it was late
inspect because it came in as a new
thing and all that respects jax-rs jsf
an auditor can't catch up on aligning
these things that was part of it in java
6 but it's even more in Java 7 and
what's even more important as we
mentioned Tetris is some of those we
kind of for common situation we had to
get to use service vendor specific
features has now been standardized
between an API for that's the value of
the spec that be and basically don't
have to miss with specific things okay
so now he was showing NetBeans
deployment glass first and that gave us
could run him in the things and i'm back
in eclipse or in this case dear muslim
studio where i'm running the same
example but now with java ee 7 features
in it right just one thing that just a
punk gotta mingle up the whole thing but
gave us a s7 was what gave us s was
called before then what gave us a s8 is
called Wi-Fi so we had a name change so
there's no confusion between gave us the
supported version and while i was the
community
so I'm going to show the few introducing
writing here now because there's no
support e same and yet and I'm running
wild fly almost better because like I
took whatever it was there last week
yeah cocaine support version has a name
oh well though what eat that may change
no no that's going to stay yes that's
staying the brand stays at the products
and lastly is just a name for the
community app server right okay so and
just again put ID I let me get so you
can see the screen I'm running both a
class fish with that the Lord gave us EP
six but even more important it down here
is the wirefly 800 beta one snapshot
outright last week cuz so class miss did
they release consider reference mutation
we working on ours and I think they have
a big deer would like 120 sup jurors
about which part respect we are doing
and last I checked all that has been
checked off so it's in the wild fly but
it's the beta is being released soon
that's it okay yeah but it's just show
the things we did in the app just
because we were kind of got the idea for
the togs okay so what we're going to do
and we said oh take a cab v6 application
we have the jealous ex amma put water
glass fish and add some now javi seven
stuff let's see if I got it started
right ah I clicked the wrong thing
that's awesome let me go to the main app
there you go and as a bit confused what
other sizes so same apps not nothing
changed basically I have it has some
people rated already but let me just add
some more let's add Pete near just fun
Pete near calm and some number and I go
register oh let me see so I'm actually
going to add does this live lock here
got home that here in the browser you
see that's an empty I get that ah come
on yeah we did we didn't have that much
time I'll make it pretty just want to
show some concepts so register here said
going to go through the same stuff and
add it the user but he saw the right
side the browser popped up to the thing
right so the lot that last bit here was
WebSocket talking to the browser's back
hey there's something opened up now I'm
writing on the same computer here but it
could be any or externally and then in a
background I actually also kicked off a
batch job right as if i refresh here
again if I'm lucky I'm not well you
might have to wait 60 seconds let me see
I am you see it's running inside a fast
up here but you see what happen is I
started off a batch job that is running
a background and I can continue working
here that we go into fits up oak it'll
get there in two seconds so what it done
is we makes you say well for our users
we want to get the Avatar images for
from the github account just made up
some earlier so he went off and passed
each other now it came back they found a
matross we used to get have api to fetch
the image and then store it somewhere
else and it's not in the database and it
does that for every user you see their
internal ipod out there and a little go
do that in the background okay so now
that here for the app so let's go and
see the kind of changes we had to do for
them so first of all what's this next
month so the tough part is their version
numbering so top gray is javi 62 Gabi
seven you bumped the version from 20 to
21 and I forgot to change the spec here
okay so you see the same style son come
that actually is a bug it should be JCP
i forgot to put in but basically you
declare a new header and you noticed is
no data source reference here I didn't
even say the dancers so Java 7 has this
feature which probably is mostly for
making examples and easy starting there
is a default data source that that just
gets given to you right so we don't have
we had IV in jboss we had something
called come something java example TS
you have underscore underscore default
yes and that logic and those guys have
probably been different in Java 7
there's two things one there's an in
default injective data source if you
don't specify anything we got to give
you one right you don't even have to
specify it and secondly one if you
actually won you can also Express you
say how r use the data source and as the
utsa common
I forgot the name now but it's called
default data source in there so this is
awesome for guys like Peter me as we can
provide examples it works on any thing
and we don't have to say Oh to deploy
this you have to go in and change this
that little thing means the binary war i
create or he creates can run on both our
service right that's awesome I think
furthermore in the original one there's
a lot of hibernate specific things
because hyvent has properties for hard
credit scheme and as how is Sarah Sarah
same if you use our classes it's a
crippling specific stuff those things
have been standardized so that long name
java expert systems stephen horizon
database action which is actually is
more readable than HP md to ddl
something this fine said oh ok on once
we are starting up i want to drop and
create the database the other one is
java x persistent SQL no script source
but it's in hibernate there's no
specified thing if you have import SQL
in your mail ain't it will load it by
just magically here you do it explicitly
and this is supported again on all jpa
21 vendors and if this is a even go
beyond what hibernate or eclipsing does
is you can have multiple no script
sources and you can even have i forgot
the name but as does modern more
advanced modification you can do there
you might be used to so here they
actually went I'm standardized this
stuff and the IAM and beyond what
actually has been found out in other
places sure
yes Harvard a sovereign Guster's I don't
know so I think the name the name can be
the same so you can choose the one name
that works across balls yes well you
know what it would do if you have if
you're doing a generic application is
that you put in a specific name data
source and you use that in both places
like there is a days of deep what's
called it's a default namespace for
these things so it's just not to use it
up to you to say well you when you apply
this app is called my favorite data
source name in both places so no that's
that's you've been doing since you know
Dobby to workers who still goes to like
this is set on file they're actually
specified in the parameters of the data
for sure that specific setup of the data
source which in java 6 was i think they
add as a data source annotation which is
standard but it's now Hawk code into
your class file which is good in some
cases and bad in others and i don't
think they unified the definition of it
so speak right but i think both of us
actually support an xml format for
defining it so you can put both of those
files into your war and they will pick
it up right so it's not the same spec
but they don't conflict so you can have
a give us da signal and I don't forgot
the name what process has but they have
similar notion as any classes by hearing
yeah yeah
anyway so they this is actually a big
this ulcer it's a small thing but
actually that's the one thing that makes
it we get actually compatible across the
two things the JSON parsing so that this
is just I'm going to show the code
instead in the end Adi so what I have
here so ignore right now says bachelet
i'm just going to show api for the
loading so again I go and fetch a AP I
github com it's an API to have you have
to add our press property set except
this is just fiddly thing for github API
and then I'm going to open that request
UCS I put out at least 66 one minute
wait time because if you ping that URL
it's gonna slaughter you and say Jana
you can't you have to do you can only do
it every every minute Once Upon premiere
unless you are assigning k/bb not and
then we're going to take that stream
which is Jason and we create a reader
and I read object gets JSON object which
has a set of key value pairs that match
to more Jason optics and you can't
reverse it stuff right so very little
little tiny speck in my opinion but it
means I don't have to go out and find
out which of the 27 different gation
parts of library that's out there to get
a freaking gayson object and then
likewise there is that you can save us
on at save right Jason objects back
again you take an object and you put
stuff into it and it can dump out a
Jason Jason thing right small thing but
you don't have to do question
boom alright so this I think this is the
order that the more new is a completely
new spec in Java 7 if you know stuff
like spring bats and utter or things
under this is what that is it allows you
to define so just one thing is
engineering in itself one of the things
that Java 7 always been kind of hated
for is you can't create your own threats
if you are you you're breaking this pen
so you're not expect compliant and be
going on why did it hella cannot kind of
threats this just knew you know whatever
the problem is that you want to be able
to persist the state and go to another
node or between you know different
process etcetera so therefore if you
study on threats the container lose
control and can't do that right so
that's why it's never going to be
allowed in any spec you can create a new
threat but he's not the way that vm is
the V and galvin books today so there's
always spin this need for well when i'm
doing a request i would like at then to
say please you know start doing this
thing that takes a while or maybe use i
think in japanese 16 through the time of
service that every hour please go and do
the salaries or whatever right so we had
timers to kick off things but we didn't
have a way to control these background
jobs and you know okay there's a process
but reading a file or reading something
and then process the objects and output
them again that was kind of missing was
undefined so that's what the batch job
does so it gives you a standardized way
to run along and running lung and
running long running background jobs and
it can be very fat like a very
coarse-grained this is what we had an
example we just Oh kick off a job run a
loop and and give it back that's a very
coarse grain thing or it can be very
fine going that's what this diagram
illustrates that you can split it up in
oh here's some jobs over here have some
steps and there's some lesser reader the
process item writer all these steps can
be handled and you know persisted so
once you you know the load goes up
whatever the batch process can say is a
be going to pause this over here and
kick it up again right
so it gives a container very
well-defined control over the batch jobs
I need I'm wired up here this is hard so
that's the spec and it's like I this
honestly this was actually the first
time i work with it and I'm actually
very pleasant surprise that was very
simple there is some XML some of that
but in this case it's actually very nice
you put it in meta impasse jobs some
named xml so that's you can have any
name set of backups and here I'm call it
look up github and it just has one step
that says fine github Bachelet ref gets
github Bachelet this says there's one
step in is this job that could be
multiple and there's a Bachelet means i
don't care if it's get split up in input
and output and steps I'm just give me
something about I'll do it and the getup
battle actually is a CDI name so my
bachelor is called get a bachelor in CDI
I could also specify fully qualified
class name here if I wanted to so it's a
name component gets a bad github
Bachelet I can do it pens injection from
my state the running thing that that is
there and then it's a method called
process it says go do your thing and
once you're done then you know you you
end up right and not what I did in this
example is you started when when I
submit something it's that it starts a
background drop saying please go through
all user and see if there's any missing
github avatars and store it somewhere in
the static list here but you could you
know somewhere else and that's it very
simple and easy yeah
if I understand this right we're not
just talking our traditional concept of
a solid dance process yeah so so the one
that I did here is a hugger it's just
one process and I can go thread.sleep
stay there and don't do anything right
so I can be an evil right so so for ya
so that's for small jobs you just want
to learn background but so this is an
example I found somewhere to they create
a download manager that that it had a
list of things had to download and then
it for every item it downloaded it could
start a step and it could even start
their own steps in parallel lets you
have so basicly what the bats
prospective finds is oh you have first
of all you can start a job and that job
can have some input either properties or
any any key value pair but also it
defines it as an input that can be split
up in tasks and then you can find those
tasks can be running parallel and you
don't have to worry about it except
you're going to define here's my input
here the input need to run through this
object I forgot the name now that splits
it up in elements and then it takes
those elements and say let's say it's a
list of download files he's a thousand
files need to be processed through the
country of whatever and instead of going
through one by one you're going to say
let me do those in batches of tens right
and then it going to give those tends to
a processor right and then you can say
well the next when those ten are done it
takes the next 10 or let me take those
10 55 blocks and give it to five
concurrent ones and the paint as an out
and now all this splitting splitting up
is well defined but of course the logic
on how many and whatever depends on
implementation that would whether they
use a rule Indian or XML or something
else to find us right but in this pack
is to find how to define the bat shop
and then the various Indians can you
know provide additional service on top
of that so they actually goes beyond
this basics yes isn't
oh it says at named it's I think it's
just dependent I'm not sure that's I
don't I didn't see any bat-scope so to
speak I think actually they just fit I
think actually they just consider this
like a separate requests kind of thing
so it fits in is oh there's no request
from that user in the same that's what I
understood release I think that the
domain value here is that we don't have
to you know background jobs something
every enterprise app does and yeah 15
years later now we have it it's awesome
for example yeah they just piss fits
perfectly into this but this is the
standard way of doing it yeah so if you
mean standard miss recommended yes it's
okay so back to you move so WebSocket is
basically the next another new
specification in java ee 7 and we verify
that it works are also equally in
glassfish as well as white flight so
it's basically bi-directional
communication across over HTTP and
basically it's it's a kind of server
push technology you know so client can
put Sun something's to server and at any
time later the server can Santa
responses and more data to the client
okay so let's look at the code of how
this how this is invalid
okay so here is that a certain point
which is a server-side class or
annotation that basically defines out
the place that sends and receives
messages you know so there are some
encourage decoders for for the messages
basically way to convert message to to
an object and then there are all tation
such as on message here that's the most
important one and on clothes so
basically this handles the old message
under say an incoming message yes I
guess this doesn't have all the message
they are closing on openness out there
because it's one liner just but yeah the
red shirt at the pass and how you
convert the parameters and that's it
then now there's something listening on
registration right and on the client now
you have JavaScript API so this
JavaScript API is supported in all
modern modern web browsers so again very
similar you can do you can supply on
open functions function and on message
function which typically you know send
and receive JSON data to the server so
this is an example again and you see
that there is a the the URL goes to the
registration and there is a special
protocol WS so you specify WS instead of
http for for specific specific ind
specifying the URL
so I think that those are basically the
main technology that we wanted to go
through in Java is seven one thing that
we that we should point out is that many
of these specs or most of these specs
have different implementation across
different runtimes so for for jax-rs at
the the GlassFish implementation is
called jersey in wild fighters rest easy
similarly jpa eclipselink versus
hibernate there is a different bundle
database you know some are the same such
as the JSF and so on so so basically but
many of these are very different but in
spite of that we found out that we
basically they behave the same and there
are spec compliance test and
certification tests that make sure that
when a service is certified as java ee 7
then it behaves according to the
standard even though the implementation
may be different and indeed we verify
that the sample that might as well show
you in his machine which was updated to
java ee 7 works without any changes on
glassfish for and just i'll demonstrate
but take the same war and the works no
no change is necessary okay
and here's the kind of matrix of what
what is the support of servers in in
tools so you see that the Eclipse IDE
supports both the GlassFish for through
a plug-in by Oracle as well as of course
jboss 7 and in the future soon also
wildfire eight and that's through the
jboss demo / studio shown by Max and
also in netbeans I do you can use that
glassfish for let's actually know that
plug-in that's that's a part of the dige
and it's just just building supports
java ee 7 right now and forge a balsa
there's also built in the integration
for jboss seven right now which is the
Jie six implementation the Wi-Fi eight
the java ee 7 is not supported yet so
that's a that's not there right now but
and it's just the important thing is
that so it fetch itself support 17-6 put
up all of it so and it also does it has
its own gave us and i think it's a
generic gave us and generic while for
generic gave us a generic class v
support but don't use it right use for
Davis you install the dev of souls which
provides a server adapter it has all the
fans features you expect incremental
deployment etc same Oracle provides
their own glassfish tooling that adds
the same thing it adds interest an
eclipse but if you download the plain
old plain old playing new kept release
its kind of miss out on the server
number you have to go and install the
one from divot tools or phone or from
Oracle and especially the CDI supporting
clips doesn't exist yet except if you go
to davis tools we provide CDI feature
so you can navigate the I objects enter
the same you can do in net beads okay so
I know that Peter said well everything
works great is all awesome so perfectly
kissin x is cool so tell you seven dust
makes it easier like especially the big
jump end of winter ability came in da v6
the whole CD I may solve a lot of
problems and that's just being utilized
more in Java 7 plus java 7 has stuff
like yet bats and web sockets the ads
these things that you kind of expect now
and the end result is you get a much
smaller war basically you actually
deployment that's the thing you deploy
it's much smaller because you don't need
to add in you know spring bats or Chapel
because in the kids back already can I
have to add in whatever WebSocket to add
on you want to do it's in there and so
they covered more but expect or not
everything is called respect so I was
like heavy we had persistent smell no
days so specified I used importance
guell awesome except that we like in
hibernate can support comments in that
it's gold funds you can screw described
oh this is flower vada script for this
product or na pyaar to insert statements
etc run out on glass vase and forth
eclipselink at this point bills throw up
and say why you put in comments in you
files this has to be raw deal alright so
that the unfortunate turns out it's not
specified the format RFID included you
can just include a file by any way you
can change it so now if you remove all
comments it will work on both sides
alright so that's again you so close but
then the small thing that that's not
color but spanked and I'm gonna nag
amount of an arch back because that
should be something and then software is
written by humans so we had some fun
parts the WebSockets so Peter added the
website functionality and I'm like well
web star has been in while fly out for
since many months ago
that's the least of my worries i
attended this friday and it turns out
that it didn't work his example i
couldn't get it to run i was like what's
going on so turns out there's a bug in
the current implementation it is better
by the way it's okay that you couldn't
have any injection that was going on in
the endpoint would trigger it so you
could connect but the cervical closed
immediately if you remove the ad inject
stuff started to work this is the but
it's reported to be fixed but you know
carefully week and then the best part we
use this thing called by the way the
website is its undertow it's a new
component in wild fly faster better all
that kind of thing so it has box and got
on you also for the bad stuff we used to
thing called a beret it's a new proper
product done by a gave us community
member i think or even employee i don't
know but it's their weights because the
the one is private i be Emily for some
reason didn't like it was a bit heavy
weight for our opinion 0 tra and that
was it worked I cuz done perfect it any
example throw in it it worked on the
left flat side and then it came to
glassfish and is seen to work except
that when's to keep that job you got
this error says something table missing
we like table what and I think that's
reason why we didn't like the DJ back
sister needs a Davis table and for some
reason why the classf is in this current
current version didn't set it up and we
need to find out why but we fixed it by
removing a space in a pump out and I I'm
still like a deleted but I verify it
twice so there's a bug they're also
quite so again just short answers we are
way way longer than the or Java 6 did a
big step Jonny certainly is even better
and we started have a much more complete
respect stuff like Donald
background jobs WebSocket and etc it's
better and yeah that is bugs but you
know that's two things over time that
they bagon be fixed sure that's it okay
yeah we actually on time for us so the
example I did so that is it my github
repository it's a fork of the quick
starts from jboss and by the way this
the aaron has a ton of water at Johnny
send some things with Darwin but yeah I
just branch this one it's java ej1 ee
seven-branched has this stuff in here
and it's actually literally our 50 lines
i changed to at the functionality and
yeah there's a row mesquite java 7 and
there's the gave us way kicks verbs this
is still only commentary six but over
time well to power gamma sigma those are
examples are very kind of exhaustive
dating coach and all the e certain
specifications and a five examples of
each and so yeah todavia is very small
it's very small fine-grained some of
them to test very specific feature and
the quick sauce is a bit high level but
yeah and to an entering yet ok questions
yeah so if i am interested in a slight
deviation say for a month what over the
next
mom would be the best way using clips
and jboss tools I'm not plugged into a
fish renekton adjust the work work with
wildfly and web sockets and it's a hook
on what is the what it would be the
number the number release another
version number RK lost to linger yeah so
what I used here was just gave us to
voters 70 but they're the one you want
to use because you want to have batch is
you want to use the 71 because that
supports the what sort of there's a bear
its and also I've built it's outrageous
and got one health is where you're going
yeah all the latest java stools for 411
alpha but the key key key the key here
is last lie you need to use the better
release which I it's not released it
right Jason yah yah yah y is y 8 beta 1
it's the one that gets day back in there
if you don't if you don't care about
bats just one the website with Jason
that's all client dated one yep is the
one
looking for and it's jboss tools for got
one dot 1 alpha yeah it's basically
relate the developer release of those
guys and it showed maybe you could show
northern when we set up a server enemies
every time I tried it does not have a
job e87 sort of type ahead we have the
jboss Senate and server type is there
now wild twice report I yes so if I if I
create a server that the glasses ones if
I typing wirefly there's now a wildfire
aight experimental does not be all jolly
sat in for size we call glass license
yeah yeah cuz it's autumn jumpsuit for
you talking about these other reasons
when I also a music so be anytime soon
me too yeah I know it's there's a better
build available in generally and that's
that's far enough questioner
if ASML is 14 elegant they're all e7 is
in one flight but a s7 is EE 6 the only
part I think that if he's six the
producer is 416 number 62 or 63 they
talking about adding some of the e7
stuff like that suckers to it but this
is you know this open-air plans play but
not the community as7 is folks on the e6
all new developments on wirefly is 8
which is targeting EPE seven the white
line so so so what landslide 8 beta 1 is
set to be released around gel one so
that should be soon and that's what I
mean that's the one I've even testing
hips here I don't know the final lease
of life I ate from my heart and within
some months but I yah that's two I n
right now yeah 58 expect
I finally be certified I actually don't
know but I think yes we are certifying
it but there's government yeah yeah so
basically I think it is but I know
there's something last time because of
those could be to certify to servicer
because ep 6 is verified as at ye
something though ee 6 combined I think
it's been running at the apartment
cheesecake so it's the questions is
going to be officially certified I don't
know if it's gotta be Tess again tsk yes
it is no no if I pausing you don't have
to be certified but you are good eyes
until I do that it's not i'm not even if
time clocks i'm just i haven't actually
heard the word OB Planning are
certifying it but i think we are so but
no promises it don't kill me I'll use
the Oracles first right okay anything
else no okay thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
