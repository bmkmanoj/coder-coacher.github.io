mentioned earlier this is now 20 years
of Java Juan and so I was thinking back
to what i was doing 20 years ago and in
fact exactly 20 years ago this month I
was packing my things and getting ready
to move from Europe to come here to san
francisco in order to work for a small
start-up which was called Java soft some
of you might remember it it was a part
of became a part of some micro systems
and since then the world has has changed
in so many ways I think it's really
amazing to look at the phenomenal growth
that Java has had and alter what a
profound impact its had and what I'd
really like to do is to thank all of you
because without your efforts without
your embracing java without your making
it better java would not be what it is
today so the world changes a lot I think
one of the things that has really been a
key to Java success over the years is
starting out with a very keen sense of
the philosophy behind it and some of
these things were we're really there
from the beginning in fact they're all
there from the beginning but some of
them only really became apparent over
time and and so I think this is one of
the things that we want to continue to
bring forward over the years we've
continued to make sure that the JDK
library has a very rich set of api's in
order to make your lives easier we focus
on security quality performance and
scalability and then we try to also
listen to you as developers and
understand what do you need in order to
be more productive and how can we at the
same time balance that with ensuring
compatibility so that it's easier for
you to move forward and finally we've
tried to do this in a way that has been
more and more open and transparent as
we've gone along doing design and
development in the OpenJDK community
be together with all of our partners the
world has changed a lot in 20 years and
Java continues to evolve with it the
cloud has changed the world DevOps has
changed the world and a lot of new
technologies have come along light
containers in order to help developers
be more productive now we want to make
it easy and convenient for developers to
use Java with containers and so to that
end I'm very pleased to say that we will
soon be distributing the Oracle JDK with
talker so we want we want to meet
developers where they are today we want
to make Java a first class citizen for
docker and we want to do it with the
distribution model that makes sense ok
I'm always very pleased to share
interesting stories of how people are
using Java in order to succeed in
running their businesses one example i
came across recently as a company that
i'm sure needs no introduction i'm sure
you've all heard of it ladies and
gentlemen please give a warm welcome to
masahiro yoshioka son from the IT
solution division at mazda
Thank You terrific hi so and welcome to
Java one and thank you i was recently
over and visited yoshioka thong in
hiroshima in japan and he showed me
around the facility there so tell me now
mazda has a large and complex business
can you share with us some of the areas
where you guys use Java ok suppression
management process cost calculation and
manufacturing processes ok so can you
tell us a little bit more about the
ordering and cost calculation areas ok
regarding the cost corrugation and the
globe are watering system the Mata
migrated from the ragazzi system to the
Java applications and the global
ordering system and the Coast Guard
system have the same characteristics and
the different characteristics so
regarding the same characteristics both
system is a mission critical systems
regarding the different characteristics
cost calculation system is a batch base
and rewrite system the ordering system
is a api-based real-time systems ok so
these sound like fairly Universal
problems i'm sure there are a lot of
industries a lot of companies that have
similar kinds of things ok um one of one
of the things i found really interesting
when i was over and visited you and
showed me around um was the way that you
guys have actually been using java on
the assembly lines like the one that we
see in the video here can you tell us a
little bit about how you're doing that
ok i explained the masses vehicle
manufacturing briefly massa have a main
front and the path front main front was
a stamping body paint final same breeds
part front other engine at cell
transmission and so on this video shows
ranging excel final assemblies the
mazdas factory is a mixed production the
massive produced multiple in the same
rinds the vocal see the data in the
display and the paper
and the choose apart and rock and the
season create a data for the welcome and
the system create a data for the factory
machine and pop the machine includes a
robot okay that's really cool so overall
what's your impression of Java and how
it's worked for your business and how
does it look going for okay now mattered
IT division have a new IT strategies in
the new ID strategies mazda I team will
achieve the harmonized aggression and
defense aggression is days of innovation
and the child to the new areas and the
defense's is a system development
maintenance operations for the business
continuity and the Java point of view
regarding the aggression the Java is a
innovative and Java provide and will
provide the new function like a lambda
streaming API projector jigsaw that
acted and the developers want and need
and each other is a most popular
language and the largest number of the
developer use each other in the world
and the huge number of the java
community support java progress that is
a evidence that java is a progressive
continously that's a very very important
point that a company like a master
choose a java and continue to use the
Java okay thank you very much thank you
very much wonderful
okay thank you for that very interesting
story of how how Mazda is using Java
think those really need to see and i'm
sure you all want to go out and buy one
of those miata roadsters now that you've
seen how they're using java in its
production of course mazda is the large
and complex global entity it's an
enterprise it's existed for many many
years and so it's probably not that much
of a surprise for us that they're using
Java pretty extensively I thought I
could be interesting also to look at
sort of the other end of the spectrum
when we look at a completely different
kind of business a small start-up really
just getting started and how Java is
able to help them so please help me
welcome Clement who is a co-founder of
wave front
Thank You charge see welcome okay so why
don't you start out you know maybe some
of the folks in the audience would not
hurt away front yet why don't you tell
us a little bit about you what sure so
wave front is a four year old startup in
palo alto california that started with a
vision that the best way to understand
machines software and even people is
through the power of metrics and to that
end we have built a massively scalable
time series data base and a query engine
on top of it that allows complex
mathematical transformations done in
real time our customers use wavefront to
detect down time to find anomalies to
identify root causes and to discover
solutions to their problems we've had
some amazing partners along that journey
and I can say it has been a blast so far
great so why don't you tell us a little
bit about the architecture sure so as a
SAS company wavefront runs a collection
of micro services in the cloud which
collectively delivers a web-based UI for
interacting with data the core engine
consists of data ingestion services
affronted by collectors that takes in
customer data from agents proxies and
external sources it also handles the
planning and parsing of queries written
in our unique time series language and
execute them in a parallel screaming
manner okay great so I I think folks in
the audience would love to hear why why
was Java a choice for you and why did
you choose it sure why Java so we
started with Java because of the
maturity of the ecosystem and which
allows us to stand on the shoulder of
giants as we develop the product we
micro sources are built on top of drop
wizard we have dependency injection by
juice jackson jersey RPC with Avro over
Nettie HTTP serving with jetty mustache
I mean I could go on and on for the next
10 minutes probably but all of these
libraries are mature well-documented
battle-tested which enabled us to write
our products and they love develop our
ideas instead of spending a lot of time
to lay out the groundwork we are also
big fans of Yammer metrics and a lot of
the libraries there
out there such as Google guava apology
Commons and probably a lot of the
primitive collections libraries out
there the Java language itself
especially the innovations that we have
seen in the last couple of years have
really enabled us to write code that's
easier to read and also less error-prone
I never thought Java was a verbose
language I guess we all use IntelliJ at
work but I think with the introduction
of lambdas stream processing and the
default methods to just to name a few
has really enabled us to write code that
is more elegant than ever before on the
JVM side of things no doubt the massive
investments and talent which many are
here today is a major reason for why we
chose Java in the first place okay great
well thanks very much yeah and best of
luck thank you
okay I thought was really neat to hear
just a couple of stories from different
places on how people are using Java I I
did want to just sort of close my
section with telling you a little bit
about you know what you can do now if
you haven't already please upgrade to
Java 8 you'll really be glad you did so
so please do that and then the other
thing is I wanted to mention that many
of you are aware many libraries and
frameworks folks out there as well as
many application developers have already
downloaded the early access bills of
java SE 9 how to look tried to make sure
their applications or their code is
running smoothly on it and reporting
issues through the appropriate channels
if you run into any issues so please do
that now in order to take the next step
here what I'd like to do is invite the
chief architect mark Reinhold to come up
on stage and give us more technical
details
thank you George
good afternoon and welcome to Java one
again here we are so it's been a really
busy year for java SE and the jdk and
everybody across the ecosystem who works
on it i'd like to take some time to talk
about what what we're working on for the
near future the the sort of medium term
and then the longer term with with help
from a couple of my colleagues so first
of course the near term everybody is
focused on on java SE 9jt canine which
will be coming soon maybe not as soon as
you had hoped but it will be coming soon
there are lots and lots of features in
nine you may think that nine is all
about jigsaw and modular ization well no
there are actually many many more
features than that here's the complete
list 885 some are big some are small
some are related to each other some are
standalone some are some are really
teeny but extremely valuable so I'd like
to start by showing you just one of
these on that is jay chou the java read
eval print loop i would like to show you
j shell the gel is the the interactive
java shell so i'm running a recent job
at nine build here a very recent few
days old let me start up j show so J
shell is an interactive shell it's it's
a program you can type snippets of Java
code into and it will evaluate them and
print the results and and show you
what's what so I can type for example a
simple expression okay well that's
that's reassuring arithmetic works I can
declare a variable I 42 I can eat i can
write a little statement let's write a
little statement show do i know but
there it is and if i look at i it's it's
now 50 NBA behind-the-scenes this is
using the compiler api to take these to
take these expressions evaluate them in
real time compiled them to bytecode run
those byte codes and show you the result
so far I've shown you fairly simple
things what's extremely cool about Jay
show is you can use it to explore an API
so let me make a string string x equals
everybody's favorite string rhubarb as
so I've got a string it's very variable
X is referring to the string object I
can now ask what methods can i invoke
Jay shell JCL like most self-respecting
shells has tab completion i typed tab
here and boom it shows me all the
methods I can invoke now some of these
are overloaded so I can go further I can
say let's see there's good there's got
to be a substring method right yep
there's a substring method that
completes and if i type shift tab here
it shows me there are two overloads of
this method name there's one that takes
one in there's another that takes two
and of course I can invoke those I can
do this I get that substring I could do
this a sub screen 47 and I just get bar
and as you can see there so there's
complete history here it's a it saves
everything over time so you can go back
and refer to previous snippets oh the
scaling is off I'm sorry I'll be correct
for that okay so i can do even more than
that so remember I've got my string X
let's say I want to split that on spaces
oh now I've got an array and well Jay
shell could be more it more helpful at
printing this out so what I'll do is
I'll just convert this to a list and I
see I've got the list of strings foo bar
in bass I can do more sophisticated
things you notice these these numbers at
the dollar 10 and so forth that's shown
here that's a temporary variable I can
use it to refer to the value of a past
expression so for example dollar 10
that's this list what's an interesting
method on list well I can ask for a
stream I could then filter say I want to
get all the strings out of that list
that start with the letter B so I write
myself a little lambda expression starts
with and you see it's doing completion
even in the middle of this lambda
expression but i'm typing in
complex statement so starts with B and
then I want to collect that into
collector but now it's not completing
and the reasons not completing is it
doesn't know about the stream package by
default so I can fix that by doing an
import facial imports a number of
packages by default but not java.util
stream I import that and now it will
offer to complete that on collector I
can say collectors dot to list close
that out and I will get the list of
strings bar impasse so J shelly is all
about exploratory programming you know
all those annoying times when you have a
question about weld is this thing going
to work in a certain way you sure you
could go read the spec you could go look
it up on Stack Overflow but sometimes
it's easiest to just create an extra
file and compile it and run it but Jay
shell takes the tedium out of that you
can just drop into the shell do some
exploration figure out how something
works and then move on racial is what's
known in older languages as a ripple
repl stands for redevelop rinse loop
that's something that that's been in
Lisp systems for years and it has an
a-list guy I'm very pleased to see it
come to Java it's also a great
complement to IDEs netbeans nine in fact
to the early builds already have support
for J shell you can type j shell into a
NetBeans window and then automatically
convert snippets in into into your
actual code okay enough enough on J
shell for the moon not sure how this is
going to work
I wasn't expecting a reboot okay let me
talk about project jigsaw it is after
all kind of the headline feature of the
release so jigsaw to find a standard
module system for the platform apply it
to the platform itself with a number of
really important properties we're trying
to achieve one is that it be
approachable something that everybody
can use to write large applications and
large systems so that you can escape
from classpath hell after all these
years we need it to be scalable it can't
just be a toy has to be something that's
capable of modularizing the platform
itself and finally it has to be
compatible we can't modular eyes the
system and say oh well all that old code
all those systems you have running now
you have to go do a bunch of work just
to make them work know if something
works today it should work tomorrow by
and large so this is a fairly hard
problem we've made a decent amount of
progress and we've come pretty far the
proposed proposed design gives you to
Kiki values from from modules one is
reliable configuration because a module
names the other modules upon which it
depends and the other is strong
encapsulation because a module specifies
in its in its self description exactly
which packages it exports and which ones
it does not so it's a fundamental new
kind of program component why you're
deeply into the Java Virtual Machine and
understood in the programming language
it's not a library or a framework that
just kind of built on top of Java so if
we drop back into J shell we can
actually see some of the effects of this
of this system let me get my fubar bass
string back here so I'm going to do a
little bit of reflection right so X X is
a variable referring to a string object
I can ask what is its class and sure
enough I get coddling string length
string back that's what I expected and
now I can also ask what is its module
because every class is in a module and
the module is a model called Java base
the base module that contains the
fundamental parts of the system
java.lang.object and string and sister
and at all but all the things at the
very core but certainly not all the rest
of it if I look at some other a class
what let's make a java sequel timestamp
just a random ok so there's a timestamp
object I asked what is its class I get
timestamp and I asked what is its module
and I get java that's equal the JDBC
classes they're not in the Java base
module there in the job on a sequel
module there's a separate module
containing that content so drop it
dropping out of Jay shell if i type java
list montreux list modules i get 0 a
list of all the modules there are a lot
of them how many are there there are 72
all told I can try to format these a
little more nicely there's a decent list
there's the rest of the list so lots of
stuff here guess what it's more it's
easier to look at in graphical graphical
form so let's do that so here is the
module graph for all of the java
standard modules in the system now you
might notice this looks a little bit
cruder than the hand-drawn graphs i've
carefully constructed before and that's
because this graph is actually generated
by the jdk build a party part of the
build process that generates dot files
which we can then render into pings that
are a completely accurate description of
the modules in the built image now as
you can see the base module is down here
it's the only module that it depends on
no others and every other module depends
on it and then we've got all these other
modules up here your appear for example
is the sequel module okay so it's a
pretty big change to take a monolithic
system and modularize it and impose this
kind of structure on it what does that
mean for existing code well existing
code by and large just works i happen to
have here
a copy of a swing set anybody remember
the swing set demo hey so this is this
is the actual swing set to jar file from
JDK 5 and look it runs no problems hi
you still have the stem it was great you
can go look at the oh yeah here's it
here the famous bouncing babies I mean
these kids are like in college now right
so in general if an application uses
only the standard Java SE AAP is in
eight or earlier releases it will just
run on nine now there are a few
extremely rare exceptions but we have
not run into many actual applications or
libraries that run across those
exceptions now it what I said about only
using standard API is critical because
now most jdk internal api's are strongly
encapsulated if you have code that's
going into you know sunday WT x 11 or
something guess what it's not going to
work right we've encapsulated the
internal api's of the jdk for two
reasons one is to improve security and
the other is to improve integrity so
that it's easier to evolve the platform
over time as things stand we're kind of
stuck when we want to evolve things
because we always have to think are we
going to break somebody because they're
using an internal api which they
shouldn't have been but we don't wanna
break them and so what do you did okay
I'm sorry I'm trying to figure out what
to do with my with my remaining time so
we've got the module graph and that
means we can we can we don't have to
carry everything around if an
application only needs a few things we
can just we can make a custom JD KJ
takeda it just contains the modules that
we that we need so there's a new tool
called j-link can tell it where my
module of course where my module modules
are um and I can make I can ask for it
to generate me a Jerry that contains us
what I need now it's complaining because
I didn't tell it I have to tell it what
I need so what that's for me let's make
a teeny a teeny run time with just java
dot base add modules bass output Jerry
it goes often thinks did him to do and
now I have I look at Jerry it's it's a
Jerry Jerry plus very been only has a
couple of commands in it and if I run it
I can ask what modules are in it and
it's just the base module I can ask for
more details about base and it'll show
me all the stuff that base exports as
you can see there's quite a lot of good
stuff your eye on Lang and math an Ettin
ngaio and security so you can do a fair
amount of stuff with just the base
module now you can also make it smaller
even so here's here's the full jdk 500 5
megabytes that JRE i just made is 46 i
can give j-link some magic options let's
say strip out the debug symbols I can
use a special small vm I can compress
all the class files even more and I can
make a small Jerry
this takes more time and have small ones
only 17 megabytes so this is this is
Linux x64 on something like Linux arm 32
it would be smaller still so the JDK
itself of course is built with jailing
you that's how we build the entire JDK
it's Jay linked with all of the modules
of the system and you can also include
your own modules in a linked image so if
your if your application consists of
modules you can link those all together
into one image stick it you know stick
is stick it in a docker file and deploy
it to the cloud and off you go so
there's a little bit more I wanted to
say but I'm running out of time I
apologize for that so jigsaw jigsaw has
been this big effort it's it's still
going on there's still a lot of work to
be done in in both the jsr and the
design of the module system and in the
expert group and also of course in the
implementation so we're continuing to
work on all that we could switch to the
other machine please I you can alert you
can learn more about jigsaw this week my
colleagues Allen Bateman and Alex
Buckley have put together a number of
sessions i'll be--i'll being most of
these two arranging from from fairly
introductory prepare for JD k9 all the
way through a hack session where you can
come and ask questions and hack on code
other information is available on the
project jigsaw web page almost
everything is documented in a series of
JDK enhancement proposals and also of
course in the jsr for the module system
itself so to look a little further into
the future i'd like to welcome Brian
gets our java language architect
hey Mark hey Brian what have you been
cooking so um you know for the last
couple of versions we've been focusing
mostly on big stuff lambda jigsaw and
that stuff is important it's building
the foundation for the future but we
also care a lot about every day
developer productivity and so I want to
talk about a couple of features um nope
I want to talk about a couple of
features that were looking at in the
short term then are just gonna make
developers lives easier you know every
every day so are we are we good okay
yeah for anyone so what we want to take
a targeted look at some of the biggest
sources of boilerplate in everyday java
coding I hate boilerplate we all hate
boilerplate I'm sure if we took a survey
the audience would agree with us right
and a lot of it is unnecessary and so
one of the biggest offenders in terms of
boilerplate is just writing ordinary
domain classes like the one we have up
here in XY point um and it will be nice
if that was the whole class because
that's really all the semantic content
but unfortunately that's not the whole
story we have to have a constructor and
you really ought to have it equals and
you really ought to have a hash code and
to be polite and really what I have a
two-string and what you know what's
unpleasant about this is this is all
very low value code it's a lot it's work
to type and it's worth to read and you
know maybe the ID is gonna generate it
for you which is great but you still
have to read it and the ID can't really
help you in the reading of it and you
know as you know one of the core
language design values of the Java
language is reading code is more
important than writing code indeed so we
want to make these classes easier to
read because people can look at it and
say I know exactly what's going on and
not have to work their way through all
the boilerplate and so it would be nice
if there were a way to say I'm just a
dumb data holder class here in my
principal fields and let the compiler
generate sensible implementations for
all of those artifacts so that's cool
but what if I what if I don't want my
own equals method or something just to
Clara do that and the compiler will see
you've got an equals method I don't need
to give you excellent excellent so what
else you working on ok so along the same
lines we want to expand the scope of
type inference so type inference is
where I keep hearing to people say Java
doesn't have type inference yeah we've
had type inference since Java fire
really ah but and we've slowly expanded
the scope of it uh you know in all those
versions so
inference is allows us to remove
redundant code from you know we're done
it doesn't see from our code while at
the same time maimed hitting the benefit
of strong static typing so it's not
dynamic typing it's just not making you
do the finger typing to get the type
theoretic typing and so you know in Java
5 we have type inference to infer the
type arguments of generic method in
vacations in Java 7 we extended that to
generic instructor in vacations with the
so called diamond syntax in Java Java 8
when we did lambda we also provided for
being able to infer the types of lambda
formals and we think this sort of next
logical place to you know to apply this
approach is in local variables where you
can infer the type from the initializer
no wait art wait oh hang on are you
turning job into JavaScript here
absolutely not this is still strong
static typing good uh it's just that the
compiler has already figured out that
this thing is a bufferedreader and and
you don't have to uh to tell it now a
lot of people freak out when they see
this because they think oh my god the
codes gonna become unreadable and it's
certainly possible to write unreadable
code but if you've picked sensible
variable names when you take the static
types away from these locals the code
actually remains pretty readable in fact
you might argue it's more readable
because you're getting immediately to
what does this thing represented my
program okay very cool now you've been
working on some big even bigger parent
thing I absolutely so you know these are
little things they're great we you know
we uh you know we want to get those out
where they're gonna make people's lives
better but we've been focusing a lot of
energy on two major projects which we
talked about last year our projects
Valhalla and Panama and project Valhalla
is about value types and specialized
generics over values now value types are
like programmable primitives they have
all the expressive and safety benefits
of classes with the performance of
primitives and then at the same time
upgrading generics so that you can
specialize generics over values and
primitives so you don't pay the
performance penalty of boxing and this
is really really cool and then the other
big project that we're working on is
project Panama which is about rebooting
the interaction between Java and native
code and data so you can call c
functions see functions can call back to
java you can access data right out of
the native heap without Marshall get at
the Java heap
having to write all that all the stupid
J and I stubs I hate writing J yeah that
that's that's all a thing of the past so
you replace this you know complicated
handwritten error-prone J&amp;amp;I process
where you have to write all of this C
code with a tool that just you pointed
at the header file it generates
everything for it and you use it like as
a java api and it's safe and it's fast
okay and you're having fun so much fun
excellent okay thank you Brian thank you
bark so in closing I just like to read
here reiterate what George said it's
it's a it's a fundamental importance to
the quality of the platform and its
implementations that that we get your
help please go to go to jdk nine java
net download the binaries run your old
code on a test out the new features and
let us know what you think the feedback
we get is is just priceless thank you
