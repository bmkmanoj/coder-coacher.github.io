Feuerstein I'm the developer advocate
for PL sequel here at Oracle Corporation
I've been working with Oracle and PL
sequel technology since 1987 or so left
Oracle in 92 came back in 2014
and I'm having a lot of fun helping
people use PL sequel understand it
better leverage it fully in their
applications
ask Tom office hours is a program we set
up to start up monthly regular QA
sharing tips and knowledge and expertise
about Oracle technologies from our
internal experts out to the users and
also getting your feedback back in so
what I'm going to do today is focus on a
particular topic which is fetching a
single row inside a PL sequel program
now the name of my office hours is PL
sequel 101 and my idea is to focus on
fundamentals and I've been thinking
about this topic and and my series in
general in the sense that I've realized
there's a sense of fractal quality to
writing code you need the big picture
you need it in an overall architecture
of how you're building your code both
the PL sequel code and rest of your code
but you also need quality right down at
the micro level of every line of code
you write and you can't get one without
the other if you write a lot of really
bad code that's hard to maintain you can
have overall quality of an application
if you have a wonderful architecture but
on the line-by-line basis your code is
nasty you're not left with much so
fetching a single road is interesting
because it's something that we do a lot
in the PL sequel world the peels tickle
language is so tightly tied to the data
it's really a data API language in
business logic language so we're writing
a lot of SQL and a lot of those are
select statements that retrieve a single
row and it turns out as with any other
part of programming there are lots of
ways to do it
so we're going to spend some time
looking at that I'll do a short
presentation on various aspects of
fetching single rows or different ways
to do it and hopefully we'll have an
interesting conversation because many
people have very strong opinions about
the tiniest little aspects of writing
their code ok so first of all let's do a
little bit of housekeeping or
administrivia around office hours so you
came in through this page and this
single page this landing page for PL
sequel 101 office hours which you should
bookmark right there that single link
will always take you to the latest
session of the one that's about to start
it'll give you a list of the previous
sessions you can go back and watch the
recordings of my two previous Peele
sequel 101 sessions which I held with
Chris accent who couldn't make it today
I'll also wait at the bottom you'll find
a list of resources so there are general
resources about PL sequel
there are also specific resources about
this session so for example I've got a
blog post that we'll be referencing
today that is specifically on this topic
you really inspired it of what you'd use
implicit versus explicit user cursor
I've got a live sequel script that runs
through comparison of performance
between implicit and explicit cursors so
the bottom line is that this one page
for appeal sequel 101 office hours I'm
fetching a single row is something you
can always go back to you for the
recording of this session and for
resources specific to this topic and
you'll see that little library of
sessions and resources grown as we
continue with this program by the way
heads up also in case I forget later
I've been doing these sessions early in
the morning it's 6 o'clock here in
Chicago to give worldwide access to my
expertise but it's not so great for the
United States so what I'm going to do
starting next month is shift to I
believe it's 9:00 a.m.
Chicago time so check your calendar
check those sessions I do let everybody
know about subscribing to the session to
get reminders and by the way if you're
joining in the session you haven't
subscribed you haven't even signed in
that's ok but if you do sign in and
subscribe we will give you reminders in
the week before your sessions in any
other sessions and also let you know
about new office hour sessions that
we're having all the time ok so
hopefully you'll get a lot out of office
hours and ask Tom and of course if I can
answer a question today which is quite
likely because I'm good on PL sequel not
so hot on just about everything else you
can always come back to ask Tom and ask
questions just like you always could and
by the way if you've got questions about
the architectural
aspects of Chios equal I strongly
encourage you to check out the smart DD
office hours that's run by Brynn
Llewellyn the PL sequel product manager
and tone kuku Lars who is one of our
real-world performance experts and
they'll talk more about how to use PL
sequel to create a hard shell around
your data and provide a much higher
level of security and performance than
you might believe is possible in an
Oracle pele sequel based application
okay but we're into fetching a single
row so back over in my presentation as
you can see lots of ways to get in touch
with me feel free to contact me with
email follow me on Twitter check out my
blog my youtube videos moving along so
the interesting thing about fetching a
single row is that there are so many
ways to do it
and this is not an uncommon aspect of
writing code there's usually more than
one implementation path and then you
might say well what's the best one well
the answer is as usual it depends it
depends on a number of factors but so
what we'll do is take a look at the
different ways you can do things
fetching single rows or at least some of
them the most likely candidates then
I'll talk about some of the pluses and
minuses of each one but what I want to
do is finish up on this rather quickly
get into conversation and at any point
during the session you can click on the
chat in the bottom of your zoom box and
you can type a message to all of us or
to me you can even unmute your line if
you'd like to ask a question verbally
I'm keeping all the lines muted right
now in addition if you see a long line
of boxes of faces or names on the right
hand side of your screen if you hover
your mouse over those boxes and you look
at you'll see a toolbar at the top you
can click on the single dash to hide
them all or you can just watch me if you
want to by clicking on one of the single
boxes
okay so options for fetching a single
row number one implicit cursor select
into in which you implicitly work will
do it for you automatically implicitly
open a cursor fetch the row
close the cursor select into explicit
cursor in which you explicitly declare a
cursor and then you open it you fetch
from it as many times as you want
you close it then there's the wonderful
cursor for the for every record in a
select statement get me those rows and
do something with them you can use that
for a single row fetch two and then
there's the whole array of dynamics
equal alternatives the most prominent
and the one you're most likely to use
execute immediate and it's certainly
another way to fetch a single row it's
really something you only want to do
when you have to do that when you when
you need dynamics equal okay so before I
proceed let's take a look at some code
so I put together a little script here
of the different examples of the
different kinds of single fetch flows
first one up select into so with an
implicit cursor what I'm doing here is
taking some code out of the the dev Jim
the Oracle dev Jim quiz back-end I'm
passing in a comm prevent ID in a user
and I want to get the combat
playwrighting basically an intersection
table for those two values so in my code
I'm going to do a select into from that
table for these parameter values that
we're close and for my single row I'm
going to return a value and if something
went wrong I couldn't find a row I'm
going to return null now I'll come back
and explore each of these in more detail
but let's just keep going for now so
select into return explicit cursor in
this case I'm going to take that select
statement out of my executable section
I'm going to declare a cursor on that
select statement the returns the same as
before and now instead of having oracle
open fetch and clothes I'm gonna do it
myself
I'd open that cursor I fetch the curse
the next row into my value I close the
cursor return and notice no exception
handling for no data found come back to
that cursor for loop for a single row
all right why not for record in there is
my select statement what do I want to do
I want to get that player ID put it in
the return variable return it finally
execute immediate again you should only
use execute immediate or any dynamic
sequel option
in PL sequel if you absolutely have to
so I got my query it's a template
I've got blind variables I execute
immediate that query using those
parameter values and I do a select into
essentially this is the dynamic version
of a select engine and then I return and
notice this query could raise no data
found just as the Select into in this
format so I've got a handler for that as
well okay so those are the different
approaches let's talk a little bit
further about them and then get into
some conversation so first of all before
you decide which of those patterns you
like you need to ask yourself what am i
coding to what are the what what's the
state of the application what do I
expect to have happening for example
some key questions well the query
usually find a row or well it mostly
miss so I'm doing a select into pulling
out that row for these input values but
do I usually expect to find a value or
do I often expect it to miss and not
find a row usually we're expecting to
find a row but keep in mind that
question as we look at the alternatives
in a moment
are you fetching a single row single
value a full row or a subset of comps
how many things are you getting back
oddly enough that can actually help you
determine which path you want to take is
the query static fully defined at
compile time if so don't use execute
immediate don't use DBMS SQL don't use
cursor variables with a dynamic select
statement just stick with implicit and
explicit cursors hey and is that same
query used in multiple places this will
not necessarily determine whether or not
you're using a select in two versus an
explicit cursor but it could determine
how you decide to implement that cursor
you might want to put it for example
into a separate function if you're going
to be needing it over and over again
all right select into in general my
filling is that this is the go-to
approach for a single row fetch it's
generally the most efficient way to
fetch a single row but the differences
are not that big
key things to remember about select into
your not opening fetching closing Oracle
isn't for you but also if it does not
find a row
it raises new data found if it finds
more than one row
it raises too many roads so select into
is very specifically designed for a
particular application of getting that
single row and if something else happens
outside of getting a single row for your
query this select entry will alert you
so that's the trade off for the the
benefit you might say it depends I'm
using select into your having Oracle do
more work for you but because you've
handed off control to Oracle Oracle has
very specific rules about what it's
going to do when it finds what it would
consider an out of normal boundary
condition now one thing going back to
the performance issue and about whether
or not you're going to hit or miss on a
query so select into when you find a row
is going to be the most efficient way of
fetching a single row but select into if
you're raising no data found if you're
mostly missing it's going to hurt your
performance exception handling is a
relatively slow process so if you know
you're selected choose constantly to be
raising no data found you might say to
yourself maybe it won't end up being the
most efficient maybe an explicit cursor
well let's take a look so explicit
cursors they're usually a little bit
less efficient than selecting two but
it's likely to be the case that your
users will never notice the difference
unless you're really hammering against
that single row fetch over and over and
over and over again or many many people
doing it
chances are you can pick an implicit
cursor slip into an explicit cursor
declare the cursor open fetch close and
not really ever notice the difference in
performance and one one important thing
in general about performance you should
keep in mind is that it doesn't matter
whether or not your code is running as
fast as it possibly could what matters
is that it's running fast enough to
satisfy your user requirements keep them
keep the users happy so the other thing
to know about explicit cursors is it
doesn't raise no data found or too many
rows so if I'm staying open fetch
clothes let's go back to the code
if I say open and fetch and it doesn't
fetch anything well that's for me to
figure out and me to decide what to do
about and I could say fetch I could have
multiple fetches and any one of these
could be not returning a row because no
data was found but it's not gonna raise
the exception you have to ask for
example with a cursor attribute if
cursor % found what we're saying you're
not found then you can take action but
it's not built into that fetch process
so here's the thing if your query often
fails to find a row if your select into
is mostly missing switching to an
explicit cursor might give you better
performance because you're not going to
have to handle the no data found
exception you can simply say if it
wasn't found and then do something and
the other really nice thing about the
explicit cursor is that you can declare
a record based on the cursor this comes
in really handy and is really obvious
not so much when you're fetching a
single value like this so I've declared
my variable based on my type cool I
select into it done great doesn't really
make much of a difference if you're
selecting into a single value in terms
of the benefits of an explicit cursor so
explicit cursors really come in handy
when you need to fetch a lot of
different pieces of data so here's a
select statement with a lot of pieces of
information from three different four
different tables and if I did a select
into I would have to declare a variable
for each one of these different things
or I create a record type that matches
the structure of the select statement so
when you've got that kind of situation
where I'm not just doing a select into X
its X comma Y comma Z comma Q oh my god
I'm gonna have 25 different declarations
of variables yuck time-consuming it
litters your code with all these
different variables so in that case you
take your select statement out of the
Select into you put it inside a cursor
and then ah so nice I declare a record
based on the cursor so often you see
table % row type but of course you can
also do curse your view % row type so I
move it out into my cursor
I declare a variable based record based
on that cursor type and that's it and
that means that also if I had something
else here hey I really need to get in
start day two I make the one change
there and when when I recompile my
record automatically picks up the
structure and I proceed to use it so I
don't know Claire another variable add
it to the selection a min and so on just
make a change in one place that is one
of the nicest things about explicit
choices and one of the main reasons two
things about using them move it on
cursor for loop so yes you can use a
cursor for loop for a single row fetch
you don't have to worry about declaring
the iterator you don't have to worry
about raising no data found in too many
rows exceptions you don't have to open
and close oh isn't that nice if you look
at that code for the cursor freely there
it is I declare my variable because they
need it you need to get that value back
but inside my cursor for though but I
don't have to do anything else but say
for record in there's my select
statement for the one row I found assign
the value and then return and I suggest
you don't do this don't do this don't
use cursor for loops for single row
fetches for one thing it's incredibly
misleading a loop is all about doing
things multiple times iterating through
things if you know there's only going to
be one then just stick with that if
there might be more than one of course
you should consider using your cursor
further but we're talking about single
row fetches so don't write code that
implies that something else is going on
from what you actually know will be
happening the other thing of course is
that it doesn't raise too many rows or
no data found so if this actually found
five rows it would assign the return
value each of those five times give you
a value back and you wouldn't realize
that it wasn't the first one you didn't
realize that you've got some data
integrity problem you've got multiple
roads so you probably have to do
something like this Angele exit inside
your for loop which is a really bad idea
- it looks awful it's unstructured etc
so the bottom line is avoid cursor for
loops when you're doing single row
fetches all right so draw
some conclusions move to some chat and
some questions so in general with
programming you almost always have
multiple implementation paths what you
want to do is analyze your different
scenarios is it well am I mostly going
to get just one row in other words am I
going to get a hit on a selecting - that
doesn't involve too many rows or no data
found how critical is performance if
it's not one of those critical path
pieces you can say to yourself whatever
it's all good I'll put it inside a
function whether it's select into
explicit cursor will make that much of a
difference I would say that once you've
determined how critical performance is
and of course you don't want to write a
deliberately none optimized code and
what you want to do is keep foremost in
your mind writing readable maintainable
code so that when somebody looks at that
block of code and they see a cursor for
loop they don't say but this is just for
one row why are you doing that
if you take a look at my blog post
that's linked on that office hours page
right here you'll find that there's a
pretty lively conversation about
different approaches that people take
what they prefer sorry not some ground
line come back come back comments there
we go we've got an enhancement request
and come back and take a look at that
we've got stories about why they choose
selected and it's really interesting in
the sense that this one says I normally
you select in two because I find it
makes the code simpler you know needed
to clear the cursor easier to understand
and then if we go down a little bit
further I never you select in two
because that no data found exception
handling which adds some clutter to the
code so to some extent it comes down to
preferences what your what how you like
to write your code how you like to read
it how you see your code
so a question from Dennis when talking
about multirow fetching could you
compare think the ways the same way so
for multiple rows which approach should
you take so there are as with single row
fetching there are multiple ways to
fetch there are multiple ways to fetch
multiple rows of data and in fact we
have lots of requirements for that as
well in PLC well now I'd say the most
common way to fetch multiple rows is
with a cursor for loop and a cursor frog
is a really wonderful construct in PL
sequel I think it's a great example of
how Oracle took ADA which is the base
language from which PL sequel was
designed and then extended it into the
database world in such an elegant way
usually so the cursor for loop I simply
say that's the data I want and it could
be a select statement it could also be
my cursor it could be from a cursor and
then for each row fetched execute the
code inside the body so you don't have
to open the fet the cursor you don't
have to fetch you don't have to close
and it you essentially say this is the
data I want this is what I want to do
with it you take care of the details for
me please now the nice thing again
another really nice thing about the the
path that Oracle is taking with
optimizing PL sequel for database
processing is it as of 10g a long time
ago what you'll find is that this code
well it looks like it's fetching one row
at a time is actually fetching a hundred
rows at a time so it's doing bulk
processing behind the scenes which is an
incredibly big speed up for our the
performance of our applications because
we're cutting down on context switches
it's similar to doing a selective bulk
collect so here's another way to fetch
multiple rows and that is to say in a
single select in two it's still an
implicit query add bulk collect and then
you're fetching all the rows identified
by the where clause and the tables into
my collection and then I can iterate
through the collection with a numeric
for loop or other kind of loop and this
is also an optimized process the
difference in the thing to watch out
here is that bulk lock will return all
the rows you've identified which can
consume a lot of pea
so you've got a curser further you've
got to select ball collect into you've
also got the possibility of doing a
selectable collect with limit so you can
say I've got a cursor here's my explicit
cursor I'm going to open my cursor and
then fetch both luck limits so this is
kind of like an explicit cursor but for
multiple rows and I can say fetch and
number of rows at a time I want to fetch
a hundred or a thousand at a time but I
don't want to fetch all of them because
that could blow out my pga my process
global area and then I exit when nothing
is in the collection that I fetched so
select well collect in to fetch ball
collect into cursor for loops and also
of course exact execute immediate with
will collect so those are a number of
the different approaches you can take
and in terms of the data volume that so
in terms of the differences around data
volume which comes up with the Select
into in terms of whether or not you're
finding more than one row the big thing
with with multiple row fetches is that
you want to avoid the row by row back
and forth so for example if I said fetch
into so here's an explicit cursor with
an explicit fetch then this will be row
by row fetching and there's no
opportunity to optimize for both process
and cursor for loop does it for you
automatically fetch will collect it
gives you control over your processing
and controlling the number of context
switches so in general what you should
never do again unless the data the
volume is so low it doesn't matter
you should generally never do this have
an explicit cursor open fetch row by row
exit when cursor not found this is a
pattern that you generally would want to
avoid because it's going to be the
slowest way to fetch multiple roads
and from Dennis the ball collect feature
differs a lot from the for-loop approach
because you're able to use the
collection to fetch you many times just
as a usual table you can even use it in
your sequel statements that's right and
I think that's a really good feature so
that's a great point on this let's go
ahead and and make sure everybody
understands about that so I'm going to
go to my nested table example screen
here I'm using a collection of it's
called a nested table that says my type
list of names is a table of our car -
without any index by Clause which is
what was I was using here as well I
could have said index by so that's
integer this would be an associative
array and by the way my next office
hours will be on collections so I
populate my collection here's the point
I want to get to to show you is that one
of the really wonderful things about
collections is that once you start you
decide to use collection you to fill a
collection from your table or even
directly inside your Cove it as I'm
doing here you can still use them with
sequel so with a nested table in VRA
prior to 12c you could say for every
record in select column value that's the
hard-coded name for a single scalar a
nested table value from table operator
of my collection and this table operator
says take that collection turn it into a
relational data set or looking like a
relational data set and then do normal
sequel processing on and you can join to
that collection you can do Union all's
you can do minuses whatever once you've
put it inside that from table closets
just like a relational table and as of
12c you can also use this with
associative arrays so I can now select
from table of an associative array which
is indexed by integer so they give you a
really nice way of combining the
strengths of PL sequel and the strengths
of sequel so I can programmatically
procedurally construct a data set right
inside my code and then I can you select
from table of two to work with that data
and I can take that constructive data
set put it inside a function that
returns a nested table or a collection
and that table function can then be
called inside a selection so as of 12c
you can use the table operator with
nested tables that the arrays and index
by associative arrays are indexed by
tables you can use all those in a table
function let's take a look at a table
function for those of you who are not
familiar so here's an example of a table
of a function here's my function that
takes some data this is actually a
cursor variable coming in I'll show you
what that looks like in the code in a
moment and returns a nested table this
nested table is a nested table of types
of object types and the object type
actually mimics the tape the data that
the table structure that I want to put
it into it so in general with with table
functions or using the table operator
you're going to returning a single
scalar value in which case we have a
hard-coded column name column value are
you returning a an array of object type
instances so you create the object type
the nested table on top of it and then
your function populates that array and
then returns it so that's it here's a
function that returns a collection I can
use it as a table function by putting it
inside the table operator so here's my
function I literally pass it a select
statement here's my select statement
it's not inside single quotes it's not
dynamic it's a select statement my
cursor expression converts it into a
cursor variable that gets passed to my
function it does whatever operations in
this case a pivot from one row to two
rows and whatever it does it constructs
the data set and then it returns it to
the sequel statement through the table
operator and then it's processed in this
case with an insert select if I have a
pipeline function which is one of the
things Dennis mentioned well the
pipeline function so let's go back up
and look at that one here's my pipeline
function version I'm again returning my
- the table of object type instances I
say it's pipelined and what
this does is allow me to return or pipe
each row back rather than filling up a
local collection so in my normal table
function non-pipelined I declare a local
collection I fill it up I extend to make
room
I had the new object type instance and I
return it that's that's a typical peel
circle function in other words I run all
my code and when I'm done I return the
value in other words my sequel statement
waits for it to finish with a pipeline
version every time I'm ready I pipe it
back out and when I return I return
nothing but control I don't return any
data it's an odd-looking function if
you're not used to pipeline functions
why would you do this well the reason
you would do this is that as you pass or
pipe rows back to the calling query and
pipeline table functions can only be
called inside a select statement
non non pipeline table functions can be
called in normal appeal sequel anyway as
the rows are passed back the selects
daemon can take advantage of it so in
the little script that I wrote here we
go back to the what I've done is add
where where row num is less than 10 so
only get me the first nine rows I don't
care about all the rest of it and what
you'll find is that the performance of
the pipeline function is way better than
the non pipeline version because this
query is grabbing each rows it spiked
back in as soon as it gets nine it says
I'm done stop the function and it
terminates the function with the non
pipeline version you might you might
construct an array with 10,000 rows in
it you pass back the 10,000 rows
consuming all the processing time all
the PGA you pass it back to the koreahas
Allah I just wanted the first nine rows
so that's one example in which
pipelining can be enormous ly performant
you also commonly use it with
parallelization parallel enabled
functions in data warehouse operations
so Dennis I'm not sure that that
answered your question probably some of
it but I thought it'd be a nice little
segue into just explaining the
difference between pipeline functions
and non pipeline table functions and
again in 12 say
you can now use them use the arrays so
if I can now use a collection so here's
my associative array ah this is an
example of how you can now bind
collections but I can also select from
table of the collection so this was
never possible before 12c and now we're
basically giving you the same
functionality across all the different
types of collections with the exception
in some cases still if string indexed
arrays can you
please share in the table function
sequel coder give me the web link well
let's so here's a tip for you in general
use live sequel so live sequel which is
where I've put the script for the
comparison of implicit and explicit
cursors is a live a website where you
have live access to an Oracle database
instance in fact eighteen see if you're
not yet up you don't you know don't yet
have access to an 18 C database you can
come to live sequel Oracle comm and
check out 18 see features
now what I've done is put a lot of
different scripts we'll just take a look
at my little library of scripts I put
about 200 PL sequel scripts in here so
these are all my public scripts I've got
over 200 now and my suggestion is you've
come here and do some searching so let's
go to the home page and let's look for
table function and as you can see lots
of examples of using table functions so
pretty much my suggestion is that you
come to live sequel if you've got a
question about my code come to live
sequel and take a look at and just do a
search on the keywords and then you can
drop dive in and take a look at the
different examples and you'll see
examples for example this is a streaming
table function example so we go through
building up a function type debate in
the collection show you how to use it in
the table clause I've got explanations
here so so my answer would be in general
go to live sequel check out my scripts
and you'll almost certainly find what
you need and if you can't find it let me
know follow me on Twitter put in a
request for an example and we'll get to
it ok thanks for joining me for this
latest PL sequel 101 office hours
hopefully you've enjoyed learning about
different ways to fetch single rows and
exploring the alternatives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
