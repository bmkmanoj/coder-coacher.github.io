serviceability architect at oracle
serviceability to me means all the
things that make it possible to look
into the JVM to grab information out of
the JVM and also to control the JDM so
it's it's a wider range wide range of
things all from debugger to jmx heap
thumps but it also includes the tools we
use internally to debug the JVM itself
how we look at core files and such today
we're going to talk about how to
diagnose your application on the JVM and
I will have to show you this first so
we've all been there right you have your
application deployed everything is
running fine until it doesn't you get a
tweet from a customer a red light is
blinking somewhere on a console and
something is bad now what do you do
hopefully you have all the tools in
place to go looking for the problem
wherever it is this session today we're
going to talk about the tools that are
included in the JDK so if you have the
JDK installed you will have all these
tools ready to go as long as you know
how to use them of course these are some
of the things we will cover today it's
of course going to be an overview I
don't have time to go into details of
every single tool I hope to show you the
tool so I hope to put the emphasis on
the new things that we've added in the
last couple of years and that session is
going to be mostly demos and what could
go wrong with that and
apart from doing demos I'm also going to
talk a little bit about the internals of
these tools how they all work together
how it can how they connect to the JVM
are they get the information out of the
JVM but let's begin with the demos I
hope this is large enough to see at the
back no one's complaining good so I'm
going to start with the command line
tools some of the visual tools can be
more powerful but sometimes all you have
is access to a command line and i'm
going to start there and we will look at
some visual tools a bit later let's
start with the simplest thing how do you
find out what java processes are running
on your system well there is a tool
called JPS and you run that you get a
list of the currently running JVMs their
process identifiers and the main class
for each one you can add more options
and now we get to see the command line
arguments for each one as well we can
have either even more options and we get
to see the virtual machine options as
well so the GC process here will started
with a maximum heap of 150 megabytes in
jdk 7 we added another powerful tool
called J command and its simplest it
does the same thing as the APS it lists
the processes it happens to include the
the arguments by default but otherwise
it's very similar but J command is much
more powerful that it can send
diagnostic commands to the JVM the JVM
can execute something and send a
response back so we can for example take
this sleeper process we send the vm dot
version to it and we would get a reply
saying what version of the vm that is we
can ask it for its command line
and we see that it was started with
verbose GC and it's running the sleeper
process if you find it tedious to to
type the process identifier you can
actually type the name of the main class
as well so you can do sleeper vm done
and if you want to send the same command
to all the currently running processes
you can use the zero as meaning all of
the processes that are currently running
so vm but up time for example they seem
to have been all started at about the
same time when I prep this demo of
course but how do you know what commands
that there exists for forge a command
well you can actually ask the vm for a
list of the command so sleeper help we
see what commands are available there
aren't that many currently but we hope
to be adding more and more and you can
do help for a specific command as well
so help vm flags will show you that this
command will print vm flag options and
their current values and that there is
an option dash all to it to print all
the currently supported flags so let's
let's try it out the flags we see that
the it was started with an initial heap
side max-heap slice print GC it was
actually started with verbose TC but
that actually just sets the print GC
flag and uses compressed ops and
parallel jeezy crank what if we do dash
all a long list there are actually 670 I
have no idea what most of these days
another thing with J command is that you
can batch command so if we have a little
list of commands in a file we can send
them all at once so J command sleeper
dash f we get to see them executed one
after the other first we see the version
than the vm arguments and then the
uptime that can be useful if you have a
batch thing you want to run every now
and then to check your process for
example from a configuration and
environment point of view it can be
interesting to see the system properties
so there's a command for lab so we get a
list of all the system properties we can
see for example the classpath not very
interesting in this example but could be
useful the most useful command is
probably they want to dump all the
threads and I'm sure you've seen a
thread stack trace before a thread dump
before usually you get one by sending
sink wit to the process or control brake
on Windows or using the J stack command
but you can do the same thing with Jacob
and thread that print we get to see all
the threads and the stack trace for for
each thread you can see where is the
main thread here you can see the
priority of the thread an internal
thread identifier the operating systems
identifier you can see some state of the
thread what it's doing and you get the
stack trace its it's doing sleep that's
what sleeper does what may not be so
well-known is that the using this thread
dump you can also find dead locks in
your process so if we do this against a
process that has a deadlock I happen to
have one
thread print we get the same thread
stack traces here but at the bottom it
prints up found one Java level deadlock
we see that thread one is waiting to
lock a monitor which is held by thread 0
and thread 0 is waiting to lock a
monitor held by thread 1 so a classic
deadlock we also have the stack traces
for both of those threads down here and
you can go hunting for that deadlock
this also works for Java util concurrent
locks if you happen to be using that so
we have the same kind of output thread
one is waiting for an honorable
synchronizer which is actually a Java
util concurrent locks reentrant log
non-ferrous inc which is held by thread
0 red 0 is doing the same thing for
thread 1 so they're stuck again and we
get to see the stack trace well a lot of
more frames this time but the
information is there so a quick recap we
looked at discovery how to find JVMs
that are running we look to some of the
options the environment and to look at
threads all using J command and jps so
far the JVM also exports a number of
very detailed information about the
garbage collection and the JIT compiler
for example and the tool to use to look
at that is called j stat so we're going
to use j start to look at collections in
young space as they happen so first we
need to find a process identifier so j
stat and i'm going to use this GC
process GC new Oh wrong wonder GC new
and then I want to see output every
second and this is what we see a lot of
data I'm going to break there
I'm going to look at some of these
values only over here is the young space
GC index number so there's one GC
happening there and a couple and another
one there add another one yeah that's
the same one but we also get to see the
Eden capacity or the young space
capacity it stays the same 16 megabytes
for all this the usage on the other hand
is going up and down because well this
process is just allocating stuff and we
get to see the timing for each garbage
collection looks like it takes almost a
second for each one up I don't know why
I find it very weird Jace Ted can do
other things Jace that the options will
tell you what it can do for example I'm
just going to take one of these we can
do dash class and I need that it again
we see that there are currently 1052
classes loaded and that they take up two
megabytes of space it took 400
milliseconds to load those classes just
that kind of presents the data in a
readable fashion one might argue about
that but you can also look at the raw
data which is less readable you can do
that with Jacob and her counter prints
on the GC process for example and we get
to see a whole range of different
counters that are available and this
this way I don't know how many there are
two hundred fifty eight different values
currently export it that way so let's
look a bit about what we can do with
with the heat from from a command line
let's for example run a little program
that leaks memory so we put that in the
background we take a look at
the classes in all the objects actually
on that heap we print the class
histogram for for that process so for
each class we're going to see how many
instances there are now I'm going to
look at the top of this list for example
here we see that we have a hundred and
sixty-eight thousand instances of hash
map entries taking up five megabytes of
space and the key class or we have
almost the same Mountain a number of
instances of that if we run it again we
see that the number has increased we run
it again and same thing so a typical
memory leak you don't get very far with
looking at the memory leak this way but
at least you can find that there is a
memory you can find out what class is
leaking you if you want to drill into
more detail you have to create a heap
dump you can then look at the heat time
using a visual tool for example visualvm
or eclipse memory analyzer are good
tools for looking at that creating one
of course you do with Jacob and so Jacob
and leak GC heap them cope oops we have
to provide an argument the file name
where we want to save that dump leak
dump heap file created yeah 86 megabytes
of dumped heap and we can take a look at
it with the show vm open file leak them
wait for that to start
so you get to see all the information
about the heap and in visual vm i'm not
going to go through all the different
things you can see here but for example
you can get a class histogram the same
thing we saw from the command line we
can see that when i did this there were
already almost a million instances of
these two classes that are leaking using
a visual vm you can drill down into
great detail about this so you can look
at every instance you can see what the
values are for every field on the heap
this one is an int that's a value of 60
for whatever reason you can also compare
to heap dumps so there's an option over
here to compare to heap thumps so you
can see the difference between them but
i'm not going to demo all of that but
it's good to know where it is now let me
kill that leaker so i don't waste all my
memory ok so let's move over to more
graphical tools the newest member in
this class is java mission control which
you might have seen here it is you
started with bin JMC java mission
control allows you to view processes
live so we can connect to one of these
processes over here over on the left
side here we have the list of all the
processes if we connect to one of them
we get to see data live from that
process we can see garbage collections
we can see how many threads there are we
can see cpu usage so down here i'm not
sure you can see this but there's a
little graph down here that shows the
memory of the process this is jmx based
yes you can see the system properties
here as well you can see for every
thread you can
the stack trace for it and an
interesting feature is allocation I'm
sure you can't see this in the back but
for every thread here we can list how
many bytes it has allocated we can sort
on it we see that the main thread has
allocated 15 gigabytes right now well
that's what this program does it just
allocates memory and then throws it away
but you can as you said it's jmx based
you can take a look at all the m beans
that are here I think no you can't what
could go wrong with doing a live demo
there you go and if you have your your
own ambience deployed you could you
would see those here as well there is
some advanced features to create
triggers here for example you can be
watching one of the M beans and create a
trigger to say that for example if the
cpu usage has been higher than eighty
percent for more than 10 seconds then
please send me an email or something
like that or create a heap dump or
something like that no it can't be
scripted you have to do it through this
little you I hear another new feature in
7u40 is the flight recorder so for which
is over here a flight recorder is a
non-intrusive profiler and tracer it's
it's built into the JVM itself it
captures information a lot of it from
both the JVM and the java application
running on top of the JVM and then you
can do offline analysis in the UI in
Mission Control so we can quickly create
a recording here
and yes not going to show all the fancy
stuff that are available but we started
recording you can see it running down
here ten percent done I set at one
minute recording I'm not going to have
the patience to wait for that but we can
we can cancel it and it should create
the recording on the JVM and then send
it back to Mission Control so that we
can take a look at it and if things work
it should be arriving any second no oh
there it is so in a way the UI here
looks similar to what we saw in the in
the console the jmx console but what
we're looking here at here is not live
data we're looking at a capture of
something that happened but it does have
a ton of information in it so for
example we can go looking at hot methods
there's a profiler well it's not very
relevant for this little program I was
running but you could have didn't to
them we can for this program may be a
memory is more interesting we can look
at garbage collections and I'm sure no
one can see this either at the back but
we see here garbage collection we see
heap usage going up and down we see
these red thin lines r GC pause times we
have a list of all the garbage
collections for each one we see all the
different phases the garbage collector
goes through for each face we get quite
a lot of information about what happened
during that phase be very helpful to dig
down into what actually goes on in
inside of the JVM
sorry you can't start a program from
from from inside the Mission Control
Mission Control can be run as a plug-in
to eclipse and Eclipse can start your
program but you can have it all inside
of the same IDE if you want Mission
Control is written on eclipse RCP sorry
you don't need eclipse we ship it as a
standalone program but there's also
version that it that works as a plug-in
inside of eclipse if you want to have it
running there it doesn't it's not
available for netbeans as a plug-in but
you can run in standalone as I'm doing
here so that was always going through
show about flight recorder today I have
another session tomorrow which I will go
into a little bit more detail show a bit
more demo about flight recorder and mark
is hurt from Mission Control is doing a
tutorial session later today with more
information about flight recorder as
well I'm going to go back to my command
line or another command line so far
we've been looking at live processes but
we can also actually look at core files
using these tools core files are may be
most useful for for vm developers but
sometimes they can capture information
for that are interesting for java
developers as well you can hopefully you
you won't see core files from the vm
crashes hopefully you won't see the in
crash put but you can create core files
with the G chord utility for example and
we can we can for example look at thread
dumps from a core file so I have a core
file here it's 810 min ago I exercise
we can then run J stack on that and to
do that we need to specify the actual
program that was running when the core
file was created so something like that
the program and the core file and it
prints out the the normal stack traces
it also does the same kind of a deadlock
analysis so it found the deadlock and
the earth at two threads involved in the
deadlock so this is actually running the
serviceability agent which is a tool a
part of the of the JDK I that is more or
less a full-fledged debugger so this
will attach to the process to the core
file using a debugger and dig out the
information from there we can run run
other tools on it as well so we can do a
class histogram I'm the same yes you can
core think you got that right so we got
a class histogram where's the top of it
they're from this from the core file we
can get some general a heap information
from it so we see some statistics on the
on the heat for example there's 23
points a very detailed number usage of
the eden space in this case
oh and I should probably show you as
well for for a flight recorder you can
start a flight recording from the
command line as well you don't have to
use that use the UI to do that so you
can do Jake command the GC process jf r
dot start I think yeah it says it
started a recording we can DJ far to
check to see that there is a recording
currently running we can do stop ID too
I think no not that how do you do it
help j4 stop no he'll help oh so it's
called it's not called ID it's called
recording recording oh stop the
recording that could be useful so um
sorry no I can't look at it from the
command line I have to use the visual
tool to look at it so back to PowerPoint
that was the end of the demo we've been
looking at jps and jacob and to list
processes and send diagnostic commands
we look at the inversion thread print GC
class histogram heap dump we use J stats
to see performance counters we took a
quick look at both Mission Control and
Java flight recorder now I'm going to
talk a little bit about the internals
how this all works behind the scenes but
first let me mention that there are a
couple of ways to access a vm remotely
which I didn't demo the first one is
using jmx that what is what the Mission
Control visualvm and jconsole uses
using a jmx you can access all the
information from java.lang management
jmx uses both SSL and authentication to
protect the connection typically you
enable it at startup with a HD option or
you can do it at runtime using Jacob and
there's also j stat d which is a demon
that runs on a remote machine and allows
j stat to access the information
remotely and it can access the same
information as it sees locally that
doesn't provide any security or
authentication so be a bit careful of
running that so discovery how do we find
out what's running how did JPS and J
command list the processes that we run
at a JVM that we're running it's
actually rather simple there is a well
known location and / temp HS perf data
on the school username in that direction
directory every JVM that starts up will
create a little file that will be named
by the process identifier of the JVM and
all JPS and Jacob and does is list these
files the file is created when the JVM
starts it's deleted when the JVM exits
but if the JVM should happen to crash or
exit for another bad reason there will
be dangling files left there so what
happens is that when a JVM starts it
will actually go through that list of
files and delete any unreferenced files
that don't have a process running for
them and that way since both JPS and Jay
command are actually Java processes when
the JVM starts it will clean up this
directory for them and then when they go
looking they won't see any stale data
anymore if there had been any there is
another way of doing discovery which is
new in 7u40 the Java discovery protocol
in this mode the JVM will broadcast a
broadcast package
on the local network saying Here I am
Here I am Here I am every five seconds
the broadcast package will contain the
main class name a unique ID so that you
can differentiate between them and a and
the jmx service URL that you can use to
connect over game x to that vm you
enable it either with a command line
option or with JQ man in most cases
though these little tools use attached
to talk to the JVM if it's locally
running attaches a little protocol that
allows for sending commands for
execution in the JVM and then receive
some text output from the JVM and the
JVM could have process the command and
done something attached allows only
local access by the same user to provide
security and this is what J command J
stack j map j info all these little
tools are using the actual mechanics for
how this is implemented differ on on the
different platforms on the unique sistas
the process goes like this the the
process that wants to attach J command
for example will create a well-known
file in temp it will then send secret to
the JVM well normally sending secret to
a JVM will cause it to print out all the
threads but if it sees this well-known
file it won't do that instead it will
create a socket in a file also with a
well-known name and that socket is then
used for communication between the JVM
and J command for example in this case
Solaris works the same way except it
uses the door API instead of sockets for
historical reasons on Windows things are
a little bit different here the remote
process Jacob and in this case will
inject running code into the JVM sounds
scary doesn't it and this is this is
allowed by windows
long as you have the right credentials
and here it's only loud by being the
same user in the same session it will
actually allocate memory in the remote
process then write some code in that
memory it will call create remote thread
which starts your thread in the JVM
which will then call this code that we
put in there together with some
arguments and this will then actually do
the attached in the remote JVM and set
up a pipe so that they can talk back and
forth later on so diagnostic commands
these are small helper routines inside
of the JVM they can gather information
from the JVM or they can change some
state in the JVM they can provide text
output only this is what J command
execute you can also execute these in
jdk 8 by using over jmx so remotely you
can access all of these little commands
as we see the scene they provide some
kind of self-describing help facility
and in fact when you implement one of
these in the JVM you have to provide the
help text you have to declare all the
options that takes and and provide a
little help text for each one so that we
can have this nice Jacob and help
functionality because there's going to
be a different set of commands for for
each version of the JVM and it's going
to be hard to keep track of which are
actually available in that JVM so these
are going to be spokes over jmx and
Mission Control will have the ability to
run them remotely yes in jdk
um so j stat we saw that we created we
have this little file in temp HS perf
data named by the process identifier
it's not an empty file this actually has
all the data that j stat wants to look
at all these perf counters that i listed
there were two hundred and sixty
something of them it's a memory map file
so the JVM goes ahead and runs its
business and it will keep updating this
memory location in its process it will
get reflected in the file by the
operating system and so J stud can read
this file and get the data out of the
JVM in that way and you can see it by
using j stat or you can dump the
contents with jacob and if you want to
see the actual details so a little
diagram showing all the different ways
that we can access we have J command J
stack game update info they use the
attached framework to attach into the vm
attach them calls diagnostic commands
inside of the JVM to actually execute
things and the result is being sent back
that way we have JVM stat which is the
memory map file that j stat can read and
if you want you could start j stat d
instead and then you can read the data
remotely over rmi from from j stat we
also have jmx clients Mission Control
visualvm Jake on fo for example there
are others out there as well they use
jmx over the network or locally too
attached to or are to communicate with
with the JVM and the jmx server that
runs inside a JVM process if we look at
the same protocols in a different way we
can see that there are both one-way
tools j stat JVM plot and there are two
ways like attaching jmx some of them
work remotely jmx j study some of them
are only local like attached and Jamie
and
in case that we took a look at the core
files earlier this used the
serviceability agent which is actually a
a full-fledged debugger but it does have
a lot of it has a lot of information
about the JVM it knows how the JVM is
works how its laid out how the data in
the JVM looks like and it uses a
debugger to read that in from a core
file or from a process it should be used
a little bit of caution as a last resort
because it will suspend the process if
you run it against the process in an
unknown state so data might be corrupted
or non readable you can use it with J
stack for example by saying the
executable and core file as we did or
with the dash F option you can attach it
to a running process as well sorry I
can't really hear it does it understand
it doesn't understand the metal space
limited I think there's some support in
there but it's not as good as it could
be so J stack game up J info can be run
using serviceability agent in this case
they use a debugger to attach to the JVM
process to read out information from
there there is a description inside of
the JVM called vm symbols which
describes all the data structures that
JVM uses and this is what serviceability
agent will figure out and know how to
access the fields of all the structures
inside a JVM
so something bad happened with my slides
here you can't really see everything up
there but whatever java flight recorder
this is something new that's come back
we released in 7u40 two weeks ago the
this is a JVM built-in profiler and
tracer it's designed to be very non
intrusive so that it can be always
running without causing too much
overhead we typically see overhead in
the range of two to three percent when
we run it with benchmarks flight
recorder captures information both from
the JVM and from the java application it
will show a lot of information about
garbage collections about locks how the
compilers operating what exceptions are
being thrown the CPU usage it also shows
I oh so you can see what files are being
accessed and what sockets you are
reading and writing to so it normally
runs in a like a profiler you you attach
to the JVM you create a recording and
then you look at the recording offline
but it can also be run in after the fact
analysis mode where it's continuously
running in the JVM it's capturing data
into a circular buffer and then when you
see that something is going wrong with
your application you can request a dump
of these buffers and now you have the
data leading up to your problem instead
of starting the investigation after the
problem occurred and then seeing what
happened so that is why it takes its
name from flight recorder inside of the
JVM flight recorder has many
instrumentation calls all over the JVM
so in the compiler and the garbage
collector in the runtime they all
provide data to flight recorder there's
also a Java API that collects
information from the Java layer all of
this information is captured into
threadlocal buffers to avoid
synchronization as much as possible once
these buffers fill up buffers fill up
they are transferred to a large
global buffer and eventually they end up
on disk in a binary propriety format
that is designed to be as efficient as
possible for writing out the data from
the JVM the whole thing is managed over
jmx so that is what Mission Control
would use to connect to the JVM and and
control flight recorder and speaking on
Mission Control Mission Control has a
jmx console that we looked at earlier
allows for online monitoring and
management of a process there's an mbean
browser there are triggers and alerts
that we saw and Mission Control is also
the UI for Java flight recorder Mission
Control is also released in 7u40 you
started there with bin JMC I'm going to
have time to talk a little bit about the
future of course we will be adding more
and more diagnostic commands to the JVM
hopefully we will eventually be
replacing Jay slack j map j info all
these tools with a consistent interface
to j command and one tool to rule them
all we're not really there yet but we're
working on it we are also considering
enhancements to jmx you may know that
there was a j MX two dot oh that just
barely didn't make it into jdk 7 and
it's it's getting kind of old now but we
are looking at taking cherry-picking
some of the features from j MX two dot 0
and and putting them in there things we
are thinking about our annotations for
making it easier to create mbeans adding
a rest protocol so that you can access
jmx using rests with whatever you like
to program dressed in we're also
thinking about batched updates so you
can do several operations that
same time there is a java enhancement
proposal for improving the logging in
the JVM hasn't had time we haven't had
time to put any resources on that yet
but something we would like to do we're
also considering and I would love to
have feedback on this removing jconsole
or making it into its own project that's
because we currently are shipping three
different UIs three different consoles
we have jconsole Mission Control and
visual vm and the only one we're not
actually actively developing is Jay
console and the others provide a
superset of the j console functionality
similar thing for the h prof agent we
think that it the functionality provided
by the h prof agent is available in
other ways as well and so we would like
to retire that and j hat is a little
tool that you can use to actually look
at he bumps but visualvm and eclipse
memory analyzer i think provides a much
better way of doing that so well we're
nearing the end of the presentation I've
spoke too fast probably key takeaways
from this anyway is to know what tools
exists out there you have seen some of
them being used hopefully you'll learn
something new something useful and I
encourage you to go and experiment with
the tools and I'd love to have feedback
especially on what's missing what would
you like to see in there in the toolset
that we provide there are two more
sessions related to flight recorder at
least accept my got cut off again but
later today 10 Marcus hurt is doing a
tutorial on Mission Control on flight
recorder so you can see exactly how it
works and tomorrow I have a session on a
flight recorded behind the scenes where
we take a look at our flight recorder
works
so inside of the JVM how it's all
implemented and with that I'd like to
open up for questions yeah so the flight
recorder is a commercial offering it's
free for use in development but we
charge for it in production type
environments but and that's the only
tool that we charge for the other
serviceability agent all the other tools
are free and open source Mission Control
isn't open source it's actually I think
covered by the same license as flight
recorder there are details on the web
page exactly on what what the license is
I i I'm not a lawyer so I can't detail
them but yeah yeah
so I use J command to print up system
properties but can i print up just one
property using Jacob and no you have to
list all of them and you can grab
through it yep so the question is is
eclipse memory analyzer going to be
needed when we have all these great
tools in the JDK well it's an it's an
open market I mean there are different
tools to do the same thing I'm sure
there are other commercial tools to look
at hip pro he pumps as well so no we
don't have any specific plans to go
through and do everything that Eclipse
MIT does no no no I think it's a great
tool and please use it we provide the
data to it and MIT provides the
visualization yeah so the question was
canvassed the the information from
Mission Control be visualized in a web
UI thing instead of running the
application not currently no the DJ max
part the console in Mission Control that
you could access anyone can access that
and anyone could write something that
shows it on a on a on a web page if you
want i'm sure there are tools out there
to do that but we don't provide one yep
yep yes they're all part of that well
almost not flight recorder flight
recorder is part of 7u40 it's going to
ship in jdk 8 when it
ships the the real version of it but
it's not available already accessed
versions okay thank you everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
