session thanks for coming this is the
adventurous developers guide to JVM
languages with me Simon maple from the
UK my voice is I've been at the booth
for about two days now and my and a cool
party last night with zero turn around
so my voice is on edge is the first of
two talk so hopefully it'll it'll last
till tomorrow first of all just a quick
thank you to zero turn around to the
guys I work for who shipped me out to a
lots of different places like like this
this is a this is a non non zero turn
around presentation and they allow me to
do all these funky presentations all
over the place so thank you to actually
make this possible and after this please
all go to the zero turn around website
and buy all their stuff because it helps
me to travel so this is me Simon maple
ex IBM I used to work for IBM for about
12 years as a developer of WebSphere
application server and so I'm don't say
partly to blame but there's a lot of
code near that's mine and I recently
moved to do turn around almost a year
ago and i'm now Technical Evangelist so
I do a lot of conference speaking and
also a lot of technical writing zero
turn around have a technical writing
area called rebel labs and we wrote a
whole bunch of technical reports and
things like that and this session it
actually came out of one of the reports
which we wrote called the adventurous
developers guide to JVM languages
surprise surprise and so you're welcome
to go there it's entirely free report
you can download the the full PDF which
covers most and everything that we're
talking about today and a whole bunch
more and they're about I think three
four five developers in zero turn around
who wrote this report and we each took a
JVM language from a from a you know
really start off point and basically
just tried to see what was what was
different from Java what was the same as
Java and tried to be a little bit of
interesting just to see what else was
out there in the JVM so that was me I'd
like to understand a little bit about my
audience so what I'd like to do is just
by a show of hands
get some information about you guys kind
of numbers about what languages you have
heard about that we're going to talk
about today and what languages we have
already used so I take it everyone here
has heard of Java as there were not
heard of job surprise surprise I'll take
it everyone who's used Java here as well
everyone Java developers apart from one
now you are a joke legs like so it was
100 100 Scala everyone heard of scala
anyone not heard of scala anyone not
heard of scholar nope I'm good who's
used scarlet before about fifty percent
that's pretty good everyone heard of
groovy anyone not heard of greevey No ok
who's used groovy before it's a good
number about fifty percent again who's
heard of closure about ninety percent
who's used closure all very few about
seven percent who's heard of ceylon
sampson who's used sale on two guys are
you red hot guys
okay okay he's heard of coke Caitlin
that's a very good number twenty-five
percent who's used coating before one
jetbrains guy no it's extend he's heard
of extend five percent and who's used
extend one okay so this is that's you so
it's really good to see that everyone's
heard of all the languages are talking
about this is but this is a very very
typical graph on the right hand side
where everyone obviously has used Java
this is Java one of course it's good to
see you know that half people here have
actually used groovy and Scarlets it's
probably be our probably better industry
standard that about half people in Java
have at least tried either one of
scholar or greevey and then it's a shame
that the other language is really kind
of tied off because I think you know a
lot a lot of a lot of the people who
actually create these new languages put
a lot of innovation a lot of thought I
thought into the inter JVM languages and
also they're starting from scratch
typically in things like Java when
you're when you're emerging language
when you when you're evolving a language
you typically have preconceptions that
you have to stick with whereas with the
new land which is because you can start
from scratch you typically you know
start thinking outside the box how would
you want your applique how would you
want your jvm language to look if he was
dying from scratch so I think a lot of a
lot of the new concepts from some of
these early along with some of these
newer languages actually going to push
the innovation up into Java and you know
similarly a lot of these newer languages
actually use a lot of functionality from
the scholars in there and the grievous
so when we look at java java is you know
there's a lot of great things in java
but the underlying the underlying piece
of excellence of java is obviously the
JVM and you know when we when we talk
about java when most people talk about
java they're really kind of talking
about some of the awesome pieces of the
JVM people who are using scholar and
people here using greevey get a lot of
this
benefits and features of the JVM but
it's really the syntax and you know the
additional things like you know the
closures and lambdas and it interesting
new pieces of collections that they
actually want to use but the JVM is the
real power behind this and we can see
this very very easily if we just take a
look at the languages that are built for
the JVM all these languages will built
specifically from scratch for the JVM
platform we also have and more
interestingly a much larger number of
languages that were created or the wall
that were ported from existing languages
across to the JVM so each of these have
non JVM implementations and then they
were pooled across so we have a whole
bunch of languages both ported and
created for the JVM one of the worries
is is that what we are actually doing is
just creating a graveyard or a history
of languages which you know people
wanted to use for a particular reason
whether it was style whether it was
content and because we have so many
languages the community's going to be
spread thinly across all of these
languages and without that community
backing how these language is ever going
to going to stay there and stay popular
you know for the length of time say Java
has so yeah it is it is a worry that by
creating so so many languages and with
technologies like antelope technologies
like with x10 sorry with X text it's
getting easier and easier to what I say
easy Ernie users obviously ridiculously
hard but it's getting easier and easier
to you know start and create your new
language if you wanted to say i don't
know maybe Scarlett I love scholar but I
wanted something else do people try and
people trying to prove scholar and press
call it to the way they want or do they
try and just start from scratch and say
this is my new language that I want to
use but you know at the same time
another on the other side of the hand we
don't want to we don't want to stop
creating JVM languages because you know
there's a lot of innovation that comes
out of JPM languages and we'll see we'll
see from some of the some of the later
and you know newer languages around
there are some big differences between
you know the newer languages just from a
year or two old can compare to the java
and we don't want to stop that
innovation so there's a kind of fine
balance between creating no not so many
new languages that they just
they just died away very very quickly
it's just a massive waste of everyone's
time but equally we want to make sure
that we continue the innovation of the
languages so this is a nice little
timeline of a lot of the language that
were going to be talking about today
obviously Java very very early 90s was
was created version 10 in 96 I'm going
to be talking obviously a little bit
about Java rates and the ones I want to
kind of focus on today a little bit is
Ceylon coat in and extend so we're going
to we're going to dip into some code on
java SE lo and coating and extend today
and then have a look at some of the
others just in slide format for each of
these languages during the report when
we created this we wanted to write a
kind of not necessarily a Noddy piece of
code not like a Hello well piece of code
but we wanted to write something a
little bit better but not too complex so
we wrote an HTTP server for each of
these languages and all our
implementations are on github so you can
go there take a look compilot have a
play and as part of this I guess
introduction to learning some of these
languages we tried to put in as many of
the language features as we could within
reason to these implementations and then
we're going to talk about going to refer
back to that during this presentation so
initially we job right then so job rates
20 years just a little bit over 20 years
old now I think it was 91 it was first
it was first actually created and
obviously there are huge numbers of
people around the world using this so
when Java comes out with new features
new functionality API changes
improvements it can't just start from
scratch I can't say right yeah this is
an interface this is great but what I'm
going to do is actually going to change
this to this new interface no one has to
now use this interface it breaks many of
the existing users we can't just change
interfaces on the fly so whenever we
look at changes in Java there are three
golden rules for java changes that first
of all don't break binary compatibility
secondly don't introduce sourcing
compatibility and thirdly manage your
behavioral compatibility changes so in
short the three things here is
make sure everything still compiles make
sure everything still links and make
sure that what was happening before
still happens now no don't want to break
existing implementations so let's now
have a little play in Java right so what
I've got here is a Eclipse instance with
the latest openjdk build which i'm using
to compile these balls with and is that
i think there's other the codes actually
we're bigger so you should be able to
see that and let's talk about lambdas
first so in in Java right there are a
couple of new or a few new things in
Java rate which people are talking about
i'm sure you've heard about all of them
in this conference already lambdas
default methods and streams those are
you know the big three i guess in in in
java right so what's allowed by lambda
is implemented in Java 8 as as a Sam
type and a Sam type is a single abstract
method so let's take a look at what a
simple a single abstract method is here
we have a couple of examples we have
runnable that code sighs okay for you
guys little bit bigger yeah okay yep
yeah so we have a runnable a run will
obviously has one abstract method run
and we also have a comparator so we can
see one comparator their wine abstract
method compared and to use a lambda we
have we creating a new runnable there
and we use the lambda and implementation
for it so for runnable we have no
parameters and we have a simple piece of
code here which does a system out print
line of hello lambda very very simple
one piece of code if we wanted to do
something similar to that before who
would have to write an anonymous in a
class or something like that as a
comparator yep pretty similar but in
this case we've got we've got a couple
of parameters coming in and then we use
those integers parameters later in the
in the lander implementation so pretty
simple nothin too nothin too shocking
but very very clean in in one line and
this is these are the
you know other programming languages has
been doing for many many years now so
this isn't by any stretch new but for
for java is groundbreaking so let's now
take a look at how we would actually
oops how we would actually use a single
abstract method actually use lambdas to
get a pass in a lambda to call so here
we have an interface a public interface
action with one method such as a single
abstract method so it qualifies as being
a interface we could use as a lambda so
we have a at the top functional
interface and this is basically saying
to the compiler when it's being compiled
this is this is a Sam type and all I
want you to verify that you know
everything's okay and if there's
something wrong please throw me an
exception and we'll see that a little
bit later to actually make use of this
here we have an execute class and we
have an execute method in that xq method
we're taking action as a parameter so
we're just taking an interface that you
know as a parameter we can pass in class
of that type we call action run as the
action interface has the run method
passing in a string hello main method is
now the interesting part where we call
execute we're actually passing in a
lambda and this lambda takes in a
parameter string and all we do with that
parameter string is just a simple system
out print line of that of that string
parameter if I was to run this we get
hello so the parameter that we're
passing in is this hello and everything
works fine because there's actually only
one parameter and we can we can infer
the type we actually don't need the
parameter so we can save that run that
and we still get hello because there's
actually only one input we can actually
remove this entirely and use a new funky
syntax like that and what what we're
essentially doing is you know we're
parsley this is a one-parameter syntax
whereby the one parameter that we that
we get passed in will get past a to
print Lin message with print lien
method so we can run that and we get
hello again so we're actually looking at
a really really simple code really
really neat and easy to read code which
which is more important easily
maintained code whereas before we would
have to write something ridiculous like
you know a big an honors class and so on
and actually write the door at the
implementation right the right the
override and so on yes if you want if
you wanted to reference that if you
wanted to do anything special so let's
say spring concatenation or some spring
string a concatenation or something like
that you would actually then have to do
what we did earlier and actually say
param and then actually use the string
that there's not there's no it there's
no item like in grieving out okay so yes
of so when you're using when you are
using lambdas but what the bike hope
will actually do is it will create a new
method I believe because we did this we
did this earlier with an earlier version
of the width of the token JDK we did a
Java p of of the bytecode and I believe
we actually had a new method created
called lambda dollar 0 or something new
anonymous class created for us because
of that and interestingly when we when
we actually tried to create some new
ones of the same name we then got we
then got an exception back saying you
can't do that you've already got a jeep
message I tried that earlier with the
latest version and I and I actually
couldn't see that via the bytecode so
I'm not sure exactly what the bytecode
is doing now but that's certainly how
how it worked out
right okay it's Nev I go Michael okay
okay so next if we if we go back to the
action interface now if we did something
a little bit more interesting so let's
say we wanted a second method here which
we're going to call stop all of sudden
we get an exception straight out from
our builder and if we look at that we
get two exceptions the first one I'm not
massively kiel an unexpected functional
interface annotation what that's really
saying is you know this is a functional
interface and you can't have multiple
abstract methods the second exception is
actually coming from the execute Java
which is pretty much just saying you
know you're trying to trying to use a
lambda here but the interface that
you're trying to use it against has
multiple isn't a sound type essentially
so how do we how can we get round this
well as I'm sure you're all aware we can
use a default and after we've default we
actually have an implementation so here
we now have an interface with two
methods one of which is implemented one
of which is still abstract as a result
everything works and we can go back to
execute method and we can run that again
and everything still works so default
values this this is a something which i
absolutely love now in Java if I for
example have an interface here we have a
default method one-to-one default method
on on this interface which has an
implementation which is just a plain sis
out if i now have a class which
implements that same interface we can
essentially just instantiate this class
cool default method on that and if i was
to run this where we're getting that
like we're getting that system out as
you would expect the interesting point
here is this is just that the sisters to
play in class with with you know no
methods that were overriding and we're
actually getting implementation so you
know the one bad thing about default
methods is that we're actually clouding
the clouding the water between what
interfaces and what an abstract classes
so for example here we have an interface
with implemented methods on the other
hand I could have an abstract class with
entirely abstract methods and then all
of a sudden our abstract class is
looking more like an interface and our
interface is actually looking more like
an abstract class so yeah I mean you
know this is muddying the water and
that's a shame but the the value which
we actually get from a default method is
very very large because now we can
change interfaces existing interfaces in
Java and we don't break one of the
golden rules which is source
compatibility weakens people can still
compile against us even though they're
implementing an interface that has a new
method that they're not actually
providing an implementation for and this
is this is very very valuable so let's
take our lists example here we have an
ArrayList we have added three pieces to
three items strings to our ArrayList
Java one and 2013 if I wanted to iterate
over this arraylist and print things out
I would have to have a for loop and you
know a whole bunch of stuff which you
know in that for loop have a code block
and actually perform operations on each
item now what we can do though is
something very very neat which is called
for each and the for each method is a
default method on the I think it's on
the iterable class at which collections
extend and now this has an
implementation so anything that has
implemented the collections object or an
iterable object doesn't need to override
this so it'll still compile because we
already have that default implementation
so here I could just do a system out
front men run this code and we get drive
1 2013 so a really really neat way and
this is this is looking more and more
groovy and Scala like weather day yeah
it's pretty much so one of the things
that some people were sure disagree with
this but for me the reason that
Java is getting a lot of these are
really down to scarlet and groovy really
pulling pulling the language up I don't
know I don't know how much of the the
functionality and features in job right
we would have today if it wasn't for if
it wasn't for languages like Scala and
groovy so for me I think you know the
innovation that's happening in Java is
really down to the innovation that's
happening outside of Java and and you
know things like they said so when we're
saying yes these these this is very much
like scarlet rates it is and it's great
that that Java can stay stable for me
personally that is great that Java can
stay stable and all these other
languages can innovate round and put as
much for their thoughts and innovation
into it and then when when things are
ready when things are proven when when
people can realize exactly what we want
in a JVM language we can pull those into
jobs so Java stays stable and Java gets
a lot of the great stuff yeah closures
and lamp is probably a bad example
because because they have been around
for many many years anyway and Java
should have had that many years ago
anyway but yeah there we are okay so
that's everything I had for Java 8 let's
move on to scholar than a habit of time
let's move on to scarlet so so scholars
one of the older languages that's on the
JVM and there are a few few key
differences between scholar and and Java
one of the biggies is that there's no
static keyword there's a there's a much
much bigger split in scarlet between
your instance and your annual kind of
class artifact so there's a companion
class and the companion class holds your
your static artifacts if you wanted to
you make use of them from your class you
can import in this case HTTP server
underscore which pulls in the static
artifacts that you can you can then make
use of variables and this is again going
to be very familiar to people who have
used most JVM languages vowel and var
instead of instead of a kind of normal
declaration in Java where you would have
things that were final things that
weren't because typically in Java very
often you you don't start off
why creating a variable and putting
final where whereas with other JVM
languages you typically start as a valve
and everything should be a vowel unless
you absolutely need it to be of our
whereas typically because there's so
much boiler code in Java you typically
don't start off with declaring a
variable and making it final so that's
that's a big kind of mindset change
between scholar and many other JVM
languages and Java so Val here is a
value this is the immutable value and
var is a variable so you can you can
then reassign later date case class is
another another nice piece of scala
whereby if you if you wanted to use a
case of switch you can actually create a
case class and the compiler under the
covers will provide implementations for
many different methods such as equals it
will also do a hash code it'll do it'll
do those kind of things and it does it
does some interesting pattern matching
under the covers as well here we're
actually using some of that here but
this is this is the code that we that we
use in our HTTP server and you know
usages usage is quite similar to to Java
here one other piece of Scarlet Witch
we're making use of here is something
that I believe should be in every single
language which is when we're calling
when we're creating this this status
object here sorry when we're making an
invocation to respond with HTML we're
creating a new status objects and notice
there's no new keyword there but we're
calling we're passing in parameters with
names so named parameters I've seen many
many better din vacations with about
like ten boolean values true false false
true true false false true and you go in
and try and change one anything 1 2 3 4
5 6 1 2 3 right there yeah that's the 1i
change yes I changed the wrong word and
you know it's ridiculous that in this
day and age we have we have method in
vacations with 10 boolean values and
we're having to count with our finger
across to try and work out which one to
change it's so simple just to say this
is my title and this is my valley this
is my body this is my value and you just
don't get confused if you have 10
billions you just have 10 names and
their billion values really
maintain really clean coat scarlet
strings again a very nice feature and
again adopted by many languages that
we're going to talk about today this is
multi-line language a multi-line string
denoted by the triple double quotes and
we have a little s before that which
basically means we can have
interpolation of values in a string so
we have a dollar sign and some curly
braces are believed in scholarly you can
actually emit the curly braces for
simple interrelations as well but we can
we're essentially just dropping the
values the variable values here into
this string so you don't need to add
string concatenation and so on so what
we're actually looking at here is
something very very similar to what you
would actually see when this when their
string is printed out rather than a
whole bunch of lines with can cat with
you know loads of pluses concatenations
and you know you kind of miss read it
sometimes null is also another very very
interesting part of scholar and many of
the different lands that will be talking
about today handle it in a different way
the lace collar deals with null or
should I say allows you to make a user
of your classes look and check for null
is using the option type and the option
type has two subtypes it has a some or
none so in this case this this to file
method is returning something of option
type and the inner type is a file so if
I'm writing this to file method I I know
that i am passing back either something
of type some or something of type none
so when someone calls me they're going
to have to look at this and say ah this
is an option let me check if it's of
type some if it's of type some I know
it's got a value in it if it's serve
time none then I actually have to do
some special case but way of making them
make this check if we just pass back an
object that could be no then you know a
lazy developer or someone who hasn't
read the docs might not know how to
handle or not but in this case we're
saying you know this null is important
if this is null you're gonna have to do
some
special so we can we can push that so in
both cases or sorry in the Sun case if
it is of type sum then you just get the
value and then you can handle the file
as you as you wish also notice there's
no returns that's because everything in
scholar as expressions so every code
block has a value at the end of it and
it's typically the very very last
expression in that code block so in this
case the last the last piece is either
some or none and that's the return value
of the method so complexity a lot of
people when they hear scholar
automatically think my God's Carla
that's a complex language should I even
look at it am I good enough to look at
it and scholar doesn't have to be
complex if you look at our scholar
implementation of the HTTP server it's
not complex you can look at it it's
beautiful code probably cuz I didn't
write it someone else did it's beautiful
code you can read it it's maintainable
it's easy you can see what it's doing
there's nothing we actually have to you
know really looking some docs and think
I wonder what this does it typically the
complexity of Scala is if down to a few
things first of all in Scala you can
write Scala functionally you can write
scala in an object orientated way you
can even combine the two there is no
such thing as a typical scarlett
developer you can have scholar
developers that are very object-oriented
minded so on that very functional minded
and only will code in functional and
some that mix the two so so straight
away you know if you have a team of
scarlet developers you could have
different developers looking code which
they're not comfortable with and that's
one of the big things there is no
typical scholar developer there are also
things that I don't say tanks Carla
that's a bit harsh but things like the
simple build tool one of the most
ironically titled tools available today
it's a very powerful tool but it's very
complex there are symbols there are
there hey is it really it's changed a
scale of building there we go there we
go it's I think that's that self
admission isn't it Connor okay the sky
built oh so it so it's not so ironic
but yeah it's quite cryptic if you
actually look at there a lot of symbols
and typically when people use SBT their
their copy pasting they don't start from
scratch also scholars and if many of you
have heard of scholars or even since
some scholars code i'm going to show you
some in a minute it's very much of a
functional programming in scala there's
also a complexity theory which is kind
of more of a mathematical you and
there's all all this kind of stuff which
some developers absolutely love and
there are many developers that don't
want to look at it and when you get
these different developers in the same
team it's very very hard for this for
some of these developers to maintain
each other's code I I did a I did a
quick google and i was told that this
session has been recorded so so don't
put anything blue in there and luckily I
I edited out some of the some of the
atrocities in this tweet but I did a
quick google for some scarlet
complexities and i came across this
which was interesting because that
they're making a comparison between
Scylla code and scholars okay so is this
typically Scala code you know is this
going to be is this the kind of thing I
should expect when I when I introduced
myself to scala this is scholars I I was
wondering how I mean yeah you know you
could kill yourself in a messy way or an
easy way but you know that I did
contemplate these kind of things when I
look at this code because it's not easy
to read it's it's very hard to maintain
there are lots of symbols which is
similar but actually have entirely
different things and you know this this
guy on Twitter yeah he's having a bad
experience of scholars and almost
blaming scarlet scarlet is still a you
know a nice easy to use language if you
are just doing plain scholar but this is
where I believe the complexities come
from yes
no right groovy so so groovy groovy is
Java supercharged one of the big things
about groovy is if you write Java code
that's groovy code so so there is a
really low bar to entry into jar into
the Scarlet any Java code will compile
as any Java code will compile as groovy
code so you all a Java developers you're
also grevioux developers put it on the
CV so it does try and stick to a lot of
the Java principles and a lot of the you
know the look and feel of Java know
there are some there are some really
good additions into jail inter inter
gravy not handling nulls in this case
we're doing 2d 2d references address and
street if either user or address or null
in Java would get a nullpointerexception
but we're dereferencing it in a safe way
here the ? dot is pretty much saying if
either if user is null or we've got an
address as well or if address is null I
don't need to throw a null pointer
exception I just want you to ignore this
line and don't run this line and so will
continue program it will continue
progressing to the next line quite a few
different languages do similar things to
this and there's still quite a split as
to whether people like this approach or
whether people actually say no if
there's a null I want to know about and
I want a null pointer exception not that
anyone actually does say i want to know
pointer exception but Elvis again user
this is a tertiary operation user name
if user name is null then return
username otherwise to return the string
anonymous it's just compacting existing
Java to be neater and easier to read
without boilerplate and groovy is very
very good for that closures closes again
very very simple when they do go no the
whole nine yards on this for using
closures here we've got a simple closure
square equals eight times it it in this
case is the item so there's a question
earlier about what is there in its in in
Java lambdas there isn't in Java
but in in groovy we have this we have
this notion of an it so for example in
the in the next line we have a
collection one two three four we call
collect passing in the closure square
and so what squares gonna do is going to
take each one of those items in the in
the collection and it's going to square
them so it's going to times it by itself
as a result we get 1 times 1 1 2 times 2
to 3 times 3 and so on very very neat I
do like the I do like the syntax of
greedy collections very very good as
well here we've got if we go straight
down to the third line we have a
collection of short names which we are
creating from a collection of the top
names and we're applying a filter to
that so we're saying names dot find all
so what we're saying and we're passing
in a closure here we're saying for every
item in the collection names check the
size if the size is less than or equal
to 3 I want to keep that if it's greater
than three I don't want it as a result
we get our short names collection back
and if we then do a dot each with just a
print line of each item we can see that
we omit the name Fred and we get Ted Ned
so really really simple code really easy
to read lovely grube 20 is dine attic
before 20 it was a dynamic language
after 20 there are also some static
parts so for example here we have some
method we have another method called
test which calls som m double e method
which would give us a runtime exception
if we were dynamic however we have a
type checked in groovy 20 which makes us
a little bit static so now because we
are having an annotation there we get a
compilation error saying that we can't
match this specific method fairly
straightforward but for people who you
know we're having a we're having a
balancing act really between dynamic and
Static languages and right now it's very
much leaning to static languages and so
this is groovy adding that static
support
a word from our sponsor well I've done
lots of slides and I haven't talked
about zero turn around oh my god very
very quick so zero turn around how to
have a tool called durable and durable
allows you to link your IDE code
directly to your runtime so as you
change code in your IDE those classes
which you change will instantly be made
available in your running runtime
there's no need for Bill there's no need
for deploy and because we have all all
these languages on the JVM some of them
share very very similar class loading
strategies Scala groovy and Java are all
supported by geral and as a result many
many people save much much time during
their development and this is our CEO
who saves lives and he we are over a
couple of beers so I'm struggling to
remember this now over a couple of beers
at javaone we were trying to work out
how many lives terrible saves I believe
durable socials has now saved one
developer it saved about 82 years of
redeploys I think overall with all out
with all our customers I believe we're
saving about one developers life every
two weeks so yeah we save lies moving on
closer so closure is a functional
language he likes functional languages
here who doesn't care who hates
functional languages me just me so no I
don't hate functional languages I
sometimes don't like the syntax of
functional languages but that's just me
hey we're all different clerk closure
has a ripple is its pleasures that plus
it's the language which really combines
a few different languages I think it
combines c-sharp I think it can but is
certainly combines a lisp and there are
some really useful features one's a
rebel with is read evaluate print loop
and it's the ability to effectively
right into a console and have those
lines of code automatically run one
after the other so I can continue typing
in this ripple and it will it will run
them one after the other as if you know
it's
one piece of code running in runtime
regularly it's nothing new placing users
/ users have used this for many many
years greevey as well you can actually
have a ripple and groovy i think it's
called groovy SH which you can do very
similar things here but one of the big
things even though you know we're
running this on a JVM platform obviously
functional principles still need to be
applied and so if you're moving from
something like Java across to a closure
then you know many of the things like
for example little or no side effects if
you call it if you call a function with
the same parameters you should always
get the same value back so for example
and we keep you an example of that a
stringtokenizer stringtokenizer next
every single time you call that you're
going to get something different because
it depends on the string you're holding
state side effects if you that something
that you typically wouldn't do in a
functional language you would do
something like a spitter which will show
you which will show you later this is
some code whoa it hurts my object
orientated eyes but i'm not sure i'm not
sure i've actually formatted this right
any closure ians think I formative this
wrongly yeah yeah I've had a couple of
comments people say I your formatting
this all wrong and a couple of people
say yeah no that's okay but we can chat
off that so yeah this this is you know
very very different compared so if
you're looking something like Scarlett
or groovy you know we still here we
still have a function call we have some
we have some variables going in we have
a little bit of dock on it and and we
have our method body so you know
obviously it's going to look kind of
similar but the way the way you look at
it's quite different let's get
functional so it's so this this area is
the actually this this part here is
showing where we actually do the split
lines this is again from our from our HS
for example HTTP HTTP server sample
whereas in all the other languages we
were using a stringtokenizer this is
just showing that you know if you're
gonna do closure don't don't be an
object orientated person writing closure
you have to get a mindset to be on a
functional program i'm going to find the
functional principles and i'm going to
write
closure so you know we changed our code
here just to do that so removing that
kind of state interrupts were very
important and when we where we talk
about interop we're really talking about
one thing we're talking about interop
with Java Java has a huge ecosystem and
it has huge numbers of libraries no
one's going to move from Java to any
other language if we do if we don't keep
the links to all the other libraries
it's the libraries that we're currently
using it's the law reads that I've been
tried and tested and it's the libraries
that you can easily still use with a lot
of these JVM languages here the interop
is very very easily we just import we
say which which packages and which
classes we want to import from and you
can just use that directly in your
closure code ok say lon so now we're
going to go back into some code ok I've
got about 20 minutes left so now we're
going to drop back into some code now
stay lon is a is a language which is
created by Red Hat and the one piece i
love about Ceylon is actually the two
things i love about Ceylon is modularity
modularity are the box and extensibility
and we'll see that now so let's
experiment I love this this this do by
the way ok so we're in a klipsch let me
drop into the ceylon view ok so in
Eclipse we have a sale on HTTP server
here now we have for sale on classes or
sorry for sale on artifacts we have a
package in a module if we look at the
module first this is modularity built
into the language it built with the
language itself has anyone heard of was
accorded jboss modules few people so
what day boss did is when they were when
they were looking at application server
modularity and things like that they
wanted to create a lightweight modular
environment similar to ours GI but
without the kind of bigger services
stack that comes with ours join so they
created something called jboss modules
and they use jboss modules today in
their app server and now they're using
it in in salon as well
Gavin King the the guy who bleeds salon
doesn't see this as a permanent solution
yeah he's very keen to when majority
does at some point drop into the JVM and
Java he wants to make use of that but
for now where there is no modularity
Davos modules is a very very good
solution so here we can import which
modules we want and the extensibility
which I was talking about is if I were
to create if I were to go to my show
view and go to my sailor on repository
Explorer we can we can now view a
repository of modules which we can pull
in and code against and these are these
are libraries which could exist locally
on my machine or they could exist on the
sale on heard which is an online
repository where people can submit code
and people can download and use other
people's libraries so it is really
really creating a good developer
ecosystem good developer community to
serve on so let's look at some of the
classes than a subclass of some of the
artifacts so we've seen the module dot
sale on the package sailing is all about
visibility across the shared key word
here is used in many different places in
this point it's it's talking about who
can do the package that we're creating
we have a couple of other ceylon
artifacts here we have run sale on run
is main in salem and we have classes
salem run dot salon doesn't have a class
but our classes ceylon has an HTTP
server class i'm going to drop into an X
term here here i'm in the the salon
modules where i can view my artifacts
that are actually compiled if I dropped
out here I can see my source so there's
four artifacts in my sauce let's go to
let's go back to my modules I'm going to
see what oops
typing's bad today I'm going to see
what's in the sale on sale on archived
and we can see some interesting
artifacts we're not seeing we're not
saying for not saying the same for
artifacts that we saw before we're
actually seeing a HTTP server class a
run underscore doc class and a port
underscored or class which we don't have
artifacts for but if we actually look a
little bit closer at the the code in our
classes salon we have the HTTP server
class in our run dot salon we have the
run method and the port so methods and
and global variables and classes are all
compiled to their own artifacts so if I
had three variables here and a few more
methods or have six compiled class files
that's an interesting difference java
interop we can use Java and this is
again you know a really important thing
for us to be able to do we can import
straight from java dot lang and so I
want to I've got land thread equally
java.net let's use the service socket
lets you suck it one of the important
parts of actually using interop is let
me get rid of this of using Java interop
is making sure we use the Java dot base
module which allows us to use Java at a
certain level and also the salon interop
Java allows us to do some type mappings
as well so some of the types are subtly
different ok the other thing I wanted to
show here in in the classes that salon
is a piece down here so here we have an
input we've got a bufferedreader which
is a java bufferedreader and we're going
to read the line if we look at if we
look at some of the job javadoc in here
we can see that we may where is it or
not ok in the Javadoc it said we get we
can either get a string back from a line
or we could get a null if we get an end
of the stream now if we get a null
salons and light nulls if we get a null
what we're actually going to do is we
are going to put a question mark here by
the string type which basically says
this
variable could be a null this this this
type can either be a string or not as a
result we cannot use input then unless
we actually do referencing it as you
know I know this isn't null so the if
exists input is pretty much saying if my
input is null do not run this code if my
input is actually a value you can
happily run this code if i take if i
take that ? off we no longer need the if
exists input and we get an error which
says the expression must be of an
optional type and the optional type
that's an interesting that's an
interesting way of saying the optional
type means I couldn't say something like
that which is and now what we're doing
is we're doing type unions and that has
now compiled so what I'm saying is get
rid of this what I'm saying is from my
bufferedreader here if I read a line
that type is either going to be a string
or a null and these Union types says
that I'm this input value is using
everything from the string or everything
from the null type when I compile this
and when I run through this we do kind
of its kind of like a type working out
which type it is at runtime so during
the if exists input what we're doing is
we're checking if the input value is a
string or a now the simplest way of
doing that is just saying string ? the
null type there is actually an object
which is very interesting the compiler
actually sees it as a primitive and null
primitive but they use an object in
insulin for for noel's okay so put it
Cullen Cullen is a is a jet ranger
project and it was one that I actually
really did like let's go to IntelliJ
unsurprisingly we're using IntelliJ now
because jetbrains are the guys that
create IntelliJ so if they're going to
create Kotlin they're going to put all
their all you know they're richer
features into in Scotland into IntelliJ
so one of the big things here is is is
the functions everything used in this in
its implementation are functions so here
we have a function with process you can
also see that we're using vowels vowels
and vars again very very similar to
tuscola one of the other things is if we
look at this connect variable which is
of type socket if I go down a little bit
more and we see this connect send HTML
response this is a method that doesn't
exist on the socket interface yet we're
calling this method so how are we doing
this if we go into it we can actually
see it's an implementation on it you
know within described within this coat
and file and what this is this is
extensions this is method extensions
what we're actually saying here is this
oh ok I won't point with on and this is
on what we're actually saying here is
this socket class this is a this is a
java.net socket I want you to extend
this class by adding effectively adding
a new method so this method and then you
know when you're when you're calling it
you can read it a lot lot easier because
you're saying right on this socket I
want to send HTML response rather than
sending an HTML response passing in a
socket and it's just nicer to read a
couple of the things we can see we can
see that here we have a template and
this is effectively a multi-line string
a multi-line yes much lunch string with
the triple double quotes and we're using
variable interpolation as well so all
we're doing there is we're grabbing the
variable title and grabbing the variable
body and concatenate to get into this
string we also have default values
so let me find a default value for you
here we have a default value so this
function socket send file we have a few
parameters one of type file one of type
string and then one of type boolean
we're actually assigning a default value
for the billion to be false and this
basically means when we're actually
calling send file like in this case here
we're calling send far we can actually
first of all use method naming so we're
saying the file variable is being big
we're passing is this file the method is
this method is retry equals true the
reason why we're passing is retry here
is because we're not using the default
value that we described above we're not
using this false default value if I
hover over this and find another
invocation of send file in this case
we're not actually even passing in that
boolean because by not passing in the
billion we're just using that default
value in Java what we typically do is
would have another method so we'd have
two methods one without that billion and
one with the boolean parameter and the
one with the boolean / am the one
without the billion parameter would call
the one with billion parameter with the
default value so we don't need any of
that we just have a simple defo yes yes
correct so when you when you're actually
when you're actually coding in that
you're actually in the scope of the
socket itself so I could call this dot
something that will actually refer to
the socket okay that's copelet the last
one I want to talk about i believe is
extend extend is an eclipse project and
let me go back to eclipse obviously
because it's an eclipse project and
here's my extend now extend is very very
interesting because while everything
else compiles across to job two JVM
bytecode what extend does is actually
interprets your extend code into Java
code so it generates Java code for you
and then you actually compile the Java
code into bytecode so
I don't if you can see this here we have
a source directory and then we have an
extent gen directory and so as our
source directory is containing our
extend classes and our generator
generator 2x Gen X 10 jen is containing
our generated class so if we look at our
generated class this one here we can
actually see it starts off looking
pretty reasonable but then as soon as
you get a little further down you can
actually start seeing yeah this this
really is generated class generated Java
but you don't actually you wouldn't
really try and touch this Java you
wouldn't try and make changes to it you
might just for reference when I view it
but really you want to be touching the
HTTP server extend a couple of things I
want to talk about here first of all you
can see it's actually very very clean
there's a lot less boilerplate we're
using vowels and bars there's things
like this where we have a vowel port
equals 80-82 this is type inference we
know 8082 is a number so we cost it as a
number so it so the port variable is a
number value is a number a couple of
other things that I want to talk about
here first of all again we've got socket
dot send HTML HTML response this is
where the name of the language comes
from extend we're actually extending
socket here and we're doing that by if I
was to go to this method we can actually
see that this is just a normal method
call but the point here is because
socket is the very very first parameter
we're essentially allowing people to
call socket dot method name and that'll
work with every single you know style of
method like this so you can extend
string you can extend whatever you want
so long as the the class here trying to
extend is the first parameter in that
method we also have a couple of other
things here these these funky little
this funky little symbol which you're
supposed to be able to type in with
using the using the extend
plug in or I think it's command shift
cue or something no actually no it can't
be there control shift q maybe I don't
know but I couldn't create that that
character my advice to anyone who's
writing a language would be if you get a
writer language try to use the
characters that you can actually visibly
see on your keyboard but but no I mean
this this is actually very very powerful
what we're seeing here this is very
similar to you know in JSP is where you
can have you where you have the angled
brackets on a percent and then you can
write some code this is very very
similar here so this is this is just
value interpolation so we can actually
add the title variable in this in this
piece of XML and the body variable but I
can also add some whoops I can also add
an if here and what we're essentially
saying here is you know if I put an
expression there and then a next piece
of code I can start building up some
code blocks in the same way I would with
my JSP I could do some loops and start
generating some HTML and XML and things
very very easily just by code also
static calls this is this was one that
this is one that got me for a while
static calls let me find a one of these
so here we've got file this would just
be a file dot separator but because
separator is a static value you have to
use this double colon syntax which got
me for absolutely ages but yeah that's
not that's extent so in summary coming
to an end now so summery functions are
first-class citizens we're seeing that
more and more in languages Java is just
starting with it now and they should be
treated as such a static languages rock
for now until we all go dynamic some
time later everyone syntax sucks and and
really okay that's a bit harsh everyone
syntax sucks to someone else there is no
one perfect syntax that's why a lot of
these languages actually just born out
the JVM is awesome and you should all be
adventurous and please please please
pick one of these languages that you
have seen today have a little play with
it spend an evening just compiling
something go to get and grab our code
and have a play
because this is you now one hour later
which is you have heard about every
single one of these languages and now we
just need to get that other graph up a
little bit and you can use it rebel labs
awesome we have a whole bunch of
technical content technical reports such
as all of these as well as the
adventurous developers guide to JVM
languages you can go there and download
that there's a whole load more
information about all the languages that
we've talked about also a whole bunch of
resources they're linked to get with all
our source code and I link to the the
report for this session and me please
please send me tweets about how the
session was what you'd like to improve
any questions about JVM languages
anything you want us to talk about rebel
labs and that's it i hope you enjoyed
the presentation if you thought the 60
minutes sucked you can redeem your time
