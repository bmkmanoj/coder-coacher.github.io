life here in Seoul
I'm your host Javed Muhammad and I have
as my guest today general Wenzel who is
a developer advocate general welcome
thank you product manager so last time
we were together in Sydney and now it's
all exactly xx I guess of the of the 20
cities of Oracle code you've been to how
many of the cities have you been to I
believe have been there six of those
including Souls including Seoul okay you
probably haven't had too much of a
chance to look around but just a kind of
a retrospective of Oracle code any any
thoughts about having meant to so many
cities about code and outreach to
developers I think the the codes serious
was a huge success so in every city we
have been there was a tremendous amount
of people everybody very enthusiastic
very engaging lots that people took away
from the event where you could follow on
Twitter and other social medias
afterwards but also a lot of things that
we learned and engage trip of the folks
I think there was really a huge success
was great great okay
so you gave a introduction this morning
is it for the keynote I think you were
talking about just about the presence
that we have both in enterprise as well
as an open source
yes docker you want to talk a little bit
about that sure so the first thing I
think is to point out is that Oracle
does not only do proprietary software
but also open source and I have to keep
reminding people that did Java or Linux
as well as other things my sequel and
yeah exactly open sources and free
available the the announcement that I
covered this morning was around the
docker announcement we had in March
earlier this year at docker Cohen and
Austin were essentially we said okay
we see that the developer community
everybody's using docker images these
days to you know spin up an environment
going whether that's C CD CI or just to
have your own development sandbox so we
said okay we're gonna provide everybody
with docker images for the Oracle
software or maybe the other way around
we provide our software a stalker images
for everybody so that it's as easy as
never before to actually leverage Oracle
technology in the very same tool chain
or toolbox that you would use everything
else and with this well and I think this
can you do just a little compare and
contrast so some of its available in
darker store and then github yes yes the
docker introduced the docker store
earlier this year which is essentially
for commercial images and their
guideline around there is whatever you
get from docker Store is checked by dam
that it's you know doesn't have a virus
inside and so forth and certified by
them so we provided our commercial
software on the docker Store that's kind
of the go-to place for a commercial
software it's not a store in conjunction
to that we actually also launched our
own container registry so where we
ourselves do the same thing where we
have this container container registry
for docker containers docker images that
Oracle people actually certify scan for
malicious code and so we'll make sure
that whatever is up there is also clean
and good to go
furthermore docker when it came out
while ago it had always this hub model
where you essentially you have a
registry of images if you don't have
your local image you would just pull it
from the web and this is what's known as
the docker hub essentially whenever you
need an image you would say dock around
me that image and then docker goes oh
yeah okay I don't have it locally so
actually go to the hub and download it
there and all our open source software
is on the hub as well so people can now
just pick and choose whether they run it
get that image from the hub or get an
image from the docker store or a
container registry and then as a step
further is that all those built faults
that you use to create those images we
actually made a veil of
and that's what we put on github so
that's for people to look at to modify
if they'd like to file pull requests
back if they're good additions features
yourself and so forth or just to learn
what's actually houses image build
what's inside a cetera so I know within
with all the Oracle code cities we've
been having an offering for people to
try out our cloud services is that true
in Seoul also yes that's correct so in
Oracle code Seoul with so many Oracle
destinations we actually have a five
hundred dollar cloud trial so when you
sign up here at the code lounge you
would receive five hundred US dollars in
credits to use on the Oracle cloud and
for those folks who are not here what's
the URL so for those that would like to
go slash try it and also if you're not
happen to be RORO two codes you still
get a cloud trial dollar amount it's
three hundred dollars u.s. dollars that
you would get at any point in time when
you sign up for the Oracle cloud so it's
actually for everybody they get $300
worth of cloud credit to try the Oracle
cloud right so 20 cities down and
there's the twenty first city coming up
there exactly so we kind of go the full
loop now back to the basics or the roots
you could say San Francisco yeah so with
open world and Java one this year we
also have again an Oracle code event
they are happening which is what would
it be like seven months after the
original one so we started in San
Francisco in 1st of March this serious
and now first of October open well Java
one kicks off and we have already code
there as well
great so for those of you who missed any
of the other cities and you happen to be
in California with San Francisco please
come check it out we will be there
exactly and it's a free one-day event
there as well so you can just go there
and try the free one day event as well
or go to the full fledged JavaOne
conference or open or comfortable well
Gerald's always a pleasure having you
and the name here thank you buddy
right absolutely thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
