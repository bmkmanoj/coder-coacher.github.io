coming today I appreciate it I know that
we've got a lot going on tonight those
are you going to the appreciation event
plus the null pointers are playing over
at the Taylor Street Cafe and a half
hour so I'll try and get through this so
we can get out there and watch them my
name is Josh you know author application
developer written a few books Java eight
recipes Java EE 7 recipes introducing
Java EE 7 i've written some magazine
articles for java magazine and articles
for OTN i also recently joined the JCP
and the JSF 2.3 expert groups so I don't
think that's up there but so today what
we're gonna do is just try and cover a
few series of you know real-life
scenarios and they'll focus on the Java
EE concurrency utilities API you know
lots of times people think about
concurrency and there's think this is
gonna be a boring subject and but it's a
necessary evil it isn't necessary but we
we do have to make sure that our
applications are concurrent because we
don't want to have our customers waiting
for processing to get finished so I try
to make this a little more you know
exciting though so what I've done is
developed an application that we will go
through and I'll show you some demos as
we're going so we're not just looking at
code okay so the main point here at the
beginning that I want to get across is
that the Java EE 7 really is increasing
productivity by giving you lots of
shortcuts now and your code compared to
back in in the years past
because any of those of you who have
used j2ee in the past I mean those were
nightmarish days and they're don't
they're over now because Java is really
a viable platform to be getting things
done productively also it's introducing
more standards because now we've got a
standard API for developing WebSockets
concurrency utilities and badge api
json p and others so and i think that's
going to keep on coming in java ee a
well i don't have a safe harbor
statement so i won't talk about that so
like I said Java EE 7 increases
productivity the CDI everywhere jax-rs
now has a client API async processing
being validation JSF flows JMS to auto
if nobody's looked at JMS 2.0 yet you
need to take a look because a lot less
code and was required in the past it
also introduces standards like I said
WebSockets JSON P batch concurrency
utilities so today we're talking about
the concurrency utilities for Java EE
and really what this means is that now
we've got away a standard way to do
concurrent activities in the enterprise
environment because you really don't
want to be spawning off threads in your
applications on a managed server what
happens if it goes out of control it may
harm all their applications on the
server or other processes on the server
take everything dump wouldn't be good
they have that happen so we needed a
managed way to do this and a standard
way to do it and that's what this
provides us so let's go ahead and get
into some recipes I'm just gonna give
you a little bit of foreshadowing on
this application that we're gonna be
going over you know I'm really big on
using JSF so most of it as a JSF based
front-end but we will dive into code I
will look I'll have you look at the
console a bit because lots of the
messages that will be printing out or
just be going direct to the console and
if you have any questions just feel free
to ask as we go so what we're going to
do is introduce a series of problems and
let me give you a solution I'll show you
how it works on screen you know in the
browser and then I'll tell you a little
bit more about details okay so problem
number one
let's say you're developing an online
reservation system for a multi-million
dollar company and your client wishes to
a lot of the managers to run reports and
had these long-running reports not
hanging up their client their front end
because they want to continue clicking
around on the screen and doing other
activities rather than waiting for that
report
and so what we're going to do is when
the user clicks the button we're gonna
send these reports with these tasks to
this manage executor service which is on
the application server processing will
allow the canoe user to continue doing
their work that way okay so here's how
it looks basically what we do is in our
controller class we are going to or and
that's this is if you're using JSF
actually you can and inject this
resource into any java class we will
inject this default manage executor
service every Java EE 7 compliant
application server must have a default
management secular service in this case
I'm using GlassFish 44.1 now I think but
it's called actually as you can see it
up there and then what you do is you
create your manage task it's a class
that I'll get a little more into in this
case it's called Acme reservation report
I don't know if my pointers are working
but and you can see Acme reservation
report and then what we do here is we
submit this report to the manage
executor service it goes off for
processing and when it's done it will
return this future object and we can do
something with it
so let's take a look and how that works
or how it looks like anyway so
basically this button is linked to a
rapport class and when I click is going
to run this report in the background and
will see this message appear on the
screen says the report is complete it
went pretty quick
but imagine that this is a long-running
report and was you know maybe around the
world on some server and we needed to
get this happening very fast currently
we take a look we can see that the
report has given me all the reservations
in the system and it's just printed them
to command line okay so if we're looking
a little bit of code here this is
basically the class that I just showed
you or the method I just showed you we
set up what this was called a managed
task it's just a class that implements
runnable or callable and then we can
inject or excuse me not inject but we
can pass in whatever context we'd like
so here I'm passing in some session
beans so that can make use of the data
and then basically when the task is run
on the server this run method is called
and in this case what it does is it
invokes this reservation report and
basically we just are querying the
database and returning results to the
command line not very fancy but and in
their production application we probably
send an email
and then you can see that we just submit
this task class to the manage executor
service easily and returns this report
future what I've done here has actually
used UI framework known as primefaces if
you're using JSF and haven't used Brian
faces you better look at it it's good
but basically what it contains is a pole
component which basically allows you to
go back to the server and whole process
and update the UI so what it does is it
invokes this function which just goes
ahead and checks to see if this report
feature is done once it's done it
updates DUI so again
Java SE 5 oh yes
so the question was since we've got
every Java EE application container that
works with this must have a managed
executor service can you see these
manage tasks if there's one that stuck
can you stop it well that depends on the
implementation
GlassFish does I don't believe it gives
you that ability to just go ahead and
cancel a task however there are ways
that you can actually see these tasks
running you can implement a interface
that's they manage tasks I'll show that
a little bit later and you can find out
more information about these manage
tasks and then we can cancel them from
our code so there's ways to do it so
yeah again in Java SC 5 we had the
concurrent package introduced in
concurrency utilities for Java EE just
basically extends upon that
implementation now I in a previous
session I had on Monday some people as
well if I've got an SE application
written that's already using concurrency
can I just port it over to EE not
necessarily you it uses the same API as
far as the the dialect goes you know but
it's still using managed resources on
the server so you can't really just just
do that and again all compliant
application servers must contain these
resources it relies on JTA to maintain
transaction boundaries you can also use
J and the I look up to get this resource
rather than injecting it if you wanted
to do that
and again just a little bit about the
task class you must implement call ball
or runnable and like I was saying a
second ago optionally this managed task
interface context can't be passed to the
class and to submit an individual task
you just go ahead and call the submit
method if you want to submit a task for
execution and arbitrary point you can
use the execute method and this is just
a little bit about what the life cycle
looks like so this was actually stolen
from some slides I saw online so I
didn't do it
but basically it's just a bunch of apps
they're calling in you've got this
context that calls into this managed
executor that's on the server and all
the processing takes place there ok yes
that's a good question is is so if you
want to redeploy the application and the
job is not done I don't believe it's the
ABS job I think that you can just go
ahead and breathe deployed his server is
already doing its thing once it's done
it'll finish it'll complete its task and
they'll be done I'm pretty sure that's
the correct answer but because this is a
90-day synchronous process once you hand
it off it's just going to do its thing
what's that
yes yeah it's basically gone yep
it just goes okay problem number two so
or if we have a bunch of these
long-running reports that we want to
execute in a concurrent fashion you can
do this using the invoke all or in bulk
any method on the same image executor
service and here's a little bit of code
that shows you what that may look like
basically you wouldn't be doing this in
production of what I'm doing here is
just I created a loop of you know for
loop and I'm just kind of loading up a
few of these manage tasks into this
report list and then I just past that
list to the Imbolc all okay and then
later on we loop through this list of
futures I'll show you here and when I
dive into the code and then we can go
ahead and we can get each of these
futures back and process them real easy
so let me
so if we're running many reservation
reports
you can see here we processed four
reports okay so it's just doing this all
in a synchronously the same fashion but
it takes a list of futures and processes
them on and returns them and what
happens is actually I know that probably
wondering do we have to wait for all of
them well yes if you submit like I did
in this example it's going to execute
all of the tasks within the list and
then give them in fact you but there is
an optional command you can actually
pass another parameter to it that gives
a timeout so then what I will do is it
will execute all of the tasks they can
within that time once the timeout is
reached then those other tasks are
thrown away and it's just processes
though so there was made it was able to
get through okay
so
again what we have here like I showed
you we've got this managed class in this
task class at this time I used a
callable so you could see the difference
again passing in some values and just
into the constructor when I create the
instance and then this call method
actually gets invoked when the task is
executed by the manage executor service
and really what I'm doing is I'm finding
this this reservation ID that I passed
in okay and it returns it returns the
object
and this is going to I've set up this
global list of future Park reservations
so again this this works in the same
manner as executing a single task but
you're just not doing a collection of
tasks and invoke all execute all of them
you can also specify a timeout as I
mentioned in bulk any well execute at
most one so what does that mean well it
means that in this case I click run any
it's not very good demo because you
can't tell but it's choosing one of the
reports to run whichever one finishes
first that's the one that gets executed
I personally can't come up with a good
reason why we wanted to use that I mean
if you've got a collection of tasks that
you're sending to a server why would you
only want to do one but it's there
anybody has a use case for it so problem
number three you wish to execute
multiple background tasks and then
utilize the output of a couple of them
together this is just basically using a
couple of these tasks and submitting
them to the managers ocular service and
then formulating the future results
together you're not just compiling them
together and this is really what it
looks like we'll submit the tasks
separately and then we'll get their
features back
so in this case let me clear this so you
can see
so what I did was I submitted the
information for Joe Smith and actually
called upon his reservation and then
also this restaurant reservation object
formulated to two together and displayed
the output is all I did so if we look at
that
that's basically yet you can see I just
do two different submits I get these two
different futures back
so it's possible to send multiple tasks
to a managed executor service at once
it's you can just keep throwing tasks
said that if you want and then process
accordingly they'll each return a
separate future object it's running them
asynchronously it's not going into a
queue so they're each managed separately
so if we go back to that you can see all
the worker threads so you know they all
go into this these worker threads and
get you can get executed
I would imagine that's
implementation-specific
probably not part of the spec at least
not that I saw
okay so in this case we'd like to
schedule it has to be executed a
specified date or time okay and so on in
the case of our application the
management wants account of the daily
reservations so we can create a task
class implement either runnable or
callable and then we can pass it to
manage scheduled executor service in
this case what I've done you can see
that we've got a new resource we're
using this is no longer the managed
executor service it's to manage
scheduled executor service also required
by all g7 compliance servers and this
managed schedule schedule executor
service allows you to pass units of time
to it so that you can tell it you know
what period of delay before this test is
executed and then how long between runs
so as you can see here I've got this
serve like context listener that's
actually running this information this
class and you can actually see the
output I'm getting the reservation count
for the day periodically and I can show
you what that looks like
so this is started up when the server
starts up or nuts or if the application
starts up okay and again I inject or
excuse me I just pull in that this
resource into the class and then once
the context is initialized I invoke this
manage task and then I call the schedule
at fixed rate method of the manage
scheduled executor service past the
class the time units so it's this is in
this case every minute it's gonna go off
okay and this is what the class looks
like it's just implementing runnable and
in this case I'm doing a J and D I look
up just to change things up a bit so I
do a drain the I look up for this EJB
return it and then I run this this
method to find the count
so again reference the manage executor
via jndi lookup if you'd like we invoke
the manage tasks using this schedule at
fix rate method other options that you
have are scheduled or scheduled with
fixed delay if you go into the
documentation there's a pretty good
documentation on this you can look those
up can also customize this with the
trigger API which will allow you to do
things such as skip so I skipped a run
if you wanted to you know only do it
every only have this thing executed
every three runs or something crazy you
can set up this trigger to calculate
between how many runs you've got and
actually fine-tune exactly when these
tests will be executed so in this case
we would like to fine-tune the scheduled
minge executor service and skip some
specified runs what we want to do here
in this example is just I'm going to
specify a number of seconds to you know
give the period of delay between the
tasks executions so we again use a
trigger class to implement the business
logic and then we pass that trigger
class to the manage scheduled executor
service along with the tasks so in our
application here I've got this JSF input
text and then let's say what I'm gonna
actually do is when I click this button
it's gonna schedule a report that will
give us reservations that have come in
for the week but in this case I want to
set a 10-second delay on this all right
excuse me a 10 second in between each
executions so if we look here we can see
the schedule weekly reports has come up
that's because there by default is a
five-second delay that I've coded in
there and now in 10 seconds you'll see
it happen again
and every 10 seconds thereafter
so
in this case what I'm doing I've got
this again it's a class that's
implementing runnable easy does run
method gets called when it's on the
server and I'm just doing the the lookup
here ok and what I do here is I call the
managed scheduled executor service
schedule method passing that reservation
count task class and I'm also passing
this trigger ok so this is the trigger
class that I'm sending along with them
what I'm doing is I'm passing the
current time and also the number of
seconds I'd like to delay you know into
this implementation so in the trigger
we've got these two methods get next run
time this is where I'm actually doing my
calculation and putting the delay on it
and then every time that task is
executed the next run time comes back
using this method so it calculates when
the next run time should occur and I can
change that dynamically here if I wanted
to go ahead and I put 30 seconds on
there that's going to change it so now
next time it gets wrong it's going to
wait 30 seconds before execute second I
also have this get run method
I didn't implement it here but you could
return a boolean here and do some
processing to indicate whether the next
run should be skipped or not
okay so the trigger API it just allows
developers a little bit more control on
how text tasks are executed and just
past the runnable or color bulb on the
trigger to the schedule method to get
next runtime specifies the next runtime
the task is scheduled to be executed and
again like I said the Skip run it
returns true if a task is going to be
executed the next time but you could put
in some logic and decide to skip the
next task if you wished and I just threw
this light in there because it's halfway
through this is what I imagined that
managed executor service on the server
looks like trying to get everything done
at once I told you I'd be exciting right
okay so what if you're interested in
spawning a threat just you want to throw
a thread out there to perform some tasks
in the background this is possible by
using a task from the manage thread
factory this is another one of those
manage resources that every Java you use
7 compliant application server must have
as manage tasks Factory and in or excuse
me manage thread factory in this case in
GlassFish it's called a default manage
thread factory and what you do is simply
call upon it to get a new thread and you
pass it the class that you wish to
execute and then you call the start
method on that thread just like a
regular thread would be so in this case
let me clear my console again if I click
this button you can see this report runs
in the background this is just running
on a thread I mean the thread Mexicans
executed right away and then stops if I
wanted to have this thread continue to
execute I could but I did not create it
that way because I thought that would
get boring looking at a bunch of the
same stuff but in our reservation alert
er here's where the threads act actually
I could be waiting a period of time if I
wanted to and then going ahead and
executing it again if I wanted to and
let this thing run forever if I wanted
to but in this case we run it once so a
server managed thread runs the same way
as a standard thread but in the Manns
fashion utilize Jane the I look up or
injection via that resource to get that
managed thread factory in context it can
be passed to this thread okay and
threats can be managed by JMX and again
there's user transaction support so now
this is the interesting example and I'm
hoping it works so if you're interested
in propagating some contextual
information from the Yui container to
another thread you can do this in this
case what I wanted to do for our
demonstration was implement a
promotional program whereby a supervisor
would enter some kind of promotion and
then you know they would leave and later
on in the day the employees will be
tasked with implementing the promotion
and they would run under the supervisors
context
okay so we're passing the context of the
user who created the object so you can
do this by creating a contextual procs
contextual proxy
tasks that you wish to invoke later on
we can do this using this contact
service resource set the manage or
excuse me that the application server
container has another eu7 complaint
feature so we can create this contextual
object and then pass to the service and
that's basically yet let me show you how
it works so in my demonstration here
imagine when an employee comes in
they've gotta process these promotions
there's gonna be a list of them here in
this clip in this table so I'm going to
log in as the admin Joel user and I'm
going to create a promotion
call it Java one rocks I've created this
promotion I can go and I'm peeing under
a different user now on my let's say I'm
logged in as a regular user you can see
the creator of the task is Jo user and I
can process the promotion and now it's
done
that doesn't really give you a good
visual so let's jump into the code and
see what exactly is going on
so I've got this promotion controller
and basically all it does is it contains
a list of these promotion objects okay
and promotion object is our contextual
object basically what it does is we just
are implementing a interface that can be
used to execute the method and get some
information and it accepts some context
so in this case I'm passing you know
about the controller the authentication
controller and from the context I'm
getting the current user so it's
actually running as the current user of
that context and then when the user
clicks the button it's executing this
method using a using the interface and
processing the promotion
so the context of the applications
required excuse me it's captured upon
the creation of the proxy and the proxy
object methods can be run and they can
be captured in the context and use that
later time let me show you actually the
context
I would just give me a second here can't
remember which class I put it into now I
can I'll find it
okay it's called the great promotion
controller and here's where I actually
did I created this contextual object
past the context to it and then you call
this context service that you call it
Creek contextual proxy method and pass
the context I actually you have to pass
the class and the type of class it is
here so I'm actually passing promotion
type class as well and in this case what
we did was it returns a proxy and then
you just add this proxy to the list and
that's that's what we're doing is saving
this list storing this list up for the
regular user to go ahead and work on
later so the main moral of the story is
that we can take some context pass it
into an object throw it on you know
throw it to this contextual proxy method
get some proxy back and execute it at a
later time containing whatever context
that we passed it originally
and this uses the Java language like
Peck well it can be customized with
execution properties if you wish to get
into that I didn't get into that in this
presentation but then you're able to go
ahead and return execution properties if
you set them they're just string pairs
of strings and value and a key is you
can pass it this can be executed in the
same transaction context as the in
bulking thread which is managed tasks
transactional and some this is like in
the case of this as an example we used
it to propagate some kind of security
identity some kind of identity so what
if we wish to monitor lifecycle of an
async task that's running in the
container we can do this using the
manage task listener to manage the tasks
lifecycle
so I've got an example of this
this what this is going to do here is
when I change the name it's going to
find this reservation it's in progress
it's doing its thing now it's returned
the information from the server and so
basically when it happened you're going
to see in the command line or the
console I should say tasks submitted
tasks starting tasks complete that's
because I've got lifecycle methods of
listening here so when the task is
submitted
it's calling in to this method I'm just
printing out some text when it's
starting I'm printing out text and the
same with complete so if I go to the
code
so what does is it in this case we've
got a same type of a task class that
we're sending it's going to give me a
future back I got this task class I've
created and then I'm gonna pass it
actually to the this thing that's called
manage executives it's kind of like a
utility class and when you invoke this
manage task class or a method on this
manage executives class you can pass
some kind of a class that is doing the
runnable or the call bowl along with
this task listener and you can see in
the task listener all this is a class
that implements manage task listener
interface and then you can do whatever
you'd like so in the life cycle of this
manage tasks now we can actually do
something when the task is submitted or
aborted or finished starting
yes here okay so you can allow the
tester to manage tasks to implement the
manage tasks interface that's another
way to do it if I did that then you have
you can implement this logic within the
manage tasks class itself and then I
think I had I think I hit it on here
comment it out right here is what that
would look like if you wanted to get
that listen our back you could call upon
the task class get manage task listener
and get that about that back and then
you could do something with those life
cycles okay and it submitted along with
the task class to the executor via the
manage tasks utility method and there's
just another example and those are the
four different life cycles that we are
monitoring submitted aborted starting
and done okay so in this case that's all
of the actual functionality that you the
concurrency utilities for Java EE
provides you you can do a lot of things
with it though and what I've done here
is I've got a tabbed UI that I'm going
to use in each of these tabs as some
kind of different of a different task I
want a process so what I've done is I've
hooked the tasks up to managed executor
services so if I click the button on one
and on another tab and they are each
being sent to the server and managed
asynchronously and so here's my actual
tab so if I click that I have something
going on I can go back over here and I
can find out what's going on with the
Chicago Bears because I'm from Chicago
I click read now I got that back and I
can actually just be
doing this back and forth and these
things are processing on their own and
really there is no different kind of
core to show you for this because
basically all I'm doing is the same
thing over and over again here so I've
got this different tab that basically is
just performing a different function and
then once I execute that I get the
future back and I process it differently
it's the same thing at same code I
showed you before I wanted to show you
something real nice if you're using
primefaces
I know this isn't a on jsf but this poll
component is very handy for finding out
the information that's happening with
the future and then displaying it and
updating the UI doing partial updates
just to give some feedback so again you
separate manage executor services for
initiating on each of the different
tasks okay and like like I just told you
utilization of the primefaces poll
component makes this real nice because
then the user gets some feedback to see
what's going on with the manage tasks
problem number 10 you'd like to learn
more about concurrency utilities right
here you can read my books I I didn't
update this slide but actually Java 7
recipes has been refreshed to Java
recipes includes lots of new content for
of course lambdas and all the goodies so
all the code for this application will
be up on github and it's already there
but I've actually added some stuff since
I've been here at Java one so I'll
update that code if you have any
questions I be happy to take them yes
scheduled X so what's the support for
scheduled executors excuse me a
clustered schedule executor I'm again
I'm gonna have to say that that's
probably implementation specific it
depends upon the application server
container you're using any others yes
so the question is about the Java 7 SE 7
watch service and the answer is I can't
add I'm not really sure I've not used ok
yeah mm-hmm my guess is though you would
probably do something with a scheduled
manage manage executor service and you
would probably schedule this to run
every so often and once your file was
found then it would probably cancel the
managed tasks
yeah okay yeah right yeah all right yeah
again I would probably just play around
with it and see what you can come up
with but like I'm like I'm thinking in
my head
probably a scheduled service would
probably be the best thing you'd want to
do is run a test like that you could
even use the thread and just have it
loop continuously if it's going but then
you know cancel it once the file has
been found or whatever you wanted to do
sorry I don't have a direct answer for
you
yes no that's a different implementation
yep
yes so the question is can you can you
inject different services with different
context into your classes and the answer
is yes and I actually did that I passed
in a JB's that I was using in my regular
application and I called upon the
methods and got data back yeah you can
pass the context that's the beauty of it
really because it's contextual objects
so you can really take what is in your
running application pass it to the
application server it's almost as if
it's being processed right there with
your application but it's being handled
in the manage executor and when you send
yes so when when that when you initiate
the call to that managed scheduled
executor service or the manage executor
service that's when the context that
goes with it okay okay that makes sense
okay any other questions
there are yeah okay so the question was
are there is there a way to resize the
thread pool basically or create multiple
separate that's implementation specific
I can tell you what GlassFish there are
ways to do it in the India admin console
you can actually manage the thread pool
yes yeah it's it's pretty take a look at
GlassFish if you haven't I mean even if
you don't want to run it in production
you can you can take a look at it and
just see how it works it's pretty nice
I think wildfly or sorry one second why
apply it definitely does have this as
well I think that's the only other
application server at this moment that
has g---seven compliance but WebLogic
silence way and plus I hear time he may
be having it soon and a couple others
I mean like I said we moved us with what
we had mess around
yes
that's the question is is so basically a
question is why is this better than
using regular asynchronous method on the
EJB I think that that's just probably a
matter of preference when it comes to
your application what's going to work
the best for you to be honest with you
right
which brings all that baggage again I
think it's it's a matter of preference
really because you're actually but you
also have to implement it and try it
each way and then see what kind of
performance your application gets you
know yeah yeah
right yeah so just again this is just
providing more options basically I mean
if you're already are doing something
one way it's always good to know the
different options that are available you
sometimes there's more ways than one to
do some tasks okay thanks
yes
so I've question is what
so do we have to start the context of
the managed solve CDI I guess I inside
the EJB and inside the managed bean no
you don't have to start that it
automatically move ever using CDI to
inject something it's automatic you
don't have to I haven't ever tried it
with request scope so I can't really
answer that yeah so if I was trying to
use a request scoped being is what
you're saying and execute a manage task
you off of that request go I wouldn't
see why it wouldn't be able to but I've
not done it but then again what you're
gonna do with the future when it comes
back because you've got this future
object and if it's a request scope bean
then really it's only good for the
lifecycle that requests since this is
being handed off to a server that
requests cold beans gonna be out of
scope then by the time the feature gets
back so you may not be able to do that
and I've never tried it
to be honest with you but it's a good
question you have there's David handful
finger he's he's pretty smart at this
stuff he's written some java ebooks what
do you think okay
yeah okay now I've I've I've used
application scope session sculpt session
scope usually for this never tried
request so
yeah session scope does work any other
questions yes unfortunately we actually
talked about this in the GlassFish
bought the other night there really is
no way to monitor individual application
performance really is not you can see
all of your applications in the
application server admin but you can't
see how much resource each of them are
taken
so there's actually yeah I'll reference
you to I'm not sure if you're familiar
with atom beam but he is a Java EE
expert he's created this project called
light fish and you can actually deploy
this application to class fish and maybe
allows you to monitor your applications
so that's that's one option
okay all right everyone thank you I
appreciate you coming to the last talk
