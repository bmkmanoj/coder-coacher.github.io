java SE group and I've been working with
FIRST Robotics for the last four or five
years both professionally and personally
with my kids and other programs so
there's been a lot of interesting
robotics talks here at javaone has been
really great this is one that that's
something that could be pretty easy for
people to get involved with either for
you or for your kids officer I'm gonna
go back a second unfortunately this is
supposed to be a co exposed to a CO
speak or Brad Miller from WPI Brad
Miller is responsible for a lot of the
robotic software that actually does the
sort of competition and designing robots
robot applications that are used in the
competition so they build a product
called or product they build a library
called WP I lied and it's the basis for
c and java programs running in the FIRST
Robotics Competition unfortunately he's
busy finishing up that library for next
year so it couldn't make it okay so
let's talk to me to go over a few things
first is what what is first about
secondly the FIRST Robotics Competition
in particular there's there several
different programs than first and then
we'll talk about what's going on new for
next year which which is pretty exciting
and will show Java how Java is working
on the new systems and then finally I
hope they've I might interest some of
you guys to enter into perhaps becoming
involved with first either as mentors or
volunteers helping other competitions or
you might have some know some kids that
might be interested in this so how many
people here know of first or involved in
first or of kids in first shoot you guys
going to keep me honest okay so let me
know if I if I mess something up so yeah
so the stock has got some parts that are
good for people that are new to whole
idea and other parts that if you're in
it you can get some new information on
what's coming up next year
Oh
in science fiction they are often cast
as the enemy
here a team's fate lies in their balance
a competition teeming bright young minds
with cutting-edge technology robots are
built to withstand virtually anything
you are not
in this arena minor malfunctions can
lead to major heart breaks the word some
that this is not science fiction this is
not man versus machine
this is first
okay so I just want to say even without
the dramatic music it's really an
exciting program to be involved with so
the first is a set of four robotics
competitions they executed worldwide
they're very big concentration in the US
and Canada but they are expanding quite
a bit on the so there's four different
programs that reach kids from ages 6 to
18 and similarities between the programs
they come up with a new challenge a new
game every year so there's always
something new to be learning and one of
some of the things are trying to get
across or teaching what research is what
r engineering is how do presentations
how to work in teams so it's founded by
team Cayman and he has a mission
statement here which I which I won't
read we can read yourselves but you
might notice that in fact the word robot
isn't anywhere in here has the robots
are tactic on a strategy to get kids
interested in engineering it and
understand what that what's so exciting
about it and that it's something that
they can do so the four programs is for
their first one is the one I don't know
as much about but it's it's for the
youngest kids they make models and do
research posters and looks like you have
a good time and look very cute doing it
my son certainly started on FIRST LEGO
League so this is a XX to the largest
program in terms of number of students
involved it's you know grades four
through eight people all over the world
it's based on the Lego Mindstorms
robotics product and they do this these
pretty challenging fully autonomous
robots or they might have missions that
could last from five seconds to a minute
driving around on on these four by eight
sheets of plywood doing various missions
that change every year it turns out that
some of the for some strange reason the
youngest kids work on the most
autonomous code and the oldest kids work
on the most remote controlled code so a
lot of times a team is really quite
excited to get somebody who did F
one of the the older kids teams that are
really excited get an FLL kid on because
they know they've got a lot of
experience doing autonomous programming
the next program up is for a sort of
middle school in into high school range
as this is probably the newest one but
it's pretty fast growing and it's also
based on the Lego Mindstorms but as you
can see there's a lot more custom parts
involved is it illegal my storm on there
and this is a combination of autonomous
and teleoperated remote-controlled
driving of the robot and these robots
also now start working in teams so they
have two teams pair up and compete
against two other teams so they also try
to cut teach the concepts of co-op
atisha where you have to cooperate with
the team and the person you cooperate it
might be on the opposing team next time
around and then finally the largest
robots were the first robotics
competition robots once again it has a
smaller autonomous period and remote
control period these are quite quite big
machines and they have a lot of
industrial parts on it so there's
industrial controller there are many
pretty powerful motors there's you can
add pneumatics so you have compressed
air based systems and you have these
three versus three teams that going on
let's see on this competition they're
doing my notes up at the top there doing
frisbee throwing which I never thought
I'd see robots doing so they're trying
to trying to get the freebies and the
thing I'm not sure if the in this game
it was possible to do reliably
remote-controlled frisbee throwing or if
you had to sort of start doing vision
tracking and target recognition what do
you think
okay oh okay that's great let's see next
okay so of those four programs the rest
of this talk is going to be on the FIRST
Robotics Competition with the bigger
robots and there's controllers and these
are pretty challenging machines so they
have to build they don't have a lot of
time so they get up they get a new game
is announced every January first week at
January teams get a big kit of parts a
bunch of tons of parts with all kinds of
motors the control system and and enough
parts to make a really basic robot that
would get you around the field but
that's just the start so then they're
also the teams are also allowed to
purchase lots of other parts to
manufacture parts people doing 3d part
creation some people do you know get
machined gears and all kinds of other
things then they have about six weeks
and two days to first figure out what is
this game and what are strategies to
play this game what's a robot they can
execute those strategies then build that
robot and program it and test and drive
that robot so the way that it works out
is for five weeks they're building a
robot and then maybe halfway through the
fifth week they let the programmers
touch the robot and they have to get
there I get their code running to get
that robot to do something useful so
once again it's a new game every year
but there are some similar things in
every game there's almost there's always
an autonomous period and then there's a
telly a period so it's not a long
competition so you could think about how
do you optimize a Java system this is
not a long running server application
this is something that's got to run for
about three minutes and so there's some
interesting things you can think about
tuning your system for that let's see so
teams play in alliances they work in
local and regional competitions and they
can be selected by either winning
competitions to go to championships or
winning various other kind of awards so
design awards they get then gets scored
for presentations for outreach
sportsmanship
it's not always even though even though
it's very tempting the kids get quite
focused on winning they're about a
competition there's a lot of other
things that they both are trying to
teach and they reward in the competition
so to give you a flavor of what a game
actually is this is a short video
describing this last game bullies owe
each robot can be preloaded with one
game ball a 10-second autonomous period
starts the match during this period
robots used pre programmed instructions
each ball scored during the autonomous
period earns a five point bonus one set
of goals will be lit up and hot during
each half of the autonomous period each
ball scored in a hot goal gets an extra
five point bonus and every robot that
moves from the center white zone into
their own zone during autonomous gets
another five point bonus at the end of
this period human drivers step forward
to take the controls as the teleoperated
period starts teams command their robots
to score as quickly as possible scoring
cycle starts as a human player transfers
a ball onto the field robot can just
take the ball and run directly to the
other end of the field to earn the basic
goal scorer but receiving assistance
from your partners in moving the ball
down the field will add bonus points
alliances that use all three robots to
assist the ball through all three zones
will earn the most points
throwing the ball over the truss on the
way to a score we'll add a ten point
bonus and having your alliance partner
catch the toss will add another ten
points okay so there's a couple things
you might notice on this one there's a
whole variety of ways you can 21 points
and some of the things are trying to do
is to make it such that there are some
points that a rookie team that can
barely get a robot to move around can
score and then there's some much more
elaborate things like for the sim the
autonomous scoring points you needed
have some visit vision recognition to
figure out which scoring goal would give
you the most points and two but both
perhaps drive up to that one or two aim
for that one the other thing which is
always fun is the they are really trying
not to prejudice what kind of robot you
might want to do so they come up with
the most ridiculous-looking robots for
these videos you can imagine and and
that kind of works in real life and a
lot of a lot of years you'll see a wide
variety of the robots that kids come up
with and teams come up with that's kind
of what am one of the more exciting
things I really enjoy seeing out you
know there's a million ways to solve a
problem in a book how do they you know
which tactics people choose ok so the
robots like we said comes from a kit of
parts provided by first because there's
Wi-Fi on the robots so we can talk to
both the field has a control system
running on the field which the the
team's which tells the robot when it can
run when the games over the different
phases are and the teams have no control
over the sister money on the field and
then there's also the remote control
station which talks in the device let's
see these robots can be big up to 150
pounds and they can travel fast I can
speak to experience while testing out
line following them when they start to
chase you around a room it's good scary
then you feel like a real idiot when you
realize it's just making left turns and
you have to make any left turns so I get
to to is just turn the other way is if
you're got very very silly stuff happens
sometimes I've managed to take out a
refrigerator once yeah that's been good
Val in fact I almost damage the Java one
stage one year
I won't talk about that that was a bad
day so what's actually driving this
robot is a robotic controller from
National Instruments okay I'm talking
about what's what has been used between
2009 and 2014 because they're having new
system so this is the National
Instruments compact Rio system it's got
a 40 megahertz powerpc it's actually
very much like an original iMac it's got
about 6 4 mega RAM one of the
interesting things on here is that they
use them and both controllers the bow
field I knew this is an FPGA in there
which is used first for several reasons
which we'll talk about but it has tons
of i/o to control not just the drive
wheels but you could see on some of
those examples there might be one or
more arms doing things each arm might
have three four joints and them that
need controlling and then sensors you
could have all kinds of sensors with
range finding what am I trying to say
counting rotation counters all kinds of
things like that in this system what is
expanded with plug-in modules and they
came with the set of modules and the FB
FB jade has like I said tons of
different output and input capabilities
so some of the things that are the
reason they using FPGA and one some
cases it's to do real-time kind of
control so if you want to have a really
consistent pwm modulation or you're
counting things coming in you have this
is a way to have a very solid real-time
thing no matter what the operating
system is doing or your program can die
or anything it's it's going to go ahead
and and keep collecting data or
triggering things or whatever it's doing
the second thing which first is quite
concerned about is safety so you can
imagine if the robot is going full bore
down the field and it decides to reboot
the last thing you want to have are
those motors say okay you told me to
keep going straight so I'll keep going
straight so in situations like that and
in fact it's tied into so the
communication mechanism so if the robot
doesn't hear from
the controllers every play every 20
milliseconds and either case it will
shut down the drive controllers and the
robot will stop yeah and finally there's
another component that they provide is a
driver station so there's a PC you can
use your own pc there's typically
joysticks off to the side there's a co
breadboard you can custom design new
controllers that people do elaborate LCD
panels touch screen panels you can you
know holographic APNIC interfaces you
know anything that the kids get excited
about they'll give a shot I try oh let
me say we can try this here we go right
down here is a very important part it's
it's the emergency stop button also on
the robot notices it's very important to
have that handy so I starts programming
these robots there's a framework that
WPI provides cut WP eyelids used like I
think it's a variation is used also in
LabVIEW so national intimates has a
graphical programming environment called
LabVIEW it's a very much related to the
Lego Mindstorms programming environment
it's a sort of a different skin and a
simplified version on the Lego
Mindstorms but it's also used in
industrial processes throughout the
world to control to program the National
Instruments controller boards an
addition teams have been able to use C
and C++ and starting in 2010 Brad
managed to trick me into porting Java to
run on the the compact Rio so we
provided some interns from WPI and we
got that ported over to this vxworks
system not my favorite operating system
will have been opened I didn't say that
and so that was based on the squawk JVM
which is a research vm that I was
working on at the time and that's Java
ME CLD c 1 dot ones based system does
anybody know but what seal they see is
or ok ok we'll get into why that is
important a couple more slides but
there's quite a bit of difference
between Java ME cldc and
java SE but first we'll go through a
real quick example WPI led provides a
lot of infrastructure to make it really
simple to get a robot started there's a
lot of stuff that has to go on dealing
with communicating communication for
that driver stration and drive a station
of the joysticks to the robot the field
is telling the robot when it's disabled
when it's time to go into from the first
autonomous phase and what's time to
become telly-op and then when the match
is over so there's a state machine that
the that needs to be tracked and it
handles all of that especially in the
simple robot case makes it easy for four
teams that have almost no programming
experience to get started and i'll show
you in like a couple slides you know the
world's simplest robot alright so you
have a robot example the extends simple
robot meses oh yeah it's a robot declare
that there's a drive and a joystick and
even the constructor you set up say yes
I have a standard drive it has motors on
these two PWM outputs and there's a
joystick which is remote but it's on the
USB port number one on the driver
station and the robot framework will
call during the autonomous period of the
competition will call the autonomous
method and this is just simple code that
makes the robot drive forward and back
and stop there's a little explanation
here that the drive method does takes
two parameters a speed and the curve
that you wanted to drive now the part of
that makes it so simple as there's a
sort of predefined way of wiring up you
know typical way of wiring up your your
motors and what what ports you connect
them to on the robot on the controller
and the now operator control method is
very simple while the robot is still
enabled so the road games not over drive
the robot as if you had an arcade
joystick and wait so you don't spin too
frequently because you're only getting
communication about joystick values
every 20 milliseconds so there's no
point in and we
reading it over and over again and
that's it all right so you team does
that they can just plug that stuff in
and they can have a robot driving around
pretty quickly so it's really trivial to
get started but it's also powerful
enough because it gives access to all
the sensors and controllers that you
that you could put on there so there's
built-in support for its I think
accelerometers and gyroscopes and and
the pneumatic devices relays all kinds
of things like that so even though the
game has something called telly-op
teleoperated period you might think well
that's just a driver driving around like
a video game and you can do that too and
I have a sometimes a competitive robot
or Lisa the defensive robot you can get
in other people's place but a lot of
times to really complete the more
challenging competition aspects you need
to do things like when you needed at
traction control because they had a
really slippery surface and so if you
wanted to get anywhere very fast yet
implement that some robots use Omni
wheels that lets you sort of spin and
drive around in a new direction and when
you have a drive like that you can add
gyroscopic controls so that the robot Oh
is always steering and relationship to
where the driver is so when the driver
ghazal so turn left the robot always
goes left from where the driver is as
opposed to from the robots point of view
which makes driving much easier to get
less confused action and then there's
things about vision recognition target
tracking and and once again safety ok so
what's new for this year so it's got all
kinds of great things going on so the
biggest thing is there's a new
controller and with then i couldnt do
controller becomes a new java ok so this
is the new controller the national since
putting out they actually made a special
version for first which is kind of nice
and it has built-in actually a lot more
of the i/o stuff built in that had to be
done with expansion modules so all the
nice things here's one of them right
here it's actually quite a bit smaller
than the original one which is kind of
handy mix there's there can be robots
can get pretty full of stuff by the time
they
and you know 10 motors and batteries and
everything else now this is the Duke
alarm nine processor running standard
Linux has quite a bit of ramen flash and
like I said bio and the great thing
about that configuration is it runs
standard java SE embedded off the shelf
you can go download this now and get the
the soft load api version and install it
on the robot and and it just works so
that's been that's been really great and
java SE embedded has some new features
with compact profiles and much smaller
smaller Client p.m. so it's one of the
some of the differences now from teams
that have been using Java to last year
in previous years till now so there's a
lot of differences between Java ME and a
java SE 8 and if you go down to the very
first one we'll might blow your mind a
bit but you remember the Java collection
classes from 12 they're not in cldc if
you had vector and you liked it that was
about it i oath is java dot io that's
not there they have there's a something
called generic connection framework
which is just completely different from
standard java networking and file i/o
certainly the java logging api's wasn't
there and now we have regular now we
have regular expressions java tilly
currents on even some unsigned support
for ensign two integers that's just API
stuff and then on the language side you
got here we got asserts to get generics
now annotations integrations and even
lambda so you know what does this mean
so so Java SC is what most mentors know
cementited a lot of part of the game a
lot of part of the of the program the
frc program is actually getting kids to
work with professional engineers and
software developers and to really
understand what it is that that we do
and and to let them know that yeah this
is something you can do too and it's fun
that's that's kind of the biggest thing
it's also java c 8 is also what
high school kids learn and if they have
an AP computer science class so then so
they don't have a big disconnect between
learning one thing in the high school
class and then having to program at a
different language it also means that
you can have common code that runs both
on your driver station you might have
some Java code that helps you drive the
robot or do strategy or all kinds of
things so you can share that code base
with their code on the robot and it
opens up a huge library of the world of
existing libraries that are available in
Java you know if now that might be a
little bit too much freedom do you
really want a job application framework
application server running on your robot
or Java database running on there I
don't think so but some kids might you
know that be very educational for them
realizing well maybe that wasn't a good
idea that's okay too and it also has
invoked dynamic and no one's really
working on this right now but that means
that you could also envision running all
the languages run on top of the JVM also
on the robot now there's also it was
just running a completely different code
bases squat JVM was a research JVM that
was really designed for working in very
small embedded different environments
and in fact it was a JVM written almost
entirely in Java so it was very
intellectually interesting and had some
grits and great properties but being
fast wasn't one of them that actually
wasn't one of the main goals so nowadays
the block savage a compiler and even the
interpreter is faster than the old
interpreter we have many different
garbage collectors available on Java Sea
on there's full tool support modern
debuggers full debugging support
profilers and and many of the tools you
might be familiar with okay so that's
kind of more in the abstract so we've
been actually working on running this
job on on the new compact Rio and we're
getting some results back so one of them
was looking at faster execution so I was
trying to find a benchmark numbers from
the old compaq trio days though I could
rerun on the on the new robot
and I found one of the FRC teams had a
benchmark program up so I stole their
numbers and ran the code on the new
device God got some results so this is
on there gara marks let's call it so
smaller numbers are better so squawk
running on the old computer is 650
thousand i think it's millisecond run
time running interpreted on hot spot on
the new device is 1.9 x faster which if
you notice down the bottom is is more
than the megahertz stiffens would would
make you think so it really is the
interpreters also kicking in and then of
course you get the JIT compiler in there
now you're 12 times faster so that's
really awesome and so there's some
there's a lot of you know hot spots been
around for a long time there's a lot of
cool stuff in there that's like old hat
to people and make me don't you think
about it anymore but its assembly based
interpreter it actually generates the
machine code at startup and it Tunes
that generated code based on the actual
CPU it's running on sonus you can notice
oh I'm running on an arm 9 i've got to a
coors so there's the optimal code
sequences to use for this interpreter
and that's because that's compared to
the generic sea-based interpreter we had
running on squawk so the first question
I thought it was you know what is the
JIT overhead we got 12 times faster code
but how could that hurt you you don't
want to stop for a minute in the middle
of the competition and start compiling
code so distant is the quick numbers
I've done so far it looks like it's
compiling methods in too much yeah what
is that two point eight milliseconds
method it's doing that in doing that in
parallel with the interpreter it's doing
that as needed so it doesn't stop and
compile you know 100 methods all at once
so and it had any of dual core processor
so you can be doing that in parallel X
on each core so that I don't think that
we're going to be seeing a lot of jit
pause is becoming a problem with the
robots also I realized kind of how the
JIT compiler works this is another one
of those secret things in there which to
a lot of people now is kind of like
automatic transmissions you know they
just work and kind of forget how they
work so if you want to blow somebody's
mind one of the kids minds you can say
talk about on stack replacement about
how you
interpreted and a tight loop on your
robot and then the compiler says you
know I need to compile this method and
so it pulls the interpreter state out
and compiles the method figures out
where the interpreted states should go
and what registers and continues on and
it's just that's it's really cool
programming stuff ok on the GC side of
things we have to we got now three out
of four collectors that are available on
this device we don't have G first but we
have cereal peril on concurrent mark
sweep and wanted we want to know Leo
what sort of things what's going to work
better on these robots so I came up with
a simple synthetic application that
generates rays of various random sizes
put some on a treadmill to age them
slightly and run actually run multiple
treadmills at different speeds and have
treadmills of treadmills and it's it's
all really great and then have a couple
of java.util that timers that are
running a periodic task and try to
figure out how how much what's the
maximum delay between when those tests
should have fired off and when they
actually fired off so to measure the
jitter and try different things so using
the different collectors we got
different numbers here is a whole bunch
of numbers here kind of as expected that
peril collectors design is a throughput
collector and not designed to have good
latency and it doesn't so that's okay
theory works in practice too and it
turned out that roughly the CMS
collectors that seem to be doing the
best job of things it has a curious
thing with the very first collection in
CMS is about twenty percent slower than
their the following collections so I
think I think it's doing some initial
tuning or set up at that point so I'm
towards the on the other side here we
sort of seeing what are the the jitter
delays eight milliseconds 23
milliseconds so that's a lot of numbers
what does that mean is that what is it
important or not so one way to think
about this is that the robot has several
periodic tasks that are running like I
said it's getting control data every 20
milliseconds there's PID loops that are
control loops that are running often at
50 milliseconds and so you don't want to
if you missed a control data event
coming through you may not notice it but
if you missed a lot of
by a wide margin you would definitely
start noticing your robot was stuttering
and not driving smoothly the way you
want so when we had numbers that were
sort of the absolute maximum numbers in
the 20 millisecond time that was
probably acceptable but 60 millisecond
times would would not be also this is a
synthetic application that wasn't really
tuned as so the to mimic a robotic
application so we have teams beta teams
and frc are running this code now and
we're going to get numbers from them to
see what are their applications doing
how much remember the allocating what
kind of GC pauses they're getting and we
can try different tunings with a
collector with them and we have finally
with java SE we're getting the full
range of tools available we their java
debugging api's the squawk sort of
lament of the minimal set of api so you
could you can do pretty much everything
you can't the debugger now this
profilers I got to play with visual vm
now which I haven't been able to do for
four years so you can hook this up to
your robot and see your you know GC
pauses times and your CPU usage and
there's just all kinds of great things
heap statistics yes I was generating
lots of light byte arrays and sure
enough there's lots of I to raise you
can see what your threads are doing are
they blocking each other you could sort
of look more deeper and see what what
threads are up to so these are some
really great things to easily let kids
visualize what's going on in the robot
instead of trying to end for what and
decipher what's going on so it's going
to be another talk as it turns out on
Java tools james gosling in this room is
going to be giving a talk at one about
debugging and profiling his robotic boat
you know from thousands of miles away
through slow satellite clinic
connections
let's see so next steps so this is
something that's not just you know the
and I think about robots kind of
abstractly this is something you next to
get involved in these teams are looking
for programming mentors all the time or
mentors and actually and all kinds of
categories not just technical mentors
but they really looking for people that
can explain you know maybe someone here
knows about software engineering or
source control or testing and you get to
play with robots so that's always great
it's I'd say it's fairly serious
commitment that's a rewarding commitment
but it's a but it's somewhat serious if
you want to get started a little bit dip
your toes in there's also all these
robotics events they're always needing
volunteers to help out with the events
to queue up teams to be referees to give
tech support at the competition so
there's lots of ways that you could just
try out first for a few days to see if
it's something interesting and then of
course if you know of any kids that this
might be of interest that's definitely
the way to do it so do you this website
link here us first org is the
organization that matters all this they
have a nice like what's going on what
teams are events in my area and it's
pretty easy to get involved in now let's
see that if you read the abstract and
you were an engineer and you sell some
of those numbers earlier I have to admit
that there was an editing error in the
abstract in fact there are not three
hundred thousand students doing FRC
that's 400,000 students in first
programs total so I felt bad about that
but I thought about it a bit and
realized it might be a way to make good
on those numbers at some point in the
future there's Java that runs on other
robots in particular the new lego
mindstorm aslan lego mindstorms ev3 it's
runs linux on and oh look at that arm
processor has lots of RAM it's flash and
in fact we have a java SE that will run
on that device today so this is just
supposition on my part I can so they
can't promise anything and I don't know
anything but you could easily see at
some point with the FLL and the FTC
competitions allowing java programming
in the future so look at our 300,000
plus someday I hope oh yes I realized I
actually need the safe harbor statement
so but that in fear okay so rien toys in
the comfort of the presentation here so
we good I really appreciate the help
that other teams had photos and programs
online for me to use and open up for
questions and answers here yes
yeah they could yeah they could
definitely use that I think you can use
any editor you want they're all this
year they're focusing more on Eclipse
for actual like the tools that do
deployment and all that stuff if you're
they wanted to you could use any editor
to edit the source code though and then
deploy through eclipse or through the
ant scripts I think any other questions
no I'm sorry
the test especially for the FRC they
tend to be school-based but there are
many that are not there are some that
are homeschooled kids often well done
tects orient the whole curriculum around
FRC for several months if you touching
everything their clubs 4-h clubs it
could be any organization I'll say that
FRC is not a cheap competition to get
involved in there's between all between
all the equipment that needs to be
purchased and you know access to machine
tools and some things like that so
sometimes having a very large group of
kids at a school they 10 and having
space that works out huh really okay
yeah this is yeah so it's definitely
encouraged courage you and encourage
them to go to us first org give you okay
a second guy to back
and
I
hmm
goodbye
bring it
yeah yeah so the question is why are
these systems is even smaller than what
you could get done with raspberry pi
erson like that so i can't speak to
first you know in any any real sense but
I know oh
now so some of that is tied into the
safety constraints they really want to
be able to if they even at the robot if
even if your CPU crashes and Linux is
out the work that it can they can shut
off the motors and all that stuff is an
important part
why
we're on
he
mmhmm yeah it's but
why
yeah yeah it's combined but like like
the other men said is that you can also
expand even things like vision
recognition on the older compact Rio was
that they supported it but was pretty
challenging a lot of teams actually
shipped the images off to their driver
station did it on a laptop and then set
the controlled information back or they
would you know they would tape the
laptop onto their robot
mhm
yeah yeah you have another question ok
yeah good
ok
teacher
I
yeah this is definitely regional biases
in different different areas yet like
the you know the Michigan powerhouses go
and see ya oh I'm sorry about that so
he's talking about how in his area in
indiana indiana region really is biased
towards using labview versus using Java
or C++ and it's definitely a case that
they're very regional areas the Michigan
powerhouses are often very big on C++ on
the I think on the coast you get a lot
more Java with the the even in New York
City got bankers people working the
banking industry also working our
mentors on the the robotics side sighs
yeah but
much faster but what I started with the
life sorry maybe workshops and
not
getting out in workshops
start
yeah and I did say actually that the
Java usage across the country i think is
around thirty to forty percent so you
may not see it in your area but in other
areas it but the numbers go completely
differently sorry i'm in the back yeah
yeah I'm sorry yes you
huh
Oh
oh that's great
that's great yeah
I would like to see that happen but I
think part of it is is trying to there
there were many many teams out there
right now with the current lego
mindstorms NXT bricks and I don't think
they want to force some doll to get Lee
v3s until they you know they're going to
decide that someday but they kept around
the old yellow rcx Brooks for many more
years and you might have thought you
know because a lot of times they said
you know schools that they you know one
time they bought a bunch of these mind
bricks and they're not going to have
budget to buy to buy new ones yeah I
think so but I would imagine the way
that I've seen it go before is that they
would allow ev3 s and then they would
sort of start take it over and then on
the FTC they'll allow use Robo see or a
couple others see environment so I can't
imagine they'd have any objection to
using Java yes
okay that's good out there do you know
if they are allowing the ev3 yet oh ok
ok that's great ok so we're on our way
ok any yet oh well i thought we're all
done it or not I'll go to the man in the
back here for so no so where do what
happen to these kids after they go up
they've done Studies on some of that
stuff they definitely track college
entrance rates and majors and so they
definitely i don't i don't know the
numbers off on top of my head but they
definitely do see an impact on a lot of
I mean you get the thing about this
program is that you'll get some kids who
are going to be engineers no matter what
and this is an opportunity for them to
sort of stretch their legs and their
arms and really dig into some
interesting problems like I ran into a
kid one I would go to competitions and
I'd say so I using labview using C++
using Java and this one kid said yes he
decided to implement his robot no 3 just
so we can compare and contrast and say
ok that's great and you have other kids
who would never imagine themselves doing
engineering at all and they realize no
this is this is fun I can do this and
they're getting power tools in their
hands of our first time and there you
know program for the first time and so
it really does make an impact on on sort
of what what they end up doing
more difficult
there have been talks about this for
years so I'm not going to say that guys
ever talk that it's going to happen
because it obviously hasn't but you're
right it is much simpler in Java Sea not
that it's going to be the same you could
easily write an emulator Java Sea on the
desktop and you'll be running nearly the
same code on the robot and you might
have some things about doing you know
having some canned inputs or recorded
inputs for sensors that's kind of the
trickier part is how do you get what do
you what are your sensor inputs up like
to your robot needs
mmhmm yeah yeah you would mock it and
you know maybe at the lowest level
instead of going to fpga you then go off
to some simulated you know visual you
know motors spinning around or or is it
or something like that but I don't know
of any project like that been in place
it's a definitely an interesting area
that if you're volunteering to work on
yeah yeah yeah if someone's interested
in this definitely contact myself Derek
white at oracle com or brad miller at
WPI and we can try and collect and see
if there's a people coming up okay so
that's the last question okay I think we
can wrap up then thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
