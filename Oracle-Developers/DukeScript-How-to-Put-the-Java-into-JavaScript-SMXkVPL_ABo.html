script and how to put the Java in
JavaScript I'm Tony Eppler from everton
IT consulting in Munich I'm basically a
trainer and consultant and we're doing
consulting for John's weeks Emily's
platform and now for Duke script and
here with me is yo Steph Tula one of the
founders of NetBeans and still with the
NetBeans team and he's basically the
architect behind most of the technology
you will be seeing here and we will talk
about how to put the Java and JavaScript
because actually JavaScript the name
javascript is a lie incurs in a used a
they wanted to be part of the hype
around Chava in the beginning so they
call their language javascript but we
all know that it's an inferior language
and that we need to do that we need to
fix it basically and we're very happy
that we want the dibs Choice Award this
year we've received it yesterday yeah so
what we're trying to solve is a couple
of with technology is a couple of
problems and the first problem is that
javascript is everywhere you know you
can have it on all the interesting
devices like iOS Android you have it in
the browser and everybody basically
wants to have like this shiny web like
you is and in most companies where I'm
new projects they always investigate
these technologies but a lot of these
projects are running into problems
because javascript is a language that is
made for small websites but not really
for application for developing larger
applications so for that you would
rather need a real language where you
have like like typing so we have nice
ide support and you have you have ways
to modularize your application and for
example do but I factor in without
breaking everything yeah exactly so on
the other hand we have a language that
is capable of doing all that and that is
java java is a really nice material
language that has all the features for
creating maintainable testable
applications but the problem is it's not
really running on all of these
interesting devices so if you want to do
client development for android iOS
probably right now java is not your
first language of choice so that's why
we came up with Duke script and you trip
is a way to write your application in
Java and render it in html5 so we didn't
want to have a whole new rendering
toolkit like for example in Java things
that you would have to port to each of
these platforms but instead we wanted to
take something that is already there on
the platform and do it basically
together so I have a very nice citation
from Steven Chen who is the content
chair or general one and he said Duke
script is lightweight Chow ethics i
always dream them ok and first we want
to show something we want to show it in
action so you can see that
running on a lot of different devices so
I'm head over to yarder can we switch to
second computer I have okay you switched
perfect so I usually start by showing
everyone the most productive ID on the
planet and it's because of this little
icon because whenever I need to do a
long-running build I can play it again
and that makes me really productive so
what we are seeing right now is
basically a mine see per game return in
Java running on the client so there is
no server whatsoever and rendering flu
HTML so the UI is HTML application logic
is Java but of course I don't want to
play this game only when I'm at work or
using NetBeans sometimes I also want to
play it when I'm when I'm online and in
a browser so basically this is the same
version of the game again written in
Java running in a browser and the
browser does not have any Java plug-in
installed so in spite of Google trying
really hard not to allow java in a
browser well it runs them and last but
not least sometimes I don't even have a
connection to internet and I still would
like to play the game so this is my iPad
and well the game looks the same and Oh
place the same so so much for them
okay so how does it work actually if you
saw it on the website there are also
links so you can download the game in
the iTunes and also in Google Play for
your android device if you want to try
it out it's for free but basically it's
very simple so you have two slots if you
want to support your script on a new
device or new technology that you have
to fill in and the first one is you need
html5 renderer component and the second
one is in Virginia and your script is
them together and does the basically
just a magic between them so what's
happening when the application is
running is the JDM execute the chavo
business logic that is written against
the Java API of Dukes crib you can
create your own ati's if you like but we
provide some for you and you script and
the Java API Stan control the metro and
update it so typically you have a data
model and business logic and you
manipulate it and the website with the
HTML would just find itself to the data
and update itself when the date has
changed and on desktop the JVM is hot
spot and the renderer component the HTML
renderer is the chili flakes vampy on
android we have doubted as the virtual
machine and we have the android webkit
webview that we control and use for
rendering on iOS we have robo p.m. which
is based on the Android runtime
libraries down and we have this you I'm
MP and so by doing these components
together we have the platform basically
running on each of these different
operating systems and we have a very
simple and lightweight way to to run our
application on each of the devices from
the same conference yeah and i forgot
the browser that's the interesting part
because we are not only running
basically natively on the devices but we
can also run in the browser the best of
voice testing chrome with a virtual
machine that is actually executed in
JavaScript so it's written in Java
comprise to JavaScript and it really is
able of interpreting byte codes and
working with jar files that's real
virgin she okay so if you would like to
play around with it and if you would
like to develop something the easiest
way to get started is just go to a
website that's deep script University
basically it's the development
environment on the web and you can find
it under this address and it's basically
something like do you know who of you
knows jsfiddle okay it's jay's fiddle
for Gibson so I'll hand over to yarn up
and he will show okay so this is the GU
website and actually what you can do
here is to code code in a browser
without installing java without
installing anything so we have few
examples I think spinning you by Aybar
is one of the first juice written by
somebody else than me so I will show
that so when I selected it downloads the
sources from github and the source is
actually HTML and Java and yeah this is
basically Java editor so if you want to
get code completion and you can have it
you can modify whatever you want so here
is crack of Duke so file I think I can
change it and when i when i change that
basically the system does recompilation
and i can run the kind of obligation so
right now we are so sorry joe buck is
running inside of your browser but not
only javac we are also running this
application so we can see that the
button name has changed that it's really
a crack of crack of knowledge back but
the first version was a car korea and
then i can do simple animation simple
rotation annotations so this is
basically Duke's crib in action not only
for and it shows the power of the back
to browser virtual machine because it's
so good that it can run a complex
application like Josie ok so it's pure
client-side technology right here
there's no browser in 10 serving bowl
okay so since we have the architect of
NetBeans the quiz question is probably
very easy to answer we have very good
support for you script inside of
nathan's so if you want to if you want
to try it out further than the first
examples in the browser you can just go
to the plugins in netbeans and install
this plugin here HTML java project
support and then you can create a new
project from the html5 category and yard
external shape ok quickly yeah project
project next so basically the result
gives you a clue of what it's going to
do they are targeting all these
platforms we can view recommendation not
now so project name demo for java one or
netbeans demo ok next here we can choose
from few templates and it's G set of
templates is growing every day but let's
go with the simplest template which
just a simple animation we need to use
javafx and it's very useful for
debugging and other arm and finding and
development of the of the application
but then we want to deploy it on rue it
we want to deploy to iOS you want to
deploy to browsers and last but
definitely not least you can deploy the
application that you create also as an
admin module like the minesweeper that I
showed initially so finish and now on a
background we are running maven
archetype and from the maven archetype Z
generate the project so now what I would
like to do is debugging it charlie no
not not know the magnet not very much ok
so this is how we create the project ok
so we provide a couple of AP is that you
can use to develop your application and
the most important one is knock out now
see that's right book oh there's typos
did smoke out Jess yeah but we remove
the chase oh right because we don't need
JavaScript ok what we're doing is
basically we are using knockout.js the
library but we're using it from Java so
in the HTML page you will have the
directives for data binding but your
data model will be in charm so basically
what we can do with this is we can
create a really nice developer designer
workflow so the designer can really
create assets a website with his
favorite tools and they don't need to be
converted to some some some F XML or
something else they can be reused
directly and the developer just writes
chava because it doesn't know anything
about design like we all do probably
so it looks like this we have the HTML
page here is a simplified version and on
the html5 HTC in the button there is
this data bind directive and this data
bind directive is basically knockout and
it tells us that we want to enable this
button if the rotating is false and the
click on this button will call the turn
animation function in our in our
application so in Java you have this Eid
function and the turn animation on so
this is the method that is going to be
called if somebody clicks the button and
you see this model annotation up there
this mobile innovation can be used to
generate the model as a java class so
that you can interact with it so you
have this model it has a name data and
it has some properties for example
boolean property here protein so that is
the rotating property that is also
referenced here in the index page so
what it looks like is you have to define
a class name and you can define a set of
properties and the properties can be
typed so that's very nice in comparison
to JavaScript and they also can be of
any type so we can really have nested
properties
so here you've got one of these nested
properties where you have whatever the
address that is part of the person and
now you can use it so you can
immediately use it from your in your IDE
and start typing because the annotation
is in the background of conv used to
create a class for you and this class is
confined so you can have code completion
and you have getters and setters and
everything on this method so he can
create a new person like this and one
nice feature is the two string will
create Jason for you so you can also use
that basically to communicate between a
client and a server and what you need to
do in your replication is then call
apply bindings and your data model will
be bound parallel to the page to the
index.html so it's very simple and you
don't have to code any JavaScript you
just have to have somebody who knows
these knockout parameters but it's
purely be there so JavaScript so
yaroslav will now show you how to debug
it okay and maybe go a little bit
through the cold food cold well this is
this is the code that has been generated
by the by the initial template and
astonish said we have the model
annotation and the reason why we have
this model annotation is that we really
wanted the code to be effective and even
shorter than a similar application
written in JavaScript and to achieve
that we are trying to generate as much
code how to generate as much gold as
possible but there is not anything that
is not anything special this is real
real Java it compiles with Java Sea and
that's all it does so annotation
processing is in Java since version 1.6
so that's what we are using to generate
this data class so now what we have is
one
two properties which vid getters and
setters want a named message one named a
rotating and then we have another
property computed property which is a
derived property it depends on the value
of property message and if the message
changes it also a computes it returns
six a list of six words it splits the
message in the words by the way here I
can show the power of annotation
processors if I make a mistake here and
say message I get a warning that must H
is not unknown property that we only
know message and rotating so basically
this is a huge advantage over JavaScript
the JavaScript you need to run the
application to find out what is wrong
here if you do some mistake if you do a
type of you get a compilation warning
and even more than compilation warning
you get a warning from the annotation
processor so that should make people
more productive as well so let me do bug
it I will put a breakpoint into function
that's exactly what is being called from
the from a HTML part and I will start
debugging
okay so this is our application and if i
press this button start you can see that
below we have a breakpoint inside of
Java Virtual Machine and sat inside of
hot spot we can elevate the model
basically now the value of the model is
printed as to string value so astonished
said this is the JSON format of the
model and if i go over i need to run it
properly ah ok so did it work ok the
models should now say dating true and
unknown and the rotation should be and
the words should be rotating so let me
try once again please demo gods and the
last start ok so and if I just run it
without the bugger it works without
problem and we are basically this is
knockout so really to you I is bound to
the model and when i type here
everything synchronizes with the other
words and and the method for doing the
computation is really cold and separates
the message into six words don't
inspection or you are right i have
forgot so those who are developing covet
chrome tools or fire fire back are used
to have your favorite tools for
inspecting the Dom tree and actually you
have it as well in netbeans so let me
minimize this application I need to tell
the system that this window it's usually
better to if you are designing web to
have 22 monitors not here I should do
hold on top so that's it and here we see
inspector so this is the structure of
the of the page and I can basically
select each of these and find out and
this appropriate element is selected in
the page as well I can turn on a
selection mode so if I click here the
bottom is selected properly and I can
either go to source directly I get this
and for example do some changes like
start could be begin and if I save it
the begin out of the HTML page has been
automatically refreshed in a browser as
well so basically the speed of
development is relatively fast
comparable to JavaScript as well okay so
we can also do client-server
communication as I said it's really
quiet technology so it's running on the
client but since we have these nice data
objects that we can serialize to chasten
strings we can use those to communicate
with the server and we can reuse the
same data model on client and server and
you can also has a
for this ok so our request feelings ok
watch this Giselle ok so I did I want to
get to this page of The Wizard basically
here you have the options of the
template and one of them is crap
template so if you done if you select
the craft with charges he faces you
basically get more complex application
which is not composed of a single maven
module but four and one of them is for
the server one for the client one for
sharing bits data structures between the
client and a server and one for our
special JavaScript if you if you need it
and I won't finish the result because I
have the application here already
created so this is basically jersey
jersey dress server so those who know
how to use Jersey may recognize that
recognize these annotations so this is a
very how to create a get get rest api
here is a way how to create post and the
nice thing is that there is the contact
class is basically shared between client
and server so if i go to the UI model
this is this is something that will run
on the server you can see that this is
basically the model of the UI but we are
using the model class called contact and
this is basically the shed path which
run at the short code which runs on the
client as well as own server and that's
useful for validation for example if you
have well if you are using two different
languages like JavaScript and Java then
some code needs to be written twice
because validation needs to happen on a
client and it was of course needs to
happen on a server as well Duke's crib
you can really share the code so let me
debug that I should first start the
server
okay and I ops and now I'm supposed to
start the client be back so again we
will start the client in javafx review
which the good for debugging and let's
add a new so this is basically to
validation if we don't have named you
need to specify it
oh ok so now I will click ok and so he
stopped here so basically this is we are
on the client side in the client virtual
machine we are about to repress the ok
button which means to commit the water
has just been edited so here is
happening the validation which runs on
the client side and at the end we are
going to submit it ok and we should have
a breakpoint under I effort usual hit
this breakpoint what happens another
demo problem unbelievable
ok
Oh finally I'll add are in communication
okay no no no it's okay that's okay I'd
contact okay so now we are on a server
so this is the grizzly grizzly server
and again we have the contact you can
see the value and it's the same class
which represents the contact we can do
the validation here as well which is
basically using the same code and then
if i finish this application allow
multiple times oh you are the advice now
that was the problem so the server was
not responding quickly enough and i
press the ok twice but yeah you can see
how effective you can get the Duke
script by sharing the code between
client and server so we have more api's
and it's this is basically there's we
are trying to build a community of
people who really take an API that they
like or that they would like to use in
their project and create basically a
cube script wrapper for it and one of
these is the leaflet and leaflet is
basically a map component mobile
friendly map component and you can
download it here in on guitar and
compile it and it's it has a nice Java
API you can create a simple map like
this and you can add components there
for example I add a circle here at a
certain position with a certain color
and bind the pop up to it or add a
polygon stuff like that so it's it's a
nice java api so you don't have to coach
script here and you can directly
interact with them and I'll show it to
you so here is a little application
using this API so we have the map here
and we have these these listeners
basically that open a pop-up on it and
you can zoom in and zoom out and since
this is so easy embeddable dupe script
is embeddable in any application
basically that supports java fix javax
panel so you can also for example who of
you is developing genetics you can now
use this leaflet component and use it in
Chamonix and i have a small devil for
this as well so here an application it's
a regular Java fix application and this
is the map view component we just add it
to a more to a border pain here I've got
a regular list view and I add a couple
of addresses here at a listener and
whenever I click something I interact
with the map and update the position map
and leaflets and view you where you get
position so on it
so besides being a standalone tool it's
also very good for for being embedded in
in your applications and enriching for
example Java X doesn't have enough so
now he has a map component and it's very
it was very easy to create so we can now
go to the Hilton or visit yarda go to my
office and so it's a really easy way for
example I saw a lot of people were using
we're using the webview together with
JavaScript and evaluate and this stuff
to create for example charts because
their charges charts are not so good and
but then javascript has nicer joints
that's ok that's really ugly because you
have to construct these strings and it's
horrible then with Java gigs with you
have a very clean way to do the same you
can do the same thing for swing
applications and you can do the same
thing for eclipse RCP implications
because it's easy as it's it's the same
values ability
ok that was just again the code we have
more so sometimes you don't want to have
this declarative style a native and
fighting style but you want to have a
direct access you want to draw something
and for this for this we have the canvas
API and the canvas API basically wraps
the html5 canvas so we can directly draw
to it from Channel so the directives
that you that you have are similar to
the ones that you have in the html5
canvas but their type safe and they're
pure chump so it looks like this you
have like graphics context 2d you
created and then you start drawing and I
can show it here
and a small devil
so here we have the code graphics
context HTML graphics get or create this
will look for the campus in the site and
make the graphics context accessible and
then we can set line with fill style to
the rails and we'll set the font draw a
circle whatever you want and here's for
example of the result of this and you
can also use it for example to create
dynamic or interactive applications just
created a very simple demo here that you
can use to for example draw for this
time I'm just using the mouse events of
this is what I run into each other I hit
this happens in the way so it's possible
to create i'm using knock out here to
bind the mouse event to some events
inside my java check some functions that
are going to be called when the mouse is
moved and that i cannot take the refuse
so you can also do really visual style
with it and here's a nice example do you
have it not yet ok this is some guys
created a java fix implement
actually that is running on top of this
canvas and you can I hope you can see it
here and is using back to browser
basically so you can have really nice
applications it's quite performed
so if you want to try it out here is the
live one of my side projects to do with
it is creating a game engine for it so
just having having a little bit of fun
so if you want to download it you can
try it we have time to show them ensure
your you can do the more you can play a
follow along time ok so I have to for
some reason I have the M rated
application so there is some form of
nudity in there sorry for that but it's
really it was a technical problem
actually so this is work and development
so it doesn't doesn't so you can see
like there's a tiny engine in here and
you can walk this little guy around
usually he's dressed but for some reason
I had the image merging it does come to
work so is unfortunately naked and
there's also a physics engine engine in
here and it's basically box2d there's
the same physics engine that is used for
angry birds and I have pone here I think
this is the first time that somebody has
created a version of Tom the uses
extension you can see that there's some
gravity in here
okay I'm are you a link I don't know yes
I'm winning I just actually wanted to
show because sometimes the friction was
will make the ball start to spin so you
can we see that it's a the kids out
sorry I don't go home and good play so
if you want to play a little bit it's
also good for that you can create cross
platform games if you want so who is
developing so who is behind that the
best technology is developed by Oracle
as part of as an ending sub-project and
it's free and open source some
additional api's are developed by the
Dukes crib community it's a small
community but we would like to invite
you to join it and there's already first
commercial application there is the
controls j/s and it's transcript library
provider that they have some advanced
controls they're very nicely mobile and
they also operate now as it keeps good
planning so you can program the same
thing each other actually it's a ice
sometimes called this library so that
visits for those who hate HTML because
basically what you can do is to our code
for a browser without coding and HTML
and there's a nice nap in slugging so
you can also create the application here
and they even have a visual designer
here so you can drag and drop and there
are data binding directives
somewhere in here it's very new so i
don't i don't know it exactly are you
can switch like this and with the data
bind you can see value is bound for
example here and there's also if the
button should be bound to a function so
this is about the first name this was so
something else I think it's in data
for this argument
okay but if you click this button so you
have to believe the channel function
that is referenced here will be called
so in the model it's just the same home
also use the knockout findings this
function say hello would be called so in
a if I run this application now we
should see the same effect so you have
data here
and you can you can code your
application logic in Java and you can
instruct the UI in a visual way with a
visual excitement its readiness we're
very happy that we have basically
commercial contributors already um yeah
I did the demo so now we thought about
why how could we convince you so this is
basically the sales pitch why you should
use it because it's good because it's
really cool it's good and because it's a
if the name is to model view viewmodel
pattern so unlike for example in Java
pics you do not have a toolkit
dependency your normal so the model is
pure Java without any nui dependencies
so it's really nice really test two
really very nice testo detestable
designer developer workflow so the web
designers work the essence can be used
directly they don't have to be converted
to a different one but we want the
signers tools give you you can use you
can use you will probably have a
developer at the data bind directives
because that's not the designers job but
but other than that it's really very
nice in
separation you can write cross-platform
applications not only for iOS Android
and desktop but also for anyone a
browser so they will run in the run you
can get rid of unattainable JavaScript
code and a lot of projects have problems
with that now you can leverage your
existing knowledge you don't have to
learn something you and your developers
and your colleagues develop sharma will
be able to apply their server side
nawlage basically because Java has
become a server-side technology it
started as a client-side technology and
we're trying basically to get it back
there so you can use your existing Java
knowledge to client side programming
with the modern paradigm for the
business code will be in one language
you can even reuse the same classes on
server in time and since its type saying
more errors will be called at compile
time so you don't you have to do less
unit testing for the thing you have a
better tooling because I are much better
refactorings are much better than in
JavaScript so in the end you will have
fast development less code and the low
all fear for your application so this is
what we want to if you want to if your
child x developer that we have also
something for you you can use existing
JavaScript frameworks and very easily
embed them in your application without
having to do all these string
concatenation cell functions and we have
you script University so if you want to
learn more we have some additional
resources so the presentation will be
will be online anyway so you can
download it and all of these things so
there are lots of devils and they
try out if you want to contribute that
will be great or if you want to try it
out for a project or four for an
evaluation I just come to us and talk to
us we will be happy to help you and if
you want to learn more more detail also
how to into unit testing for example
then you should come to our presentation
tomorrow it's a tutorial so we have two
hours of time where we can really go
into great detail or you could simply
join us now and come with us to the
hacker garden that's in the exhibition
area where we can do some coding so if
there's interest just come up to us and
we can do some some coding maybe half an
hour or so so you can get get started
okay that's it from us we were faster
than I expected oh yeah we fought the
tub we will end up like yesterday's
keynote well it will just go through the
slides at the end top do you have time
for questions so if there are some yeah
i right html5 JavaScript CSS for the
fights right in their issues trying to
test
you know I fightin htmlunit and whereas
you know as corporation we have a
certain amount of code coverage that
so that writing job just change to you
okay yeah we we reached fine so you are
exactly right the question comment was
what is in there for we're testing that
there is actually a problem in testing
JavaScript html5 applications and what
we basically supply here okay so really
because of the separation because all
the models are separated from the UI
then they don't have any connection this
is how you can write unit tests the
phone car the phone class is generated
by the unknown here so basically this is
this is the class that represents a JSON
object in JavaScript and I can basically
instantiate it in a in a test and call
its methods so let's let's run it let's
wait for the black point to be hit and I
can get into the application logic so
this is the generated part but then it
it's you can get into your own code so
this is what you are actually testing so
we need to find out that number is
correct and it's not because it contains
letters so on okay continue continue now
online and we get a proper error message
so here we are back and the error is
here so this is how we can do unit
testing and basically if we really
follow the separation of designer of
work and developer work then in the HTML
we don't have anything to test what we
really need to test is is the logic and
that's fuel in Java so testability
should be huge
just well this question these working
browsers so the question was what other
supportive browsers what are the
supported browsers well if there is
something not stable in the whole you
click Duke's crib ecosystem that's the
back to browser virtual machine that's
that's the most experimental part which
I'm writing when I have time so i know
it works on chrome and actually we did a
lot of optimization to run really fast
on chrome it works on a on firefox so
but it's slower because the really the
form of JavaScript that we generate is
optimal for for v8 and otherwise the
generated javascript is not using
anything special so I know it for
example works on Safari and even on the
iPad but today I found it out that I
have problems on Internet explorer so
that those who need to be fixed but
otherwise the primary so far we believe
that the primary target our mobile
phones if we want to get to mobile
phones I believe they are super stable
Oh
okay basically the go go ok the question
was is there a lot of support for other
IDs so basically we have made an
artifice so any idea that supports
Meghan sugar and what is a little bit
difficult for example in Eclipse is that
Eclipse doesn't handle annotation
processors very well in these projects
because they are doing their own
compilation and you have to have the
right combination of plugins and you
have to know the right combination of
the plugins so you can make the
annotation processors work it won't work
as nicely as it that means but it will
work so we can treat we have add events
where they were the Eclipse developers
and they've managed to get it to run to
the main projects but it is basically
the idea of how IntelliJ handles overly
intelligent handles dedication
processors so I did usability study or i
order to use a notice today for the HTML
Duke scriptum essential yoox crib api's
and those guys were using various ID
there were complaints from the Eclipse
users that it's not working properly
because but yeah if you if you always
rebelled everything from a command line
if you add this directory as a source
directory it can work there are no
complaints from IntelliJ guys so it
probably works in IntelliJ notably well
and by the way here on the page I'm
showing example the commands that you
can use from command line if you want to
avoid trying the beach if it also also
an eclipse it's there there are plugins
that enable the annotation processors
basically but you have
you go to stack overflow and look it up
okay more questions
okay if they're on the other days
how so the question is how mature is
Luke sleep and HTML for Java is the core
component of it so originally I started
to develop the HTML for java for a last
jovan keynote so i'm working on it for a
year and half and actually I'm glad that
I have not made it for the last keynote
last year's keynote because at that time
it would not be mature enough we had
performance problems to communication
between between Java and JavaScript on
iOS was not was not really good so so
really I'm really glad that we have not
made it but now I think it mattered it's
completely my shirt it can be used
probably doubt without worries and well
if you need a support Donna is the right
guy black asked for it he does his
living but the other thing is that we
have decided to include the HTML java
beach and technology in netbeans and use
it in netbeans because we would like to
somehow right you I once and then run it
in a desktop as well as in a browser or
on mobile phones or tablets so I think
if there is something that's not working
we will find out and we will have to fix
it so basically the wishing is also not
only to run it in netbeans but maybe
even in other IDEs actually on wednesday
we have a pair coding to bring it into
atoms it already rounds but it needs
some polishing from eclipse expert so we
will do it on wednesday
Christian okay so thank you for your
attention and if you like to come with
us and cold or have questions just come
up and keep it off thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
