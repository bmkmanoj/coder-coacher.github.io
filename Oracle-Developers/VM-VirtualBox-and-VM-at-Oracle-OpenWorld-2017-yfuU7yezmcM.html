dev life I'm your host Javed muhammad
here at open world 2017 and I have as my
guest today Simon Couture Simon welcome
to the show and Simon is the director of
product management for which VirtualBox
little box and Anna Rocco VM so Simon I
think last time we met was in we were
just talking Moscow
yeah Oh Scott's been a it's been a while
and here we are on the the back home
yeah home for me
yeah for you it's a how's the weather in
Italy yeah now it's becoming colder
you know it's autumn so yeah but is good
enough right so we're going to talk
about a VirtualBox
let's just first of all this talk of at
a very elementary level for the folks so
for the developers out there who may not
know about it just give us like a the
elevator pitch at 30 seconds one minute
overview what is VirtualBox yeah so
beautiful box is desktop virtualization
solution that you can really really
easily install on any desktop operating
system so it can run Windows Linux Mac
OS okay cool yeah all on the on on all
the Linux distribution and so on all let
me say the main x86 platforms at the end
and thanks to these desktop
winterization solution you have the
option to have on top of little box any
x86 operating system running on a single
artwork on a single system so it's a
sort of very interesting solution
mostly for developers because if you are
going for example to build your own
application able to run on many
different platforms you can still
continue to work on your laptop for
example because fax the VirtualBox you
can test don't run your application
differently you don't need three
different platforms develop you don't
know
need one system with Microsoft Windows
and other Linux another Mac OS and so on
I only need one and on top of it you can
build your own VMs you know virtual
machines and run your application you
can also develop your application and
the cool part is that when you complete
it your software your solution on top of
this VM the Symbian can be easily
migrated to the cloud and when I say to
the cloud it can be the private cloud
like for example Oracle VM server
private cloud appliance or the Oracle
public cloud and on these we also worked
it a lot so lately
we had the release candidate one for
visible box 5.2 and one of the main
targets each of these release had been
the creation of a bridge between
beautiful box and the Oracle cloud in
fact now Internet the next release of
visible box 5.2 you will be able to
export the VM into the format that
Oracle public cloud would like to have
okay have we made public when VM box 5.2
will be coming so we are working to to
have it available as soon as possible
our target is to have it available by
the end of the month actually everyone
can already download and install the 530
release candidate 1 so if either to
release candidate 1 is already available
on public website you can download it
you can test it you can work with it and
then the cool thing about it is free
yeah obviously VirtualBox beautiful box
is free so you can use for free on your
own desktop laptop environment is
open-source totally open source the
VirtualBox base package is totally
open-source GPL version 2 code and so
you can install you can modify the code
you can redistribute if you want so it's
totally open so who says the best things
in life aren't free yeah all right so
one thing so when I'm just thinking
obviously the the benefits of it are
very obvious instead of requiring
multiple types of hardware you've got
one platform what about from a
performance standpoint
can you just speak to that because
usually when you talk about
virtualization there's a overhead
involved so you can use to speak a
little bit to that
yeah sure because that may be a concern
you know into the latest 5.1 release
that is actually a release or for
VirtualBox
we already work it to improve as much as
possible all the performance is mostly
related to the i/o and that's it
another important thing to know is that
on top of EVM you can also install the
guest Edition guest Edition is a package
able to bring you the best performance
is possible on top of a VM running on
digital box this guest Edition are
available for all x86 platforms and so
thanks to this piece of software that
you can install on the VM you can also
wear you can also have very good
performances from a CPU memory i/o and
also Network point of view well it
sounds like a very very exciting thing
people should go and check it out if
they want more details where do they go
is the URL beautiful box the talk is our
main website which of all the
communities work uh-huh but obviously
you you can find also many many
interesting things like documentation
white paper how to to get things or so
on our Oracle technology website so on
OTN ok all right and I'll put that URL
in the description when I post it also
sure Simon always a pleasure talking to
you thank you so much for coming guy
pleasure my pleasure charrette thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
