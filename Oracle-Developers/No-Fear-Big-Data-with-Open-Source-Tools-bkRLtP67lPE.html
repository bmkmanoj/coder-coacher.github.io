Oracle code 2018 in New York City I'm
Bob rue Bart with the Oracle developer
community and my guests for what I think
may be my last segment for the day is
Edelweiss camera rental place thanks for
stopping by
thank you for tell me about the session
you presented today okay so today a
presentation about big data but getting
started with big data so it's kind of
difficult because there's a lot of
technologies about Big Data a lot of
tools a lot of products it's gonna be
can be very messy you know for someone
who could try to just start in working
and start playing with it so my idea was
to show how you kind of store storage
the big data for example with Hadoop
okay and then how to analyze it using
hive or using a spark and how to
integrate it all of the Big Data with
your different systems and you had
different target system maybe Oracle
database or Oracle sequel or some other
open source sources that you have no
sequel MongoDB Cassandra blah blah how
to integrate it with data so it was a
very ambitious
you know presentation because a lot of
but it is was just get an introduction
to people to start playing and to start
you know getting some you know the awake
some curiosity you know and I send a lot
of give a lot of information but also
send a lot of links give a lot of links
to continue researching about this topic
and also they pre-built Oracle Big Data
light beautiful machine which is very
very nice and has a lot of things in
there you know Hadoop Kafka it has you
see it's got a lot of technologies of
products of big together and you can
start playing with it what do you think
is the most frightening aspect of big
data for beginners it's a lot of
technologies a lot of things they're not
going then they don't know how to start
it's kind of afraid you know it's like I
don't know how to start doing it do we
have to perform an installation for
example of a roof with three nodes no of
course not okay because it's quite
difficult you can insert with one and in
fact my my recommendation if you just
want to get the knowledge before just
playing around just planar with this
also a butyl machine from cloud era that
in the site of code website that you can
download the one from from Oracle and
today okay it's also that most people
doesn't know the definition of Big Data
you know sometimes people says you
should I don't know I have a lot of late
I have a huge amount of a and this is
big data and not thinking about the
variety of the information and structure
data and all stuff the title of your
presentation is getting started with
Hadoop spark hive and Kafka yeah of
those four tools is there one that you
would suggest is probably the easiest
starting point for someone who's new to
big data in order to storage the
information for sure Hadoop you can do
so can you be for fat for much and
processing and if you want to have more
real-time data analyzing analyze analyze
in real time data you probably owe to no
sequel but it starting would have to be
started with a basic ok so you need to
start for me with with Hadoop and in
storage the information there and you
know check how the formal information
and you know I think this is the main
and because MapReduce which is the
language that process the information it
could be quite complicated know and you
have to think in you have to start
thinking in in in terms of mappers and
reducers there are a lot of other tools
that makes your life easier
ok and for example if you you know a lot
about sequel which is you know the most
common thing most common language that
at least for the people from my age you
know sequel very well so you can use
hive you can use spar sequel ok so that
is the DHS to you know get familiar
start working with some language some
thing that is familiar with you okay
maybe maybe you're familiar with with
Python sky
maybe you want to analyze information in
a spark you know it depends on what you
know and what is familiar to you so go
for the low hanging fruit you delivered
your session just before we're doing
this interview and you in you mentioned
that your audience kept you behind
answering a lot of questions what were
some of those questions for example if
they want to perform some ETL process in
how they can do it and how they can for
example accessing they have to be
information and things like that
things like that but in fact there was
some because it it was a lot of
information for 45 minutes but it has
just the years was just an introduction
just for people you know yeah get into
the into the topic but there was a lot
of questions there was a lot of
questions I was very happy I started
talking with with people outside the
room because there was another speaker
and showing things you know with a big
tool machine in my in my laptop I really
really enjoy it you mentioned that SQL
is the choice of your generation of
database people what do you think is
replacing that for the younger
generation languages right now I am very
happy that there are a lot of people
there are young people also coming in to
these events and they are into
programming and they're into you know
into are into Python into into Scala
obviously Java is there is another one I
mean language for for everybody but it's
very interesting how they they they have
this familiarity with with programming
which is which wasn't you know I am I'm
the first language that I have to work
with was Pascal you know it's good so
and after that you know five six years
later our organ with Java but the first
language for me was my Super Tuscan
anything right now they are trying to
you know warm our world more for four
different languages and I think there's
a variety of languages that young people
are more into and there are women
which is a very very important thing
that we have more women's in technology
and this is a very nice way to you know
yeah yeah in fact I was going to mention
it today obviously is International
Women's Day
what drew you into information
technology as a career well I was into
into computers very very young how young
14 okay
and what were you what was your
involvement at that well and in fact
they have like yet my my dad supports me
a lot because he saw he's also an
engineer okay engineer so when I was
fourteen he asked me about okay you have
to choose you want to for example in
South America they have we have four
four four fifteen birthdays you can have
you know like a big party and you
dressed like a white dress quinceanera
yeah like a princess and so I have to
choose or that or a computer with a
monitor and so I I was very into
programming and it was you know TTR ice
eighty you know yes I'm anxious you know
saying how hola well I am with this
story but I started with this and I and
I I didn't have any doubts and I was you
know 15 years old I didn't have any
doubt about that I wanted to be an
engineer a computer engineer are you
involved in women in technology efforts
how are you encouraging young women to
get involved in technical s year at
almost October it was October November I
was invited by the telecommunication
company my in my country Anton and they
invited me to do a motivation
motivational motivational motivational
motivational thank you I talked about to
many many girls like 200 girls in high
school in public high school so they
were like 13 14 years old
and that is an adage you have to start
deciding what you're going to do with
your life right now it's a very you know
early age to take this type of decisions
but you have to and I explained to them
all the things of the good things that
are happening with me just for decided
to be an engineer and this because you
know you have a market when you you know
ash of market but when you do engineer
what do computers the the shop market
for you is the whole world you know it's
not limited to your country some limited
to you if you study I know if you're
decided to be a lawyer so if you move to
another country you need to study all
the all the other laws for the other
country but right right you doing be an
engineer you know a computer engine you
can do it in any place that I'd never
thought about that actually true so that
was a very very big incentive for them
you know you can leave whenever you want
you can do the work do you want to work
with our intuition artificial
intelligence do you want to work with
machine learning do you want to start
new things do you want I don't know with
NASA okay you can do it okay
I have travel a lot thanks to this to
this profession I have met you know an
amazing people you know the whole world
so I'm pretty pretty grateful with this
profession pretty pretty grateful I'm
very lucky
well you're an excellent spokesman
hopefully that pays off and you can you
can draw some some young women into the
profession you know vice thank you so
much for stopping by see us dating if
you're interested in more information on
