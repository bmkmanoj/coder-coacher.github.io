here at Auto Coco's Sydney I'm your host
Javed Mohammed and I have as my guest
today Yaakov and let's didn't get the
penalty tonight
khadiyah and James Isles who are both
the cloud platform advocates consultant
and more absolutely well thank you very
much for having us yeah yeah thank you
for coming gentlemen so I'm telling you
guys did a hands-on lab what was it can
you tell us a little bit what that was
what darker and containers and you know
short love it a little bit we saw that
we did a hands-on lab on docker so we
allowed people to sort of see how docker
can make you know sort of building
applications and distributing those
doing dev test migrations to production
make those very easy we looked at some
of the technology that Oracle now has in
the Oracle container cloud service and
how you can use that to really leverage
the advantages of docker in an
enterprise sense you know spin out you
know WebLogic clusters and all sorts of
fantastic little open-source projects
and better do those almost instantly
without having to sort of have that time
lapse or waiting to infrastructure to be
provisioned or waiting for people to
install software you just grab your
image grab your docker file and you hit
the ground running through ok so when
you're talking about dev tear something
in my mind I'm thinking of DevOps and
the DevOps pipeline is that does this
kind of tie in in some ways to that
absolutely so when you look at from
having a calm safe the right through to
where you can deliver business value the
time with Dockers has been from
decreased tremendously so for people
wanting to quickly spin up the
capability they sticker
see if it works and then to put that
into production that's pretty much what
we try to demonstrate here today and and
as part of that DevOps story being able
to do something once and repeat it over
and over and over again you know have
that iterative step of you know constant
improvement but in that DevOps mythology
of methodology of you know you want to
be able to have everyone involved you
have a migrated through have complete
ownership of control of it
docker really facilitates that from the
developer through to your IT
administrator and you've got massive
benefits from a developer I in dive for
me personally I love using
proof of concepts and demonstrations
yeah because I can get access to all the
bits of software that I need and put
together very quickly and we can deploy
that as is directly to a production
system that's tremendous yeah yeah not
so kind of beat the DevOps pipeline to
death but if the DevOps pipeline starts
off with the code repository such as
github Dockers on the other end of the
other end of the pipeline so what is it
is it you distorting the artifacts or
what is it you're you're putting in the
doctor hub
well the docker hub would actually be
essentially the application that you
want to distribute so it completely
packaged up ready to run docker image
that someone can then download and build
and that's your application that's
exactly as it was that you wanted to
provide it you don't have to worry about
what platform it's going to run on you
don't have to worry about installing
third-party libraries you've got a
self-contained application that runs
exactly as the developer intended how
long was the hands on load by the way I
was about just under two hours it's in
the two hours and how many people came
both folks fully we'll see about 40
people at so W and so it's quite quite a
busy quite a busy session everyone was I
think really engaged in the in the
process the lab material itself was
extremely interesting and it's available
up on github at the moment but we can
make that address available IO if you
want to pass that on yes people can jump
on there they can actually follow
through the processes they can install
docker on a Linux VM and go from there
and actually see what it was that we
achieved
yeah those won't follow on question but
you if it looks like you're Liddy
answered that one is that for those
people who weren't able to attend the
event if there's any way for them to
actually it's absolutely that experience
we've got everything up in github it's
all extremely well documented there's
links there to install darker on Linux
if you've got that available there's
links to build your own VM and of course
you can also look at taking advantage of
the Oracle cloud geez okay toss our
Oracle contain a cloud service it's
actually you know hosts those docker
containers and images still want to give
their doctor but oh yeah so if you go to
we put together a quick URL just for a
session so if you go to docker dot James
riles comm lets jmes ryl es
calm and that'll take you directly to
the docker lab okay and to when I post
this on youtube unless you put that link
in they're all perfect thank you very
much well gentlemen thank you for coming
by and all the best thank you very much
having to having I thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
