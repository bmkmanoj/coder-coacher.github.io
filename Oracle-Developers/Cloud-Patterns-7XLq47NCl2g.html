room is mostly packed because when I
applied for all talk and received
approval I was really proud to be a
speaker chai WAN and then I receive the
schedule and no I was speaker for the
last days of last session so i was
thinking i will be sold with my
colleague but my colleague already went
back to los altos all right thank you
very much I appreciate you that so this
dog is not mine not strictly speaking it
has been inspired by my colleague
Michael needle and I also pick up some
ID from Eric bata from VMware so i will
introduce myself I'm support engineer
upload this my name is Nicola drove so
but this is a trench company whereas all
telecommute so in most time I'm walking
this way all this way depends when it's
called I've been a maven commit or not
active anymore but I wrote a book please
buy it for eating french but by it I
will earn one a row and I'm a Jenkins
committee as well I'm a jug leader I've
founded the local Brittany in France
joke right leg and the conference to
Bryce count and I'm contributing to many
things so I have lots of these small
bites here and reap please that's how I
can nori go down to the floor and that's
all you probably already obscene this
pyramid absolute of the cloud I don't
really like it I prefer the other one
this way because what's its importance
as a developer is to know so ecosystem
we are what we are considering so okay
so in fact such as a service is the
basis for switching it's huge data
center it's incredible resources but
from an ecosystem perspectives arif
really few of them very large one you
are a mess only
shoo if we have a zoo rackspace few of
them but not a dozen on top of it you
have a few offers for sales platform as
a service cloudbees Google App Engine
our COO and so on and then the zara all
the application that are created on top
of this reverse pyramid and it probably
equipped 33 external shop since a cheese
flavor because these tools and you are
far more than just this room so you can
expect lots of application so this talk
is not strictly focused include bees but
fosters at my own experience so can also
apply to a droid foundry to open shift
to App Engine and the best pass ever
Club is what you probably will learn
here is that taking your unpromising
application your classic application and
deploying it to the cloud is not always
easy there is some scepter change such
as some challenge you have to address
but the reverse is always something
simple so we can resume all what I will
say during one hour to if you did your
job with the clean architecture that's
all so in some cash sometimes we'd have
to do some refactoring in your own code
to make it cloud compliant it looks like
a like your TV advertisement but her the
easy way if you want to start an
application and press one of the service
is to start from scratch grid fin
application so you don't have specific
constraint and you will learn the
platform as you use it you will have
some issues but there is no you won't
have a thousand of line of Scots that
would be impacted so such that will be
smooth I've put some some sample of such
applications that I contributed to
settle French conferences which rated in
host
the website and registration and so on
on Toby's so that what has been created
using your play for Morneau GS and exert
such are really a hype and so on there
is also the all the author's application
that we all have that are just plain old
java application using some spring maybe
even some strips we still using struts
okay I contributed to stretch some years
ago Sultan is when you have such an
application so many sure you have it set
the framework you are using and the way
you have development yourself as not big
gum not be created with cloud is mine so
there is some things apps may be little
complex when you want to switch to a
club department you are really heating
some constraint because you take your
war you deploy it don't work you have to
debug and so on not really pleasant I
will illustrate my I talked with the
application from the divx conference do
you know the dev box conference nobody
oh it's the best conference ever you
imagine java one but down in Europe and
with Google Twitter and Facebook guys
with a rig we talk hey it's cool yeah
okay this this conference has a code for
paper registration website and so on and
so on from something really classic and
this is the typical Cloud usage because
such a replication only as traffic two
months a year before the conference
Roberta tried to register everybody
wants to know the schedule and after the
conference is completed nobody cares the
initial setup self-hosting their
infrastructure and as I had many issues
due to do you to this lack of elasticity
so they switch to club display pass
platform-as-a-service it's a pure very
classic application based on week at
spring my sheep or hibernate and so on
so like most of the job application so
much as you don't really know about here
is here is that just eluded eyes you can
see it's mostly required application
whether you are all the all the talk I
have submitted to this yeah I've been
rejected with detailed rejected F
accepted you nothing we wonderful just
some puppy whip okay that's happened so
that's application you probably have
with maybe not dedicated to a conference
but very classic application the first
things they have to learn is that when
the conference comes into traffic
doubles every day up to a very high
traffic you can just ask your provider
to get a bigger box you have to skate
out that's something you probably
already know from software computing
silence that's that is the physical
limit and the best way to scale is to
distribute on the coaster you still can
scare up on a platform as a service that
itself is using an
infrastructure-as-a-service so you can
start use amazon terms for for the
machines you can start on a and once
more and then switch and emma large and
then to a double extra-large and and
then is there is no bigger box and this
happens when you need really more
because your traffic is growing you're
probably your business is really
starting you have a good birds on the
press and you can follow the traffic
remember the time when Twitter hard to
show you this big whale then in you are
sorry we can't we can't
that's really difficult to address from
a business perspective and even when you
have such a huge box for your
application if you check your Russell's
actual resource this is a completely sir
bob tball because you have some some
variations and you pay for big box so
not really cool if you look in details
what's an extra-large matching is you
quickly we win age in some huge server
mainframe 10 meter long with blue lights
and so on but to dt not it's a it's
something classic mostly this computer
that's my huge server so nothing read
really so so incredible servers that you
may expect will follow your increasing
traffic so scale out so as such the
modem town to say think clustering and
you can really adapt your resource
conscription to the load of your
application all the platform as a
service of an auto scale option that
will just reduce your costs to exactly
what is needed to run the application at
a specific time so everyone from a cost
perspective this makes sense and from a
business perspective is just ok if I
double my user for whatever reason
because I got a picture of my boss
wearing your beasts costume published on
Twitter you did you see this one now
this is my boss ok such that won't be a
technical issue to to have in fact due
to a guy coming and all we have to to
install new server quickly and so on and
we have to redeploy a new application
and check the cluster ring 10 so
platform do tell you what's happening on
the path is that you have some mostly
big server that are split into slices
thanks to some virtualization techniques
mostly Alex second to narrow things like
that and add a lowes to allocate exactly
the amount of resources that is required
for application that's what you can help
that booty to nancy's some yet an
awesome magic world there is many way to
implement this as a hardware level that
is about farrah DJ virtualization there
is all open source excuse me operating
system level that is exactly what Alex
sea container do and there is a
middleware level that is really
interesting for samples if you consider
a my sequel that allows it's easy to say
ok I will create one Shaima one schema
for each of my user with right
permissions so it is a late there is
some sort of multi-tenancy you can't
have custom configuration for you buddy
but that make sense if you're
considering the JVM it's running as a
UNIX process so doing some multi-tenancy
but with the same system user what
happen if my application does a runtime
not exact so there is interesting
research papers and so on to have a
multi-tenancy on Java 9 i'm not sure
that will happen but who knows you
probably also have seen many many
presentation on being stateless being to
insist everything stressed fool yeah i
would say yeah ok be stateless if you
can that's so simple the promise is to
scale the reader you doable users to
ball traffic application is a just need
to double resources that's ok but there
will always at there is some interaction
with your user that is not into a singer
HTTP request or you are really a very
simple application so you have to
maintain
some conversation we are between the
application and the user so you have to
maintain some sort of state there is
many way to do this and the way the
performance are addresses addressed in
such a state class world is to have cash
how can you expect those on nodes on for
it raining your application to a good
database access performance using a cage
and the cash is synchronization so there
is some some state in a way and there is
also something that I learn because I
just got this this issue with my own
application I was touring waves some of
you are using grace if you so I created
a small glass application was fun was
quick I wanted to involve some security
because was internal internet use
application so i enabled security
bringing one line of configuration you
have a nice login screen and so on
perfect what you have to know is that
spring security itself is a very great
security plug-in is itself using sprint
security and the default configuration
for integrity is using HTTP session Oh
state is back you put maybe you know
that you know well Spring security you
know all the details but the frameworks
abstraction completely hides this detail
that's why I tell you that those
frameworks have not been designed with
clowns as DNA second adapter is many way
to fix this issue with us to line of
configuration to actually but if nobody
tells you you will just have a big issue
can you really be stateless
for example place is using browser
cookies from an architecture point of
view that's perfect so client is will
only want to know that you are state
there is some security constraints to be
addressed but prefer mark is doing that
well the main issue of seats you have
real lots of data to maintain the
opposite state every request we will
have a high payload so especially if
your application is hosted in the cloud
you will pay for Adam see that's soap
isn't all you can use the good old HTTP
session as we use for years java ee
premised that there is some container
way to distribute the session on the
cluster but such as to api to supervise
the implementation his fourth of wonder
so there is many way to do that i'll put
this we offer memcache based replication
I don't know exactly I was a platform I
do there is also a very simple solution
such sticky session a user will always
always be served by the same node if the
node is retired for whatever reason of
your redeploy your application the user
will lost with losses this station but
you have to balance it's more business
choice do you want really all your user
to stay online whatever happened to the
application or is it ok when you
redeploy that you lose whew whew user
session because there is no long
conversation with no job is never once
all solution so you have really to
balance which one we're not sure actual
use case and some so as solution is to
say ok I will centralize at the database
level so you suppose that you have some
data storage that's really scary that's
something that no sequel do really well
but from business logic point of view
it's make it some time
because you know the principles no
support when you write some data it will
be eventually passes dead consistent and
so on but you don't have immediately
someone to say you okay transaction is
committed you will find another think
you will click quickly discover when you
go give the cloud to try it's a login
for yes we have been locked by java ee
vonda's has provided custom extension or
at least some waste some very specific
way to configure resources and when you
have your application running on
websphere with lots of hard for it to
work you know that you will never
deployed just as isn't a boss or what or
anything else that's not restricted to
Hawaii the best way to avoid such
locking is to just do stand out it's so
good good places conference to talk
about startup because you have lots of
GSA experts ja vai ESO is one of them
what I would like to know Java is a good
pass because there is some discreet
about things in July even even Java is e
could be considered turned out such some
way to define a runtime don't try to use
some custom extensions and for sample if
you need to configure your application
so really I just found out is to use on
your own unviable or system property
into the GOM world but that's something
that's all frameworks support or are
they run on supportive and windows so
that's really something strictly
portable without any issue engine you
can reproduce on your own desk laptop to
debug and develop your application and
if you really need to do something
specific for whatever reason sometimes
just because there is really some a very
grid service such a continent container
provides and you want to use it it makes
your development quicker in such case
wrap
such in this specific abstraction so
that you don't have had locked with a
with a vendor so typical standard Java
EE or just a servlet Hodges to jeff j km
in order i go system into the linux up
as my sequel PHP not GS word oh that's
some sort of thunder but not strictly
speaking stunned out at the factory de
facto standard but that makes sense if
your issue can see if you have a ruby
application and you can just package it
to be build and deploy with some basic
commands to populate the vm impairment
you can reproduce it's everywhere you
probably can reproduce it by owner on a
cloud provider the main issue word with
the dev axe application is the five
system i wish our secret with you the
cloud provider are you are using a very
specific file system implementation that
is shredding your file system someone's
in somewhere it's there it's not that
you don't never never know exactly you
access ified it's a and you access it
later not mmm that's i am its allies
what is not why because a platform of
the service is a pool of server and
seven a pool of slice of service so when
your application is first deploy or
we're on a user is septic is a accessing
your application this node with hundreds
of requests and if you redeploy or if
you are using cluster node this also not
with follow the conversation and the
file upload you did there is not
available on this on this one with the
graphics look stupid but when your
application as strange behaviour it's
not so simple that's well why what
amazon is calling the ephemera or five
system that's just to local disk and
there is no guarantee for past pistons
and for distribution in the cursor so if
you need to stow that on five system
use Amazon s3 or even database blob or
no sequel equivalent so that you are
safe I told this we are promoting s
profile CSM wrapper that lets you map
directory in your application on the run
onto a straw bukit there is some
drawbacks it's on magic but can be a
good solution and if you use that those
solutions we've got something really
persistent don't forget that you have
gigabytes available in the intramural
disk use it as you catch you retrieve
information for your storage engine keep
a copy in your cage that means that you
have to endure some immutability when
you store data so from your business
logic that may have impact that's the
best way if you can't do that just be
careful and remember okay well every
time I do a file white I need to ensure
what time actually doing because the
main difficulty West file system when
you are poaching an existing application
to the cloud is that it's just
java.io.file what end submittals you
don't know if it's just some dumb powder
temporary files that is taught that
would be processed and it doesn't really
matter it's not distributed or if it's
actually the user profile avatar so it
has to be maintained in the installed in
is some precedent way there is no way to
do it automatically just scanning the
source code and so you really have to
know the business logic that that is
near in the same category you are the
famous Singleton's Spring Framework
introduced massively so use of singleton
I'm not drinking strict that's sorry
strictly speaking about social
Singleton's those one hour in most gay
just optional switch service two of them
three of three instances of the same
objective not an issue has just not
state sometime you really want to have
some actual
al is a singer one around the world are
one's own universe a simple example is
the quads job scheduler and you know it
so mostly a chrome in intimate in Java
and we hire the customer that's how a
big issue he had a billing job running
everyday such was running twice because
he had his application deployed on to
note so the job was running twice that
says was a surprise for me for him never
never suppose this would happen quartz
has a very simple solution that's using
jdbc that sits on store to manage the
job table that is actually the same
issue I explained about to create
security pregnant if you don't know the
framework you are using you just say
okay it's a crown that seems to work on
Milo come to on my computer it works you
all who here didn't say that at least
once in his life there is another
solution that was the one that has been
selected for this user is to use the
service as a cron not a framework at
cloudbees while hosting Jenkins for all
the build and testing purpose and so
customer just notice we are building our
project we are running QA every night
and why don't we just trigger the
billing from Jenkins and it created a
REST API to add replication generate the
bill report and a Jenkins up to invoke
the application do the bidding so main
benefit was it worth far more simple to
test if you want to run it twice just
invert the job or just being the URL you
want to test for Kelly you don't have to
wait for midnight such a bad
execute just being the you well it was
here they were even able to create some
tests to do but tests writing tests as a
Java developer cloud is also about
latency we develop on our own computer
we do some team testing on local area
network and then we deploy somewhere on
the cloud sometimes the somewhere it's a
bit confusing am i calling Michael is
living in Australia and when it access
servers in the US yas tam single nuttin
see so such can hurt when you are some
pressure for something to really a high
priority task and the web interface is
still are all and slow and slow method
to something real reading interesting so
i won't wyndham the wheels there with
lots lots lots of tools and
recommendation on a good way to create
web interface this is my blog it's using
blogger it's extra mistral google is not
present at javaone so i can see it to my
blogger to display is a running i see
100 requests to get all three image and
so on and javascript and such
configuration of the page so yeah so the
basic recommendation for web developer
is to reduce the number of requests so
collapse all the javascript in single
file same for CSS use the city's use a
CSS image spite and so on and so on and
so on the main idea is to use HTTP the
right way there is lots of cash he does
to help the network in the browser to
act coy p a very simple way to desert it
is for all your static resources to
other unique you are so that you can
force the cash
first time any browser access it it's
keeping cash and if you just want to
ensure that your user will have the new
logo of your company just have to add a
versioning to the you are can be harsh
can be anything I'll even simpler even
or better in time of performances use a
content delivery network so to read the
best option so I hope I didn't you're
not too afraid with solar shade maybe
you are thinking oh I'm not sure I will
meet with my application to the clouds
not don't not so sexy so do you think
it's a good way to migrate to the cloud
yeah yes it is what you need is to be a
strong man with a well-established brain
and with the grid tool some some samples
SOA that's such a big acronym but I'm
not speaking about soap service with WS
transactional and security and all those
horrible xml stuff and what I
service-oriented architectures the right
way it's about splitting your
application into small services that
collaborate each other by rest calls
JSON Swift whatever protocol depending
on your actual needs can be synchronous
using plain old HTTP or a synchronous
using your message queue and I've so
many application where to complex as you
can spit them every single yeah it's of
spaghetti design yeah perfect but if you
think about your architecture they have
probably many things that you can
consider to be smaller pieces of
software first benefits you will be able
to scale its part independently so for
example your front-end needs to be
really quick so
give him some place to be a true to
answer you will batch process to index
all the content may even be shut down
during the day because it's a batch will
run once and sundown so on for everyone
and then it's easy to say okay this is a
project has a Berg I just released this
one I'm accessing its as a rest service
with the west where established JSON
format so that's fine to have
distinction in the release cycle or even
you can have a new generation front end
with a new bootstrap base because
everybody is using boost to our today
front end and you can deploy it with the
reality that a base and shown services
test eats have beta testers and so on
and just kills all one when you when you
save for the same reason don't try to
give randoms will consume services the
other service ecosystem is huge
especially if you run on Amazon most
services are all stood in on Amazon
sample if you need to send Meg's from an
application okay you can set up your own
smtp server add some monitoring
maintained by security fix and so on and
so on and so on and spend howard it's
extremely interesting if you want to
understand zones the SMTP protocol but
you can also just subscribe to send grid
with a free subscription plug into your
application and such a job is done and
you benefits all the capacities from
sang grins to track everything that
happened to your matron and through it
has been delivered to give you report
and so on and so on same for memcache
here if you want to use memcache for
replication such high 0 for data
indexing mungo HQ rabbit and so on and
so on it's probably isn't those from
partnership with the substrata service
provider so that we check to integration
is we're working we make some
demonstration documentation on the
premise how to connect to memcache sure
so it's a
easy for you and for sure you can use
your own preferred software as a service
to plug because all of them are based on
API calls so it's really Bruce Lee
Cooper pretty easy to to attach he'll
require the grid service ecosystem but
I'm not here to do advertisement for a
roku and when I talk about side consume
service on the public cloud that were
always someone to tell me yes but my
company is creating your private cloud
nobody asks I'm surprised but so the
question do you produce your own
electricity I don't think so you are
consuming electricity as a service like
water and where many other things and so
sole reason I verb so far about I need
my own private world is about security
if someone say security nobody can
answer the house Jim it's about
securities or and if you look at recent
announcement from amazon they are also
offering what they call the virtual
private cloud that is based on a VPN
from your enterprise that makes some
section of amazon public cloud the
actually private with fire water
everywhere and private network and so on
and that gives you all the benefits for
the cloud without sacrifice to the
security and then it's always someone to
say yes but now is not about technical
security but my data confidential yeah
for sample your sales guy sort of old
customer data are using Salesforce that
is the typical software service and
sales force has all the customers
billing data for a huge amount of very
very strategic company so that that's
only politics I want my private cloud
cloud is cool I've I went to open world
conference and there was a a guy that's
on
crowd is the future I want my own cloud
yeah okay and there is also a great
great great concept of the design for
failure you may be no the netflix guys
have lots of very interesting papers and
the ways of testing infrastructures are
killing servers randomly to answer that
your infrastructure with resurrects the
data and rebuild the service that's
really incredible without doing such
from an architect point of view follow
the blog honesty but I'm not sure you
need that but the question is not if it
may fail it's just when it will fail and
it's not specific to the cloud you know
your own data center always art has a
failure just in most cases Mazzone where
or when you were on vacation that's when
the the main issue with the cloud is
that is visible you are the status for
all services that said we are we
wherever so where I do it I did a screen
capture from the club is one where
everything is ok but that such happen
with some time have some provisioning
issues that prevent new server to be
started so we have a small portion of
users that have applications in still
winning but I can't deploy the new
version and so we do everything possible
to start reestablish the service but
such happen and we make it public do you
do to use your company make your press
announcements every time you have a
server to have a failure yeah if you
want to be safe for some way safe okay
you just you can do the the next week's
way then you will probably a patrol car
driver one next year or you can also try
to be careful with the external resource
such just about our sankunni this is
something that happened to a diverse
conference
registration just before devoxx you gave
I'm remember correctly one week before
so that was the last registration and
sangre that had a temporary issue this
one yeah operates at civic Sookie so the
code was freaky second she'll get user
information confirm and send the
confirmation email and wait for the mail
to be delivered and you are hard threads
to start and wait for the mail to be
delivered and send going to say oh sorry
we have an outage sorry sorry so just
doing this I synchronously would reserve
the issue so that some best practice
such can apply to any software you heard
about the way java collection in a Java
8 are doing things in power and so on we
don't use multi calls and we design
releasing secondary even when we consume
external resources we do this second
cherie that's such here anyway cloud is
safer so I don't have the disclaimer
that whole article shows but I have some
metrics I never not sure I'm supposed to
tell you that and maybe I in your aim a
liar anyway last year we suffered had
filled with 20 th 12 min 20 minutes
those are doing 10 minutes in terms of
SLA is famous yesterday it's a 49 not
too bad so main problem is that we
didn't try to hide this information so
when amazon has some outrage so
blogosphere the twittersphere the press
he said oh another issue in the cloud
the same way you have you have read the
whole java as under the security issue
yeah for those of us are still using up
lets you know okay and I e6
we also for sue maintain everything
about backup disaster recovery that's
part of the service that being a
platform as a service is not just
creating some vm instant in Java Tom can
start in your application and holy-o's
who have to maintain security we have to
set up of the monitoring we have to
patch and so on and so on so that you
don't have to monitor by yourself for
the infrastructure level if you are bugs
in your business logic it's your
business logic sorry there is no bug fix
as a service yet that may be a good idea
someone some of you are so what we do is
every time you deploy an application
it's archived on s3 databases is a stone
on OBS at are persistent and back up
every day and so on and so on and you
are encouraged to have your own Decker
policy on top of it those back up for
our own recovery if you have some
sensitive data in your database create
Jenkins jobs to do a nice equal dump
everywhere every day or some things so
that's that way if you need even more if
your ID guys want to 89 SLA he live on
Agnes in it free I'm sure there are some
IT guys are dreaming about our on Amazon
you have multizone have ability that
means that your application can be
deployed on two servers that are not in
the same data center such don't use the
same electricity on network access but
still have a high traffic network low
launches load blow Lattanzi for it so
that's a good way to say okay my two
application is running if something goes
wrong such happens the other one is
still there but if you have read the
press about Amazon issues there was a
controller as a single point of failure
between the LEDs his own so
what's a bit broken the other solution
is to be multi-region deploy your
application once in us those are Europe
you are completely safe for such with
your big programming on so here's its
app that's supposed to be really safe
then you have to synchronize you have
real network latency between US and
France I can confirm so that's suppose
that your application is not designed to
say okay I'm cool I'm committing
something in the database and I expect
the european version of my application
to immediately see the result all your
application will be incredibly strong at
the same way when you do a synchronizing
your code in java so for the same reason
you have to add some elastic dns such as
able to switch user from u.s. to Europe
when something goes wrong amazone route
53 is a good option for that so there is
no no term care solution I want my
application to be mutual region yes sir
sign here no it's not so simple that is
possible sorry depends on your own
business are you okay to wait some
significant development hours just was
this your choice I was saying that we
are monitoring and maintaining to
infrastructure the middleware for you
but not your application that means that
you still need ops somewhere you may or
may hear that with the cloud you don't
need operation guys you still have not
strictly the same that won't do the same
jobs there they won't install linux
kernel's anymore let's say i have the
culture of monitoring of measure of
dashboards and so on of possible based
on them so i use for reduced ability
using script or even dedicated tools i
prepared chef and so on so in such case
they like your application to have lots
of metrics collected I told this we
consider that the platform
as a service is not just running tomcat
it's from your source code being built
by Jenkins in deployed beam with being
archived to a server and the server sell
between being fully monitored with
visibility for you not just for our own
monitoring sample is to plug New Relic
or our dynamics to instrument your jvm
and collect matrix other option is to
connect paper trays such will collect
all logs and allow you to do some
specific textures searching for a
regular expression and Devon sinks
triggering alerts when something
specific happens so that's a good option
that we also have a partner with hosted
graffiti if you know that lets you
create some time bus line graphs that's
why we useful for technical monitoring
but also for business mentoring if you
are able to expose business metrics
hello then it's easy to export
everything to graph it create graphs
that create an image you can just plug
into your wiki for business guys to see
okay here is a traffic vacations for the
application today here is the phone
we've collected as whatever your
application is doing so you may
understand that we are not talking about
very low level ops know every or can I
option well that small couch ooh that's
I've met so far on the DevOps ecosystem
what they like in in
platform-as-a-service it's at the goal
of DevOps to have one team developer end
oops not that everybody knows everything
but just we collaborate together so we
have one goals it's a for the
application to have the new feature with
best time to market and to be stable if
you break everything such don't makes so
much sense to be on time on market and a
very simple way to do this is that
everybody shares the same platform as a
developer I'm trying to reproduce Oberg
I'm running the exact same on the run
ons and my prediction with the class
deployment on dedicated hardware you
mostly never get the same environment
even for staging it's somewhere smaller
or don't have the same database export
or it's always complex to be in sync on
the platform as a service you don't have
developer integration staging prediction
of your man's own you only have values
application running the same binaries
not accessing the same database which
everybody has the same configuration so
you can reproduce bugs and so on and
test things so delivery is not about
sending an email with a wire attached
and the end of and 100 page to world
document to explain how to run the
script for installation and so do you
have such a document I had four years to
write such documents as well okay
deployment the platform of the service
is too about coding an API and in most
cases SDK to help you because your
service many options to pass so there is
a clean SDK the club is one is called
bees bees up deploy my up dot wha oops
they prod and choose the target to be a
prediction staging whatever the seminary
is sent in terms of development process
and classic organization it's mostly a
fire-and-forget so it's sending the
email okay we have finished our jobs a
while is ready push to production that's
that all the apps to take your war and
understand how to deploy this single on
a web spam el Chino do what you can do
with the cloud platform you also can do
at home but it's really difficult it's
continuous delivery that means every
commit that passed unit tests create a
while archive can be deployed on a test
environment this one will pass let's say
selenium test for functional testing you
can use blaze better for sample for
performance testing and so on
and if if everything is okay can deploy
on the stage in a permanent so that your
QA team can run some additional test and
validate the bay view of your
application from a human perspective
because of my automatic testing is great
but sometime it's missing few days shoe
important the days and then your boss
can push the green button put prediction
because set the exact same process you
run every day for every commit so there
is no stress and then you can do my
qualities too if you are using get for
sample you can do a feature branch and
have a specific instance true to test
the new feature and when it's okay it's
merging master and your boss can
validate its ok and put your prediction
that can happen many times a day when
you you probably already heard about
continuous delivery continuous
integration is well established now
every time you commit you run you build
your test that's right continuous
deployment is about doing all that stuff
and deploying to your prediction or to
your actual target that's a bit
optimistic so the actual best practice
is really the continuous delivery every
commit can be tested down to a beanery
that is ready for production and
switching to the next step don't require
any human to edit web dot XML file or
whatever this famous way java ee tell us
how to configure an application manage
your resource the same way you manage
your code you have the database it's
easy to manage so good sorry to manage
your source code have branches and so on
but what about your database for sure
you can create the schema using your my
sequel client but then you can't
replicate you on the amount you can
manage your database upgrades and so on
and so on you can do the same
in your SEM just like you do for your
source code your application
configuration properties and so on just
have to store your database treat you
should do it with pure SQL script it's
really complex so there is very
interesting tools I try to address this
issue on migrating database or do adding
some abstraction in the way you did
classes we define the schema it's still
a little complex but really really
interesting as has true you also can
have zero downtime deployment that's
pretty simple and most
platform-as-a-service of her use this
option my demo application is routed to
etc at some time I'm ruining the
deployment command so the new binary is
deployed to another server and when it's
ready to root of switcher traffic no
interruption of service that allows you
to do deployment doesn't I'm a day if
you are able to manage the state the
conversation with your user to switch
the same way something if you want to do
that something you have to know is that
this happen as well for your database
your app is running with a specific
person of the scheme out and then you
deploy your new version that has some
you update command to add some required
columns and everything phase for a few
seconds for users that are still using
this one in Java we have are duplicated
you can do the same with your database
when you create a new a single shift of
the schema don't do it a strict way the
first time to eat in progressive way
first time you are the column deploy new
application new version of your
application is starting to use this
column but as some fall back it just see
if the clone is new and then the late
the future they will tip the deployment
with just upgrade
logic to say okay now I'm adding a non
new restriction to the database and I
can just drop to existing code night and
if you don't want to under all these
practices you can do the Twitter way
just deploy temporary applications as
they all sorry right Meg knows that can
be for just 10 seconds hope but a big
deal and the main goal from a diverse
perspective is that deployment is not an
event in terms of stress of everybody is
that ok we have a production tomorrow
there is a very interesting parties for
that it's called blue Gwynned or green
blue tape on deployment this is
implemented on unplowed bees and well
the cotton batting for the idea is just
to alway of two version of your
application chain deployed and you just
change the configuration of the router
so your your current application is a
green one you deploy the blue one you
can test it and so on and when you are
ready you don't actually push the green
button to have a new deployment you just
switch the traffic and if anything is
wrong you can switch back that's also
don't kill the green one too quickly
just ensure that everything is fine with
the blue one on the same category you
can experiment with a be testing that is
a selecting a category of your users
that will see the new version of the
application I was talking about the new
front-end samples that you are
experimenting with a new design and so
on that's a very interesting way to
correct business metrics I've selected
the a population of my users are testing
the new guy is actually my target
audience for my application so once that
will actually pay for the service and so
I can really measure those replication a
better job for those guys and that's
just a subset
same for cannery testing get a bit
deeper that means that you have some
users a test with seven don't know that
a test that's a natural way fun and as a
conclusion if you follow this logic to
be extremely agile in the way you
provide new features and test with the
subset of user and do Bluegreen so that
you can read that if something is wrong
and so on and so on do you know what
that now it's a first bumpy lot it's
spam period making paper so guy who
captured the bumpy lot first created one
on paper and got it 1 1 week long just
to check is it's too big for my pocket
is it's easy to end it that was he was
thinking for sample that the screen was
not really easy for probably he had big
fingers so equated the stills was just a
piece of wood and that was what some
called a prototype that's even not a
prototype that's a proof of concept that
is makes sense to do something else to
implement i have no proof of that but
i've heard that amazon is actually doing
that when they have a new ID for a new
widget on the website the first create a
widget have graphic element with a
button that does nothing but correct
matrix the activated to a random panera
fuser one person maybe or maybe even
less because i have so many users and
they do starts who clicked or even deeds
a click if you go to amazon you see your
words are two clicks that nothing
happened you do about Drake nah
Singapore oh never mind so from a user
perspective isn't not too big deal but
from a business perspective you can
imagine for the marketing they had an ID
this morning it was on the website at
noon at 2pm second stop the project
because I know nobody a script
don't have to spend money to implement
that and plan for two years development
process and so on and such searching is
only possible if you don't have to care
about your infrastructure about your
middleware about your deployment process
that you really can have a smooth
traffic between your business guys that
have new ideas your marketing that is
trying to know what your customer want
your developers that have to implement
and don't don't want to waste time on
the 90s that is stupid who offers
already implemented some feature being
sure that nobody will never use that
only twenty-five percent you have
working for great companies thank you
everybody I hope you had a great gerawan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
