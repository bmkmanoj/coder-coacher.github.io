third of April office hours for the
database cloud service my name is Robert
Austin coming from the Netherlands and
I'm trying to answer all your questions
you have on the system you can answer
questions by selling them to me by email
or you can ask questions in the chat
window that I have open on my rights or
sometimes left on the video but
sometimes you'll see me watch to the
right to see if there's any questions my
experience is that there are no
questions in the beginning I am received
any questions from the email so what I
wanted to do today is give you a short
update of things that I noticed when I
was going through the ocean and the
ocean classic systems because of
database so this is small overview I
have for you so one of the things is
that there are no Oracle various virtual
machines anymore on the ocean classic
and I'll dive into the various subjects
in few moments it's just an overview
talk a little bit about oshi I bought
new LAN and data center and about the
new x7 platform that we have home
database and on the share things on oshi
on oshi a classic migration of bits we
just this weekend successfully completed
the first migration at least in my area
from another system to the OCI clouds
using a tool called rack where records
new partner explain that later on talk
about limits on oshi a classic and LCIF
received a couple of questions from
partners and from customers on what are
these limits and how can you change them
and there is also an update on 11 - and
12 - as in the latest versions will not
be available and more in January 2019 so
let's kick off with the first subject
first news was the deprecation of DVCS
vm option let's do it like this so
database vm option so if you when we
started with database in the beginning
we had the database cloud service and we
have two flavors basically we had a
flavor where everything was done for you
so the moment you said I want to have a
database you go through a wizard next
next next finish and the answer will be
a fully running
database either 11 queue or 12 one
however there was another option as well
which was this database virtual machine
and if you started this database virtual
machine you basically got nothing you
got an empty infrastructure as a service
kind of a small database small file
system and no Oracle how no database
running whatsoever and the only good
thing about that service was is that you
would pay for the price of the database
licenses per hour or per month whatever
you selected but you didn't get any
tooling you didn't get any automation so
the uptake of this database virtual
machine is not that big there are some
customers that are using it but not that
much
and as a result there was never a 12.2
version for example of this database
virtual machine option now with 18c they
have definitely stated that there will
no be it will not be any database
virtual machine option in the near
future it will actually be fully
deprecated so how can you actually do
these things well in the in we have two
kinds of cloud accounts once are the the
one is the meters and the unmetered
version that is the initial way of how
we charge for database services or for
cloud services in general in those
accounts where you have metered and
unmetered
you still have the option to do database
virtual machine but it will be like I
said deprecated 12 2004 18 will not be
available as well and in the new
universal credit account so those are
the ones that are created so in the last
half year to a year in those universal
credit accounts you will not not even
see this option anymore
but for those people who are still
working with metered and unneeded be
aware that this feature this option will
be deprecated so that's basically it's
12 to an agency already and not
available
so it's something not a lot of people
will be impacted by another good news
for me at least are the
oshi on oshi ion or cloud infrastructure
bare metal the bare metal clouds or
cloud infrastructure we have new service
available so those are the oracle x7
same systems as we use in the latest
Exadata environments and those systems
have the good thing that they are faster
basically than the old CPUs we used to
use x5 systems on the system we now have
x7 systems on the system both are
available still availabl by the way you
are not forced to migrate from one place
to another place but I just wanted you
to know that the new systems are
available one of the good things is in
the new systems in the x7 is that if you
buy one OCP you of database which is the
same price as one o cpu on the x5
systems not only will you get a faster
core but also you will get twice as much
of memory so in the old systems in the
x5 systems you had 7 gigabytes of memory
per OCP you and in the x7 systems you
will have 15 gigabytes of memory per OCP
you so all without an additional charge
so how do do you recognize those new
systems well the the naming the the
versioning is actually in the naming of
the shape so for example here if you
look at this line it says vm standards
and then the number 2 so the number 2
doesn't mean you have to sockets of 2 to
course or two systems or whatever the
first number 2 you see here as in vm
standard 2 but actually mean that you
will have the the second generation of
systems and in this case these are the
x7 systems so if you have a vm standard
2.1 it means that you have an x 7 system
and you are using one OCP you same
applies to the bare metal dense systems
on the database those are the only
databases data as sisters we have on x 7
on the new shapes the b and dense Oh
- so dense io number - version 2 with 50
- oh Sh abuse optionally available on
the system so that's on the system side
be aware that the price of the bare
metal systems if you do a full bare
metal system will be slightly higher
because you can in theory burn more
Morros abuse on system so for more
information
cloud or chrome go to the database
session
and you will seek the new pricing
available so the new systems are
available in all data centers we have
four now we used to have three now and
four yeah what can I tell you more it's
they're using skylake processors the
Intel platinum 8167
em well very nice two incarnations later
10% single thread performance
approximately well at least you know
it's there be aware if you choose them
same price better performance and more
memory so my choice would always be the
new two systems okay another nice thing
on OCI is that we have a new region
available so we used to have Ashburn and
Phoenix in the United States and we only
had Frankfurt in Europe so now we have
London as well the London region is
available that comes to four regions at
this moment UK London one yeah there's
still big discussion going on like
what's it gonna be with the brexit will
they form a separate region as you look
at the naming at this moment you see
that EU and UK have been separated but
well we don't know what the brexit
negotiations will be maybe UK will have
the same security and privacy things as
in Europe so we'll see at this moment
the naming is UK London 1 if you want to
enable it you can do it yourself
one of the administrators can actually
go into the system go through regions
bottom option is manage your regions and
then you can actually enable your new
region so even if you're on universe
apprentice with the normal interface
with the generic interface you can do
that if you want to not a little bit of
nice things or going to make myself a
little bit small I mean then at least I
can put myself here that's better
and so another nice bit of news I've
been working together with a partner in
the Netherlands partner name is the doc
and with a partner we have been
migrating a customer in the Netherlands
and we've just finished the initial
migration the initial test migration and
using a partner called requester oracle
has a new partner rack we're like I said
it's American based companies but they
can well they can supply you with the
sister
all over worlds I mean they're big
enough for that and there are you say
the speciality is basically disaster
recovery and migration so migration
basically means and the South recovery
is that they can you say that
slurp an entire source system empty they
basically log in with SSA it's use a
various number of tools to actually
retrieve all the information from the
source system and use that information
to rebuild it exactly it was on the
source side but then on the OCI or the
OCR classic clouds so no more need to
think how can i migrate my application
or even how can i migrate my database
with rack where you can just simply
point and shoot you point at the source
system it makes a copy of it and it
restores it in the Oracle clouds and
then you are migrate you can do
incrementals as well so you can let's
say you have a big 4 terabyte system you
can do the 4 terabytes in 3 months as
the transportation layer and then maybe
last increment or last 2-3 incrementals
you can do in an hour and then you
migrate and then you have my credit your
source system onto your target so they
can do any to any they can do I don't
know VMware to an OC IBM or VMware to an
OCR bare metal or bare metal to bare
metal whenever you want to Linux windows
all things are there so very nice not
too expensive I mean I will not tell you
the prices exactly but I mean they are
very very reasonable in pricing that
abuse a piece of news on oshi i and oh
she a classic in oshi on oshi a classic
we can now very easily see the limits I
get a lot of questions from people
saying why cannot why can't I start this
or why can't I start that or why do I
get an error or even a quota breach or
things like that well I wanted to
explain very briefly what it is to
actually have the limits in there so on
oshi a classic all the limits are well
should be visible per service but it
basically means that you have one
overall limit on the OCR classic
environment that is stated in your con
huge note so if you go to compute
classic you go to dashboard compute
classic few details and look at resource
quotas and on my right you can see the
block storage the box stores SSD maximum
the external eyepiece and the CPU
general purpose which is six and all of
these limits will actually roll down
into your online services so this means
I can have four database oshio CPUs and
two infrastructure service or CPU so in
total six like I have here or I can do
250 gigabytes of database and 250 250
gigabytes of instruction service all of
these things limits are limited on the
compute class level on oshi I they
recently released new functionality and
that's basically the reason why I
started with this topic is that on oshi
I you can very clearly see not only what
are your limits but also how much of
those limits that you actually use so
this is done for users on admin level
with ethane rights and it's displayed
per region and per type so what you see
here in the bottom is that I went into
our personal system we I went to
identity and then went to service level
limits and then I opened up the check
box or open up the tree for database so
as you can see here I have one
allocation of bare metal dense IO for
example I'm not using it in 81 but I
haven't used in 82 and I have one used
in 83 so next time I want to try to
start something up in oceania Frankfurt
I know I have to start if I want to do
bare metal I have to go to 81 to
actually start up a bare metal system so
there is there are people talking about
removing options from the drop-down box
and when you create the database you're
creating structure as a service and are
thinking about removing options if you
are not entitled to them or are out of
resources or great amounts of things
like that but they're working on that so
at this moment I think your best look
your best hint is actually looking at
these limits if you want to know where
you are why the error is there if you
don't have any limits by the way if you
want to obscure
your limits if you want to make your
limits bigger the easiest way to do that
is actually log a service request so
every cloud environment will have a
customer service identifier basically
your entry into my Oracle support so if
you go to my office report or create a
new account put that CSI in you can
actually log a serf request for limit
increase there's no cost involved in
this you just stayed some reasonable
values and then they will increase your
limits on the system breaking news at
least interesting news both on OCI and
OCR classic the versions eleven point
two and twelve thirty-two will be not
available
starting January 2008 nineteen so in a
couple of months we're now at April so
in about eight months eleven point two
and twelve the two versions will not be
available in the cloud anymore for new
deployments so existing deployments will
still be there will still be available
for support just like normal support
policies still exist but you are not
able to create any new eleven two or
twelve two environments so couple of
reasons well for 11g you have to realize
that 11g is now ten years old
approximately so usually after at least
five or six or seven years we usually
start duplicating things from the fact
that eleven gene was still there well it
should have been deprecated already but
now it's ten years old and it's nearing
end of life and what you can still use
it
normal sport polishes just as for twelve
- well this is actually something we did
to ourselves as it because of the
renaming of the versions so twelve - oh
one that's the one we currently promote
in the database clouds as 12 - was
actually just a dot release just wasn't
a final release of the twelve to sing
like twelve 101 12010 to around twelve
103 those are all dot releases days
these are not available for like five
six seven years so the version 18 is
actually twelve two or one is 12 - OH -
sorry so 18 see because of the new
renaming is actually 12 - OH -
so it's the next small upgrade from 12
201 - 12 - OH - which is like I said
agency - that's the reason why 12 201
will be deprecated after a while because
we only want the latest and greatest in
12 - online which is 18 C sorry for the
name change um Releford she still
supported cloud tooling will continue to
be supported past 2019 there is a my
Oracle support note you see at the
bottom of the page - 3 7 7 6 5 1.1 and
it will list you also when for example
the cloud tuning will not be available
anymore
how about 12 1 well 12 1 is still
available there is no that's the
terminal release of 12 1 will show
therefore it's longer available then a
dot release on 12 - which has 18 C as
its successor still available even after
January 2019
there is no cloud provisioning and end
dates applied yet so look at that my
uncle support note I just mentioned and
you can see when 12 1 will be deprecated
or at least not available on the cloud
for new releases again support will
still be there cloud support ends - you
are 2021 you want to go to upgrade paths
you can go from 11 - maybe there's a dot
my Dietrich is very good at these things
trust you - 12 1 or 18 C is possible 12
- 13 C should be working as well just
enough release so it should be working
you have any questions on that Mike is
doing a regular a stone of flowers as
well and he has very very interesting
information on the web just search for
my dietrich de as in germany and you
will get a lot of information I think if
you just search for database upgrades
Mike you will get it as well so that's
it for the updates I have today let's
have a look at questions well there are
no questions today so it's a short
session
maybe I'll repeat it at 11 o'clock
because I made a small mistake with the
universal time and the summertime policy
for that so maybe to show up it's not
that high but if there are no question
then I'll just close the session so
thank you for watching thank you for
listening and if there's any questions
please let me know Robert no question at
or cannot come my email address is in
the presentation if not my next session
will be on the 30th of April because on
the month of May the first Monday in May
I will have a small holiday so that's
reason why I was I made it a little bit
earlier on the 30th of April so any
questions let me know any such as you
like me to present or discuss let me
know as well and until then thank you
very much and hope to see you next time
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
