Anzio we are here at Oracle code in
Bengaluru and I'm here with Prabhakar
Paul Samus is that right okay I'm
struggling with my Indian names here but
so you are the director of application
development for I work on a CX portfolio
under CX I work on service cloud and
field service cloud product areas okay
cool
now where are you based you based here
in Bangalore no I work from southern
part of India Oracle has an office in
random it's a sudden how far is that
from here
it's an hour flight from here so okay
it's an hour flight yes I see okay okay
so actually before we actually were on
air we were having just a conversation
and you said you do farming on the
weekends and I thought it was just like
a garden but you it's a real farm it's a
real big one it's a multi acre farm and
in headed from my dad oh the weekend I
do forming now since the summer season I
do have watermelon planted and just
waiting for the very good so is there
specifically interested in farming as
well so I'm just wondering wonder is
there is a relationship with here your
coding work and your farming or is it
just two separate lives separate lives
five days work hard and two days okay so
you're doing a session later on today
and so later actually about four you
know later around about 420 it's 4:20
so what are you going to be talking
about will be talking about a concept it
is Sam Sam is scrum assistant
microservice scram mr. Sam is a virtual
assistant or chat bot in a scrum team
you know typically if you see a scrum
team has three roles we have product
owner and scrum masters and developers
so we introduced the fourth role a
virtual assistant or chat bot in a scrum
team and if you see in the CIC devolve
and continuous integration continuous
delivery world it is all about speed of
the release and quality of the release
and performance and a travel application
and moreover innovation in how to keep
on innovating you know to have a
continuous release faster and high
quality so we feel Sam is an innovation
and we'll talk about that in the other
session and also we'll light them all
about that one
you should then Mouse as well okay so
much is this term scrum assistant micro
service is this a new micro service is a
new term it's a new term introduced II
it's a concept as I said so I mean to
talk more about Sam I said it is
configurable completely you know it is
up to the teams I mean they could
completely configure than now let me
give an example how it helps developers
QA and scrum masters for a developer
typically they work on you know new
features or above fixes so they give a
request to Sam hey Sam
execute build test smoke test or you
know performance test or entire scrum
twist from my working code and what Sam
does is it builds the code it pulls the
repository of you know into this stuff
and then builds the code in a separate
container and also it brings up another
container for testing the application
and results are given back to the
developer and remember developer is
still continuing to work on his code you
know his work is not at all affected
so you know we are living an option for
developers okay keep continuing working
and you leverage the cloud
infrastructure to have the results
faster and perfect same for QA for QA
they do let's assume they're gonna
introduce a new you know flow or maybe
test script in this case they want to
make sure in a diet flow whatever
they're introducing is not breaking
anything and you know so what they can
do is okay here is here is my local
repository and say hey exam you know can
you validate enter you know bill flow or
smoke flow again same Sam does the same
thing okay
full set up a story builds the code
container is up and then against and
comes back with the results now for a
scrum master it is different you know if
a slopmaster wants to know hey how many
bugs I have in the scrum team today and
how many celerity one box you know Sam
you can scrum master can give a request
to Sam and Sam gives back the results
also if you want to know okay open all
the moderates or approve all my
modulates so scrum master this pipes
that and then you know it began the
screen it interacts with the github or
you know your source control system and
comes back with the results okay
interesting so you imagine imagine you
build a few times in that conversation
we actually spoke earlier about some of
the different technologies used to build
can you go over some of those yeah so we
built using Oracle main pass I mean more
of autonomous pass for a front end we
use mobile enterprise and our micro
service Sam you know it's built on
against extract and we deployed into OC
I when I was yes our Oracle cloud
infrastructure and back-end you could
integrate with any Odysseus
I mean Oracle developer cloud service I
mean like you know we have inbuilt
source control system and build system
and a reveal system so you could you
know integrate with that model if you
are looking for more autonomous
infrastructure I mean we could build the
same using Oracle function plug or F an
open project and also like you could how
you were given a dis cluster and bring
up your docker image
and then like you know make everything
as a function you could apply the same
there are if you are completely open you
know pretty much or if you have other
platforms
you could interface with you know Alex
or Google assistant and like interfere
and with this service and then you know
you could configure your back-end
services it's pretty much possible in
all the ways okay but we built using
Oracle pass now you were also talking
about using chat bar yes why okay let's
take an example if you wanna have an
alarm for tomorrow morning 6:00 a.m. I
mean we can go to the open the mobile
application or mobile and go to the
alarm application and open that and then
like you know 6:00 a.m. or you can form
a.m. or p.m. and then set the ringtone
and save it the same thing can be done
by ok hey Siri okay wake me up by 6:00
a.m. a lot of difference like the first
one you have a lot of manual work and
second one you just want command so
significant ease of use issue yes so if
you see the developers world they do
have like you know lot of code scanning
and regressions all these things can be
done by this chat box okay you can tell
a chat bot can you validate whether my
check-in has mic my local chain has any
violations or any you know issues I mean
I'm introducing any regressions all
these things can be easily done by the
chat bots actually it's like a
conversation flow you could easily build
and then like you could avoid all the
manual repeating tasks can be easily
done by chat box cool all right well we
can wrap up there thank you very much
but before we go you would tell me
earlier that this is your first
experience with Oracle code this
particular conference series you were up
in Hyderabad and now we're obviously
here in Bangalore do you have any
observations about maybe some of the
conversations you've been having with
the developers here yeah I do see
when everybody's more engaged and you
know in all the sessions you know they
are asking the right questions and if
you see the boots now I mean it's almost
full everything here I see a lot of
momentum and engagement it is good about
Oracle technologies and I do see a lot
of questions on the you know every
sessions
it is good yeah I've noticed the same
thing there's lots of discussions taking
place and we're in a little bit of a
small space here there's over a thousand
people but there's lots of dynamism
there it's really really interesting
well Prabhakar thank you very much
thanks a lot and if you want to learn
more to sessions later on this afternoon
and we'll be back shortly
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
