introduce myself and jiseok Raju part of
this health consulting center and with
me today is my colleague Maru both of us
are here today to talk about what Oracle
blockchain has to offer and the
different use cases and will share some
of the experiences that we acquired
recently while doing pocs with some of
those clients but firstly thanks to you
all I've never seen such a house full
room in my so many carrier I mean the
entire 18 19 years of Korea with with
Oracle and elsewhere and that word 6:00
p.m. in the evening
firstly thanks to you all thanks to you
all thanks to you all for showing your
interest in this Oracle blockchain cloud
service yet-to-be d8 yes thanks thanks
absolutely and let's keep this whole
session way very interactive I know
there's a lot of jargons in terms of the
technology words and other thing but
let's keep it interactive do stop us
wherever you need I know it's tough to
be you've been waiting for this session
for a long long time for the past six
seven hours I guess let's keep it
interactive a lot
I mean I'm forced to use jargon here
today basically since I'm presenting but
you can always stop me and offer more
more and more clarity on the subject
that I would be demonstrating here
thanks again for all having you here and
so we have a short agenda basically out
here for today with where we would take
you through the current state of the
world where we talk about the typical
you know hub spoke model or a
peer-to-peer know things around what the
current state as this of today in terms
of the by the way how many guys are
invested in the cryptocurrencies you can
raise your hand here but close the DOS
the government is not watching us okay
by the way we are not into currency side
of it you're going more on the
enterprise side how many of them I see
only one hand here raise some hands
there I'm invested I lost money though
that's that's a different issue only
two of them or is it or you want to stay
away from the eyes of the government and
like scared of not raising behind you
can hear okay then so so guys slide
chain ecosystem beside to that toward
the end we will talk about some of the
use cases in questions from the
audience's there and I would like that
you ask me more and more questions today
here at this forum and hopefully we
should be clear most of them also
that's a disclaimer okay so of late
what's happening is which other
enterprises I walk in so the first
question that do you have anything to
offer unblock you yeah we do have and
think like that and anytime industry and
indeed talking about you know how the
blockchain like last year and last year
it was sad board site everything that
you pick up or you know can we do a
chart but around this can we do a chart
vote and on this or can we do IOT around
this so this year I I see a mazing trend
like you know can we block Chennai's
this basically can you block Sinai's
this every industry you bigger you know
we want to do blockchain see what so the
question is and then the same old you
know we've been doing this with the
typical idea may as traditional RDBMS
what's what's so unique you know some of
those questions that I got today
at my booth there basically so guys so
what's important is you need to know
pick up your use cases correctly you
know and see what problem they are
solving and then look for adopting the
blockchain you know just don't just
because every Enterprise is going out
there and trying to do something on the
on the on the blockchain you should not
jump on first qualify you your use case
properly and and then look after who are
the multiple stakeholders is there a
trust issue out there and you know how
you're going to solve them so or clearly
identify the goals that you need to
achieve by implementing the blockchain
and it should not be like once you have
implemented and then you're finding out
oh I can do it with the traditional
legacy systems you know and I'm not
saying
it shouldn't be the case so spend more
time as to if there are trust issues so
if you look at the the traditional the
value proposition in terms of so trust
and provenance is one of the things that
I am seeing on the blockchain side of
thing we're getting more and more
tractions and on the use cases side of
the especially on the trust and proven
inside so start with that and then move
over you know up the value chain which
is the smart contact another thing to
start with you should focus on on the
trust and provenance side of of your
industry that you belong to or try to
pick up some of those processes I would
say where multiple parties are involved
and and Trust is involved and and
obviously more importantly where the
cash is involved basically not
transactions are involved to start any
questions there okay thank you
yeah
so that's the current state the
client-server architecture we all know
what the issue highly centralized
there's one nodal point somebody has a
control of it and he can manage the
access and permissions and everything if
this goes down the service goes down
everything goes down right the the
traditional client-server network we all
know the challenges I don't want to bug
you with with the set of issues and
challenges that it has in today's world
so that's one of the network that we
have the model I would say architecture
one the other one we all knew no
peer-to-peer network it never took off
because of the vulnerabilities of the
security issues and file sharing issues
and the piracy issues and all those
things so these are predominantly two
architectures basically which we see in
the today state of the architecture so
what blockchain frankly speaking when
when when I started a year and a half
back I would say like you know the
bitcoin is blockchain I don't know that
that's how I started which is black jade
but that that's not so so I mean they've
been so many technologies out there
which have been really disruptors we got
the ollas and the OBS with truly
interested but have you seen that
government getting disturbed because of
any one technology this is the one right
I have not seen so in fact every every
month if you see and in fact most
recently our government has been giving
regulations very forth every fortnight
you know today you can buy tomorrow you
cannot buy today you can buy and that's
has been happening so I've got a couple
of my accounts blogged and things like
that I have not seen government's
getting panicked about technology so far
in my career as much as David this and
some of the government's have actually
gone in
and created points I heard when a
jeweler and couple of other have created
petrol coins and other things basically
so they've been seeing the currency is
getting devalued because of some reason
of the other and and they have actually
gone ahead and creating the sovereign
currencies basically for them so such is
the impact of this technology you know
that it has created in Madison at least
in my lifetime I have not seen a
technology disrupter and which can
actually change the nation's government
basically and they had to jump in and
give the regulation sorry I'm not
getting into into the the the buzzwords
yes so so what what does it do basically
in the it's it's a remember forwards
it's it's a distributable ledger between
peer to peer everyone can see it's a
transparent and the first question comes
is like you know what's the difference
between the traditional database and
then doctrine has to offer it's it's
open transparent immutable verifiable
that those are the simple forwards
basically distributed ledger today what
happens every Enterprise has their own
ledger and they only look at it they
only update it they only change it
everything is meant them okay they
define the rules and it is not at all
transparent to the the larger ecosystem
of the vendor so that's the first thing
it's it's immutable its transparent its
distributed its real-time it so lot of
lot of benefits around it and and going
forward what happens is basically lots
and lots of vendors would would like to
connect to only those enterprises who
are open in nature in terms of when I
say open in nature who keep the ledgers
open and transparent because it has a
lot of business benefits attached to it
yeah so so my my so one thing that I
would like to say here is yes this is a
descriptor and it's going to stay for a
long long time certainly we are not on
the currency side of it but nevertheless
there would be valid and and and you can
write your applications so this is a
platform as a service and you're free to
write and it will have
the violet as well go ahead and write
your applications on top of this
platform and and create not the coins
but in terms of some of those things
which can go into the violets and that
can be exchanged any questions there
again so this is the same thing what I
said
bitcoin is not blockchain so blockchain
is - Bitcoin what internet is - email
yep please
Fitness fen-phen so I have I do have
some slides so as to get into the
technology side of it go into stage the
technology is going to evolve their
technology is continuously going to
evolve if you look at this slide I am
saying like you know this is like the
Internet's of the 90s so technology is
evolving the the businesses the
technologies everybody is jumping in out
there trying to create solutions yeah so
so this is the same transformation phase
today with the blockchain what Internet
was sometime 90s you know we were all
thinking that we could book the tickets
online and all those things will happen
and and 1990 and we could do that in 20
year 2000 around so those things were
streamlined so likewise this technology
to is actually undergoing that
transformation phase so that would be my
answers so it will take it do cause
basically before we can do okay so this
was the field exactly you know what
happened to the internet forum you know
that they said the w3 standard for web
services OS a send this thing if all
right firstly the internet came and then
these organizations were formed so as I
talk there there are groups being formed
but they have not been named as such
like the oasis of the web services
standards and things like that as we
talk there are some organizations being
formed so as to make that inter ledger
communication and all those things
making those things possible or today's
so if I host our fiber let your based
framework which is or OBCs and you also
take some other OEMs hyper ledger based
framework then we both should be able to
talk if it is 1.1 and it is continuously
evolving but so 1.1 I think Apple that
you would be able to talk I mean we can
take this offline now any question
okay processing that is required for the
Black team has scaleable is your
question to answer that see so it's it
would be like the typical internet era
you know thousand transactions per
second of these Swift's like but
certainly it's coming at a cost right if
there are multiple parts spends in your
network and they need to endorse it then
actually you're slowing slowing it up so
it's all about your design the way you
design your blockchain network topology
it all depends upon that the throughput
of this certainly I would agree that
today it's not of that speed you know
that kind of a throughput what you're
seeing today in the in the internet
world because it is just writing it to
the database right typically our DBMS
but out here what's happening out here
the the OBCs has got the consensus
framework the more the like the CAF cars
of the world and other things are being
so the more complex your your consensus
framework that you use makes it more and
more complex in terms of D the
throughput will will be reduced
accordingly and more participants make
it so that's a design call actually the
technology is still evolving and
hopefully in a year's time there would
be an answer and and and you must be
looking at the ability of framework you
know they are continuously some
additions or the other for for the
throughput to be increased in this world
hopefully we should see the whole
technologies under what I say the
transformation phase so we should see
something which is happening in terms of
improving the throughput is how can we
have the least the i/o transaction which
happens in this case you write it on the
ledger with the world state you write it
on the peer nodes of the ledger as well
so the the the high polished fabric
group which we have adopted and other
groups as well they're kind of finding
out okay what would be the minimum piece
of the block which
written and still it will make the
transaction valid in terms of the block
structure whatever is the core of the
blockchain so there there also there are
a lot of being technologies or the
standards or the papers which such
papers which have been given in few
hours back being adopted like one being
the zero knowledge proof a few folks
would be knowing over here they're
working on that so that kind of gives
you an option of how you have a lesser
blocks or a kind of illicit overload of
the i/o transactions which could be
there so which would even transcend to
having a increased throughput so things
are still evolving as ii said and it
will surely be because the kind of
outcome that you see if you compare with
the bitcoins kind of world you would
find out you know or the athenians well
you would find okay yeah there's there's
a lot of lag over there but when you
compare with the enterprise ecosystems
across the verticals there are certainly
certain benefits coming up because
unless we go to the use case will come
to know like how exactly it can benefit
it's like it's trying to remove a lot of
the process inefficiency which exists
today so still even after having all
those lag in terms of support it is
having an advantage over the existing
business processes to transform so and
slowly the technology also is evolving
yeah
so let's bow our heads to so sort of he
Nakamoto since we were talking about
next slide
no it's not the country based it's based
on it's for the enterprises I think
you're talking more from the financial
side of it
no no not exactly the ledger
yeah if you'd go with that old knowledge
of the accounts balance and all we are
not talking about Bitcoin over here
we're trying to give a perspective about
the blockchain or Bitcoin is just one of
the use cases implementation only the
Bitcoin not the blockchain
okay this give us few minutes let's go
through it yeah and probably you will
have your question answered there itself
so so there is a guy a guy wants to send
of money to be basically how does it
move in the in the blockchain ecosystem
so somebody puts a transaction what
happens in a traditional world you put a
transaction and it's stative it goes
into the DB right there is no consensus
framework today in the todays ecosystem
out there somebody wants to transfer it
good internet neft go done basically
right there is no no consensus framework
there is no ledger as such it is gone
into the our DBMS of the systems basis
or the core banking system that you've
been debited with so much money or
credited with so much money he wants to
transfer it to be so but but in in the
in the blockchain world what happens our
transaction comes it transaction is
created basically but not in the ledger
I mean a wants to transfer it to be so
what the first thing that we see here is
the is the transaction has come into the
picture okay now there are other
participants in the ecosystem who
watches this basically and say endorse a
set only then it basically goes into the
ledger so that what is happening so
transaction was created that the first
block was created
you see and then the first block you
know you can see that it has been it now
it's in the network the block which was
created here it's here in the network in
this step number three and what happens
in the step number four you see a tick
mark out there it's nothing but the
consensus okay suppose you so you know
abode room right in a board room what
happens four people said together and
make a decision on a resolution suppose
in a board room there are two guys who
has the voting right so the guys who
have the voting right are nothing in
from the perspective of the blockchain
see them as endorsers they are the guys
who only when they endorse it actually
goes and sits in the ledger so here what
you see is a consensus is nothing but a
policy which has been it has been acted
upon on on that transaction and then
eventually that money is transferred to
B so that's how the system is actually
getting a transaction has gone into the
ledger but out here in a real life you
click NEFT and it's gone to the core
banking system done nobody knows nobody
approves okay so so yes the tax guys
will be doing this going forward
basically where every transaction I mean
that's how I four seats that probably
the banks would might have to to adopt
such a thing where well you know these
any high high high valued thing bidding
transferred you know between between two
individuals or three individuals or so
there would be big amount of stake
holders who can watch this at a real
time and approve this at a real time to
happen so
yeah so that's upon how you how you
design your network blockchain network
topology so you can have five people
looking in dorset three people who can
endorse it so when I say three people
these are the T important people in this
stakeholder in your ecosystem who's
right
who whose approval is mandatory and I
would define them as the endorsers
within this network topology that's how
it again so I've been talking about the
the the traditional database in the
blockchain and the differences let's
look at the images you know what does it
speak so it's typical central hub if if
this fails everything else fails the
whole system fails basically okay and
look at this basically you know this
decentralized node goes off everything
goes off let not look at the entire
thing so there it is
if you look at the traditional database
there is a central nodal agency you know
if that goes down the whole ecosystem
goes down okay so that's and we all know
I mean I need not tell you tell the the
pain areas with this architecture known
that it is certainly fair it I mean we
have been living with this for a long
long time and it has added value to the
to the enterprise's that who have
adopted but but we coming from a
different blockchain perspective where
we need to identify certain processes
which which needs to be addressed across
across multiple stakeholders for a
process in an enterprise so that's where
the blockchain fits in and if you the
benefit what do you see the benefit here
look out there there is a central nodal
body or an agency or a system out there
but here it's all nodes you know so even
if a node goes down here it continues to
survive and you continues to get the
information and and at any point of time
it has not gone down the transactions
can still come in and it is how best you
have designed your endorsers and the in
the network topology so the blockchain
continues
but out there in that ecosystem on the
relational database and it since it has
to write into the IDPs otherwise
typically putting everything into the
queue till those things doesn't come up
now he can you appreciate the benefits
that blockchain has to offer
imagine your enterprise has some one or
two critical processes especially around
the payments or any other businesses not
the supply chain and that just cannot
you cannot afford to you know let them
fail
I think blockchain is the right place
where you know it's continuously on this
is multiple nodes are there at a real
time and you don't need any centralized
agency to watch authorized or any of
those things it's like the replicated
data so you've got your data across all
the nodes so that's the benefit that you
see any questions on this yet okay yeah
yeah so those those load-balancing are
they again are you know regrading under
the technology side of it
okay what what you didn't see is yep I'm
coming
all right got a right
all right no no way all right today I'm
coming I'm coming I'm coming okay so
okay before that I would like to address
this question your question was like
here also we do basically the same way
right you have the high availability so
the question is not our availability I
think if you if you heard about my
initial things the blockchain has to
offer it is transparent it is immutable
and it is not writing into the you make
me the database super admin in your
office and I will tell you what all I
can do one sitting on top of it right I
can do that certainly I can do that but
if I give you everything here in this
ledger you will not be able to do any
reproduce anything you cannot break my
blocks even if you have the access the
Genesis block once it gets created and
and then subsequently the hash of the
previous block that start to another
block basically so that way it's a chain
so I as a super user or an administrator
of a blockchain network and this
lifetime cannot be able to sneak in and
put a block in between actually okay and
here I can do all these things okay
sorry I think you interpreted my my
blockchain concept and from the
perspective of the high availability and
all those things no so I think that just
concept saying that if you have any any
business workflow say it continues to
run the different nodes are running and
they will continue to exchange just
because somebody has not the approval
will continues to happen in this
ecosystem whereas not in this see we
have a nice en nixies running lot of
applications today if that land record
land registration system goes down one
of the thing you know it's like said
helpless but out there in this ecosystem
you are capable of designing such a
network where wherein the nodes are
alive and and they continue to serve it
even if there is a one node going down
now coming to your question sir could
you repeat your question so that right
right nice
good name
right right right
fair enough I gotta push that so as you
rightly said the Dassault that trust and
provenance which is the bottom most like
or in the bottom most order of the or
the value proposition that this has to
be yeah so again this is not like a
typical user ID and a password there is
a certificate which is being issued to
and everything that goes in it's not
rests in a typical database it is a
block which is created and out there
okay and again it's all so it's a
distributed in the per se when you
actually define your topology all of
those nodes are separate nodes actually
which are not residing at your host okay
so you me and mate for instance and you
become the founder so you have the
founder dog in your house basically but
I am somebody in your ecosystem so I to
have the rights to actually download
that ledger and see what you have
updated in your ledger and if I am an
endorser I can endorse it the every
transaction dot going out there so
all three of us need not be in the same
same data center actually and I know
that's how its transparent and any
change that you make at your site
basically it is visible to me it doesn't
go into the legend unless I approve it
basically or he approves it so so and
it's certainly immutable yes like trade
money right
good
right so that's what if you when you
when you design the blockchain solution
so what exactly is being offered nor
does the pass offering you would create
your solution on top of it
so the core thing is you need to define
your asset so if you take the real
estate you need to define the real real
estate-related
assets inside the blockchain ecosystem
whatever you network you're going to
design on top of that you would design
your network with this week holders over
there and then you would say the
endorsers who would be the endorses not
everyone would be the end-all set for a
particular transaction but there would
be one or more endorsements happening
for any transaction so your asset
definition is the key the second thing
is the endorsement so whenever in
transaction is happening when you have
defined an asset let's say we both are
into a real estate agreement to kind of
do a I'm doing a sell and you are buying
that property right and there's a
regulator that several star which is
there in Indian context who kinds of
approves that transaction in the current
process right the same thing can be
mapped when you go into I'm keeping
aside the legal contracts there we I had
a discussion with gentlemen that it's
very difficult to translate the complete
legal contracts into smart contacts I
agree to it but it has the potential to
define all that coming to the solution
part so let's say we define I am the
organization was creating the solution
they defined the assets they define who
would be the endorsers would be and they
define the smart contracts which would
say that okay if some approval happens
this would be the next step which has to
do so what exactly would be the next
step over here I'll come to that so
let's say the application client
application design she has an evap
interface or mobile interface when you
give an intent or I give an intent that
I want to sell my property right and you
came as saying that okay I am buying it
now we both go into an agreement will
over a private communication channel
again in the network topology we define
using the auction platform saying with
further pricing negotiations right that
is in between us we both can see what is
the pricing agreement now when we both
agree on it you let's say you have an
application on your the client
application we say okay I agree I buy it
now once you buy to kind of map the
current process there has to be some
notification which would go to the
government body in our case is it's the
regulator over here Sabri star right who
do approval so we can even override that
but that won't happen especially in the
case where you have the regulatory
concerns coming into picture so let's
say there is an interface for the for
for the Registrar to kind of say okay
approved the previous transactions the
complete title looks good he's I am
being the owner and you were the new
buyer and the transactions can be
approved in payment also simply said
he'd create a system where the payment
reflection is also happening so once the
solicitor approves what exactly would
happen the title own ownership would go
from me to you so that's where you say
the tamper-proof how would we manage
that you would manage that by mapping
the data the data concepts along with
the network concepts the natural
concepts is given by the framework
itself the moment you design the network
stakeholders it would be given each of
the entities would be given a signature
when you define the smart contracts so
let's say somebody who's building the
solution for both for for the overall
and record systems would be coming on
play a table and saying that okay these
are the legal contracts which has to go
this has to be the work flow and all
they'll build the smart contracts
according to that and whatever the
transaction happens since in the finance
system that we would have to endorse it
since we are the parties that would go
and sit in the system saying that okay
we both have agreed to it so that's
where the network itself with the core
the system components of nodes the
endorsements the asset structure and the
encryption and the signature the key
they the subscribe it capably key kind
of models it gives it gives a kind of
tamper proof block of data getting
generated for each and every transaction
and that's what it's making it ample
proof what exactly would do with the
system blocks in systems like a retro
blockchain you would have a a kind of a
designing tool where you can define the
network endorsements the parties who
would be there and you could have a
monitoring tool on top of it so other
than that you would have to build a
solution client applications which will
talk to that for making you for doing
the read and write transactions
essentially using the system components
of blockchain
well then over here because we have the
kind of wrench you can take the demo in
the interest of time I think we'll move
to the demo directly
I'm just skipping a bit this is more of
the Bitcoin side which you all know so
this is an interesting use case that we
have done for for the supply chain side
of it and you should like this what do
you write
so I think it will answer the questions
like it's not all this linked to the
money or the financial part it's a
matter of how you define the assets in
this particular use case it is being
done for we have taken a consideration
of a the entity being a port terminal
wherein you have it's a useful kind of
it manage the supply chain scenario when
there is a supplier of a consignment and
there is a buyer of a consignment and
then we have a regulatory body like
customs as well over there there's no
money part over here but what exactly is
the asset before coming to that I would
like to put a bit of highlight on the
business aspects so that you can be able
to kind of map that okay what exactly
blockchain is giving me in terms of
benefit like if you a few of you have
attended the previous session there was
a very small snippet when say that I had
a list with chains to wear and it is
giving you more productivity to
developers right the same thing if you
talk about the enterprises even a 1% of
efficiency in the business process goes
into the very large context right so
something in terms of the boat operators
the recent survey done last year these
are the three major concerns they have a
lot of concerns to increase their
profitability to optimize their
processes was the first was what the
other operator said then the cost
reduction and then improving the yard
operations so we kind of tried to okay
see how exactly blockchain can do a
solution for it so what exactly they
were looking for it since the port
terminals are the key hubs for managing
the supply chain of supplier and the
buyers they were thinking okay if we can
make a marketplace well in the good
strands action can happen over the
blockchain even now we can have a
database based application which can
provide the supplier and by ecosystem
but what if I have a supplier in by
ecosystem over the blockchain which can
give a secure and transparent
marketplace right then I am not owning
the data the people who are creating the
data are the owners the people who are
getting into the transactions are the
owners for it right I am considering
myself as a port operator over here
real-time tracking of data on the
logistics to all stakeholders so in this
particular use case we have plugged in
IOT along
with the blockchain right welcome to the
quick demo on that it's a video which we
have created faster completion of
transactions every one of us know how
exactly it matters when it comes to the
enterprise business processes if you can
improve the efficiency of any of the
process it's it's always transcend into
the cost of ownership for that right the
operational delays as it matches to
whatever the reductions so you reduce
the operational disease with respect to
customs approval the customs are all
usually it kind of goes into its it's a
different question how we can bring
onboard the government parties but if
those can be a part of the view blocks
in solution imagine the kind of amount
of paperwork in the workflow levels
which they have for approving any
consignment right that's it's always we
have seen the one side of advantage of
the GST which it has removed all those
checkpoints when you have a flat tax
structure across the country so that
that's kind of improvement is the
business efficiency on one of the
process part so similarly can that we
achieve with the solution of blockchain
over the for the supply chain scenario
and lastly it should be system driven
that I so that it ensures that the
manipulations are not being done let's
say any IOT data or any business
transaction somebody is not faking it up
behind running behind the scenes query
so what exactly we have taken okay find
support terminal we have an ecosystem of
seller or the supplier and the buyer and
then there is a custom of fields as well
right so we named it as two to tango how
exactly it is so supplier will be
marketplace okay fine we have a client
application wherein the supplier would
go and enter the details of what exactly
they want to sell the moment that is
entered that record is gone into the
blockchain and available to so the the
network is we have all the supplier
enterprise surplus and the enterprise
buyers so the moment it is gone you can
create your own notifications and all
those things by which they would be able
to know that okay these are the new
produce available now as a buyer I would
go or the buyer would go over there and
search further
produce now what exactly is different
over here the core concept of immutable
data find the moment it is entered now
in we will take it as an example of its
interest containers
right it has the IOT sensors attached to
it now let's say it's a produce related
to 3000 kgs of wheat right which is
going cross-country from India to
somewhere in China or some in Europe
right now the they have an agreement
which says that okay for Mike for the
for the container the shipment the
temperature should not go below 425
degree and should not go above 35
degrees the humidity should not be going
beyond 30 30 percent right now how would
you ensure in the current system you can
still have the sensors but you would
have a database system which would be
getting updated with that but there is
always a chance of that being faked
right that's that's that's where it is
but here what we're saying is once you
have designed the network and your IOT
players sensors are directly feeding
this data into the blockchain system in
the ledger there's no way you can go
somebody can go and change it the reason
being the core nature of the blocks
itself
it's all encrypted data the other thing
who server are the parties of that in
that network everywhere the data is
replicated if somebody wants to change
anything or make anything behind the
scenes the data has to update it all the
notes you cannot be done right away
right so that's what it brings you the
inherent capability of the blockchain
network and we are talking about the
assets as containers over here now
though I'll play a video also let me
quickly explain it so once the shipment
starts okay fine it is put in the
marketplace biases okay fine it looks
into the IOT sensor data it's all
matching as per their specifications and
then say okay fine I am agreed to buy it
they can at that time define okay these
are the certain contracts of our legal
contracts s of our trading agreement
then which let's say they're I need
should be reaching within this
particular time duration it should
follow this particular path and
obviously it should be coming to this
port which in case anyway we have a
single port over here now all that thing
is put into picture now those things can
be defined as part of the smart contract
how would you map out the number of days
again gee that's a good business logic
input when the shipment I have agreed
for a shipment and when it is kind of
delivered to me the GPS coordinates from
the IOT sensors can give you the
tracking of the parts which has been
followed if it is the part of a legal
agreement you can verify that as well it
should be customer approved if it says
again the customer approval also is
happening on the blockchain so nobody
can produce a kind of a fake paper with
the smuggled goods saying that okay no
this customs approved you you don't have
to go into a big cycle of your legal
team verifying all that whether it's a
proper or genuine consignment or not
right so and the moment so all the data
is getting into that and then the
customs won't come to customs also they
can see this since they are part of the
network they can see that data in the
blockchain and they can based on that
let's say there they that's only a part
of their whole process but at least that
part of the of the business their
business process is getting more
efficient because they are getting it in
the real time all the data and they can
verify it right away on their system
once everything is the proof but the
buyer would say okay fine I agreed to
buy it and we'll the moment would say ok
fine buy on the client application you
can have a smart contract if all the
parties are agreed to it you can trigger
a payment release from the smart
contract you don't have to kind of
submit all the procurement department of
my company or the buyer company don't
have to submit all the papers to the
financial department and go through the
whole process of making the payment
release now imagine the kind of
potential it has to if bringing in more
efficiency in terms of the payment
realization in terms of the procurement
acceptance the procurement cycle as well
that's where the efficiency comes into
picture so these are just a few texts
what I have spoken in a very brief
high-level so we leveraged the block in
IOT apps combo so from Oracle skitty we
have a iot apps which gives you the
dashboard and all those things which you
can using which you can monitor all that
data blocks in part we have already
discussed quite a lot the transference
in ease of governance and efficient
operations employs smart contracts to
automate further stages such as payments
contract renewals it could be refunds
reconciliations and all those things in
case something goes bad before a buyer
accepts it they have the data over there
so someone in that whole ecosystem so
here we have talked and talked about
only about the supplier and the buyer in
real world you have a distributor you
have the regional distributors then
finally it comes to the buyer right so
you can map all those into the network
for the use case purpose we have taken
make it more simplistic so I'll quickly
pair so this is what architecture we
have over here at a very high level so
what you see over there the very high
level the core system components so you
have
Gateway proxy you have the pier smart
contracts and ordering service I will
talk only about the blockchain over here
so PS has something like like they're
transacting nodes of the blockchain so
if you go to any of the you can look
into the Hippolyta fabric as well so
those were those were the nodes with
which your clients applications would be
talking to and each p8 for each of the
stakeholders so these are the things
created for each of the stakeholder
order or the nodes created as part of
the network so let's say for buyer for
the seller for the customs official
there in the in the technology per se in
the in the system or in the cloud you
will have all these nodes running for
each of the entities so any transactions
happening would be happening with
respect to their particular entities
based on the endorsements define it will
be the ordering service will be taking
in inputs from all the peers and then
qualifying it to kind of written to the
ledger
once that ordering service says that
locates all the validated as per the
endorsement definitions you have given
it will be given back to the PS to
commit to their local state so what we
call is two states over here the local
states which is at the peer level which
is actually to the real-world entity
level and then the global state which is
at the ledger at the whole overall
framework level so the ledger is
maintained at the two levels over here
rest of the things is kind of the custom
application and other cloud offerings
from Oracle which which we have
integrated the blockchain with so let me
kind of quickly okay I have few more
slides so this is what it kind of gives
you the monitoring tool which I was
talking about so this is a network
topology when you create in the
graphical format you will see the
complete textural details also and then
once it's GA its it gives all the
details about the so these are called
nodes so you have this other pierce
entities and then the other one is one
is a certifying authority with each and
every entity and one is the ordering
service and what you see on the other
side is the channels so that can give
you a picture that doe can you you can
have a common channel for broadcasting
you can have a private channel for
certain transactions where you need only
certain stakeholders to be party of it
so that's where the permission
blockchain
comes with the offering it's not like
everyone has part of the network would
see all the transactions you can map it
as per the Enterprise Systems
requirement
okay let me quickly play a video or
maybe that will also ease out the burden
over here sorry
for the freshness of his products they
all expect nothing but top-quality
and on top of that Safety Mart has a
tough job to reach their expectations
but he does that's to a tops of my
process that can never be possible
without blockchain technology it's
always challenging for mark to trust the
supply sources and all the provenance of
the products and be sure of the
immutability of the recorded transaction
when mark decides to get a new transport
of fresh food he contacts Andy the
seller Andy works in China working one
of the buyers over here and I leave the
seller
Marquez in India and and even China and
its kind of trying to buy a produce from
seller in China does that checks all the
safety parameters of the containers
including temperature that is possible
to peyote sensors that send information
to the blockchain ledger which is
displayed on Andy's dashboard you notice
is that the temperature of one container
has risen outside but the table format
is something is the ledger data what is
being fished from the ledger which is
already recorded the graphical map
format over there kinds of gifts of maps
the GPS coordinates given by the IOT
sensor on the continues so all that you
can see in the real-time over there and
also in the tabular format checking the
temperature history and he notices that
it has been like that for quite some
time
using blockchain technology mark and log
into the same platform and notice the
status of the containers he notices the
one with temperature problems and order
as the container leaves a Handy's
warehouse thanks to the IOT sensors him
and mark can always keep track of it
besides knowing how much time the
container spends in transit they can
monitor the temperature thus making sure
the food is kept in optimal parameters
no matter how many links appear in the
transfer cycle due to the blockchain
technology that can trace it
transparently
and easily on Friday the container
reaches customs in India tame the
customs officer can login to the
application to check the tracking
history of the container doing in
transit after proving the transport he
can click on the get history button to
show the updated ledger data mark logs
in again and checks his newly bought
container he also checks to the tracking
history is up to date after making sure
everything is all right he accepts the
shipment the blockchain made it possible
for mark to trust the supply process he
knew exactly what merchandise he ordered
and its condition at each point in the
transit process he knew its provenance
as he could trace it with the tracking
numbers due to the digital ledger that
offered transparency and security nobody
without authorization could have
interfered with the transport by using a
blockchain fact supply process it's easy
for mark to reach the high expectations
of his customers and keep track of his
products from source to destination okay
so that was a quick demo but I already
spoke about I spoke about but to kind of
show you that ok it's not only
financials so to kind of answer one of
the questions how do we ensure so it's
actually as part of the blockchain core
concept the network the encryptions the
the block structure which ensures that
nobody can tamper with the data the
moment the data is written this one way
like it's written it's written in an
encrypted format at the peer level you
have certain things like you have a
choice of maintaining something in the
database as well you can query it but
what you will get is only the binary
output you won't be able to get what
exactly the data over there
that's only using the framework you
would be able to see the current details
out of it and you can act you can define
your business process on top of it so
it's essentially it's just a platform
now it's not giving you
the moment you cannot say that okay I
put block you know everything will be
resolved if you have to go through a
kind of etiquette was early mentioning
you need to kind of think which use case
what benefits the business aspects this
the the contract aspects when you're
talking about smart contracts the
business process aspects what you want
to make it more efficient so you need to
think of all this map it with the
blockchain core concepts which it is
giving an essentially is giving you a
distributed ledger and encryptions along
with the consensus mechanism so if you
think in these terms it's quite simple
terms which usually people think in the
real world as well no it's coming as a
kind of an offering in the technology
per se very which has the potential of
mapping your real world challenges or
the real world processes exactly in the
system as it happens I'll and it over
back to shaker open for questions are
out here so please feel free to have
questions I mean my please I mean I can
talk about the slide but it's good that
we have an interesting session and we
learn something in darts reason hello my
name is soothing order actually I want
to know what is the velocity because I
would he produces data in terms of high
velocity high volume how blockchain is
hang this high velocity high variety
plus volume of the data I think you need
to configure it in a fashion that you
know so you won't catch all the
temperatures right you have to slot it
accordingly
you know at every interval of five
minutes or 10 minutes and look at those
things basically what you need to
capture that that has to be analyzed is
more of a design aspect that you need to
you know why do you do it the design
time and accordingly design your
blockchain network to handle that kind
of a throughput that's coming out from
your IOT so you have to that more for
design consensus that you need to do on
your side I think you're coming from the
perspective how much of throughput it
can handle right - like I already
produces a lot of data variety volume
and a velocity yes so we have done it as
part of the demo but essentially it's
like it's a matter of design
to see how exactly it's roper desert in
sizing and all those why I raised this
question is because you cannot go and
tamper the data right yeah but whatever
the data produced by the IOT that data
has to be analyzed before putting into
block change as per my knowledge
otherwise all the data cannot be put it
into a block type block no that is that
is something you can define as part of
your IOT census and if you're using an
i2c s you can define it over there that
what exactly let's say you want to only
write down the variations which is go
which is not accepted right yeah
threshold values you can mention and
whatever the threshold crosses that
transaction can be put it into block
right but there is a chance that at the
threshold value fixing you can tamper it
now before we enter into the that that's
something you need to ensure from that's
the input side right not from the
blocking perspective that's your client
application now you can have something
created let's save in a mobile app right
when you can have an app created where
the user interests X value but when
you're sending it to blocks and you
change it to Y value and then sending it
that's something outside of the
blockchain ecosystem right
so that's we we need to as a system what
your solution you're delivering they
need to ensure on that part ok I skip
the slide but basically here you can see
the transactions throughput and and if
you look at ob sea as we more into the
permissioned and private side of the
ecosystem and the throughput that's been
returned basically it's hundreds in the
thousand but you know but but all it all
depends on the the way you design your
network the the way the incoming stream
that is coming and a lot of those
factors and then you cannot frame it to
one value kind of a thing you know so I
I know you guys must have been used to
in the typical client-server technique
there one more I would like to add to
this because that's a reason most overly
this blockchain is now they are
reinventing or recently with the kind of
iota have heard of that I don't know
it's IOT a mm-hmm
that's a new technology which is most
properly alternative to blockchain that
talks machine to machine itself any kind
of data produced from the IOT that will
without the any manual intervention are
analytics goes to a blob
I think you've got m2m protocol is
already there for the IOT ecosystem but
there is always a cloud service which
which it so I ot census always connect
to a hub and then it goes to cloud
service and then finally it goes to
other systems right that's the reason
they are building a new technology it's
called iota exactly so giving a cycle is
yesterday I did Dora dr. my gig Oracle
is very much interested in making the
IATA technology very well so that's you
are kind of answering your question
itself right so it's like it's not only
the blockchain the way it is giving the
advantage in terms of the ledger name
encryption and all it will it will kind
of trigger potential of redesigning of
the existing systems other enterprise
systems how we can ensure the security
of the data on those fronts because the
the storing part is already insured so
the other ecosystem has to kind of
evolve accordingly so iota would be
dancer on the IOT side so I just want
you to have a look at this slide that
the public side of it which is the
currency side of it it hardly makes
around 7 to 15 percent per per second
transaction and if you look at the
private permission and especially the
hyper laser based ecosystem between
hundreds and thousand the way you define
your transactions actually so that the
throughput that we typically talk about
you get
it's a policy that you write the
Consensus policies that you write and
that's how the the Consensus policies
that you define its automated so it's a
matter of designing your application as
well so let's say as I was talking about
the custom that's what you have to
define your network accordingly and
based on the process that you have
chosen especially in the in the sea the
whole point the corruption is one of the
big things in the land records there are
multiple agencies within the State
Department you know if the whole point
is to remove this handwrite who place
the presses the okay and that's the
areas where you need automated you know
consensus happening or the approvals
happening and then you assigned your
title deeds of offer land or something
so those are the areas of automated
approvals happening but then you can
still have the controls in manual
control to approve those assets that's
it's that you wants matter all you
design the solution so you can identify
okay fine not let's say you have 100
manual approvals because you can say
okay no visa we'd certainly need manual
approvals at certain stages but we can
do away with this 50 approved stages of
our rules so those things you can put
into smart contracts over there which is
essentially your business logic when you
can say that okay level 1 to 5 1 to 10
if level 1 is approved I can directly go
to level 4 because I have the right set
of data I don't need further approvals
to come to the level 4 so especially in
the regulatory related scenarios yeah I
don't think you can directly do with all
the approvals it would be gradual anyway
but you can slowly bring in more
efficiencies by way of having the
automated contracts so this is the world
of smart contracts the whole point is to
get out of the BPM world that you are
talking about and that's where you're
defining the smart contracts very clean
and clear and you have transformed your
business document into a smart contract
and that this whole ecosystem basically
the network the blockchain network is
running on those smart contracts or
smart rules that you have already
defined so everybody is playing by the
rule book so there is no point somebody
sitting and actually approving that
because otherwise you going by
hitting upon your efficiency of that
process there's no point so so that way
it is needs to be automated right and
kind of your bit of a technical
perspective over here I assume that view
from different looking from the more
technical perspectives
so what you get as part of development
scenarios is one is the cloud offering
which gives you the base framework now
on top of that you will be creating the
client solutions which will talk to the
blockchain platform offering by the G
RPC or the rest services and then it
would be your smart contracts which is
currently having the the golang support
but no GS and other supports is also
there so people who write in smart
contacts would be writing the codes in
using these languages then your client
application whichever you're trying to
build it could be in any any of your
choice of your frameworks it's only a
matter of what you want to send you
define that it should be it should be
conforming to the assets defined in the
blockchain and if you're trying to
trigger any any false operation let's
say we're trying to do a redo or
something like that if it is not defined
as part of the endorsement configuration
it will be denied by the blockchain side
so more technical part I just write
thought of kind of giving it over here
in this prescriptive manner so you would
be yeah essentially and then there'll be
an admin role would be kind of like a
one-time design activity you can say
would do a network designing for all the
stakeholders mapping all the entities in
the blockchain system the endorsement
definitions the chain code deployment
and all those things would happen it
would be done probably by your admin who
would you essentially be a maybe your
support team or something like that
so I think you're asking about Oracle
Blockson solution if there's any
and know currently we don't have
anything out you want something to code
and practice basically order any you're
talking about yes right
good you got the question Oracle
offering would be becoming gia whatever
we are talking about the Oracle
blockchain cloud service it will be
generally available sometime in May it's
currently in the pre gf phase where we
are working along with the partners and
the close ecosystems so as soon as it's
come become a pass offering you can use
that for creating your own samples and
applications thank you very much thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
