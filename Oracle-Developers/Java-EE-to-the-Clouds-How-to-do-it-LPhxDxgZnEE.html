working at Oracle as called evangelist
and today I'm gonna talk to you about
Java each of the clouds how to do it I
hope that you already familiar with
containers if you not please look at our
video that is containerize your java
application using docker so you can get
used to it so Java is pretty easy to run
on the cloud especially if you are using
containers and that's what I mean just
about to show you right now in your demo
okay
so first if you watch that video you
will see that we have built docker image
for our application what we are going to
do now it's getting the image and
pushing into the whole docker hub so
basically we are going to do is a darker
okay we are asking in docker to push our
image to the docker hub it's a service
on the cloud
ok so once we are done and we are there
now our docker image is available in the
docker hub so we can use it wherever you
want whatever we like in any any vendor
and clouds and any solution that we have
on the cloud or even on on-premise and
so on so the first approach that I'm
going to show you and we have here this
machine ran in a cloud so we are going
to connect it on it and I'm going to run
that same container that we run on the
the other video get looker okay so we
have here this run sooo common and we
okay that's we need true to remove the
the last container so we get this like
okay step opposite
yeah so we have just removed those
containers so we just Ram this very same
comment so once we have this this
reference to our image on the docker hub
it will download the image from from
docker hub on the internet on cloud and
we'll use it to run our container so if
we use it here okay it's raining so we
just got here and try yeah so at very
same application that we use to show how
to run java application on containers is
now on the cloud another machine on the
machine running the cloud using docker
is one approach and the other approach
is using a container service for for
docker so here in Oracle we have this
container cloud service this is a
dashboard for it and basically it's a
pass platform a service for running
containers so what we are going to do
here is to have this one here will
delight because they were gonna create
it right now yeah so we create a new
service that will call Java e docker and
this demo for serious it doesn't matter
for now the import part is here that we
make a have friends for our our darker
image on docker hub yeah and we have a
port here that we have one is exposed so
let's do it
on the host 8686 and in container 8080
it's a TCP port and I believe that I
didn't forget anything so our service is
here right now so we can deploy it if
you wanna change
something here I don't want so let's
just run so it will download the image
and we'll create the container and let
it ready ok so we just wait some seconds
so wow it is working if you look through
this bottom view logs we can see that
the the GlassFish is just running and if
you go to this step environment
variables and get the IP here we have
the IP the public IP for our our
application for our container and we can
just go to the this port and there you
go we have the same application that we
ran once in our machine then we run on a
machine on the cloud and here using a
container service for a docker and as a
platform as a service and well as you
saw it's very simple you can just put
the application inside a container and
you dock your image and then you can
push it to the docker hub and then now
you can choose whatever environment you
would like to run it ok so thanks for
watching see you next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
