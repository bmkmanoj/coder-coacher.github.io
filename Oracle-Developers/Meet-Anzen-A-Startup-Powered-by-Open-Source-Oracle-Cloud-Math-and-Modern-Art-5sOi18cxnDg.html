Amazon I was another startup and we
started about 15 months ago and we're
building out a new type of database so
any ambitious what I want to talk to you
about today is open source
Oracle's new bare metal cloud and on our
own composition our own startup before
we get going it would be quite helpful
to the discussion if I kind of knew a
little bit about new guys in the
backgrounds so-called participate in
raising hands so anybody who's got a
right arm could they raise their hand
right okay so we're kind of off to a
good start I think it harder and who
knows about the cloud okay great who
knows what hypervisor is okay good
and who uses principally the Oracle
stack okay it's not a lot fewer than or
total and so who uses Microsoft sequel
server my seek all those kind of things
yeah anybody use a no sequel database
yeah okay anybody use one go okay good
anybody know what gdpr is
okay what about Ruby snacks Ruby on
Rails and Python Django okay
VMware okay so puzzle is what you're
resting you guys using okay so j2ee know
to other people okay right good okay I
can I get a little bit of an
understanding I think of sort and so I'm
going to explain specifically today and
how open source has helped us drive our
ambitions forward and latterly have
Oracle bare-metal cloud has been helping
us to in terms of the way it presents
its its technology as you know from the
title there are certainly other
influences in in what were producing so
we started seven years ago we've been
incorporated 15 months but we started
seven years ago because we were involved
in financial services insurance industry
the IFA industry and an online retail
banking and we wanted to be able to
store information in the cloud
specifically wanted to store information
on AWS and in those days AWS only ran
important territories mainly the US and
it was a legal fist or UK citizen data
in u.s. still it and so we set about
understanding why that was the case I
attended quite a lot of conferences with
a classic Security Alliance when I met a
lady there from Reed Smith the
international privacy lawyers normally
just down the road and she explained we
couldn't encrypt that wasn't good enough
we couldn't anonymize the data that
wasn't really enough so we decided that
we should come up with a scheme whereby
we were able to do this so we scratched
our heads and thought about it and it
eventually came up with the scheme went
back to the privacy lawyers we're
pointing the best in one time and effort
if the whole thing would come unstuck at
the legal stage and they agreed that we
had a solution which which would in fact
allow businesses to adhere to
territorial privacy law which is seven
years ago so there's no sign of GDP on
the venous system at GDP our sins come
on see and equally we've had lots of
data leak so Yahoo national medicine the
OPM system the states of all security
betting information of fun I've given
with representatives so we file for
Peyton around the idea and I took five
years and was awarded in the u.s. it's
still pending in the UK and after award
in the US we incorporated and second
that building a business building Amazon
as a database solution okay
you know that's okay would it be easier
if I took the mic off and just shout it
or not shouting but I think I think if
you're easier yeah lately the mic can
everybody hear are you recording sorry
applause how's that not better yeah yeah
okay okay just flag up as soon as he
goes again please Thanks so we assume
all of these things are going to be true
basically those things will be breached
when human humans are involved at some
point there'll be human failure which
will cause those things to happen that's
why all of the breaches we've got today
have happened one way or another so we
were not suggesting for one moment that
we change a security strategy we're
suggesting there ought to be something
else there needs to be a way in which
the data can defend itself so what is it
we're doing and what I want to try and
do is give you a toehold into into the
approach and I hope you'll agree when
you've you've heard it it's a relatively
simple principle but if you imagine
Waterloo station at rush hour
and you look down from the balcony and
you'll see thousands of people milling
around the actual fact from the
information system perspective there's
probably only 50
oh sorry 15 20 25 people down there and
that's because everybody milling around
is essentially a clone of one of those
15 20 25 people and what I mean by that
is if we have the ability to follow them
home
each and every one of them will find
there are clusters of people would
follow clusters to a similar distance
out of London who were either renting or
had mortgages of similar sizes rents of
similar sizes living in houses of
similar square Mitra geez watching the
same TV programs drinking the same beer
if they take exercise doing the same
types of exercise at the same gyms I
mean it sounds sounds pretty damning and
but just just kind of think about it and
we all do it all on that little hamster
wheel one way or another and but it's
that kind of insight that led us to the
idea and it's always good when insight
is reflected back to you from a
different domain and so I came across
this artist at the time we were thinking
about this this is a piece of these work
a guy called mark Francis and the reason
his exhibition struck me was that he was
painting in a way in which or he was
painting things that were similar to the
things I was imagining ISM of my
thinking through this idea and so it's
really good to have that that validation
that information can be arranged he
calls these and rhythmic compositions
and that also ties in with something
else were doing from a math perspective
we're kind of big on signal processing
with what we're doing and people like
Fourier that play a part
but again going back to to the art
analogy Matisse was asked apparently
wants what he painted he said well
actually I just paint the differences as
I don't paint what I see
or what I see are the differences and
that's what we record we don't attempt
to record the same things about
everybody so we started
with financial services we have
experience in education and healthcare
so education is a great example exam
board record exam entries for each
candidate and when in fact lots of
children do the same combinations of
subjects I mean quite a lot of schools
that are clusters of children get the
same results in those same subjects so
you can probably imagine how all of that
information could compress I don't know
it was anybody here from Cambridge
assessment but they handle something
like 20 million candidate entries a year
and that the birth information does
compress
so we believe under under the Amazon
scheme and just keep the image of the
Waterloo situation in Mike's I've come
to precisely what the ends and scheme is
but will relieve the data is actually
safer in the cloud than it is on premise
and we can explain why it is so the
Amazon product has machine learning as
you might have guessed and its core so
we have to understand what all of those
clusters of information you know what
are they in the particular data domain
with its financial services health care
education or whatever your domains are
so the database itself underlap
understands the similarities between the
people as a consequence of the clusters
it uses open source technology so we use
SPARC specifically in terms of
clustering and we use ML Lib which gives
the k-means algorithm k-means service
which we used to detect great clusters
so once that process runs across of data
set across the set of spark nodes we can
determine the clusters and the people
who belong to the cluster so we we end
up with two distinct pieces of
information we end up with the pieces of
information pertaining to the definition
of the cluster so that group you belong
to who commute the same distance out of
London and living the same houses you
know and we also compute who belongs to
it and essentially how they differ from
the average in the cluster
that's the beginning that gives us the
basis what we call the shard so this is
not to be confused with what all the
database vendors call shards that's
easier that's mechanical sharding just
by chopping the data up based on some
keys
this is sharding by the database onion
implicit knowledge of your data so we've
ended up with two shards and then we go
further because fundamentally in those
two shards what we've got the clusters
and how you your individual person
document differs from the cluster
there's lots of other information stored
about a person which is not necessarily
connected to the keys that are used for
clustering all of the associative
informations we call them in relational
modeling so things like credit card
numbers things like and bank account
numbers sort councils and things like
that so what we do with that kind of
data we look for it as a microphone okay
yeah mic okay yep so we look for
patterns in those data the mains
themselves in the same way as and the
the image industry JPEGs looks for
patterns they use for analysis to
understand how to compress a JPEG so
we're looking using signal processing to
look across that domains of data like
bank account numbers and sort codes and
what we're trying to do is look for a
formula plus some constant which is the
customer specific information that then
gives us that particular value
so we've clustered and we've got the
ability to compress but compress the
good reason compress the
see enhancing technology reason the rest
of the data and that becomes our third
shard excuse me a second
so here are the three shards the green
is the cluster the purple is the Delta
or the dis is how you differ from the
cluster as an individual and the third
is what we've what we've labeled
translate and inflate the inflate is
essentially the opposite of applying the
or detecting the formulas for things
like social security Combes bank account
numbers and so on and so forth so to
bring those alive we have to re-inflate
those so we have three distinct elements
to what is traditionally in one a
datastore so we go back to to Waterloo
station the green bits of the 25 people
the 25 people from which were all cloned
the purple bit represent how we all
differ so in relative terms as 25
entries in in the green bit and there's
15 20,000 entries in the purple bit and
there's something like orders of
magnitude 10,000 entries in the orange
piece if we took the Waterloo station
example so I'm hoping you're kind of
picturing how this data's looking and
how it's very very different from a
relational database as we store things
very verbose lis in a relational
database
so all of these things do not preclude
as I mentioned earlier the application
of today's security technology so all of
these things even though they've been
split across different parts of the
world they can all be encrypted at rest
the firewalls etc can be applied to the
servers that crunch them so nothing
nothing changes it's just how the data
is understood by the database and how
the data can then be reassembled by the
engine but this time the engine isn't
running on a single server the engine is
the cloud itself so in order to use the
information you need to reassemble it so
we have two assembly options and one is
stronger than the other the weaker one
is still stronger than what we do today
so on the left-hand side we have the
cloud assembling those three shards of
information so when a query comes in we
pull the data from the appropriate
jurisdictions and the query engine is
good enough to know which bits of data
pulling from which jurisdictions and
that's assembled in the cloud on a
application server in inverted commas
and disclosed in the way that you would
with any any application today
that's assembly option one so that the
point to make there is in terms of
keeping legal we've stored the data in
very different parts of the world but we
can't do is assemble the data in
different parts of the world so the data
has to be assembled in the jurisdiction
in which the
nation lives so if we're talking about
GDP our general data protection
regulation which comes into force in
about a year's time even though we're
exiting were still we still have to
adhere to that regulation the world to
trade with Europe if a company fails to
veer to that regulation actual GDP our
GDP is a new part of that regulation
this apart we can solve if we don't
adhere to that regulation or your
organization doesn't he gets fined four
percent of its global turnover so the
anthem database will disperse and store
anywhere in the world but it will only
reassemble in proscribed jurisdictions
the mobile device adds another level of
security in the sense that you can elect
to assemble on the mobile device so you
can take three shards of data in so this
is a an IFA example demo that we have
you spin basically the plans your
financial plans are representing in the
wheel you can spin a wheel and touch on
the wheel and the value of your plans is
revealed
there's a little bit of chat information
that appears at the side of the wheel so
this is quite a good demo because it
means we can bring we can bring the
three shards of data in from different
parts of the world and the picture shows
meaningful data about someone's
financial life it's only meaningful when
those three things are assembled okay we
could also use the arm trust zone
technology to actually assemble in the
secure operating system on the mobile
device I understand both Android and iOS
have a trust zone
and lodging so that adds yet another
level of security so we call this the
military-grade option you can deliver
information out in the field and it does
not need to be assembled in the mid tier
so British Aerospace that expects
expressed an interest for example in
that kind of technology so even if it's
intercepted on the wire and decrypted
yep yes so we need fast networks I'm
going to come on to that actually so so
BMC is a good reason for it well good
reason for anthem to be on BMC is the
fast Network and I'll get to ask
so that's an intro to Amazon what we're
we're trying to achieve in terms of
splitting out data distributing the data
so I want to to move on now to talk a
little bit about open source and and for
us open source wasn't what it was a
necessary option and because we don't
have the budget we don't have the
funding allows us to build everything
from the ground up so when we first
started to look at this we were thinking
actually of taking an open source
database and then starting to to to fork
that and build our own technology off a
fork of something like Mongo and that
that wasn't the right answer absolutely
wasn't the right answer particularly
with the emergence of the cloud and the
compute capability there but it was
important because I wanted to leverage
open source we wanted to leverage to the
point where in an ideal world we didn't
have to write anything I just had to
bring things together to create what we
wanted to create and that's probably an
ambition too far so the first stage in
the process is understanding what it is
that you need to fulfill in terms of the
functionality so let alone what's out
there so we set about creating a
shopping list essentially of the things
that we would need in order to build our
solution so we need an operating system
we'd have been incredibly silly if it
wasn't Linux we needed a database and
I've been in the the English I'm quite
old
and I've been in the industry a long
time the first 10 years of my career was
entirely around the Oracle stack which I
then hardly used after that as we move
through the Java and
and really on Rails and Django kind of
euros but the from the bane of in my
opinion the best the bane of the
database and life particularly from a
developer perspective is fixed schemas
and they always get in the way they
always take time to update some of those
things that they made easier with
migrations and things but nevertheless
it's you know we've had these things for
35 years and no one's given us the
flexibility to - to control the schema
from the application so we absolutely
had to have a skinless database now I
don't know whether you all know the
scheme list doesn't mean schemas it
means essentially the application has
control over what it's printing back
onto the database so the scheme is
essentially defining the application so
we were looking for a scheme most
database we were looking for his
clustering technology and the ability to
scale low because we knew we had a heck
of a lot of compute to do and we had
even more compute because we wanted to
be able to recreate these clusters on
the fly and we mentioned before about
all of those things they're going to be
breached and the whole security industry
being built up on monitoring breaches
and testing vulnerabilities and what we
wanted to be able to do was respond to
those breaches and respond to those
alerts and read clusters they gave us
yet another level of protection so it's
consequently we're going to need a heck
of a lot of compute and ideally we can
leverage algorithms that are already
written like the distance based
clustering k-means fast Fourier
transforms and so on ideally we'd be
leveraging test-driven development and
bagel driven development frameworks
things like and continuous integration
frameworks like Jenkins and the like and
we wanted to ship compile code so we
didn't really want to be exposing Python
the things we wanted at least byte codes
so even if it was to be reversed
engineered and at least we've done half
a chance of defending our limited IP
because most of mrs. open-source and and
above all we wanted to met a program the
deployment environment and the way we
scale the solution so what I mean by
that is and we ultimately wanted the
ability for us to script the way in
which the environment would be elastic
and weave in coordinating little while
okay it's all making sense to everybody
so our initial choice these are not our
choices today as we're moving further
along the a roadmap to MVP with our
initial choices and some ones miss types
it so how do you type my own note so so
the first one is a clearly MongoDB if
I've got spotted at MongoDB and spark
spark job Server spark connector and
then and we did our own bespoke signal
analysis on some of the data
so did I ask if anybody else familiar
with spark
anybody can leave its mark okay anybody
familiar with batch jobs and mainframes
and things yeah okay so so the world
never really changes the language
changes so spark is is the ability now
to essentially create create your own
super computer so you can leverage
launch nodes and leverage nodes and push
processing out to the network
Spartan job server is essentially the
old-fashioned batch job system so I can
schedule a spark job run a spark job man
go see what happened so we're kind of
reinventing all of that that stuff from
well obviously it's not quite the same
thing because you know we as individuals
we never had access to a cluster we do
today through through the cloud and we
can rent them out for a few dollars for
a short space of time so we have moved
on in the sense that things are more
accessible but fundamentally the things
we're trying to do in the way we do them
don't change you know as this computer
was invented in 1937 my cheering that's
not changed so these were our specific
choices at the time to fill that
shopping list we saw earlier
so now we start to get on to so you know
we're trying to achieve you know now
we're trying to achieve it so now we're
going to get on to a little bit about
bare-metal cloud or if you have told me
they call it their metal so they may
I'll try and call it bare metal
so essentially picture on the right
describes how you how you would create a
set of virtual machines and the picture
on the left shows how that would look in
the container container world okay
sorry I've got the wrong way around
right so I see the container lest easily
don't know a left from the right this
next room so I can't remember the
results from before how many people know
about virtualization VMware and that
kind of stuff
and how many use it in the org and their
organizations okay brilliant and how
many organizations are fully virtualized
everything you run it through sort of
virtual machine wonder-percent though
how many people have got 25%
virtualization okay anybody got any
Oracle systems that are virtualized okay
anybody use container technology so
docker and communities okay good right
so essentially the diagram shows right
at the bottom so this is bare metal
we're talking about now Oracle bare
metal it shows storage machinery and the
network above that is the standard
hardware abstraction layer and the
virtual network layer so what some poor
here is that the virtual network layer
the power of virtual network layer on
BMC is available to all machine types
not run light which is not necessarily
true with other another cloud vendors no
understand like a salesman because I'm
not but that's what we found from the
Amazon perspective at Amazon perspective
so this is a stamp pretty standard stack
on each side and essentially we have on
the left hand side VMs VM is implicitly
contain the operating system they're
running so containers essentially just
contain the definitions of the
applications without the operating
system being embedded so in terms of
bare metal and this would also be true
of things like Microsoft Azure and also
AWS essentially if you're procuring a VM
you're procuring something that's taking
up a portion of the real physical
machine and then within that VM you're
ringing a piece of software if you're
running in a container world the effect
is the same you can still run those
applications be the database being an
application server but if you're going
to run more than one of those things on
a machine you can save some processor
you can save some resource by using a
container based solution
so the next bit is going to be a little
bit tricky for me to try and articulate
because I'm kind of relying on a certain
level of VMware knowledge or VM
knowledge and container knowledge but
I'm going to try and explain from Lanzon
perspective
what this cloud means to us as opposed
to some of the other clouds so in the
bare metal cloud all the machines are
treated equally on the network so by
that I mean although they're little
cloud I can have a real machine so I can
have a real physical machine and I put
to work I can have a virtual machine and
as far as BMC is concerned the network
behaves in the same way for me so it
gives me its full capacity
we can also integrate with external
networks so we want to be able to
integrate with a telecoms data center
for example so the telecoms data center
will run an Amazon solution but they
want one of the shards to exist inside
their own data center so we can plug in
to the BMC virtual network an additional
data center so we're running on out of
an Oracle I took two Oracle data centers
plus essentially a private data center
and now comes the difficult bit what we
wanted to be able to do on the shopping
list was met a program our environment
so we started out on the left-hand side
we started out by creating virtual
machines at AWS actually to fulfill the
compute requirement we had and what we
wanted to or what we ultimately decided
we need to achieve is we need to remove
all of these and these wasteful versions
of the same operating system and by
leveraging a container solution like
docker for example we can share a single
common operating system whilst having
the luxury to launch containers with
real functionality so wire wire virtual
machines and wire containers important
well they're important because from a
DevOps perspective you can define and
code the definition machines in the
environment and then have them launched
have them scripted at will the machine
selves can script the expansion's the
thing needs to be elastic so we want a
model where we can specify an engine
as a definition that can be put to work
in one instance two instances five
instances whatever we need for the
workload we're throwing at it and so
container management or virtual machines
initially but now container management
is is a great way for Amazon to roll out
its compute and roll out those open
source engines that are configured to do
the job that we needed to do so in
addition to that again coming back to
the open source community you will
created something called cube annuities
which is an orchestration tool for
containers so we now have gotten you've
got to really picture this what we've
got functionality that are implemented
in the visible units or the containers
that will run on machines and now we've
got open source projects or the
delivering orchestration engines to
manage those containers and we've got a
pure clean environment here in bare
metal that gives us the network capacity
in the compute power to be able to run
those containers
so we've got the ability here for us to
essentially build out through script our
own environment and have our environment
managed through script so that it can
react to we clustering operations for
example so we've got the machines really
running the machines and scripted
through through DevOps but the
flexibility is absolutely incredible and
in terms of if we start to compare to I
don't know a lot about Azur but we can
certainly compared to AWS because we use
that quite a lot too
and a awf as we said were there seven
years ago and as I've great compute
resource if I draw the comparison from
Land's and perspective and with AWS
we've got a whole horizontal layer of
functionality and we use a massive
subset of that and the configuration
options for those are different and
varied and so there isn't a uniform
approach to our DevOps so what we found
using this technology because of its
simplicity its power and its clarity and
we can through the use of technology for
technology like cuban et's we're in full
control of the environment we're
building out so we're leveraging Mongo
we're leveraging tend to flow and spark
and and we've containerized it and we've
got Cuban ETS managing it so these are
all open-source projects but an open
source project here
managing the elastic capacity of an
Oracle cloud it's so sweet really
so you know we can absolutely met a
program this environment so when I start
to think about things you know doing the
pass with Cambridge assessment and first
rate banking in HSBC and all of those
and we used to spend weeks just setting
up test machines and and then you don't
quite necessarily know what's in
production because the guy who who
placed over the production retired or
left or whatever and so you've got these
estates of dev and tennis and production
and they you know they it seems kind of
a completely alien world to this kind of
model and this world is a model where
not only at all of those different types
of environments are documented but
they're scripted so those scripts have
to run to the other run or they fail and
so scripts that actually make the
environment obviously don't fail anymore
so you've got the ability to reproduce
your dev environment we produce your
test environments and your production
environments at will on the press of a
button everything's written and not only
that the production environments can
take there it can expand using this
elastic orchestration capability
curtis's of tools like humanities so
from Land's of perspective on bare metal
with our approach of leveraging open
source to deliver a new type of database
product we've got open source projects
working at very different levels for us
they're part of the solution and they're
part of our DevOps
so this is our current direction so
again it allows a lot of iteration does
this approach because you can start
playing around with different tools in
different places and particularly if if
you're very very careful about how you
leverage the functionality at each layer
of your architecture so these are the
things that are important to us today
and so cuban ets daca cassandra is we
think is a faster database option for us
than MongoDB and but because of the way
we're rolling things in and out
we can roll Cassandra in and out of will
in parlors something new for us which we
really only just started to look at and
we're hoping this is the route in to to
bringing sequel to to to query our
database so we obviously don't want to
write a sequel parsing capability that
this is the route into query for us with
the ends of database spark of already
mentioned smart job server tensorflow is
another new one on on our radar the
reason we were likely to be using
tensorflow is after we've initially
generated those clusters of information
we need to be able to understand either
change to a customer record or a new
customer in fact we need to be able to
understand which cluster they fit in so
if it was the IFA example for example
and you suddenly won the lottery then
you would be propelled into a different
cluster and so that's update alone would
mean you change clusters even you're a
new customer you have to be assigned a
cluster so we need something that allows
us to to take some input parameters
essentially and then predict which
cluster Latian that person should belong
to and then and tend to flow fits the
bill it might be too powerful for what
we need to have like something else in
that slot and the line so let's come
back a little bit to bare metal because
and I'm kind of guessing a little bit
here now and because Oracle won't tell
us anything anything that they won't
tell everybody else so we can see this
this bare metal architecture unfolding
and we think we believe certainly Fran's
and Cuban ETS is a big part of that but
what I know we feel would be helpful in
terms of a cloud provider architecture
he's not necessarily all of those
services that keep being added almost on
the daily basis by some of the vendors
but to keep things simple pretty much
around container technology but to give
us some tape easily easy access
capability into some of these
technologies so you know ideally some
templates that allow us to launch these
pieces of open source software quickly
and easily so we're hoping on the
horizon is not only given eating's
within Oracle bare-metal cloud but also
templates around the common software
products
from the open source community so as I
said earlier we are working towards our
MVP Minimum Viable Product which we
believe will be ready in September and
we will launch in October with three
regions and then so Phoenix BMC in
Phoenix Frankfort and our own data
center in Gibraltar
so we'll launch with shards being
distributed into those three territories
okay so in summary anthony's building
out its product from a series of
open-source software components with a
little bit of secret source and it's
building account now as its primary
court an oracle bare-metal because of
the power clean interface and
succinctness and ability for us to
metaprogramming put as in control of our
of those open source products on this
platform anybody got any questions
oh sorry yes can you just remind me oh
yeah yeah
in this model yes yeah so and so better
networks give us the ability to to pull
information very very quickly and the
speeds of this network is phenomenal but
the traditional methods of cashing in
this model the data volumes are
relatively small so you position your
big volumes in the jurisdiction where
you and have to process so the clusters
definitions themselves a relatively
small can be pulled and cashed with a
reduced cash in the backend and that's
the the approach is to and is to take
the architecture model as is and then
put in capabilities that allow us to
mitigate latency issues not not yet we
will have when we launch the MVP yeah so
the time we launch will be publishing
figures on typical volumes in those in
those data stores but from the initial
prototype and initial investigation we
do not see a problem at all with with
with the network in terms of the
standard OLTP application yeah yeah yep
yes and so we're looking in terms of
Fourier we're looking for patterns and
across data sets so across a domain of
values so we're looking for and we're
looking to fit a curve essentially to or
a series of curves to data that we find
in in in our column of information and
so the reason we're doing that is we we
want to we want to represent and columns
and information as as a set of formulas
plus some constant data so we want to
try and compress the range of values and
then in much the same way as as happens
with JPEGs where you've got the base
information but a lot of the content of
that image is summarized in a series of
essentially formulas of waveforms and so
we're looking to be the same with
another soceity data around the edges of
a definition so by associative data I
mean if we looked at a standard
relational model and we mapped customers
many orders that kind of thing only
little details
with some more powerful parts of that
data model and some other associative or
decorating on to the model and it's how
you handle those the Associated bits the
decorations like bank account numbers
and things like that and and we want to
achieve a mechanism for some standard
data types particularly financial
service data types where we can
represent the information in a field as
a series of things are not just data but
also formula essentially and again that
adds a level of privacy enhancement to
it
yeah so good question actually well so I
guess and the gentleman asked whether we
were vulnerable to to rounding errors
yeah
I can't categorically say yes or no to
that at this stage actually there's a
very very good question now clearly we
can't be vulnerable but I can't say for
sure it man and if we are we'll work
around that but that's very good
question thanks for that yeah anybody
else on the system itself yeah that's a
good point yeah so this is the way the
systems are eating themselves up so yeah
yeah so systems are being used to please
themselves you know so again it's a kind
of meta level thing but it's really a
point actually not automat yep so maybe
we can construct some kind of and yeah
absolutely yeah to control the whole
thing yes absolutely
yeah a point yeah like it
so if you had an Oracle database today
in in Frankfurt then that would be less
secure than three hands and shards in
Frankfurt so it would be less secure
than three hands and shards distributed
across the globe but the Amazons shards
would still be more secure than an
Oracle databases today when it's
collocating in the same data center yeah
and any other database that might I'm
not picking on Oracle but sequel server
my thinking whatever you want to choose
yeah because we've got it split there's
three three points you've got to hack
and combine a single database is
obviously we're more prone to to to
vulnerability yes yeah yeah yeah so we
see this is a very different approach to
and a complementary approach to today's
privacy technology in that there's more
for the hacker to do but also we can
leverage this I said before some of
those information feeds about
penetrations and and get the database to
immediately take some pre-emptive action
like rearranging its clusters so it's a
living Beast it's a bit it's a database
that only works in the cloud and the
data in one of these databases is more
secure and so your data is more secure
in the cloud if you're running inside
the nodes and database and it is on your
own premises
single questions good question so we
believe the bitrate of the data and is
is a lot less and UCL I believe that too
and they're helping us formulate that so
we should have some metrics and some
maths which actually describe why that
is the case yes yes yeah yeah and and
you occupy less storage so it's been
suggested that we could get Inco grants
to create this make sure we've never
thought of yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
