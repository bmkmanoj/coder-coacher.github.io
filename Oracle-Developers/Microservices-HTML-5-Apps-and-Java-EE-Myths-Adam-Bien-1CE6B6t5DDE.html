lounge here at Oracle OpenWorld in Java
1 and also today is actually Oracle code
day I'm Bob Rubert with the Oracle
developer community and my guest for
this segment is Adam being Adam thanks
for stopping by
ok thank you this is actually Java 1 and
2 oracle open exactly this is the
exactly right we spoke a little bit
earlier in and you were at a session
yesterday that had some important news
about Java
you mean the keynote the keynote right
you were pretty excited about that when
we spoke earlier why don't you talk
about what you found interesting in that
session so first of all the keynote was
actually interesting which is not always
the case and funny and then was really
surprised that for instance the FN
project was open source on stage which
is not very common on Oracle keynotes I
would say and and yeah the new guy I
think is called mark mark cabbage he had
really very good perspective what should
be done in Java then the whole Java was
open sourced as well he 4j and I think
the most surprising thing was that the
open JDK and the Oracle Java
there will be no binary difference
between them and so many Java developers
as well as the Duke here are excited
about it
now you're presenting three sessions
this week yeah describe briefly the
three stress three sessions that you're
going to be presenting some we together
we had already a podcast about micro
services and this session today actually
what I try to do is if you already
decided to do micro services what is the
impact on the source code so because you
already know that you are in the micro
service world you can simplify it
drastically the code base and this is
what I did today
yeah does what I did today okay and then
what about the other two sessions yeah
tomorrow I get lots of questions from my
clients and a why I'm not using the
lightweight or heavyweight technology
they actually do not know what it means
so I asked them what do you mean by
lightweight our heavy weight then no one
could explain me what it actually means
so tomorrow I will ask the question
myself and the whole session I will
measure the most heavy weight
application service and compare them
with nothing but hello or Java so what I
what I would like to see is how much
space RAM CPU cycles whatever is
measurable can you actually save that's
your mythbusters' session exactly and
then and in the third session you're
presenting Oh lots of my clients ask me
now - what javascript framework should
we migrate right now and and the problem
in enterprises Java is pretty stable so
you can develop for years and you have
actually never to migrate but it's not
the case in JavaScript world every three
month you have to choose another
framework which gets obsolete the next
three months and this is um and this is
not very appealing to my clients so what
I try to do tomorrow is - what happens
if we apply the same principles what we
are from Java e to the web so I will
develop on stage a a simple web app
without any external dependencies just
relying on browser standards and and the
web platform and the cool thing is it
will almost look like Java interesting
interesting now yesterday you were you
were originally scheduled to participate
in a podcast as recorded in my hotel
room yesterday but you had a schedule
conflict which was in fact that Java
keynote what we discussed in this
podcast was I asked each of the
participants what they thought was what
trend or technology had the most
significant impact over the last 12
months so now you get to answer that
question in a different format what what
Trender technology do you think had the
greatest impact over the last 12 months
- what - what Impa - in in your world in
your
oh I think in the web world as a just
outside Java I would say standardization
in browser in the last two years the
lots of stuff is going to be
standardized so you don't always have to
use JavaScript frameworks so this was
the most I think the highest impact on
my projects and in the backend it was
not the technology rather than mindset I
think right now it is easier to start
pragmatic and productive projects in
Java two years ago you will have to
implement you know 20 patterns until you
hit the table once you know so and right
now we can just focus on business logic
and this works well I'm not sure whether
the last 12 months something significant
happened but there is a fault I think
from Bill Gates like nothing happens in
two years but a lot in 10 or something
like this you know you know the thought
is like there's two years you can
predict everything for two years was
impossible for 10 or something like this
and this is why I have to think about is
because for me is always hard to say you
know what is the difference between the
newest Java and the older one because
always use the newer one so you know
it's a 12 month for the last Java one I
think there was not a lot stuff which
changed the projects now your excuse me
your devoting a lot of your attention
lately on micro services hmm and and I
mean how would you characterize the
evolution of micro services within the
last 12 months
Oh two truthless all decisions recorded
a Java one the last seven years I would
say we're about micro services but we
didn't have the term yet invented okay
so right now I rename my sessions and
show actually the same but now what's
really what's really changes in
enterprise HTTP and JSON are acceptable
protocols and this could be the impact I
think the impact is we are forced as
Java developers to provide Jason and
HTTP for the web stuff so two years ago
you could go away you know with Java
desktop or whatever but now
the demand here you would like to have
our web stuff so this change a lot so
then if we already have the HTTP
endpoint there is nor far away to
micro-services so what I also see in
micro-services is the over use so many
just building micro-services because
they can okay and this is what we not
doing we try to start with a micro list
so very small my monolith and then if
you find something in the domain
perspective which you can extract from
the micro service then we get to three
or four so this is my way is the
opposite one not just thinking about
micro services API gateways and whatever
and forget to forget about the domain I
think you just coined a new term micro
lit I don't think it's for me but I
always talk about macro lifts like you
know and but micro lift is actually a
really considers as best practice if you
think about this imagine you would be
able to ship this software of the whole
company in one package very fast this
will be a dream and because it's not
possible we need micro services but if
you will able you know to build one app
completely in one second - it would need
micro services at all because it's
impossible we did Microsoft whom is a
wreck around not of his practice in an
interview I did a little earlier today
with Boris show and Claudio Cataldo
they're both from Oracle Boris brought
up the idea that in service oriented
architecture reuse was a much more
important factor than it is in micro
services
give me comment on that yes absolutely
and in fact I think we use never
happened
this was always a dream in enterprise to
reuse something and on what we heard at
conferences it was always the obvious
stuff you know like one department has
the absolute control over let's say
insurance policy computation or data so
everyone has to reuse that because they
have no other chance but what what in
projects happened that obvious technical
stuff was the idea was to read to make
something reuse
but it was never reused because first it
was hard to find this to identify as a
develop and no one will search in the in
the company Internet what is something
similar Brahe the problem is how budget
works in large companies no one is
interested in to use because if you are
a department and you have your budget
you will never call another department
and be depending on the others you know
so it is a way better in order to grow
your department and build your stuff
than depending on the others so this is
what's also political issues you know
what happens if the other department
change their interfaces so they will
have to do it that there's a huge
meeting in a company what we do right
now right so I think in micro services
we don't even try to reuse something
because we already know it never worked
it didn't work in kora and the component
models of why it should work now right
now the the world of developers is a
world in which they deal with an almost
perpetual learning curve you always have
to learn new things to stay on top of
your game what are you learning um I
have to say what I really admire I see a
Java one developers who every year talk
about different language I couldn't
handle that I have to say I'm in with
Java Script in Java and I learn all the
time and the problem is I attended right
now an Oracle key Oracle session with
Joe Darcy's like Oracle engine in Java
okay
and they and if you attend such a
sessions you know you actually knows
that you do not know nothing you know
you know that you don't know and this is
what strikes me it is actually it is
never boring and even if you learn the
whole staff Java you are still in oh you
only know a little so um I enjoy it and
I make no difference between learning
and working so there's the same priority
I like to play with things try them out
but in my projects I apply the Boris
possible stuff because if your projects
are boring is a good sign you know you
can sleep well this was actually what
was said at the keynote and and this is
what I really like I don't like to
experiment in commercial projects I do
it in my leisure
as I recall one of the sessions you
presented at one of the Oracle code
events over this this past spring was a
slide 'less presentation yes why did you
do that um along a story the first time
I forgot the slides and I deleted them
or something and then started the code
and every one I'd like that so what this
is actually cool so I don't have to
think about the slides and hence I'm
developer we'll just code and the
problem is if you explain you now like
micro-services or Java EE no one
believes you so and but if they see how
it works how fast it is how small it is
is complete different conversation so I
see it in my sessions if I hack
something hello world but they see the
point how they communicate and this what
I will do tomorrow I think you can
imagine more if you see the code and
actually what has to be done to to
achieve something this is for me very
important develop developer ergonomics
in my point of view if you have a
technology and is impossible to show it
in a session probably it will never take
off yeah what do you think is the reason
for that skepticism about micro services
in Java EE oh the Java EE the problem is
the problem are people problem as always
and so Java EE was mostly enterprise
technology and in the enterprises there
were architects which exaggerated a bit
with architecture would say so the force
developers to write you know crazy code
to implement simplistic things so and
now new developers came in and and saw
the terrible code and the application
server and they thoughtful and they
associated somehow heavyweight complex
stuff stupid stuff with application
service but this is no more true for six
seven years so actually I met some
people here startups are using Java EE
and the young developers they don't even
care whether it is java your application
service if it does the job it just works
so I think this is this is the issue a
little bit it's just a naming what hence
is renamed right now to Enterprise
Edition for Eclipse
no problem anymore right yeah okay
you've got let me see we talked about
one two three sessions over this week if
you could combine them all what's the
one key takeaway you want the audience
to walk away with from those sessions
what's the one thing you want them to
remember okay try to find a platform and
the standards and stick with it in
commercial projects this would be one
thing this is the common theme across
all the things and this is why Java is
so successful so if you just stick with
core Java you know you could go into
production in 1995 and your code will
still work but all the experiments I saw
you usually die those are completely
cool and esoteric technologies they know
they have no light a long lifespan and
the problem as developers is impossible
to learn them all so it is better to
focus on the platform and then if you
have time to do something more an hour
left and right then then just follow
each crazy hype and then revert your
decision the next year so what's next on
your calendar where are you off to after
Java one Java one is the most important
conference for me actually is the only
conference where as spent for Dasia
usually I'm just one hour for my talk
and fly back because actually I'm not a
speaker so I spend all my time in
projects and conferences there's a huge
you know time sync it's like I cannot do
you know it cannot be three three three
months on the road so I already have a
travel with Java one but at the next
conference there are probably some Java
user group meetings
okay German in Germany this is what I
want to do a lot is just a free the
Chavez very vibrant community of works
coming up yeah yeah so this is what I
will do but the next conference probably
devoxx in Belgium and boxed in Bucharest
they invited me he's also a nice crowd
and where can people find
more information about what you're doing
like your what your your blog you are oh
thank you my block URL is an ambien dot
block and Twitter is Adam bean and
YouTube is being Adam because one of the
reasons Adam bean was taken all right
well Adam thanks for stopping by and
talking to me today and for talking to
the audience for you folks out there
another you are else you should remember
is developer oracle.com you'll find lots
of content about micro services and java
ee and a lot of stuff you're hearing
about today thanks for watching and stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
