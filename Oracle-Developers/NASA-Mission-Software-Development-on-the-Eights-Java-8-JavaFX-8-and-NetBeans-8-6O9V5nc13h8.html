name is Shawn Phillips am i right
am i right I have three of my esteemed
coworkers we all work for a contractor a
nasa contractor named AI solutions
that's our logo we handle not only NASA
missions but also US Air Force JAXA and
to Circus and ESA so allow me to
introduce we've got Sean Henley Sean
want you to tell us a little bit about
the missions that you've been working on
lately Cameron yeah you're good right
now I'm working on a lot of missions
some of my high Earth orbit missions
some exotic orbits I'll show you in a
minute it's awesome low earth remote
sensing satellites runs again basically
yeah can you name any the missions aqua
aura Terra Landsat series ace wind Soho
James webbed with MMS discover cetera et
cetera so next to him yeah big deal so
next name is Nick savvy Nick tell us
about yourself yeah I am with the NASA
robotic conjunction assessment risk
analysis so it's not a mouthful right
and we make sure all of his satellites
are okay in space so what is it do an
okay job so what is okay mean in this
situation and that means that not hit by
pieces of junk
you mean like Russian satellites or
Russian satellite or missiles or you
know whatever right right
whalers on the moon yeah okay and and
you're supporting where's that being
supported out of actually well we're
pretty geographically diverse at the
moment we have a bunch of guys out at
Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland
we've got analysts supporting in
Colorado Springs Colorado and I'm
actually out at Vandenberg Air Force
Base in California just down the coast a
lot of the stuff he does is so my
presentation is gonna be awesome
just just a blank screen great
eggs so is on the right of him it is
Keith Chapman and before I introduce him
I just want to say the boilerplate that
I've been sharing with everybody as I
introduce him over 30 missions this guy
supports every day and he's been doing
that
for his whole life alright and his whole
life is a long time yeah yeah alright
keeping James Gosling's up there yeah
yeah so and I also want to say that this
is a guy that hired me and he got me out
of my dreary previous job doing DoD work
and got me into the super exciting world
of NASA cubicle work so he felt a little
bit about yourself yeah I guess I'm
putting the gray and gray beard over
here I've been supporting the NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center flight
dynamics facility for about twenty nine
years coming up on the 30 next year just
hard to believe I had it all up the last
16 or so than with AI solutions so in my
roles there I've been on both sides of
it from on console doing operations you
know with with the analysts all the way
to doing some development some onboard
coding for the EO one mission and now
for the flight dynamics facility I'm
working as the systems engineer /
architect and manager over the software
development efforts as we go through
modernization the facility itself does
handle 30 plus missions we handle
routine on-orbit spacecraft operations
for things that are already up there
whizzing around our heads but we also
support launches for expendable launch
vehicles Delta's Atlas things like that
we supported the shuttle program when
when it was up and flying we do support
for the international space station we
support the mich
that fly resupply and people up there
back and forth we do a lot of really
it's it's kind of an interesting
facility and that we typed pretty much
all flight regimes we do low-earth we do
geo saying we you know and we support
all the NASA network so quite a quite a
lot goes on there little feedback
yeah yeah right yeah for flight dynamics
it's not radio engineers so we don't
know yeah yeah yeah so we I'll do that
I'll cap off what he said that all human
spaceflight in the Western Hemisphere
goes through this man right here okay
that's right good luck with all that
yeah so I would be remiss not to include
us not not to include a slide which is
about us and you see a bunch of dots
well at start this is where we are so
first of all we we touch launch services
down at Kennedy and Vandenberg and
what's not up there we handle Wallops we
handle a lot of different places in
addition to our headquarters being
outside the Goddard Space Flight Center
in Maryland we do according to our
marketing team everything apparently and
we have some really strong tools in that
domain including free fly which we will
not be showing because it's not Java but
not everything is perfect everything we
do is 100% Java ground systems services
data all right so at the end if anybody
has any questions about this stuff feel
free to come up and ask us if you want
to give us a resume we will take it
happily okay I want to ask a couple
questions here let's see if anybody has
any questions do you want to add to this
please come on so guys why did you move
to Java I mean you weren't all doing
Java since you were born so in the
context of your NASA mission services
but maybe Shawn he seems kind of young
but but what made you switch over to job
as a technology implementation vector
anybody go ahead kingka for us so yeah
going back how long way involved in
facility flight dynamics facility has
been in existence for quite some time
when I started there the software suite
and I mean we were on IBM mainframes
there was a lot of things that were an
assembler code and some really old
versions of Fortran and things like that
and it was very good workhorse stuff it
obviously did the job very well and it
continued to do the job very well for
quite a few years but it became obvious
that you know obviously these things
have lifespans they needed to be retired
but the model that went forth bringing
that kind of software into existence and
giving us the kind of capabilities we
needed really had used to say a small
army but when I look back it was kind of
really a large army of developers and
this kind of monolithic thing that went
along with it so it became obvious that
we want to replace this and we want to
be a little more flexible agile and just
be able to bring new requirements and
new functionalities and the capability
new talent quite frankly into the mix so
so would you say it's there's a cost
savings obviously yes but the cost
savings isn't just what's gonna cost to
develop the code it's it's the entire
lifecycle and it's in this bang for the
buck really to I mean you can and it's
something somebody says okay well a
budget is coming down and always coming
down so you don't you know talk about
that in a minute
yeah you don't you don't have that you
can't have that army anymore one so but
the other thing is so the next challenge
is well how do you how do you get things
out with a smaller workforce but get
bang for the buck I can we can develop
stuff the old way and give them things
that meet what they need for that dollar
amount but it doesn't add new
capabilities going forward to bring new
mission
into the facility to bring new customers
to be new business so the cost issue
isn't just how many dollars it's what
you get for that dollars and these
platforms moving on the NetBeans Java
Java things like that really gave us a
lot more that we could bring back to the
customer and say hey here's things we
can do to leverage to bring customers
back in and facility perfect so uh hey
Shawn what now why did you switch to
Java I wouldn't come job one that works
that works okay so thank you for coming
we're done on that shameless plug issues
right so uh let's see here
how's the move worked out I mean this is
the sole I mean I put 8k back up one
slide keep talking about eight so how
did how did move into eighth impact you
or your customer or your missions I'll
go ahead and take that one
we didn't choreograph this I know had it
all Nick come on well I was kind of
nervous about it honestly I was thinking
well I you know I I'm a sole developer
out at our Vandenberg facility right now
and so I don't have a lot of extra time
to be going back and trying to you know
get stuff working that was working
already and so I decided to give it a
shot I installed NetBeans a JDK 8 on my
system compiled and it just ran out of
the box no problems nothing broke it was
awesome so you know it saved me time and
effort from not having to go back and
fix things that I probably should have
coded right in the first place but you
know I am an engineer so it happens yeah
right once in a while yeah and now
you're in a cleared environment where
there were trials and tribulations to
getting uh yeah and in fact the
interesting thing is own so when I first
got there we were on Java four so one
point four so I mean so like 90% of all
the businesses out there
right you know one point four I mean
this is the stuff I coded on when I was
in an undergraduate in college so
luckily I had experience but you know I
came in and luckily right when we
started they decided to upgrade to a new
Linux system that had JDK 7 bundled with
it so we started developing on the on 7
and then you know the upgrade 2/8 been a
long time coming I mean it came out you
know last year I guess or or so I think
the official remark marks but the beta
releases have been coming out that's
right and I'd like to point out right
there that that's been really strong for
myself and I know Shawn yeah
and and I don't want to speak for
YouTube but what I was able to do was
for the several applications I was doing
for multiple missions once I established
a release and typically two releases a
year to operations that type of thing I
was able to release on seven and then
compile against Java 8 the early
releases in 2013 and so that when my
2014 release came which was in April
only a couple weeks after release Java 8
no problems I just there was no issues
in fact I had to explain to them that
there was actually a release change you
know a complete JDK change I didn't they
didn't they couldn't fathom the idea
essays the systems administrators
couldn't fathom the idea that we could
go a whole rev up and not have a problem
and I think the only reason I didn't
have to rely on that is because in the
secure environment the accreditation
process takes so long that you're
already like the second release of Java
8 before we even get approved so in fact
our approval just came through recently
we'll be installing Java 8 on our
operational system next week so and then
we'll be able to upgrade our development
system to operations so yeah so I want
to save enough time for a few demos
which some people might be interested
although if you saw a Michael Hoffer
presentation that it's going to pale in
comparison I'm almost embarrassed to be
up here but I got a couple more
questions what do you see the benefit to
your customers going forward and so let
me define customer as the mission
stakeholders both in NASA and also the
US air
go ahead okay a little bit of the same
similar things that I've touched on
earlier and just saying when we move the
Java itself our facility it's not
mandated that people use the flight
dynamics facility NASA doesn't say you
guys have to use these we have to look
at customer base come out and say okay
there are missions flying we want to
bring these missions into our facility
we want to do support for them and so
some of that is being able to adapt the
new mission requirements put things out
that the capture the interest of these
in of these missions and be able to
incorporate those into our facility very
quickly and cost-effectively so I see
the kind of things that are now
available and you know as we move the
JavaFX with our later latest projects
and now you know now we're up to eight
seeing some of the things that are
available and when our customer wants to
do as far as exposing some some of the
graphics some of the data out getting a
little more pizazz we've been doing a
lot of foundational type stuff that
build up the foundation to make sure
that all this stuff has a good platform
to build on now it's time to take that
and go forward and say hey look at some
of the cool things we can do your
mission wants to fly with us and they
could leverage those things and leverage
the talent for these kind of guys to
come out and bring that kind of stuff
out and get generate buzz and bring
bring missions in cool cool good Sean
but a mission tom was on discover it was
a compressed gadget went from three
years to one year development time so
NetBeans and Java allow me to use some
of the things Sean worked on previously
and pretty much Natalie into system
without actually doing any kind of
coding which is great for saving time
and customers love that he's hidden time
money and dictum a feature of that when
you work and you're gonna get to see
some of that actually so unless anybody
has some immediate questions yeah right
okay so the question we have to repeat
the questions so the man can hear ah the
question was which version of NetBeans
oh the NetBeans platform did we start at
well I think that's gonna be a little
bit different for each one so I would
say Keith you're you used in the
NetBeans platform a few years ago to
implement a few one-off applications yes
we started all the way back and started
doing some job of work all the way back
in 2006 did that even have NetBeans back
there yes they did yes they did and you
know as we've been going along what one
of the things we've just been updated to
the newer versions as they come out and
that's been actually worked out very
well and we've never run into an issue
where oh my gosh
back out of version because the newer
version broke something that we were
doing and it should be noted with
Keith's he has a mix of pure Java
effects type tooling and a couple
one-off Neptunes platform apps yeah as
we've been as we've been moving along
since this project has been going on for
a little while we have things that are
in operations that are still on we got
six and seven out there and now we're
rolling out an eight as we go back
through our maintenance activities we
get to upgrade those that are out there
running but yeah now now all the
developers desks are sitting there were
they okay how about you I started on
NetBeans six oh that was more just to
learn the platform and then by the time
I learned it it was NetBeans seven so
that's what I developed on 731 was the
question was was there any issues going
from seven point three to eight no no
everything just ran out of the box so
yeah I find here Chan this is direct at
you that there are some once in a while
and occasional dependency is added to a
new version of the platform and by
default it's added to your platform app
depending on your dependency tree and
that that is the worst problem I've ever
had where it's like suddenly there's a
few extra dependencies and then you
compile it you're like oh that's new to
the platform this here you go when you
uncheck the things you don't want and
you're
so it's of yeah it's like a two minute
thing that's trying to collect a
dimension that that may have happened
that may have happened right but but
then but then there's so many other
things that just go so smoothly yeah and
that takes a couple seconds to resolve
right not that big of a deal actually
our latest maintenance releases we're
rolling out for one of our projects the
the move to eight FX 8 that means 8 has
actually it's fixed some things that we
had that our users had written some
scr's against to say you know there's
some things we need we want fixed and
before we looked at okay so we made the
switch and we did some analysis came
through was like hey just by making that
switch we got to close out a handful of
dickin so that in and of itself was nice
my experience I've used NetBeans since
five oh not with this company two
companies ago I watched it go from five
five to six did all kinds of swing
development JPA modeling was a dream
back when JP a standards were barely
established yeah your chance like wow
that we do that yeah I'm telling you
that's what we used and then I changed
jobs I was forced to use some other ID
clips something I don't know and then
then I came to here and the very first
real assignment I got was to do some
legacy flight navigation software as in
C code that runs on board the satellite
and they had all these different IDs for
different compiled build platforms that
sort of thing you know Linux Mac Windows
and it was just a nightmare so the I
combined all into NetBeans 7.0 because
that's what was available when I started
and then they said well we need to do
crown system developed and I said we
should be using the NetBeans platform
and after that they bought the design
they bought the concept and I started a
what we call the Polaris platform at AI
solutions don't laugh known as the
kool-aid drinkers yeah never I'm never
thirsty I drink all the kool-aid and so
we have our own custom platform we call
it Polaris and it's a collection of
plugins that we have to do different
data products and visualizations and
you'll see some of that here
and it's really paid off from a
cost-savings point and a rapid
development standpoint so with that
let's have a look at Nick's abies demo
yes all right so yeah let me I just want
to show you a quick picture before we
get into it so you can understand where
we're coming from so when we're
analyzing collisions you know potential
collisions out there we get tons of
notifications for collisions every
single day because as you can see
there's a bunch of crap out there some
of this is like tiny little pieces of
debris some of its other satellites some
of its like big old rocket bodies that
just got left in space stuff like that
and so the biggest problem we come
across is that we don't really know
where anything is in space we kind of
know where things are in space but we
don't really know and so what we do is
we put these uh these bounding
ellipsoids on and basically say that
this is kind of where we know it is it
should be within these bounds here and
you know each satellite has different
ellipsoids there and then you have to
use statistics to figure out what your
probability of collision is it's not
like a oh we're going to collide or not
it's a you're gonna collide ish don't
you feel so much safer now I'm so glad
we came up here thanks no problem you're
gonna collide ish so yeah what we do is
we can provide our satellite
owner-operators with kind of estimates
of what they can do to avoid the risk so
it's more reducing risk than getting out
of the way of some you know a piece of
debris yeah the question is how far it
in times that projection go and usually
we go about seven days it depends on on
the orbital regime though so what we
have here on the lower left we have this
contour that we can show our satellite
owner-operators saying listen this is
how the probability of collision looks
over a range of
you know maneuver times and maneuver
quantity so you can choose the one that
reduces your risk sufficiently and as
you can see it's not a simple problem
you can actually burn to try and get out
of the way of something and increase
your risk so the problem is non-trivial
I I wanted to put that out before I get
to the demo because the demo wouldn't
make much sense if you didn't at least
get that so alright so let me go to to
the demo here well now what are we
looking at Nick here I'm gonna put on
that zarlinh it Shawn I don't know if
you knew this but this earth this is as
much yeah like I said well first of all
we get a huge list of conjunction or a
close approach notifications every day
usually it's around a thousand plus per
day so we have to weave that down or
narrow that down into those that are
high-risk and those that are low-risk
and what we can do is take it to this
visualization here and match up our
high-risk satellite ids with those that
we've we've narrowed down on our
reporting so this is a classified data
right no it's not okay mainly because
this is all simulated data so okay thank
god there's nothing that's real about
this demo so once again home run thank
you so so what we're looking at here is
a 3d view of the earth and these little
yellow dots on here are because I was
too lazy to get models into the the view
but now with what frame occurs is giving
you the the globe
oh what's that well what are you using
to get this 3d globe well I'm glad you
asked Shawn
it's JavaFX Java fix eight that is so
what we have here is Java FX 3d yeah
embed it inside inside a Java FX panel
or GFX panel right oh it's a swing panel
that has a Java FX scene and the 2d
panels over here are also it's the same
thing except just 2d Java effects so
what we have here these yellow dots are
ground stations or you know radar sites
or telescopes or whatever they may be
and over here we have our list of
satellites that you know maybe having a
collision with a piece of debris so what
we want to do is look and see how much
do we trust that that a piece of debris
that's been you know tracked over and
over again and there are some things
that help us to understand that we and
really we need to we need to know that
so that we can make recommendations to
our satellite operators so I go ahead
and select one of these options here and
you can see it populates the the ground
stations here with with what we call it
tracks and so you see the little yellow
line going from ground station to where
it saw the satellite so you can kind of
see a distribution of you know where
each ground site saw the the satellite
and here we tell the users you know
which sites they were and how many
tracks they got per sensor and so you
know if it's if it's just one sensor
that's seeing everything we're gonna
find one that has just one I don't have
to go through anyway if you can find one
that has just one sensor tracking
everything well all of your tracks are
going to be subject to the biases of
that one sensor and so you can kind of
trust the data but but not really so you
have to assume that your solution is
more uncertain and then the other thing
you have to take into account is where
were these tracks taken around that
object's orbit because if if you see
just tracks in one portion of the orbit
you're gonna know where that satellite
is in that portion of the orbit really
well but all bets are off for the rest
of the orbit and it turns out you know
orbits or 360 degrees so uh
not every orbit is that through orbits
around the earth right well it's not
even MMS is it looks more like an egg
and then then I've been 360 it's still
it they show yes it'll go around all
right I don't know man all right that's
fine because we can get into the
intricacies of orbits right now you want
there we got a question back here the a
good question the question was are we
using world went under the hood no we
are going to show some world wind
embedded inside and that beats platform
app in a little bit but this right here
is a pure Java the x3d implementation
inside the NetBeans platform nothing's
popping right yes yes and you know
really the main reason that this isn't
this is a really cool for us is because
we can't get 3d libraries into the
secure environment right we have to get
it accredited first and that can take
six plus months if ever you know you can
submit it and you may just never hear
back so it's the type of thing where if
it's bundled with an already accredited
software package then that is fantastic
for the secure environment so that's why
Java effects 3d and you know Java
effects in general is really great for
us question is it perfect absolutely not
question right here know which
implementation this particular
application is not open sourced well
interesting is this is really easy to do
in just out-of-the-box Java effects it's
actually yep well I like to make justify
our salaries
so he's right that part's easy but then
the difficulties are more you know you
gotta map the 3d coordinate space of the
3d scene to actual lat/long L or XYZ
meters etc and that there and okay yeah
that's one math formula but now do that
for all the calculations so that when
they see something that's fairly
accurate that's where the money's made
well keep in mind yes
so I mean most of the time that I spent
on this was dealing with getting the
angles of these tracks right because I
mean you're in a tough eccentric frame
which means the the coordinate frame at
the sensor and then you have to from
angles you have to point that line in
the right direction and put the the the
sphere on the end so so anyway so you
know there are difficult things about
this but creating the little planet
there is not one of them and that can be
done right out of the box pretty easy so
could we use this to track juggs a Chaba
user group so I mean would can that be
you could so maybe this guy is and we
need you know we talked to him after
talk to him afterwards and oh yeah a
worldwide jug tracker there we go okay
all the netbeans
it wouldn't be quite as interesting as
tracks I mean you just have circles on
the earth all right yeah it should be
one big circle all right come on another
thing I wanted to show was if you want
to pick out one of these tracks right
here I can click it it changes color and
populates information in this other box
so I wanted to show how easy it is to to
interact between the JFX panels you can
do that through event handlers lookups
and you know I made a custom sphere
object that held a little bit of extra
data so that you know when it passed the
event handler or when it passed the
event over to this GFX panel it would
have a little bit more data than usual
so from here I can I can go ahead and
look at individual tracks and see if
there's anything weird about it
I wanted to give a shout out to the the
open source project or kit it was an
orbit library that I gave me a lot of
orbit dynamics attitude dynamics
coordinate frames stuff right out of the
box and it's fantastic it was
no problems he isn't it so cool right
did you have any slides did you want to
show or because yeah I think we covered
most of the slide stuff I want to show I
mean bless you yeah yeah so I'm gonna
switch back yep
besides nobody wants to see my slides I
just wanted to hurt him pictures
hopefully we have a question here while
he said no the testing
well if NASA had a bigger budget we
could afford that's not just like
documentation documentation well you
know I well I know we use tests ng a lot
you know the J unit and tests ng just
the stuff that comes with NetBeans and
again it's because of the secure
environment I can't bring in external
libraries accept what's packaged but you
know I found everything I need can
either be done or worked around using
testing G so yeah although I'll say that
a lot of the 3d stuff you know that's a
heavy custom 2d stuff I mean it's hard
to test that you can test the dead
underlying data services and we do a
little bit of that when it makes sense
but in the end if it a lot of its custom
visualization I mean only a human can
really say it looks nice or it looks
terrible and and honestly since this
stuff is really new for us at least all
of our testing code has been done on
like a report generation and data
processing so that stuff testing geez
awesome for right all right well we're
stealing from Sean Sean wants to talk
about mission called discover and sold
takeaways Sean alright so discover the
great acronym that deep space climate
Observatory mmm you can figure out how
to do that
you can argue so discover is at a very
exotic orbit or call the garage join
orbits basically there to balance
between Earth's Sun and rotation they're
kind of weird to keep diagram on the on
the Left shows where they are so they're
kind of in the middle of nowhere really
that's the else
the different Elle points of the
lagrangean so we're going to l1 so
that's the point between Earth and Sun
now why are we going to l1 because you
got a good view of the earth um we
wanted to conceived by Al Gore after the
internet was recommended um he decided
to that the man is the myth that he's
his own legend yeah there's a backstory
we're not hammering Al Gore per se he
saw the internet he wanted to solve
climate change so um he decided to have
a satellite to look at earth we could
all see how Dirac changes over time Bush
didn't really like this he canceled the
program was canceled doesn't one
postpone for ten years Obama because
he's just with Bush brought it back or
with a cooler brought it back and said
you know I don't want to text again so
we're gonna launch it before next life
cycle so we can press the schedule from
BC three years about my time down to one
year time watch is a pain in the ass for
us a recipe for success
yes yeah so the launch is actually in
January and I'm gonna be supporting
probably over Christmas so yeah so
coming with these problems we get a
couple of things from couple things
happen first of all decisions are made
that don't really make sense down string
example our customer wanted you SDK Bush
because we're a I solutions free flyers
our choice into our software SDK is our
competitor basically they want to use
MATLAB for text formatting which I don't
know why when you have Java and third of
our operators are all kind of just
monkeys in the sea I wanted to press
buttons all day yeah easy Sean they're
also on our team I'm one of them too
it's kind of fun crossing buttons what
he's trying to explain is that there's
there several different roles on every
every ground system mission you've got
some lot of people who they're familiar
with the environment and the mission
goals and so they do the day-to-day
button-pressing really and you've got
some software developers who provide a
lot of the tooling don't necessarily
have the background
of the science or the mission itself
beyond what they need to implement and
then you have the subject matter experts
the analysts which are more into the
science itself into the mission and act
as a sort of linchpin between all the
the three groups yeah so fortunately for
us STK had Jay and I very cumbersome van
I interface MATLAB is Java surprise and
have a real good on swing based wizards
for the operators just press through and
kind of - we press next so made for
freedom tools they started out with a
legacy data source
I was made back in the 70s it's pretty
archaic we ended up putting into a
modern framework to get these data for
the operative use as well as some
visuals and fancy things for customers
to say so
basis Empire entire process made it a
hundred step process it down to 20 which
is amazing for operation saves a lot of
time a lot of errors are saved and we
save time because the customer wants to
pass things now and cheap which is never
a good idea and how did you manage to
pull that off what do you mean well how
did you manage get the features in so
quickly I know the answer netbeans well
the ramifications of starting a plug-in
platform based on an existing
architecture were that several of the
integration patterns that he needed to
achieve had already been implemented
previously on similar missions for
instance the classic one is the MATLAB
integration tool that we have so Sean I
should be a MATLAB tool here before for
another mission mm/s I just used that
Ralph the bag used and it worked it was
great for saving life time efficient so
would you budget it about 1/2 months of
full time yeah would have been about a
half month to a month of time to develop
a matlab plugin with Sean's tool it
would basically less than a day and so
by tool gave him the plugin he pulled it
down from our repo
dropped in his app he's done all right
now I'm Thomas wise good demo so while
he's pulling that up what you're about
to see it well there it is is a NetBeans
platform at compile Lonnie yeah and go
in okay yeah it's my demo thanks John so
you maximize it please yeah all right so
it's absolutely this is just a very
simple interface
pretty-pretty users start out here with
that data back in the seventies it was
made it's a pretty bad I mean yeah so I
have to pull that out of this and put
into a wizard someone to use which I can
do that
in net beat so pools all of that out
puts it in this pointer from this says
here's larger data you use it for you
want what you wish so I mean you can
implement Wizards
in any version Java but the NetBeans
wizard wizard allows you to easily
generate these things and we we lie on
those heavily to create workflows that
sit on top of processes that normally
would be automated so that operators
analysts can do these both real-time in
in in the operations room or on their
desks when performing sandboxing yeah so
what we do with this basically use this
very archaic state file to generate an
ephemeris or a basically where the word
will be and next couple months or so and
when we use a post process that make
different products like angles and other
kind of contact schedules for the for
our customers and users that's nothing
that I really do because text parsing is
really easy and integration of different
tools we use for that also very easy I
also have some visuals to show summer
Carmen visual is basically one of our
requirements that we say within a
certain angle from the Sun we're also we
either fry the sensors or the tracks
that light did that so need it real
quick this requires a tutor files me a
second here
can you dance for juice please
did you feel the whole thing shake up oh
yeah you're pretty heavy alright so
pretty simple graphic but it's very
useful operators because it shows you
basically win your satellites out of the
box one side of the box wheelie fact of
it or otherwise we can't find it again
so we're not calling like an expert to
come find it again using very complex
and unknown algorithms I know it knows
how to do but yeah so pretty standard it
cost more loves because it's colorful I
almost have some 3d stuff in here I can
do as well
Sean mention whirlwind there someone
mention troll one in the crowd earlier
yeah actually used whirl with Joey when
we'd use world would now if Teddy orbit
how big it is compared to the earth give
it a second to load baby why isn't
working that's it all this weed is
Esther hmm okay my impatient first so um
you can switch back to the slide kinda
one second no more try
sure
Faison often thank you yeah SOS yeah
whatever you want
all right so that actually that was
world when that we were gonna bring a
globe up on and we have we've developed
a world wind plug-in where you can pull
in multiple globes and then drag and
drop ephemeris if Mara tees sorry which
are the raw data for the actual if you
want to see them afterwards come to come
see me I'll have it up on screen
hopefully we're in so yeah it's pretty
cool here's you just tell the biggest or
basically its orbit cells about 10-20
bigger than you actual earth itself so
it's pretty closely
alright thanks Sean okay so so what I'm
gonna show are some screenshots and some
demos from some missions like JWT James
Webb Space Telescope MMS magnetospheric
multiscale and some deep space analysis
software that we're developing in the
house this is a research-only software
and so nobody else in the world has it
and so you should be a little
interesting okay so my name
magnetospheric multiscale mms measures
the magnetosphere and it has it's very
unique because it's a three dimensional
orbit in that it has four satellites all
flying in a three-dimensional
tetrahedron and they fly half the
distance to the moon and back okay so
very elliptical and that's very
important because that's how the science
is actually conducted and they fly in
and above and pass the magnetosphere and
collect data and so that will launch in
march of 2015
james webb I don't think I have to
explain James Webb but what we're doing
AI solutions and what Shawn and I have
been working on lately is a contact
analysis tool a visualization tool
contact analysis is as the spacecraft
goes out to where it needs to be and
then stays where it needs to be
station-keeping
what ground and space assets do we have
that can actually maintain contact and
that's very important for tracking and
also
commanding control that we also are
doing what's called the launch window
analysis framework so we have a lot of
legacy tools some Java some free flyer
there's even some MATLAB in there which
perform all kinds of modeling and sim
Monte Carlos and Monte Carlos - yeah
white model it which is brute force it
but they did it and it produces a ton of
data to decide ok is it really a good
idea to launch now or in five minutes or
in five minutes or in five minutes ad
nauseam for months and months and months
and it has dramatic differences just an
hour apart and so it's our tools are
producing not only the numbers but
they're also saving the data and
visualizing there
and finally the deep-space trajectory
Explorer which is an again an internally
research and design tool is a tool
designed to look at deep space gravity
models now this is important because
when designing a mission for deep space
mission and I defined tube spaces
anything outside of Leo hero or geo and
in this case we're thinking Jupiter
Saturn all types of new problems come
out if you know the whole the whole
orbiting around the earth that's that
that that is so 1969 you know I mean
when you go to Jupiter you've got so
many of those moons and Jupiter's such a
massive body that the gravity patterns
are just very chaotic and so it's no
longer a circle it's it's a mess and so
we need tools to better visualize that
and explore those trajectories so that
we can select a good one to base our
mission around next slide ok so this is
me last year at the communicate keynote
address on stage and this is the MMS
formation this is the video we're
playing that's Heinrich style and the
whole point of the the MMS tool is to
perform daily collision avoidance we do
telemetry QA and we generate commands
for the onboard flight navigation
software next here's a screenshot of
that now I can
demo this but I already doubled this
last year at the keynote and some other
sessions and so I wanted to show some
new stuff but I wanted to point out that
we have this and what you see up there
is whirlwind on the right okay and on
the left is Java effects inside of an
eff beans platform application and we're
using a nice split pane to keep the two
separated and so this this tool out the
analyst to load up common data products
state vector files which had things like
the position and the velocity and some
other goodies in it sucks that NSA as a
recognized file type and that means does
some ad hoc calculations on the flight
before for orbital elements and then
allows the user to drag and drop these
on to the different chart frame axes and
create dynamic plots so Java effects
that's correct yes it's a Frankenstein
yeah okay so the question I'll summarize
the question we I threw everything in
one we got the NetBeans platform we've
got world win and we've got so an epic
platform swing we've got world win which
is not swing but it has swing wrappers
and I'll get to that and we've got
JavaFX
all in one tidy little Bowl here so what
were the problems well honestly the
problems go away when you start using
that piece of platform and so I mean
what I'm able to do is talk between the
two different rendering systems using
the lookup now I didn't have to do that
could have created some custom events
and I could have I could have hand
rigged it but I didn't have to and so
all I have to do is is manage a jfx
panel on one side split pane in the
middle that's swing swing swing inside
of a top component and then I used the
one has a they have an AW T version a
heavyweight version and a lightweight
version so I actually used the I believe
that's the swing version the lightweight
version so I think that that makes it a
little bit easier I think so yeah and I
didn't experience any problems and I
might add that the data files I'm
unloading and then those those orbits
that I'm rendering we're talking twenty
thousand data points and so so twenty
thousand times 12 ish floats and then
I'm able to pull those all in in about
two seconds so the the the platform
makes the the data absorption possible
the top component and lookup system
makes binding the two different
rendering systems together
straightforward and then you know
whirlwind does the Voodoo that it does
and then Java effects makes the charting
easy I did not have to yeah right I know
well yeah right haha we'll see when it
launches this one Shawn we need to get
out of path income now I quit I you know
there's a lot of questions on this I
actually I wasn't going to show this I
wanted to show something else so I want
to keep moving but if you have more
questions on this particular view please
come see me okay okay so the next tool
that we talk about is the contact
analysis tool it does these things but I
think the most important thing is again
it's an epic platform app and we're
loading in a series of large data
product files I want to say they're each
three megabytes but there's dozens and
and what happens is you've got over a
hundred thousand separate data points
the contacts that are then being pulled
in correlated and blasted onto the
screen simultaneously and I can
demonstrate that right now should be
already open yes
alright ok so we have the NetBeans
platform I use a dark Nimbus
look-and-feel because dark is trendy and
I wanted people to think my tool was
cool and it is actually because I was
just jealous of mine what he was just
jealous of mine yeah yeah it's hard to
keep up you're not very cool Shana fair
enough so you see a whole bunch of files
here we're able to manage our contact
analysis workflow using the NetBeans
built in project type of style and
mentality and that's important because
we don't just run a contact analysis
simulation and then call it quits what
we have to do is we have to integrate a
enterprise tools like free fire but you
know like these guys demonstrate it
could be SDK or MATLAB and those tools
are the accredited number crunchers and
they generate the data we can do that
here so what you can see is I've got a
couple options here I can generate the
free flyer contact analysis reports
don't work ok that takes like a minute I
mean I'm time click on the contact
analysis button ok ok so what's happened
is it's scanning the project and it's
looking for all the files that you see
here at the topic what's in the contact
reports and as you can see it's a little
dark of when projected so it doesn't the
wording doesn't show but it's going to
and it's it's scanning each one I'll
admit it's doing it sequentially so what
we haven't done is and what we'd like to
do in the future is take advantage of
streams to string the whole thing and
use multiple cores so what you have now
is it's clearly a JavaFX chart right but
it's actually a scatter plot and it
doesn't look very scatter ish it looks
more like a Gantt chart what I did was I
use Java effects to override the scatter
plot point and create little bars
a little yeah okay so what you have here
are all the contacts for all the
stations and you can hover over these
and get information on that very nice
right so let's look at our region of
interest I would say right here so I'm
gonna draw a bounding box this is all
JavaFX
and I'm zooming in right so let's zoom
in a little bit more let's get a look at
where we cross a contact boundary and
you can see the granularity starts to
show up here and I want to know about
that guy
Jeter Z and you click on it and now it's
back now we use the lookup we use the
lookup and the nippies platform it goes
and finds that that file that it's
linked to in the project not only does
it pull it open but it actually jumps
you right to the line in the file so
this what this is done that we didn't
have before is it gives the the analyst
the capability of tracing back from a
from a visualization deep into where
that data came from and you might say
that's almost trivial in an example and
I'm unbuttoning my shirt here cuz I want
you to see something vote for me all
right but I mean you you could do this
with multi variate data obviously and
maybe create yet another custom view
that lets you jump from view to view so
let's switch
okay we have we have ten minutes I get a
hurry next slide okay
and so obviously I just went through
that and we again we get to reuse our
world when plugins we get to look at all
the ephemeris files that are used to
generate the contacts so that week in
the simulation and we can have that all
on the same scene okay so this one in my
opinion is this was this is a pure Java
effects tool that I'm in the process of
porting to the NetBeans platform but I
had to develop it first on peer defects
because it's very very oriented towards
visualization I'm doing 100% of the
development in Java and on NetBeans in
NetBeans nothing tape and so this is the
deep space exploration tool and so what
this is useful for is for mission
designers to say okay I have a mission
that's going to go to Saturn no the
people don't go to Saturn they go to the
moons of Saturn okay I need to go to
Titan Titans the people who sort of
Titan the moon of Saturn right and now
why would somebody want to go to Titan
it's it's interesting it's got an
atmosphere it has oxygen and they're
discovering geysers and where there is
oxygen and where there's motion and
friction and energy is life and so one
of the things we might want to do is
send a couple probes
one probe might be a photography or
imaging type probe we want an elliptical
orbit another one would be a sampling
probe the life sampling organic sampling
the two trajectories do not look the
same
hey Sean I don't think you were supposed
to tell everybody that there's life on
Titan yeah well
supposed to keep that pledge hush well
if they send me there won't be any life
on Titan
I'll put me negate that either bring a
light flashy thing to yeah so here's a
screenshot I'm gonna get to in a second
but as you can see it's a very data
dense environment that the analysts are
thinking and in their heads and the
trajectories is a spirograph thing going
around that those are some of the
chaotic trajectories that we actually
are looking for when we want to sample
life
feel free to chip in all right so what
we have here is and I've only got a
couple minutes so I'm gonna have to run
through it it's completely custom
ground-up development we've got a little
controls FX action going on over here
and we have a blank slate I'm going to
open up some data it's gonna be a group
of very dense grid of data hundreds of
thousands of points we're gonna load it
in a custom canvas node get to look at
my desktop oh we call it your open end
game because the original that when
you're trying to acquire a trajectory
that's called an end game getting to
where you need to be however all the
data we have was a Saturn and Titan so
you know okay so it's gonna load here in
a second all right so 100,000 the data
points like that and ironically the
first time you load it on the canvas
node it takes that long but all
subsequent loads are lightning fast no
matter how large yes question out of the
box Java fix task it's that simple
really although there is a little
platform run later stuff going on in
there - yeah right so that you can so
that anytime you make a change to the
actual GUI it doesn't lock it doesn't
block the yeah do it I was there another
question no okay so okay great we got
all this data now what does this mean
well let's see here let's turn out in
central body okay that's a Titan and so
the reason the analysts look at the data
like this is because they're looking
they're taking slices of the
three-dimensional trajectory space
looking for these islands of stability
here and if anybody saw Michael hoppers
demo I can't wait to get my hands on his
whole weighted contour demo because I
think I can use that here but we want to
see ok there's these islands of gravity
stability here gravitational stability
so now let me see let me learn a little
bit more about that here so these are
all the different types of trajectories
that are existing here and I can maybe
constrict this and it's reducing the
trajectory space oh I just lost my
trajectory it's going that the island
stability is gone let's uh let's let's
slide over to where I think it might be
here all right so this gives me a good
idea I want to be somewhere in here okay
all right all right that's cool let's
reset okay let's go over here and here's
a trajectory brush and tool that created
and the whole point of this is each one
of these points is one of hundreds of
points on a trajectory and there are
thousands of trajectories in just this
single slice so I want to know okay
based on these points here yeah okay
five minutes all right
based on these points where are the
other points in the trajectory so I'm
gonna left click drag okay so what it's
done is it searched the entire data
space which has been sorted using the
out-of-the-box Java collection sorts
binary sorts and binary searches I mean
to find those points so now I know okay
these are the points that I would expect
to see on this trajectory so let's go
and draw those trajectories and I switch
my mode to point selection
I created this targeting reticule again
this is all Java FEX and what you might
see if possibly in the back not button
up in the front you see a little white
dot jumping around I'm gonna click it
finds those points it passes those at
that information to what's called a run
cut an integrator seven eight with a
step size 0.01 it then integrates it
the equations of motion for that gravity
model and though that is your trajectory
lightning-quick no other tool exists
that can do this right now okay great we
have an elliptical orbit but you know
what I just got done saying we can't use
an elliptical orbit we need something
that's more chaotic so where might that
be well I see this maelstrom of points
closer to the surface and it's colored
in a really scary green so maybe that's
a chaotic yeah that's pretty chaotic all
right but you know what this might work
because there's many many passes that
overlap and so I'm gonna get many passes
across the polar areas where I might
have the geysers okay are we done
no because I need to see this in 3d is
this really gonna work this is where
Java and Java effects a payoff because
we can have it all on the same scene
with just a few more lines of code these
are my trajectory as I just found here's
my chaotic one I'm gonna render it bang
we got it in 3d now there's Titan and
there is the 3d trajectory in space
let's zoom in we had some first-person
controls
oh we got an issue see the trajectory
it's cutting into the side here we got
the let's see here
Senko thank you all here cracking mayor
yeah the these are some some long time
ago somebody mapped out the surface
features of Titan with some van you know
fantastic names Xanadu
alright so okay cool but you know what I
want to look at it from different angles
so I'm gonna right-click and snap to a
cutaway and I'm gonna make this separate
scene here and I'm going to look at the
same trajectory and now let's zoom out
and these are these are separate
independent cameras looking at the same
job effects 3d scene do it again I'll
keep going you're not gonna stop me
all right pull it over here now let's
get a really zoom Boop yeah right there
you go
and using a first-person controller now
it should be noted that this 3d line
this polyline 3d is not out of the box
of job of X 3d
I got that from a an open-source freebie
library 3d how that's funny
I should use a 3d library called F X Y Z
same with these cutaways okay
so let's go and add that other
elliptical there it is now it's a mess
see how it's a mess remember I told you
it's a mess it's a mess alright so it's
hard to see you're a mess yeah but
notice how it also updates the other the
other views and so obviously you could
add your own custom controls to zoom
those in nicely and then you could close
them if you want so now what I see here
as an analyst ok I'll close with this
what like what I see now what I've
achieved through a combination of of
advanced canvas nodes and Java fix 3d I
know I went from data space to data
selection to data visualization and
validation all-in-one workflow ok
that's the last of demos they were
impressed with that yeah
were there any questions on that last
demo question you and that's a good
question so he wants to know can you
filter out the trajectories well we
don't in that tool yet but as you saw
with it with the sliders I'm able to
filter out on so it was an arbitrary
other variable and so the plan is to add
controls which what that's called it
what that in the orbit determination
well that's called event handling and we
can filter on events so we don't but we
could we still a book the questions
anybody yeah questions wants a book
should be rapid-fire questions
okay so the question is if we wanted to
add animation to have some sort of
physics type thing what thing in Java
effects would we do well what I would do
and what I have done is use they have
you want to use a time line I think and
a time line will allow you to set up
frames you and with each frame you want
to perform some calculation and then
update a property just some property and
then when that property is updated and
then you define an invalidation method
and that would change the scene so
theoretically if your timeline is fast
enough you get that nice pure animation
and bonus it adds a built in
interpolation so you can ease into one
end of the interpolation ease out or
both or none you have complete control
over that and you're talking like six
seven lines of total code it's so easy
yes
they call me no no no okay so so careful
that this is a mission design tool which
is not being used by the operators is
using ba it's used by the subject matter
experts so this is so sometimes it's
called a pre phase a tool or a phase a
tool and typically they'll use it either
to define a mission so that they can get
funding for the mission or they'll once
the fundings already been allocated they
say okay this is how we're gonna do it
and not go over budget and so typically
they already know what trajectories they
really want the tool like this tells
them exactly which to which trajectory
it would be and then what's necessary is
that that trajectory information needs
to be passed to what's called a full
force model which would then tell them
the exact maneuvers necessary to have
that exact trajectory the Delta B's and
that's a very hard problem and I was
showing that next year at JavaOne
mission mission support like any other
project has a life cycle to it start out
with the concepts and the idea is the
scientists gonna say hey there's some
things I'd really like to study and the
only way I'm really gonna be able to
study that it kind of oh okay well but
so some of these tools that you've seen
here are from various different phases
in there from the analysis and design
that's a great idea but can we actually
do it these kind of tools help decide
data all the way into operations and
ultimately disposal like anything else
okay a couple things these resources and
valuable okay invaluable the NetBeans
platform for beginners great way to get
started it's a lean pub so every time
they make updates you get it JavaFX
eight introduction by example I happen
to know a guy or two that worked on that
it's great a lot of great examples a lot
you'll see you'll see some of the stuff
in there that that we did demoed here
and chop effects rich client programming
on the NetBeans platform is an advanced
in depth run-through of how to use Java
effects in the NetBeans platform to have
the best possible applications you can
make and finally write your Congressman
do we really need another f-35 how about
we go to Mars
alright you Europeans write your
Congressman
all right you Canadians write our
congressmen tell them more of this less
of this all right
any more questions you'll have to meet
us in person because we're getting the
stink-eye all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
