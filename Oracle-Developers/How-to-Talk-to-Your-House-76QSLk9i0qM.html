actually going to start by telling you a
little bit about Silicon Valley robotics
so I have our website up it has a couple
of things rotating to on the slides that
I want to talk about before we get on to
the rest of the talk and it just may
contextualise some of what I'm saying so
Silicon Valley robotics is a fairly new
organization and we formed as a 501 C 6
which is a nonprofit industry group with
the goal of supporting innovation and
commercialization of robotics
technologies why did we need to do this
and why do we need to do this in Silicon
Valley interestingly enough robotics has
got quite a strong reputation in Boston
and in Pittsburgh and there is a little
bit of a history there both of those
centers had strong growth but they also
had strong regional identities and they
had regional redevelopment funds there
was a lot of push to reassure
manufacturing and to support industries
that existed there that were under
threat they had top class research
institutes they had a couple of
signature brand companies but when i
came to Silicon Valley four years ago I
was curious as to why there wasn't a
Silicon Valley robotics because there
are actually 10 world class with
robotics research institutes here not
just one or two or three when you think
about it we have several national
laboratories we have several top-tier
universities and we have a couple of
special-purpose laboratories so that's
one thing we also have a very strong
investment community we have a very
strong software community we have a very
strong startup ecosystem and I'm going
on i'm fairly certain that there should
be a fairly strong robotics community
here because why wouldn't there be and
that's a great timing think of the
history these are photos of shaky
world's first electronic person now
shaky was a project at essar I before it
became sra international i think when i
was still stanford research institute
and that's well over 50 years old well
maybe it's 50 years old shakeys now in
the Computer History Museum and in many
ways the sophistication of the system
then has only just being replicated
reliably in the real world now by
robotics and silicon valley itself is
built on hardware infrastructure so when
I came here people are saying yes but
there's robotics companies here but no
one wants to fund them there's no
venture interest there's no they can't
grow but when you looked at the figures
that was actually wrong so one of the
reasons that we are probably the largest
robotics cluster in the world but it's
also been a long time before we've
developed an identity is because
robotics here happens in every single
vertical and it happens in
commercialization and companies that are
busy trying to sell are really focused
on being in their particular vertical
they're not focused anymore on being
grant supported and networking together
so much so when you looked at the
figures there was actually more
investment going into a wide range of
robotics companies here then they were
in one or two signature companies
somewhere else and the first company
that I saw was restoration robotics I
hadn't heard of them before what they do
is they repurposed I think they used a
cuca arm I might get that wrong though
and they do here plug transplant and
they got a 40 million dollar investment
round and I went Wow who knew but that
kind of reflects the very very nature of
robotics in the valley and those
companies that we have cover mobile
robotics they cover autonomous vehicles
they cover see robotics space robotics
we have groups like NASA and sr I who
are doing really advanced research ditto
Bosch and
we have groups that are doing drones a
whole heap of stuff there we have a lot
of surgical and health robotics we have
consumer robotics although that's a very
very small section we have manufacturing
industrial and logistics robotics we
have computer vision we have software
the open-source robotics foundation
supports and maintains Ross and we tick
the boxes pretty much across the board
so anyway I came here four years ago and
I said robotics there's more here than
anywhere else in the world and why
doesn't anybody know this and foolishly
some of the companies who founded
Silicon Valley robotics looked at me and
said you know Andrew do you want to do
something about that and so I'm managing
director now stand still for too long in
this town and you've got a job so that
was a little bit of a this is Silicon
Valley robotics and I'll just while I
fiddle around and get my powerpoint up
some of the things that we do and
honestly the most important thing we do
often is just to have that website and
to be a central point of communication
so that robotics companies can maybe
find a way of contacting other robotics
companies recruitment networking events
journalists can not just keep asking
that one company for what's happening in
robotics that can be exposed to a range
of different companies so that
government policy advisors so that
people from other strategic groups and
organizations overseas can connect in
but we certainly do a lot of that
through putting on some network events
and we also do investor forums because
we're very focused on helping grow that
ecosystem out of researching into the
real world and recently for example we
co-hosted the robotics industry
association collaborative robotics
workshop that had people from all over
the world the heads of all of the major
industrial robotic
companies and the new field of
collaborative robotics which is
industrial robots working safely with
people that's a whole interesting thing
we had that on Tuesday and people from
cuca and ABB and some of the automotive
companies a really great collection of
people from all over the world coming to
San Jose to have this workshop and for
me I was very keen to expose a lot of
the other people based in this area to
this sort of high level understanding of
what was happening in the robotics
system the IFR has just released
statistics on where robotics ears and
for those that don't know industrial
robotics is 15 to 20 times the size of
the service and personal robotics sector
so people talk about it's slow growth
but it's also the elephant compared to
the mouse still so we're trending along
the spectrum towards consumer-based
robotics but it's a very very long way
off still or that's a very small area so
what I like is that we do cover all of
those areas we also had the UK
Technology Strategy Board bring eight of
their top robotics companies out to do a
little visit San Diego to San Francisco
to meet research labs and other robotics
companies and network and we had a great
network event because the Brits paid the
bar tab and it still hadn't run out by
the ends of the night which for a
robotics event I don't know you know but
all of us know that robots and beer
there seems to be something that makes
them go together we have a monthly
network event that we call box and beer
and it's just really casual but one of
the first things that I see whenever I
go into a robot lab somewhere is people
say oh I have a look at what our interns
did over summer we taught the robot to
play pool and it fetches beer
okay back in Sydney where I come from
the Australian centerfield robotics
actually has a periodic table of beer on
the back of the lab door so you know the
number of research papers I've seen that
relate to robots and beer it's really
quite stunning I think we have a strong
nation in fact here's a shameless plug a
young roboticist I know works out of bot
&amp;amp; dolly studio doing i has anyone seen
keep on the little yellow dancing robot
you'll see them in Toy Stores but
originally it came out of Georgia Tech
is autism research he also has a
sideline brewing beer it's called dirty
robot brew so robots and beer what can I
say and the one final thing I say is we
do this fantastic event every April in
national robotics week and it's the big
robot block party it's a free event we
had last year 40 different robot
companies and groups exhibited and for
me this is really dear to my heart and
we actually think it's probably the best
robot event in the world is because it's
about the entire kind of robotics
community which is in some ways still
quite small we have kids in FIRST
Robotics showing off their robots we
have new startups with things that we
haven't seen before we have advanced
research from NASA and other lab and
Stanford we have commercial giants like
intuitive with their da Vinci system we
really have a kind of smorgasbord of
just about everything that's going on in
robotics and it's just a celebration
it's a science fair on steroids it's
just come and see this is what robotics
in the Bay Area's about and it's to
celebrate national robotics week and the
reason that there's a national robotics
week is we all know that we're facing a
terrible stem shortage and robotics is
considered the gateway drug to STEM
education exposed children as young as
possible to the idea of robots it's in
some ways it's it's it's tangible it's
interactive it has this real kind of
pull
towards doing more physically oriented
engineering things and computer coding
and all of those other areas where we
need to be skilling the 21st century
workforce so I'm told that a national
robotics week is actually the very last
federally mandated week of anything that
there's going to be because the calendar
is too crowded as they fine they stopped
with a good one now how many people were
at the keynote today okay I'm just going
to pass around this book then to keep
you in today because I'm sorry we're
going to start from the same place that
the keynote was but we are going to take
it further away and in that's really why
I wanted to say here's a little bit
about my background here's where I'm
coming from and I'm going to really
continue to talk generally about
robotics and about I call it human robot
culture because usually we just focus on
individual relationships human robot
interaction or human computer
interaction but the reality is that if
you can't develop a technology idea that
has a use in the real world that
technology is just going to catch dust
on the shelf there is something about
understanding how your how technology
and culture intersect that is critically
important and that's really why I'm
involved with Silicon Valley robotics
and now moving along on the ground and
in the air robots robots everywhere up
in space and beneath the Seas did anyone
catch that shout out to james gosling
and liquid robotics by the way yeah I
thought that was pretty cool they know
their stuff robots make discoveries
robot tractors plant and plow there is a
great company in this area called Blue
River technologies if you're interested
in robotics in agriculture but usually
it's the drones robots even milk a cow
and we come back to that because that's
my favorite robot application ever
robots paint and weld and blast robots
build cars really fast and you've seen
the book now it's going around it's
really great it's really realistic as
far as the things that robots do and
it's not very realistic as far as what
the robots are because all the robots
look kind of like us and we know why
they look kind of like us because that's
what we imagine we are so conditioned to
look for human and animal shaped objects
and to see them in anything that has
movement or the shape of the face how
many of us have found faces in all sorts
of things like toast yes a lot of
studies came out of Stanford from
Clifford NASA's research lab talking
about things like how we behave when you
put eyes on a rock and there's the
famous donut experiment where a poster
with eyes is put above the donation tin
for the donuts and all it takes is eyes
on a poster to double the amount of
money in that donation chin so that's
not conscious this is just the way we
work so I talked a little bit about some
of the other examples dogs chase balls
and they know that it's not dinner but
they just can't help it's fun it's part
of our biology I chase balls to call it
soccer but you know hey has anybody seen
an animation film that is I think it's a
triangle and two circles and they're in
a box well it actually starts there's
two circles outside and there's a
triangle in the box
and the circles look like they're having
quite a good time they're moving around
then the triangle comes out and goes
around the circles and then one of the
circles goes back and the triangle goes
back in the Box and you can see that
triangles pissed off that circle didn't
really want to be going back in the box
and the other circle is like oh come
back come back and then this up the
little circle on the outside zips around
the box a couple of times the circle on
the inside mopes in the corner and the
triangle stands by the door and then the
circle on the inside creeps around the
back a little bit and then the triangle
moves away from the door sokol makes a
getaway meets up with the other circle
and they're really happy and they race
off and we all got that story movement
two dots a triangle in a box an entire
story I mean movement is such a part of
how we think and so when we imagine
moving machines we're filling in all of
those blanks and we're embodying them
and we're giving them agency we want
them to be things that we interact with
we like them being playful and you know
another example of that that Heather
Knight talks about is when a leaf falls
from a tree it's just a leaf it might
have caught our attention but we see it
as an object but when a leaf falls and
the butterfly flies past all of a sudden
we saw a dialogue and an interaction it
might have been random but we created
this idea of a conversation of an
interaction that just happened and we
attributed agency to that leaf it
happens so quickly moving on we know
that we are evolutionary and emotionally
have a frame of reference which means
that ordinary robots really just outside
of that
and ordinary robots are what the
majority of the world's robots are so I
think the little humanoids there maybe
10,000 of them in the world today don't
quote me on those figures but I have
seen the international federation of
robotic statistics for industrial robots
and they say that there are
approximately one and a half million
operating industrial arms probably over
the last 40 50 years we've sold two and
a half million but we'll assume that
they have a certain operating lifespan
and then think about what's happened in
the consumer drain of space okay who has
a drone 23 okay in this room alone three
people have drones for sorry I have one
okay think about the the penetration of
that technology Chris Anderson talked a
lot about how drones were trending
towards the consumer and there was an
incredible pyramid where at the top you
had million-dollar machines and there
were only one or two of them in the
world and then you kept going down a
level and he was saying wait till we
have ten dollar drones that are
disposable or what about when they're
one dollar and are totally disposable
and they're very small and look let's
think about that a little bit more
because we kind of come back to that
area right now drones they're a bit of a
trouble spot they are too available for
what they're good at okay so what would
you do with the drone what do you do
with your drone
okay you know you're playing with it any
real estate agents here want to use it
to take photos of your house to film to
you know make films to record sporting
events what about to watch the practice
who's baseball or football game got
buzzed by drones what about just go hang
out at one of the national parks the
things that people are doing with drones
are all of a sudden opening up some
problematic areas in terms of a whole
heap of things privacy commercial
privacy and particularly safety so we've
had a couple of incidences where drones
have fallen out of the sky or
potentially gone across flight paths or
hit people and the more of them that are
out there the more likely it is that
these sort of accidents will happen it's
one of the reasons the FAA is being very
very slow about bringing in a regulatory
structure in the US they're trying to
avoid a lot of problems but of course in
being very slow to introduce regulations
is itself a problem and where Chris
Anderson thinks this is going is this is
a problem when you have drones that are
this big it's definitely a problem in
the drones of this big they hit you on
the head that's a bad accident this
drone if it's got plastic propellers it
might give you paper cuts more or less
maybe it could take an eye out but you
know as long as you were avoiding the
carbon-fiber blades you probably ok but
when it's a little pocket drone has
anyone seen Nick see is one of the
designs people are starting to design
little drones that can sit on your wrist
little dragonfly kind of creatures and
if that hits you it would have to be
very very unlucky for it to be doing a
lot of damage and maybe the sorts of
things that it can do become also
qualitatively different ditto when they
get down to this scale
and a dollar apiece so it's hard to
create regulations based on a technology
when that technology can go through a
heap of changes like that yet
fortunately our our policy structures
look at things like privacy as abroad
thing it's not technology-based and by
and large we should be looking at
legislating that way and I'm getting
away from our main subject but I know
you saw the keynote so I don't want to
say the same thing here who's got a car
that's a robot pretty much everybody
here has got a car do we think of it
that way no but I talked to some of the
people building autonomous vehicles and
they say you know hey and you're just
letting you in on the secret you're
driving a robot already I save yeah but
it's not autonomous and they say well
actually under the hood it's pretty
autonomous you think you're putting your
foot on the accelerator and telling it
to go what you don't realize because
it's happening pretty quick because
going will I really no not now no not
yet no okay I'll do it now but it works
so we're happy who wants Rosie the robot
made from the Jetsons yes who doesn't
yeah but the reality is going to look
more like the house and I think that's
very interesting because how do we
interact with our house we're living
inside a robot and that is outside of
our emotional frame of reference so I
think one of the interesting areas
moving forward is the idea of the social
user interface and we're going to come
back to that how do you talk to your
house what are some of the issues what
are some of the problems there
you all heard the bitch thing okay who
remembers the show okay so just for
everybody else she's a witch she falls
in love with a human why does she say
okay the only thing I want to do is live
in ordinary human world and never use
magic that seems like such a bad deal
yet I Dream of Jeannie the same thing I
mean I guess the excuse there was that
she was a genie and he found the bottle
and therefore she had to do everything
that he said but Darren and Sabrina
really so the thing that struck me
because I went back and I watched the
1964 episode and this is 50 years ago
today where she enchants the house I was
going to talk more about that later but
you know let's talk about it now Darren
breaks his leg and he's laid up in bed
and is he a good patient no Sabrina
could you fetch me a pencil Sabrina
could you fetch me another pencil
Sabrina I forgot what I wanted to ask
you of course she's downstairs doing the
hoovering mopping the floors washing the
dishes running up stairs all the time no
baby monitors then right so eventually
she starts sending things up by magic
now that whole episode snowballs into
something else completely which becomes
a kind of power greed trade-off thing
and then finally they both agree to go
back to having no magic and a perfectly
ordinary life in an ordinary house and I
didn't really enjoy that part of it
terribly much what I wanted was
inspiration about what a magic house
would do I thought what was the
imagination of the 50s when we were
setting so many of these templates for
what we were going to do I mean so many
roboticists are inspired by the science
fiction of the 50s so what from this
program in the 60s without worrying
about while it won't be able to do that
because it wouldn't be able to navigate
in that kind of environment
mentor you know that's going to be
pretty hard for the sensors to detect or
you know that's going to be a changeable
environment and those chair legs will
never get around or you know the grip is
not strong enough to do that a lot of
times these days robotics gets focused
on what the technology is capable of
instead of the big vision about what
would we like it to do so what did the
magic house look like and it was
actually really boring the windows
opened in closed and Darren could call
out and food and other things would
float up the stairs to him that was as
good as it got you know actually the
rest of the time in episodes when
Sabrina occasionally got help with the
housework when she did the little no
switch and suddenly the dishes or dried
themselves it was still a bit like
beauty in the beast it was still this
invisible person doing the job rather
than the sort of process that we
actually have houses have changed in 50
years I looked at that and i realized
that i have Sabrina's magic house in so
many ways now we still need something to
pick up socks and to change the laundry
but I talked to roboticists about it now
has anyone seen the video of PR two
folding laundry it's a very popular
video because I'll just figure head to
the housework slide it wasn't in the
original presentation so it'll be fresh
for you let me say pr2 is a $500,000
robot it was developed at Willow Garage
which was one of our founding member
organizations and the goal with the pr2
was to provide a standardized platform
for robotics researchers because when
every single research lab builds their
own robot then you have very bad science
because it's not repeatable and it's not
transferable so to speed up development
of the field standard platforms a really
good idea so this was a very
sophisticated standard platform and it
has gone out to I believe 12
universities worldwide and forms the
basis for some interesting research at
the University in Berkeley
Peter a bills group did laundry folding
and they had a video that has got
something like billions of the
impressions he says one of the secrets
for doing this he thinks is that when
you do it I think Steve cousin said that
actually there's something about the way
you imagine these look like giant monkey
wrenchers arms on this big silver
hulking Robbie the robot thing picking
up corners of the towel folding it over
folding it over folding it over and then
it puts the grip is down and it does
that now apparently that particular
motion is the most viewed most go figure
but it just captivated our imaginations
the thing that most people didn't
realize is that you just watched a 30
second video of a robot folding a towel
reasonably well sped up 16 times so I
believe that each towel was about a 40
minute job for a $500,000 robot so
that's not a household appliance coming
anytime soon and that's where the people
that are responsible for that are
thinking about it in a different way
saying why would you have this mobile
armed manipulating robot until these
arms and grippers and mobile bases are
incredibly cheap that's not the way to
solve the problem why do we have a
separate washer and a separate dryer and
a separate ironing place why don't we
design the machine where it's all in one
and I think there are washer dryers that
no not such a new thing we just needed
to add something else now maybe what
that means then is that I'm willing to
hang up my dirty clothes if they come
out of the other end of the cupboard
clean so we have an entirely different
process and that's where i was going
when i said to reimagine the household
robot we really need to reimagine the
house
and see it as a machine and not as an
invisible person doing the same things
that we do in the same ways I mean I
think humanoid robots and the whole
trend we have to anthropomorphism is a
trap because it makes us want to build a
machine to do a job the way we do a job
and that isn't the best way did anybody
watch any of the DARPA Robotics
Challenge it was on December last year
it'll be on again june next year and
i'll give you a little brief history
about that the DARPA Robotics Challenge
is traditionally aimed at taking the
research problems that are 20 years out
and bringing them to 10 years out so
that they then become appealing as a
commercial prospect to other
institutions and corporations the
example of that is the DARPA autonomous
vehicle challenge the first one was held
in 2004 anyone know how many cars made
the finish of the desert Raceway 0 okay
the first star / autonomous vehicle
challenge 2004 zero cars crossed the
finish line they r e held that
competition in 2005 and i think 13 did
this is significant improvement now this
was a desert environment so they decided
now will give the team's two years to go
away and improve and we're going to do
the next one in a simulated urban
environment and simulated it was done in
an army base so it was not public in any
way but there were things like curbs and
roundabouts and parked vehicles all the
sorts of normal street trappings that
you'd have and I think in 2007 there
were actually two tracks there were the
funded research labs and there were all
the other people that we're developing
their own takes on it and were self
funding their entries into this I think
there was of the order of 30 teams
competing more or less and at least two
thirds of them were able to make it
through you know just a huge number more
and then google bought the top teams
several of them are we detecting a theme
here yeah so 2007 2011 we do have
self-driving vehicles going up and down
the 101 the Google self-driving car
which has taken a lot of the advanced
players in that DARPA challenge and it
actually started to turn it into
something that was really happening now
of course all the major automotive
companies are also really far advanced
in this particular area but would it
have moved so quickly if we hadn't had
that type of challenge so post-fukushima
there was a call for another DARPA
Robotics Challenge and the goal of this
challenge was to do disaster scenario
response we all know that if a valve had
been closed in the first 24 to 48 hours
of the nuclear reactor problems then
there wouldn't have been the problems I
think people died to try and fix the
situation and everybody said where are
the robots isn't Japan the most advanced
country in terms of robotics research
where are the robots now as an
antipodean I've also been through a
couple of disasters in Australia New
Zealand including the pikes river coal
mine disaster where maybe 20 30 miners
were trapped a couple of miles
underground methane explosions no one
knew all of a sudden there's collapse
there is no word and people wanted to
send in robots to get them out and you
go well that's really not going to work
you're too far out of communication
range it's a flammable environment there
are actually all these really difficult
reasons why that's not going to work
we've had the
mh370 plane go down you know why can't
we send in a robot to find it there are
still so many things that you'd think we
could send a robot to do we can send a
robot to Mars and yet there are still so
many places in situations on earth or so
many tasks but it's very difficult to do
so the DARPA Robotics Challenge many of
us call it the humanoid challenge why
because the job is to do human tasks and
that's as an interesting thing about the
form factor that SPECT there's the
number of teams involved changes at
various times in the funding cycles but
let's say that proportionately speaking
eighty percent of the teams that are
entering in this have a humanoid robot
there were three teams that specifically
nasa/jpl was one of them and Carnegie
Mellon with chin maybe one other that
explicitly said we do not want a
humanoid form factor we want a
four-legged robot that can operate
equally on any particular axis on two
legs or on four legs and has a much
broader body reach or the tract robot
for example where tracks are far better
than a bipedal robot for almost every
task except in climbing the ladder but
the reason most of those robots in these
situations look human is because they
are being our proxies doing human tasks
in a human environment so the tasks
involved driving a vehicle it involved
clearing debris from a door it involved
opening a door which is surprisingly a
significantly difficult thing if you
think about it in the wild how many
different ways do we have of opening
doors it's a massive problem it involved
climbing a ladder it involved operating
a power tool it involves turning a gauge
or tab probably a couple of other things
in there anyway the robots are very very
slow at doing it it takes them about a
half an hour to do any one of those
challenges
and by the time the DARPA Robotics
Challenge ran for the first time in
December and believe me it was boring I
tried to watch it from Australia on
video stream and every time I turned
around there was a robot and then the
feed would break up and I'd have to kind
of try and get back online and get back
in and they'd be a robot it was gripping
live television but by the time that
challenged the first DRC challenge came
google had already bought a good chunk
of the teams and in fact a lot of them
have withdrawn from the competition
because they're now in part of google
research projects so to me what that
says also is there's an acceleration
happening in some ways last time google
waited for the third iteration of the
DARPA challenge three years before they
started throwing their money at the
team's this time they were in ahead of
the first challenge but as Gill Pratt
from DARPA says that really the robots
you have to understand robotics compared
to human we're at best an 18-month old
toddler in terms of what a robot can do
in the environment and when it looks
human we often assume that it can do a
great deal more which again is the area
i'm going to keep coming back to in this
somewhat revision of this morning's talk
i am a great fan of this phrase because
this is where i think we need to look at
the result and results ought to be
considered like magic something that are
separate from the technology so that
you're less constrained by what you
already know dozen doesn't work or how
to go about doing it and we're less
constrained by our anthropomorphic human
biases to how something should be done
you know surely if we consider the first
could it be done as if it was done by
magic and what is the result
and then let's reverse engineer from
that instead of being what as Rodney as
one of the speakers this morning said
you know when you're a hammer everything
looks like a nail or as Rodney Brooks
says robotics isn't so much a technology
problem anymore it's a business problem
and I very much agree with that at this
point I need my glasses on to read my
notes theoretically this is how we used
to talk to machines and then we
introduced a lot of more sophisticated
gadgets particularly clocks a very
significant addition there may be some
steam cables gears wires please levers
and clocks and a lot more clocks and
then we built something like this this
is the first punch card operated device
and if anyone is familiar with it it's a
jacquard loom and i'll throw in a little
bit of history i meant to look this up a
bit jacquard created his version of this
in 1801 but the actual first punch card
loom dates back to 1725 and in between
there were three or four people that put
their stamp on that technology including
Jacques to fork and some around 1741 I
actually have that written down now
apparently evo concerns loom was fully
automated and he's one of those mad
roboticists that always got into a bit
of trouble I believe perhaps he
originally had a lab at a monastery and
he had to leave town in the middle of
the night because when he created
androids to serve dinner it was
considered to to someone high up in the
church they suddenly went this is the
work of the devil so he had an
interesting history then he went on to
create automata for their
heads of society and one of the famous
French writers said that Vulcans on stop
is the pinnacle of glory of France okay
has anyone seen 24 cancels duck I love
it in terms of the biological
inspiration that inspires robots where
he created a duck that effectively it
and shat and we believe that he
pre-loaded the intestines but the duck
walked and quacked and at food real food
and then delivered real poo at the other
end we think that it was probably like
an interns job to put the duck poo that
there were two separate bladders inside
but not many people got a look at the
insides of his doc he created another
couple of more sophisticated beautiful
automata as well but then he went
sideways and he created the loom that
was fully automated and again he was run
out of town because he was putting
school workers out of a job and I
believe this is the point at which the
term sabotage was coined because those
skilled workers war sir bows or wooden
clogs and they used that to break the
machines so this is one of the early
Industrial Revolution hot points so
devaal cancel on created the fully
automated punch card loom in 1741 but it
didn't really come into popularity until
jacquard made it a semi skilled task I
believed a Vulcan swans version only
required a donkey for power whereas
jacquards version required an operator
to run the punch card machinery and that
was considered more acceptable and we
can see where that's going this is I'm
pretty certain this is the difference
engine and possibly the Computer History
Museum up
they do have an exhibit that includes
some of the things about Charles Babbage
but if we know Babbage's history he took
seventeen thousand pound from the
British government and several years to
build the difference engine that was
going to revolutionize calculations for
anyone that was doing navigation we knew
that that was a significant problem this
incorporated a printer because the
transcription errors from getting well
calculated results to putting them into
the tables the typesetters that was
considered one of the bad points the
thing is he never actually built
anything because he had a vision about
what he wanted to build and he didn't
understand that the government just
wanted some results so they would have
taken any of his half good versions but
he had some really good ideas and
partway through developing the
difference engine he actually traveled
to France and he saw the shakaar he saw
the pre jacquard no he saw the post
jacquard looms his or punch cards in
operation and he went that's a great
idea because if you know how the
difference engine worked you had to
actually set each column of gears and
then that would in turn inform the
operations of the next columns and the
next columns but you were still at that
give me a wrench or a spanner stage of
operating the machinery and then he saw
punch cards and he developed the idea
for the analytical engine which we all
know that if he had ever managed to
build it would have been the first
computer the first working programmable
machine with memory and Ada Lovelace
would have been the first computer
programmer and indeed she was because
she did actually write the programs for
the machine that was never built and
what is more than that she saw more
clearly than anybody else the
far-reaching vision of the analytical
engine just how much it could do she
said we can manipulate more than just
figures with this we can manipulate
symbols and if we can manipulate symbols
there is nothing else that we cannot
manipulate through this machine she was
predicting an all purpose
gene and then their work languished they
were well ahead of the time but other
technologies so for example the punch
cards became used for census
calculations and we have telephones
which spread across electricity and
telephones spread so incredibly rapidly
it's I believe something like a ten year
period from no electricity to across all
of the US and really this is just pretty
pictures so I'll move quickly we had
switches and levers and then we added
sound and we added more things in we
added punch card keyboards and this is
the early computing days and I just
pause and take my hat off here to
Douglas Engelbart and the mother of all
demos has anybody seen the mother of all
demos yeah ok back to really pivotal
people in the history of computing and
robotics by extension Ivan Sutherland
1964 design sketch pad which is the
first 3d CAD program he started doing
graphical manipulation on computer
screens Douglas Engelbart put together
and his team put together over period of
some years pretty much every single
thing that we call modern computing and
the internet and they demonstrated it
live in 1968 in a 90 minute demo that
involved remote locations connected by
early internet and it all worked and in
that demo they gave us the computer
mouse they gave us hypertext they gave
us graphical interfaces they gave us
dynamic data links they gave us
multi-user cooperation
some people I talked to say that we
haven't even managed to achieve all of
the things that angle Bart's Mills
system actually demonstrated 1968 90
minutes it's broken down it was
videotaped and it's broken down into you
know six or seven video clips and I
thoroughly recommend it and just as
another little homage a Douglas
Engelbart died in 2013 and inspired many
people I'm a great fan of XKCD who
always seems to understand why
something's important and also all the
rest of the stuff that is accreted
around the edge because why I'm
interested in robots sorry just cutting
to the side here because I saw what
happened with the internet this
wonderful promise these anonymous
democratic technology that was going to
do so much to unlock data for the whole
world and we put captions on cats I
thought okay the robot revolution is
coming how do we keep a balance between
doing all of the really fantastic things
in the world and putting captions on
cats which we know is going to be out
there and if anyone tells you that
there's no such thing as a sexpot they
are lying so again this is the period at
which the graphical user interface
really started we haven't left that but
we are starting to so the technologies
of the 21st century are removing us from
this keyboard and mouse based
interaction from the touching tablets
and swiping to the interactions of voice
and then there are all of the other
modalities that we face and it doesn't
always work well I'm kind of
moved ahead of the slides so we'll just
kind of leap through as a little aside
for this one there is a book called the
illusion of life it's not a Disney book
but it is by the animators that were
responsible for many many of the major
Disney things and anybody who does
computer human interaction or human
robot interaction has heard of the
illusion of life because it's an
encyclopedia of all the techniques that
you use in animation to create the
illusion of life and that's
fundamentally all of the ways in which
we know that we are inspired to interact
with things now there's a lot of
neurological work that can back up a lot
of the things that the animators new in
the 1930s already so the good and bad
news for that is that there's a lot of
people out there working on this and we
would like it to look like that but the
reality is not only does it not look
like our science fiction future it looks
like our connect but it looks like a lot
of things that we're not aware of most
of our advanced computer human
interaction is being done by major
retailers working out how to sell us
things better that's to me a kind of
scary thought but I'm just focusing in
on the connect here because to make this
scene work that as developers have to be
able to understand who is the active
participant in this scene and if you
think about it how can you determine the
difference between that pillow that
person those other people those other
pillows that couch that window that
share that dog and how can you work that
out for every single house the scope of
that problem is enormous and the fact
that it has been solved reasonably well
is one of those watershed movements in
terms of human robot interaction and in
terms of the affordability of a sensor
for robots but for me it's just the
starting point of where we're going to
run into problems talking to our house
because if it's that hard to work out
who's the active participant in one's
section of your house in one context
which is entertainment how do we think
we can translate that into the rest of
what is the most complex diverse
environment that we have going the house
is the hardest problem to solve does
anyone have a nest thermostat yeah yeah
did anyone get a smoke alarm okay well
they were recalled and they have just
gone back on the market one of the
features the smoke alarm promised was
the ability for you to turn it off with
a wave if it went off and that was a
very hard challenge for them to to to
meet okay has anybody gotten any of
those crowdfunded rfid tag tracker
finder you know lost your stuff put it
on your laptop or your phone and it
pairs with your phone and you can find
it I am such a sucker for a lot of early
tax stuff on crowdfunding sites my
closets are full of those things and I
use them for a week and that's it I'm
their beta tester and often they just
don't get past that because they keep
unpair that every time I want to go find
something it's actually it's unpaired
and even worse because I could live with
it not working what I don't like is the
nagging that happens all of a sudden my
phone starts going beep beep beep on my
wallet does and I'm like what what what
what oh you're complaining because
you've lost your pair
you know I have other things to do right
now just get over it so we reach all of
these nuances about context about what's
critical information and what's not
critical information and this is where
the wave feature turned out to be a
really really critical one if your smoke
alarm up there on the ceiling starts
going we've all had that at three in the
morning usually right and then you have
to work out which things beeping and how
to reach it and does it want a new
battery or does it just want to be
bitten into a pulp I don't know how can
it tell me I don't know what it needs I
just wanted to shut up so yeah it makes
a lot of sense to have this feature that
says okay I can wave and it will say
okay I'm going to shut up now I know you
heard me but the problem is we make a
lot of gestures like a wave for a lot of
reasons and it turned out that people
were waving oh yeah hi bring it over
here put the cat down and the smoke
alarm was turning off not when it was
supposed to be turned off so that's a
critical safety issue and i believe they
fixed it but it may be at the expense of
that particular feature that turns out
to just be a little bit too difficult
and this is where i wanted to get into
the more speculative aspects of this
everyone's house is so different and
it's so personal and many of us will
have systems that recognize us maybe
we're really uber geeks and we've got it
so that as we drive home it triggers an
if this then that and it sends off
something and our stereo starts playing
and the doors open and we've got our
house really customized like it's many
people's goal but what happens when your
cat sitter is in your house for two
weeks well the simplest thing would be
just to turn off all of those
customizations because it's really
really difficult to fit another person
into that highly personalized system
and if you think about it when we get
into highly customizing our houses and
making them really personal what if
something goes wrong in the house okay
every robot that I know that's out there
in the wild today has an emergency stop
button on it and often they have other
people around them with pendant devices
the ability to say stop is super
critical and when it's one object in
front of you you can have that big red
button and hit that emergency stop when
it's distributed around you how are you
going to do that okay well we've already
seen what happens when you try and wave
that's not so great what if you were to
say stop you know we can see where this
is going and it's not good stop beating
up the cat ah stop looking at me like
that I don't know there are so many ways
that we can say stop so you have to be
really good at understanding the context
or we put two people into the equation I
say turn the music down no I like it
this way stop we're going to get into
that u-turn No u-turn No u-turn No
u-turn who's in charge of the house how
does the house man does the house set a
priority so that I only you know here's
the order in which I listen to you say
stop how do we fight that one out but
then let's say stop is a bad word to use
there are all sorts of situations where
people adopt what they call safe words
because they're in some role-playing
situation acting of some kind and you
know that stop is part of the script so
you have to have a different word
watermelon I'm never going to say that
normally so that's my secret stop word
will train the house because you know
what we don't want some intruder coming
into the house and disabling the systems
because it not everyone knows the
password don't worry it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 or
its password
okay so can you imagine what it's like
if your house can be controlled by
people saying stop or password so no
ours is going to be watermelon but then
you have your cat sitter over or you
have your friends over for dinner and
you know you fall over in you're knocked
unconscious and the houses I don't know
what it's doing maybe it's some part of
this accident behavior does your friend
know that the safe word is watermelon so
can we start to build in something that
is immensely personalizable and
contextually sensitive that perhaps has
this hierarchy built into it it's kind
of like a you know a last pass but for
your household controls only I don't
know that that would possibly work would
you be up to date all the time what if
that one person you haven't put on your
roster yet can you start to get a smart
system that will extrapolate while
they're on your facebook and they you
say that they're a family member
therefore let's give them x privileges
you know we are starting to reach into
this realm of social user interface
where we might be expecting context
beyond context that we've given okay I
can tell you for a fact I expect that
kind of context from my maps and I'm
really annoyed that we don't get that
yet I think for example Google Maps and
I think our ball maps was doing that as
well I actually have to say home I set
that I went to the trouble of saying
this is my home yes this address it's my
home by definition that is a place that
I go to frequently do I need
turn-by-turn directions to my door I
don't think so how many times I mean
first off I told you it was my home and
by definition my home in some place I go
to a lot second off if you were at all
intelligent you would have just added up
the number of times I went there and
would go maybe you know I've told you
how to get there 50 times I think you
ought to be big enough to find your own
way how about I make navigation
conditional
how about I have the option to maybe set
okay you can tell me when I'm on the
freeway because that might be useful but
the moment I'm off the freeway let me go
because that's usually when I'm
listening to an audiobook or am on a
phone call and then all of a sudden I'm
interrupted every block for turn left in
50 liters so we haven't even reached the
point of getting that kind of
interaction seamless which should be
absolutely within our reach we're now
throwing in so many different devices
into the mix in so many different
situations with so many different
modalities of interaction I think it's
going to be utter chaos these guys are
adding to the complexity but they're
also contributing to the context so this
is a slide from a company called
Geppetto avatars and what they've got in
this demo here is their beta for an
asthma management system and it does
emotional recognition and if you heard
bruno mess on year from older baron
talking he talked about now and pepper
and they're built in emotional
recognition and we know that major
retailers and some of these other sites
are working on being able to recognize
emotion your devices have cameras those
cameras can be used to look at your face
and work out things like are you happy i
unhappy there are a lot of points that
it's picking up on the face it's doing a
mapping over here it's also contextually
sensitive so it's saying this is the the
pollen readout and we know that you were
in this area you are at high risk right
now of an asthma break out so it's being
an early interventionist and it's
mindful that this guy is actually kind
of pissed off that once again his days
ruined he's not going to get through
work he's going to feel you know it's
not going to feel so great
and there is some scripting for pros
atty a lot of it is being pre done but
there is nonetheless some recognition of
his emotional state in what parts of the
script are being given to him to help
him deal with the fact that he's got to
spend the afternoon inside and not go
out and play you know football with his
kids now this is one of the uses for the
good but the moment these technologies
are out there we know that they're going
to crop up in all sorts of different
places so this is one more thing being
added to the mix I think we are leaving
the graphical user interface and we're
reaching the social user interface where
we're putting together a lot of
different modalities of devices and
while that is much more like what we
would call the natural user interface
the way people normally communicate it's
also raising so many problems that for
me I prefer to call it the social user
interface because the very important
part about this might be the dialogue
it's not so much about us telling the
devices around us all the time what we
want but the device is telling us what
they understand and what their intent or
the next action is because we're very
good at working around if we know what
that machine understood and what it
intended to do next so I've got my
slides jumbled now older Barons pepper
and the now they are working on
emotional interaction just like Geppetto
is and there is one problem okay the
pros and the cons with this I actually
think that we might have little
household robots that are humanoid to
help us control the house because we
look at these devices and we make much
better assumptions about what their
intentions are because they are
mimicking us so all we have to do is
make them mimic
in ways that they're communicating to us
things like are they alert are they
paying attention or about to take
actions and can we use that to help us
interface better with all of the
different devices that are around us I
think it's going to be necessary because
we have too many different devices with
too many modalities of input and I think
we need these machine translators the
downside with this have we heard about
the uncanny valley okay the uncanny
valley is a cognitive dissonance effect
and there's now a lot of neurological
research validating that it is a real
effect otherwise called cognitive
dissonance and what it means and you
can't just simplify it to say well that
particular robot is triggering our
uncanny valley effect it's too close to
human and yet it's not and if you've
ever seen HRP for one of the Geminoid
that's this one over here it is too
close to human because it doesn't move
well and it triggers this kind of
cognitive dissonance in the same way
that corpses do but it's compounded when
things move or when we become accustomed
to them then we lose that some of the
impact of the uncanny valley but there
is still nonetheless an absolute
neurological underpinning to it which
means we may never be able to completely
get rid of it so perhaps we don't want
to throw our bets on to the humanoid
side of the robot thing perhaps we want
to keep our robots looking somewhat
childish and cartoon like and clearly
telegraphing the fact that they have the
capabilities of an 18 month old child at
best
which is probably the best place to
leave it and ask are there any questions
yes I think so not necessarily in your
glasses you could have tablets placed
around and that's what Geppetto avatars
is working on I believe their tagline is
creating the hearts and souls of robots
but they're starting as an avatar
creator were there any other questions I
talked a lot longer than I thought I was
going to so thank you for being terribly
patient and letting me and it was
pleasure especially</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
