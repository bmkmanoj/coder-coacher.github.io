native micro service development
workshop in this workshop in this
particular lab we're gonna have you
assume the role of our project manager
Lisa Jones and as the project manager
the first thing you're going to do is
start a new sprint inside the sprint
you're going to build the agile board
that'll contain all the features and
tasks necessary to complete in this
workshop and last but not least you're
going to initialize the sprint to begin
a process we're gonna actually sign into
the Oracle cloud in this case we're
going to sign into a traditional cloud
account and our identity domain is
located in amia we'll enter our identity
domain location they're provided to us
by the instructor or as part of our
cloud account how long with the
credentials to login as cloud admin now
the first thing we're going to do once
we log in is customize our dashboard in
this case we want to scroll down and
select the developer cloud service and
make sure that that particular service
is set to show on our dashboard we'll
use it throughout today's workshop next
drill into the developer cloud service
and we're going to do this in a new tab
just makes it a little bit easier to
navigate as we go through and we're
going to create a new project we're
gonna use a singular project called
alpha office product catalog project
throughout our entire workshop for the
workshop we're going to start with an
empty template and we're going to select
markdown as our documentation format
inside our workshop we're gonna go to
our issues tab well we will begin
creating several new issues to support
actions we need our various developers
to take
to create an initial get repository for
the Twitter feed service
we're going to set this to be a task
we're gonna assign it to our cloud admin
and then we do this simply so we don't
have to log in and out a bunch of times
as different users and at the bottom of
the page we'll give it a couple story
points click create issue and now we're
on to our second new issue when I create
a filter on our Twitter feed data this
time our type will not be where it's
going to be set to feature once again
our owner will be cloud admin and we'll
give it a couple story points
all right feature two is in place now
let's go on to our third issue we're
gonna create a micro service to allow
the product Claro with catalog data set
it as feature do the same thing for
cloud admin along with their story
points our final issue it's going to be
to create the Alpha office product
catalog UI this will be our front end on
our various back-end microservices once
again this will be a feature assigned to
the cloud admin with a couple story
points now that a project manager has
created the various issues it will
tackle inside this workshop we're gonna
navigate back to our left hand menu and
we're gonna open up the agile tab inside
the agile tab we're gonna create a new
agile board to host these particular
issues okay
now we can create a new sprint inside of
the agile board
now we're gonna simply drag and drop our
task and our features that we created
earlier as individual issues up into our
sprint and we'll ask but not least we're
gonna go ahead and start our sprint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
