vinicius participates on the Java user
group since 2001 so very old member of
the group this is the third the 13
javaone he's participating and it I
remember as it was today the first time
we have our talk approved here 2004 2004
were crying so happy to have the talk
approve it here so now it's 10 year
later there there was a seven years in
the career where he was giving java
classes on java for oracle and sun
education we founded a company called
global code which is a training company
and also an event company we do organize
a big conference in brazil color the
developers conference we created a home
project now we can change it to Jay boat
project instead of that we update it for
things API project so we tried to make
it brother than it was with the genome
project we got the Duke choice award in
2011 of course we always had james
gosling doing some internet of things
before the name but it was one of the
first Internet of Things project we had
here at javaone if we don't consider
james gosling of course a little bit
about myself we have been doing lots of
things together I got an indication for
java champion some years ago and i am
alternate member of the java community
process executive committee so the place
where we discuss the future of all the
java specification requests so that's us
this is the place where we live ubatuba
is in the between some Paulo and Hugh
Janeiro very good place to stay so
there are 82 beaches around very good
place for sale so if we want to trace
this route from here to there so here
well about the way is right here where
we have MQTT message is coming from here
to here is just to have an idea about
the distance and sometimes hear the
people ask me where is Brazil so it's
better to be sure that everybody knows
that is in South America
and here is the place where our boat
leaves colored sakoda ribeiro very nice
and protected place for boats and so
this time the boat is there and if you
want to go to brazil if you have to go
to brazil please drop us a line and
visitors in yorba tuba we will be happy
to to you can slip aboard in our boat
this is the our house extension for
special guests will be monitoring your
sleep yeah take care we do there because
we'll be making pictures and everything
so that's our email well but serious if
you go to Brazil drop us a line and save
some days so you can go tuba tuba we
have more than a hundred different
beaches there so it's a very nice place
for visiting and Brazilians are very
open for people that are traveling so we
have our devil so Java folks so we are
going to make a very short introduction
about sailboat is a big privilege to
have a slide at javaone introduction to
sail boats and so and we are going to
talk about our first hacking that we did
in the past with our sailboat and we are
going to show our gateway that we are
running in our boat the things power
gateway and we are going to do some
demos present some videos here and
fortunately today the weather in Nova
tuba is totally raining and and it's
late night now so it's very dark we
can't see too much from our boat alive
but i have a friend he is in yuba tuba
with a clone of this panel this is my
panel we are producing for we call as
automation hacking panel we have here
raspberry pi jam out to arduino sensors
and everything so we have the same thing
running in our bolt in our friends house
and also here locally so we have three
different panels running all around the
world
and up we are going to have some time to
show code and make up a key way so we
have other experience with automation
automation is very generic you can do
home automation guard and automation
both automation cut automation industry
automation so I think that automation is
the very basis of of international
things actually home automation is maybe
the oldest type of project for internet
your things so it was international
things without this name and so we have
different types of experience with that
and here when we are talking about home
automation we are not talking about
having a product that you know will do
the same thing for every house and we're
not talking about that but we are
talking about solving your own problems
so if you're your problem is a cat no he
went to feed we have those industry pool
internet your things you can have legacy
projects like when you have a very big
machine and you want to connect into the
internet and so this is a profile of
project the people that are trying to
make some money with IOT like startup
projects we have the industry projects
but here we are talking about which or
self project solving problems so this is
not a product this is something that you
can replicate and you can use our our
code in your boat if you want you can
collaborate with us so here is the very
high level architecture of a sailboat so
we have all the parts here the mast
these days and the backstay the front
the head stay and the boom that hits
your head all the time take care with
that and this is the life aboard the
life aboard something amazing here we
are working and deployment testing our
stuff in our sailboat so is amazing life
aboard and if you don't know how to say
you you can learn by this geek way say
Oh XCOM so you can go there that an
account and it start sailing so you will
understand the concept of a headwind and
up weed downwind jives and things tax
and things like that so I like this eox
but I actually love to play the volvo
ocean race v12 of ocean race it's a
crazy thing you just get addicted
running a v12 hey gotta where you can
you can compete with thousands of people
all around the world so I used to wake
up in the night to change the boat
direction and things like that and you
feel like sailing a beautiful sailing so
it's amazing wait wait it's 2am I'm
going to turn the boat yeah that's it
put a lance to turn the boat because you
know you have to the virtual race with
the real weather conditions so it's
amazing because the same condition that
the racers had in his boat you having
the vehicle regatta so once you have a
forecast you know that you will need to
change the boat direction because the
wind will change the direction and so
you need to wake up in the sometimes
wake up late in the night to change the
boat direction and don't pop tune don't
lost positions so about a little bit
about our sailboat is up very simple you
don't need to be rich to have a sailboat
in Brazil the people link very much
boats with rich people but it's not true
is the price of one car and it's a 32
feet cruising sailboat with a very low
speed but you can go far away and it
doesn't consume too much fuel so it's
very with some with 20 liters you can go
very far because the engine is very
simple ways at 13 HP engine and the most
important information from for us is the
battery
we have two batteries with 93 m / amps
per hour I'm hour and we have solar
panel and we have to water pumps in our
boat and for those that doesn't say or
doesn't know a lot about boats water
pump is a very important thing inside
the boats is the way you make sure you
don't have your boat full of water yeah
it's taking out the water this is the
first thing that we look forward to
monitor because when you are saving and
the water pumps start working sometimes
you have the engine turn it on and you
cat least into the water pump so now
since we have raspberry pi Ronnie in our
boat the Raspberry Pi monitors the water
pump and can tell us water pump is
working so we have a voice system a
text-to-speech system in our boat and
our boat can tell us what is happening
so you don't eat you all the time check
and with you if the water pump is
working or not in our last week we
really had a problem with the water pump
we were cruising and we expect you to go
to huge an arrow but the weather was not
good so I decide to stop in an island
and once we stop it we were using the
the engine once we stopped I I listened
to the to the water pump working once
okay no problem and so in 15 minutes the
water pump start working again and I
said no Donna something is wrong my
water pump used to work two times per
week and it's working for the second
time in less than 30 minutes and so I
went to the to the behind of the engine
and we have a big big water flow coming
to our boat so and I notice I said oh I
need to monitor the water pump
immediately this is a very danger if you
don't if I couldn't least into the water
pump
working i really could have problem with
my boat and sometimes you you are away
from the boat for one or two weeks so or
more or more and then you cannot hear
the water pump so especially the water
pump it's very good to monitor remotely
remotely like receiving messages and and
since we have raspberry pi running we
can we we don't have yet but we can have
really is mark things running side like
our boat can know out in the last month
i just trigger the water pump four times
and fun and now i'm figuring the water
pump each day so the boat can can have
these intelligence and try to to help us
so here i have one video of our first
hacking we did i bring the equipment
here is very old project i have we have
the automatic pilot this guy here the
black guy here the automatic pilot you
just put the heading that you want to go
and it will make a correction correction
sir you are going today yeah and so when
you are cruising far away and long long
term cruising you don't need to have
someone just giving the direction in our
in your board so the automatic pilot is
very important instrument and
unfortunately or not when they our
compass inside our automatic pilot just
stopped working and i say who now i can
open my automatic pilot and hack and so
I I did this another project here we
have a bluetooth module we have a gps we
have compassed and we have our AG bridge
to drive the motor is a very simple DC
motor inside the automatic pilot and
through the bluetooth i connect using my
android phone and i haven't right app to
keep the boat in the same direction and
i could also use this little mirror to
change the direction which is very good
so if you are sailing or you are
cruising and is
raining a lot or a storm you don't need
to go outside should change the both
direction so it was the very first
hacking we did let me show you the video
here
haha
can you open
yes and when we think about this
automatic pilot for those that doesn't
sail you need to stay there and pay
attention and it's some very time
consuming you need to stay there and you
cannot miss 30 seconds otherwise the
boat goes to a totally different
direction so this automatic pilot is
very important and the mechanics on that
it's not very complex if because we are
just pushing and pulling that the thing
is amazing because is a DC motor without
any kind of feedback from the DC motor
and I don't know how the English is an
England automatic pilot and I don't know
how the code for that is perfect even
without the feedback they don't know how
much they push sure that they forward
the the arm but it's very big precision
so now I am building another one much
more robust with stepmother so you can
control how how much you forward the arm
so then our new automatic pilot will be
much better in this case the mechanic is
very simple because it's just one motor
but the code can be very complex because
we have the water flow that comes in a
different way and they're under the
current no you wait the waves so in
terms of math that it's needed to be
able portion how integral and derivative
the PID it is very hard yes very hard
because you you just make a PID that
works perfect with no weed and so when
it starts winning the same the same math
that you put inside just stop working or
you don't don't work so good and another
thing is that testing it's very complex
as well right you need to go out like
seven why you want to test this
do what some volunteer and here yes so
we are using the raspberry pi b plus we
are using Arduino we are using gemalto
concept board right over there we've
came out us board please so we have
camera Wi-Fi out your system we have
many different sensors and we have 3g
two different 3gs i will explain later
and we are using Java Sea and bedded
tomcat and MQTT and we are using pi for
j and things api for our boat here is
the architecture so we have the Arduino
Arduino is very important because
Arduino turns on the gemalto concept
board the jamaat oh i didn't find a way
to make the the module turn on
automatically you need to press one
button power start and so because it
came from the phone and so you need you
to press the power I didn't find a way
to do that automatically so maybe I
don't have the knowledge and kind of new
to gemalto also i start hacking the boat
with Yamato for java one actually and
they are doing you know so this
architecture is very nice because
Arduino is very low power consumption
and Arduino manage the low-level devices
and the high level devices so the
Raspberry Pi isn't turning on out a time
we just turn on the Raspberry Pi some
periods of the day or Arduino njm auto
concept board they can monitor the
sensors and if something is going wrong
so Arduino njm auto concept board they
can turn on the Raspberry Pi because the
raspberry pi is a plug it in a relay
that is controlled by Gemalto concept
board
so we have both system here the low
power and and the Raspberry Pi that
doesn't consume too much but it's not
good idea to have raspberry pi running
all the time in the board so is a hybrid
solution based it on the pi PI power I
think that they have a Arduino board
that do that you can schedule when you
want to turn on and turn off your
Raspberry Pi they use our Arduino with a
real-time clock to do that and so here
we have the Raspberry Pi and when we
have the Raspberry Pi we have the
complete a 3g internet access so is the
best situation and we also can turn on
the Raspberry Pi and give to grass berry
pie new software and we can remotely
update everything in our sailboat
without going there so it's amazing for
continuous deployment for remote
continuous deployment in this kind of
environment and that's it but one thing
when we are talking about this project
we there's something in common to
several other IOT project which is the
energy restriction when we are talking
about animal monitoring environment
monitoring and in this case both
automation we are talking about having a
very limited and restricted amount of
energy so here we have as he told the
solar panel and the boat batteries and
try to make it the solar energy makes
the batteries awake every day so the
battery doesn't die yeah and actually we
are monitoring the current that that is
being consumed by our devices and the
batteries are also being monitored so if
we see that we are running out of
battery we can turn off everything and
save the battery for the boat because
the is very important to have the
batteries for the water pump so you
don't want to run out of the battery
total
or we have two batteries and we can
manage that actually this is a very new
architecture that we did for our
sailboat and we are like now just
playing with that and we don't have
everything we can do much more with this
and the battery monitoring is another
very important thing because we never
know when the battery is going to die
and if you are traveling and your
battery doesn't work you have a huge
problem on several aspects o monitoring
the battery it's very important and
using some sensors yeah it can help so
long I can have a lot like the sensors
we had a GPS we have a distance sensor
that can tell us if someone is near from
some part of the bolt the read sensor
that can detect if someone just opened
up the door from our port every time
someone open the door from our boat we
can like turn on Raspberry Pi and take a
picture if you not us that is inside the
boat we can know who is there or the
boat can tell something get out here so
we have gas sensor this is very
important sensor also because we have
gas for cooking and you don't want to
have gas in your boat we have IE freret
sensor so we have a rim a very simple
remote control the old-style remote
control with low batteries that you can
turn on and turn off the stuffs presents
camera temperature humidity koonet
voltage and water pump we are we have
all these sensors available in our
sailboat and we are going to show some
of them working here yes then the gas
sensor it's some very security thing
because we use those small tanks of gas
and the lots of time they are old and if
we are there we can easily feel that gas
has a problem but if we are not there
it's totally impossible to know so
yes sensor is very useful yeah and since
it's a boat is the same price as a good
car you don't want to save money you you
say everything that it will be it will
make my boat safer I want to have and
this kind of sensors they are very
unexpensive and as actuators we have the
relays LEDs automatic pilot and the
system that speak with us we are using
this software colored espeak is an
open-source very good for Raspberry Pi
in support many different languages and
I will demonstrate here this this guy
and so we did a talk about architectures
for international things and we listed
out of the available boards and we
choose Arduino gemalto and raspberry pi
because we have in Brazilian market so
like a keyboard dragon the latter kim p
they are awesome but we don't have how
to buy that Inn in Brazil and we like to
use things that everybody can buy it's
very it is not good when you show
something to developers I have but you
don't have and you will not have because
you don't have in Brazil so we like to
promote things that the people can have
can buy is affordable and everything so
here I have another video about gemalto
just to show the basic concept of Jamaat
oh
hey my friends that's the call for fun
IOT with Java and Jamal tokens on board
implementation so this prototype is an
IOT fan so everything you need to do to
turn on your phone is just a call so in
this case I'm using my cell phone
simcard in the Jamal toes board and I'm
cutting my board so let's wait oh here
we go we turn it on and we can cancel
the Kali and okay so this implementation
is very simple one we have here a
concept board we have card and we have
here a relay board and this is the
battery that is powering the concept
poor because this port is very nice and
useful for IOT implementation because
you have Java me embedded inside and you
have power saving features you have / dr
provisioning and updates and you have
everything that you need to make a real
IOT implementations now let's turn it
off cutting again my concept board so
just call my number here we go is very
fast
here we go we just turn it off we just
need to call the the secret is the
number anyone can call me and turn out
and turn off the cover fan so so the
idea is you can receive calls you can
send my SMS messages and you can use the
gemalto concept board to transmit data
using 3g GPRS connections and we are
migrating everything that we were doing
with arduino we are doing now with
jamaat oh and maybe some in some weeks
we will have a java application with
MQTT client Soulja motto will be able to
send out the data from the sensors for
us using 3g connection so so if there is
the need of using a 3g connection then
the motto is a one of your the best
option that we have our days and we are
looking forward to take it out our
teetering connection our Wi-Fi router
because it consumes a lot of energy
that's the reason why we did we don't
leave the Raspberry Pi turn it on all
the time and as protocol we are using
rest and Emma qtt meq TT's a protocol
much more for things and the rest is
much more for humans so we are mixing
both protocols and having really good
results with that please raise your hand
if you are have listened or tested and
anything with MQTT ok great well this
source code is available in our github
if you want to check our sauce source
code our power gateway that we are
running side our portal you can clone
our get another nice to that we are
using is Arduino makefile Arduino mq
the Arduino meq allows you to update
Arduinos without the Arduino IDE MQM MK
MK k sorry mq agra MQTT MK was confusing
and the arduino make file easy arduino
make file allows you to update arduinos
so you can have a raspberry pi with an
arduino and so you can send your new c
code remotely and use our doin m ki m
key to update the firmware so we have a
continuous deployment in our or say
about including the femur because
updating arduino firmware remotely is
not easy is not something easy to do we
if you even if you have like a Ethernet
shield Wi-Fi shield you need to figure
out how to do that and using both
Raspberry Pi and Arduino is a very very
nice partner I always like to use
Arduinos because they are stable
everybody knows about it you have many
libraries okay is a C code is a sim is
not C++ is see more or less and its
sequel but it's almost java if you look
at that code and you think that is java
it is java without virtual machine so
you can write code and what I am Telling
is you don't have the virtual machine
but with your knowledge java knowledge
it's very easy to write Arduino
applications and so and they just
announced that that are the support for
arduino here in in java one in last
year's arduino was kind of hide behind
the scenes and now we can say I do in
Arduino doing or doing and this this
continuous deployment it's very
important as some of you were seen
miniatures just did the deployment 259
yeah watch me in as one minute one more
before starting the thought I was sorry
deploy I need to do a new deploy now so
he just I'm working I'm very excited
with this project so every free time
that I have I start coding and making
new things and see if work or not so I'm
very excited is that which are self
project if you have a fair no problem
the important is to bow to be not to be
under the water not a submarine yeah no
it's not a submarine so here we have
this panel install it there just for you
to see the the audio only so here we
have the cheese you sailboat and here we
were testing the GPS module the gas
sensor gemalto and everything so it's
very nice is not a since we are working
all the time it's not fixed set in our
boat we can go there and just leave the
panel there and if I need to make some
figs or install a new sensor I can take
it with me so it's easy to wide up
everything from our boat to the panel
and we make it this way to make it easy
to give maintenance but the future maybe
we we find someplace to leave the exit
yeah yeah and so now I have another
video here I'm very sorry because the
video I'm linux user and this is the
only the only the only situation that i
miss my macbook my mac notebook because
i couldn't change the video i could ask
for a friend but sorry and we hello we
are hitting our safe board to
demonstrate i'll see like the job
automation panel and our hacking so we
have this is mark boat using different
boards here we
have raspberry pi with camera gps and we
have many sensors like gas sensor it
can't detect when the water pump is
working and many other things that we
can we can check remotely so we have
behind it but the panel we have the
Gemalto concept board and some relays
here and so Jim Otto can take care about
the basic sensors reading the sensors
and communicating the data using the 3g
communication and Gemalto can also
manage the Raspberry Pi so Gemalto is
managing a relay board and the relay
turns on and off the Raspberry Pi when
we want to use something more powerful
we can send a message to our gemalto
concept board and Gemalto will turn on
the Raspberry Pi and so we have all the
things like cameras and a local
processing we can do with raspberry pi
so Gemalto is turning on out of time
here in our sailboat and if we need to
do something like logging many data to
the cloud computing are some some
database or some business intelligence
we can ask choose Yamato to turn on the
Raspberry Pi and raspberry pi can do
this process we also are using the
Yamato to turn on the Raspberry Pi in
raspberry pi can receive new updates so
we have a kind of the continuous
deployment running locally here in our
sailboat so it can publish new firmware
for Jamal 24 hour drina's or for our web
server and we kind of did a home double
using just the web and so we can avoid
coming to our boat to update our
software which is not good it's much
better to come here
update here luckily because we are here
in yuba tuba and this is a very nice
place and this is the the very big a
good thing about working with
international things because now we are
here in this nice place working so look
here is the most important equipment the
BBQ that's my lovely job and so sorry
for the format of the video now I'm
going to make some demos and we have
here the panel this panel is a it has
different types of sensors and you can
see here in my cell phone let's wait a
little bit we will receive a message
MQTT message this is the MQTT client and
we're supposed to receive each 30
seconds a message from the panel and
also from the boat let's wait a little
bit okay we have here the panel this
panel sent at the port st. also so we
can we can see here the boat gas 76
temperature 24 humidity 46 that distance
7 prisons arrow and co-head almost
nothing that we are consuming so now I'm
going to try to talk with my friend that
is there and he will put something in
front of the gas sensor to make the
valley increase so just one minute sm4
MQTT it's more like mq server message
queuing so we have a nap here on the
phone where we inform what's the server
and what topic we want to follow and it
starts sending these notifications for
us so it's a very decouple way
of receiving those messages from the
boat so the same way JMS was helping a
lot on the Java EE space MQTT might be a
good technology to be used it on IOT
when we need this kind of serves to be
monitoring something instead of the
asking do you have an up-to-date what
the temperature and all that we just
listened that that topic so that's why
we are listening the boat and the panel
so now now my friend is there and he is
putting something in front of the gas
sensor we supposed to have here the gas
boat gas the number should increase
let's wait a little bit and see if work
so it's very nice to do that remotely is
a lot of emotion let's wait a lot looked
at the banner no no no no pen on a boat
yes yes we have here gas in the boat 400
so now this is the real sensor changing
in Brazil alive during the talk and
working and really working and now what
and how the guy is happy with that and
are we supposed to have the presence
changes you want also he's working the
presence once so my friend is in front
of the panel so it could detect the
presence of him and up what more to take
pictures to take pictures and we are
great to do something different here yes
and another interesting thing from the
MQTT protocol is that we can receive a
message but we can also send a message
yeah MQTT is like the JMS for things so
to take picture I'm going to ask for
this panel to take the picture
so if you can put more light for us
please just because the screen here was
so a very dark picture just he's saying
oh 400 okay and now let's put in the
Twitter and I'm going to ask you this
panel to take the picture to ask that
will ooh we are going to see ya yes they
will not see just tell here yeah I will
say panel / actuator had the message the
message picture picture yeah so let's
look like taking picture in free too
long I took a new picture so this is the
voice of my boat so it can communicate
with me waiting new picture let's wait a
little bit just in picture at here we go
you cannot see that if you can you guys
turn off the light a little bit just to
see the picture you okay so so you can
follow my iop gadgets and with my my aug
gadgets i am using these accounts to
communicate with my devices and so the
code is a is not hard code we have here
MQTT sensor publisher the sensor
publisher is a timer task the timer task
is running each and seconds actually i
just configure for 30 seconds and what
we have here is we are using the things
api the things api is our API to promote
the integration between
things using uart communication or I
square C and so here it really take the
valley from the from the Arduino thinks
dot is a cute in things manager ftdi
which will be a / debit / TTYL us busy
rule is where they are do you know the
part from Arduino and we are taking the
alcohol you immediately distance prisons
and this is for this panel that we don't
have too many sensors here and it will
make the message and sent is very very
easy to use MQTT we are using Eclipse
abajo if we go to the sand mas'r st.
method we are just creating the message
and publishing so it's amazing because
MQTT by some way has the ibn involvement
and is amazing to see I was thinking
that how imma qtt should be complex
should be like Korra or something but
it's amazing to see how easy is to work
with a basic em acuity tip and so to
take the picture we have here the
listener the list and are waiting for to
take a picture and once it received a
message picture it will take the picture
through the camera tech take picture and
this will trigger runtime process here
is out cold here we will trigger the
runtime the rasmus chew it will ways
acutely resist you we don't have any
kind of api for java to work with
raspberry pi camera so here we are using
a comment line the same thing to make
the audio system so the audio system i'm
using espeak and i will try to make
another message
I am sending to the panel the speak
hello java developers hello John with
email address so it's a cute ET message
go to the broker and a broker just speak
what I'm I want to choose to do and the
having a day out your system in
raspberry pi something that most of the
people use Raspberry Pi and they don't
take advantage from the outer system so
remember the outer system is very
valuable just install sudo apt-get
install espeak and you have this
software in your machines this amazing
you can do robots that communicate is a
very nice way to give feedbacks to your
user and here we have someone in uber
tuba that helped us to take care about
our boat since we are very busy and we
can't go there every week to clean and
everything so his name is Jo and now
when I'm planning to have something that
I can leave voice message to hire like
oh please a give a special attention for
this place or fix this fix that and I
can just say oh I'm going to say you
tomorrow so she ideas you go to our boat
every day so once he opens the door he
can list it out they are coming tomorrow
let's prepare everything and buy some
ice for me and things like that so my
friend in the audience was just asking
if you have every tried something
colored mobile phone why we can't do the
simple way if we can do the complex way
ah there life beyond mobile phone is Jim
not too too much more fun yeah yes it's
a synchronous message which phone are
good are you going to use iphone is not
java android this java but is not
so MQTT much more fun java we can
approve our talks all around the world
about that so now we have some time for
Q&amp;amp;A if you want to to ask something ask
about some sense or exchange some
experience with us we have some time for
that come on please one question here
have you experienced using the sea talk
bus she talked boss no no no oh sorry
another question
yeah I'm taking off the power but what I
do is every time that I like I take a
picture I used to do a pseudo sync they
come the command sudo sync to dump
everything to the SD card so after I
start doing that I never crash at my SD
card anymore never never well more than
one here that I never crash at my SD
card anymore yeah yeah because we have
our experienced several experience we we
did a smart helmet for two guys that
they are investing in this Jesus mart
helmet for bikers taking pictures
automatically and dumping to the SD card
and in this helmet we had a lot of
crashes and you we start doing that so
every time I take a picture or I do
something hard in terms of Io I type the
command sudo sink so this is the the
solution that is really working very
well for us so I could try to make
something more sophisticated down
the Raspberry Pi but since we are not
having problem is turning off this way
the up actually I have a voltage
regulator so I have a 12 volt battery
and I am using the ube see you bees the
regulator 45 volts with three apps and
very stable and this regulator is from
RC models very popular this voltage
regulator so it is very smart way to
regulate so it will not heat it will not
transform the result of the voltage
regulator is not heating the like a the
7805 used to do that so you usually when
you are regulating with 7805 you used to
lost a lot of power and an energy but I
by the process of regulating using the
UPC is much better for for that so but
I'm unplugging directing to the into the
pins 55 old pins yeah okay it's a bird
it's a blackboard that jump and make
like to he jump and Mac make backflips
36 yeah it's amazing blackboard Jobson
well not our choose when we turn old
boat when we but when I got the ayah and
since this boat that our last board the
name was very strange and we rename the
boat even having other things out if you
remain rename bad things will happen
they have this in mind but the name was
that boat doesn't have any kind of
history before and we we buy to reboot
the boat and we rename it and the name
was hello word it was nice for us but
people that were working they were
what's that
yeah hello world so it was our first
boat so it was kind of hello word board
in terms of being our first board so
here is Robert savage from a pie forge a
project so he worked a lot with
professional automation and if you have
some question about pie party you are in
the right place thanks for coming again
Rob okay thank you everybody for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
