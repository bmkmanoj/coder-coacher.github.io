Toronto I'm Bob brew Bart with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
yet another interview with one of the
session speakers from today's event and
that session speaker for this segment is
Dan koloski dan welcome thank you Bob
happy to be here so give me a two minute
version of your presentation today well
what we're talking about is we're
talking about how we're using machine
learning to revolutionize the systems
management and security approach that
enterprises take so the session is a
technical session about tuning machine
learning and how we take advantage of
some of these new capabilities to enable
people essentially to get ahead of the
curve as they've managed for performance
and availability or work on securing
their applications now in your session
you talked about various types of
machine learning that are particularly
well suited for the particular
environment what characteristics or
unique qualities make those types of
machine learning particularly well
suited well so let's start by
understanding the problem that we're
trying to solve because the thing about
machine learning is that it needs to be
purpose-built and tuned to answer
questions that you know you want to ask
so when we think about managing for
performance or for that matter managing
for security folks in the network
operation center and the security
operations center are dealing with a
constant deluge of data tons and tons
and tons of telemetry data information
about performance and availability
information about what users are doing
etc that they need to analyze and that
analysis has traditionally been reliant
on human brainpower to figure out what
it all means so what we're using machine
learning for is essentially to sift
through these mountains of data data
that's contained in very voluminous logs
data that's contained in thousands of
metrics and config information and
telemetry and we've optimized machine
learning to look at that data and and
answer questions that we know we want to
ask questions like hey is what I'm
seeing normal is this abnormal so is
this enough an anomalous set of behavior
or is this a normal set of behavior
should I care should I pay attention to
the symptoms that I'm seeing questions
like what are the pattern
that I'm seeing in this data that I can
remember the machine learning can
remember going forward so that next time
I see it I know this is a warning sign
that I need to pay attention to and
actually prevent a problem instead of
just reacting to it so the types of
algorithms that we tend to use in Oracle
management cloud or anomaly detection
algorithms we do a lot of clustering
which are pattern recognition algorithms
we do a variety of multivariate
correlation algorithms which take all
that data that we're tracking and allow
us to understand how it moves together
and how it moves apart so that again we
know when we should pay attention to
what we're observing or what we are
observing represents a problem and then
based on all that analysis we use
prediction algorithms to say here's what
might happen tomorrow based on what
we're seeing today so that we can
actually prevent problems instead of
just reacting to them what's your role
at Oracle and what kind of trouble do
you get into there
I have a son role at Oracle so my my
group makes all of the management
solutions from Oracle so that includes
Oracle management cloud which has a
suite of seven services application
performance monitoring infrastructure
monitoring log analytics IT analytics
orchestration config and compliance and
security monitoring and analytics so we
design cloud services both for the
traditional Network Operations Center
the folks who are keeping things running
keeping the lights on in terms of
performance and availability as well as
for the security personnel in the
Security Operations Center in the sock
who are dealing with very similar types
of data but looking at it from a very
different lens and so we produce all
these cloud services and essentially
purpose engineer machine learning so I'm
part of the development organization
that builds all those so what's on your
calendar where will you be talking about
machine learning next well we love these
code events because one of the
differences in what we do versus a
generic toolkit is that we've taken the
time to optimize the machine learning
for the problems that we're trying to
solve and that's the central message of
my talk at code which is that you can't
just sort of say I'm going to slap some
machine learning on something and say
I'm done right because machine learning
out of the box is not actually very
smart it needs to be purposed tuned and
optimized to answer the types of
questions that you need to answer so we
do a lot of talks of these code events
which are great you can see information
on Oracle management cloud in a lot of
local Oracle events we do a lot with
user groups I'll be in London next week
dealing with a customer summit over
there where a lot of customers come to
Oracle and tell us about what they're
trying to face so we try really hard to
to understand what it is the customers
are facing and again in these particular
two markets and functional disciplines
of security and systems management we're
seeing a very similar problem of just
being overwhelmed and machine learning
is really good at solving those problems
when you know what the data looks like
and were to go find it so when the
machines finally takeover do you think
they will look favorably on you well so
we're programming them that way you know
it's funny the the myth of machine
learning and artificial intelligence
more generally is that it's kind of
somehow sort of replace the full range
of human thought right that's not
possible because there you have infinite
possibilities machine learning not very
good in it in a world where you've got
infinite possibilities so I don't expect
to see the machines creating poetry
anytime soon I don't expect to see them
designing the next sort of brand-new
idea but I do see them very good at
answering questions that we know what we
want to ask and we know where to find
the data we may not be able to process
that data very well as a human but we
can find it and we can use use the
artificial intelligence to analyze it I
just want them to get a lot better at
turning on the water in the men's room
that would be great that would be great
then thanks for stopping by
and stick around we'll have more
interviews from Oracle code here in
Toronto if you'd like more information
on the Oracle code events please visit
developer oracle.com slash code there's
a complete list of all the upcoming
Oracle code events around the world and
you'll find some cool and interesting
information for developers for the
Oracle technology Network I'm Bob revoir
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
