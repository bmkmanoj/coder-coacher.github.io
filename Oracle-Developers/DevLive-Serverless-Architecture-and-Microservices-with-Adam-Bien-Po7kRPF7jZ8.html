session here on an exciting morning
another very picturesque day outside for
those people who can see the scenery
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and I have
as my guest
the first keynote speaker of today Adam
bein so Adam welcome so Adams a
consultant and well I think well-known
to the to the world of Java and the
folks out there so Adam and I we're
going to do a can even do a follow-on
session with my colleague but I was just
kind of curious about your presentation
first of all you did a a slide list
presentation death to PowerPoint yes
that was amazing yeah Oregon ask me
about deliver keynotes as like the only
precondition is I don't like slides I
hope you do with slides so if I could
code something then I would do it and
this was a deal and now I'm here and I
think developers I mean I'm slides is
hard to explain how it actually works
and if you show it with code it's
actually simpler than expected this is
why I'm doing this well I think was no
way to show this what I did today on
slide and I think you did a great job it
really engaged the audience yeah because
I use check Evert you know and then
worry about the critic is a small guy in
the drilling right but but it went down
well so I wanted to get a touch upon a
couple of things I think you can I went
through it in your presentation and
again this is for the benefit of the
people who weren't able to attend so
we're live-streaming it will also record
it and upload it to YouTube so just for
the benefit of those who couldn't make
it so I think you touched upon you went
and discussed a couple of key concepts
one of those was a service architecture
you will talk a little bit about that
yeah so I get asked about several us a
lot and what interests me is what is the
benefit or what is the problem first and
what the solution and what the benefit
and what I did today I just used stock
Java EE application and simulated a
cloud deployment with stock lamps which
v5 which happens to be the Java 8
reference implementation so without any
preparation from scratch
use just standard tools the show
developers what we can achieve just know
with command-line and very little bloat
actually no bloat
there was no blow just business logic
and this is what I show today and
although I wanted to show that and to
explain that actually most of the huge
applications don't require that many
servers this is the surprising thing
yeah I think you when you ask for a show
of hands of who uses more than 18 years
and there were three out of eight or
nine or six or whatever so I just find
it interesting that again when we talk
about you know a lot of the new
technologies we give the examples of
Facebook and Google and you know Netflix
and all of those but I guess the real
that is the real world that you can deal
with is a you know a lot of small in
scale but even Netflix on Netflix still
has six million customers which for
which for whom they ship the DVDs and
for this application they have one
monolithic app which these with that
okay and the whole micro service and
cloud architecture is for the streaming
business reserved you know six million
clients happily with a monolithic app
that it just works so you don't have to
you know to try to emulate Netflix
Amazon or Twitter if you don't don't
have day problems so so that was the
second point which is a good segue if
you talked about micro services yeah so
when does it make sense to move to a
Microsoft for more monolithic to or
micro services architecture so in my
opinion the Amazon Netflix and YouTube
speed they have different problems you
would like to move fast
still Microsoft micro services can be
beneficial for for usual companies or
enterprises and usually what you can
achieve with with micro services like
having something like really working
modules what you can do with a micro
service and capsulate in stable part or
dedicate one team for one module so it
is hard without micro service but with
micro service you get a nice package
which is completely isolated and
completely independent from the others
so this is a huge benefit because so in
part you know you land is over the H is
going to be talking to you a little bit
more about from a Java so any other key
concepts just as a consultant that you
get
perhaps that you weren't able to cover
in the keynote that you think would be
good for the for the audience to know to
know that you you know it's a repeated
conversation program the best practice
is actually built boring applications
you know if you write simple code I
heard a client will thank you and don't
try to download half of the Internet to
create a know hello world micro service
so start with playing Java if Java is
not enough then move on to Java if this
is not enough then look further but for
me it stopped there so we build amazing
applications with nothing but playing
Java EE servers like a glassfish
WebLogic whatever and edits work
surprisingly well and because people not
always believe me I interviewed a lot of
companies on my block and perform the
interviews and ask the questions are you
happy can we improve something was it
fast and the feedback was actually
always great yeah on a lighter note so
just where where's your hometown munich
munich in your munich so I assume you've
come to Prague before yes what what what
what do you find is so different or what
impresses you about Prague Prague is
nicer my city is nice view I actually
don't like that much Munich I have to
say so I like Rudy Parker nice city I
don't know why it's really nice a German
we will please well yeah we'll edit that
out and we don't have to be a small guy
called critic in issue well Adam thank
you so much for coming down the shadow
interviewing me thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
