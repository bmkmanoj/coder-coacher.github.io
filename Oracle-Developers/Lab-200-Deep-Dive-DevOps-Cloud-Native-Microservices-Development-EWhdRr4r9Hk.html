DevOps micro service development
workshop in this particular lab we're
gonna build a first micro service and
we're gonna do that by assuming the role
of a Java developer by the name of Bala
Gupta Paula's gonna leverage eclipse
to write his java base micro service and
he will do this by leveraging code from
the developer cloud service inside of a
git repository
he will also build out the CI CD
framework for deploying his micro
service into the Oracle application
container cloud service to do that he
will have to submit a request to Lisa
Jones our product manager who will
approve it and then we'll continue on
our way so let's go ahead and get
started to begin with we're gonna go
into our active sprints and the first
task that ball would want to do is begin
or move task number one to end progress
inside of the swimlane this'll just let
the project manager know that he's were
actively working on it next he's going
to go up and begin importing the code
for the initial Twitter micro service to
do this he's gonna create a new code
repository and in our case we've gone
ahead and established a code base inside
of github just to make it easy so we're
gonna go ahead paste in that URL and
click create in a few moments it'll
reach out to github and it will import
all the objects that we need this micro
service has been pre-built just for the
sake of time mate we will make some
edits in a little bit next we're gonna
go out and create a new build job this
will be our Twitter feed build and we're
gonna need to specify several parameters
for this particular build job
our first parameters make sure we set
the right JDK and in this case we want
to use JDK 8 next we're gonna go out the
source control and specify get and then
point it to the repository in the code
that we just imported
after that we're gonna go to triggers
and we're gonna trigger this build based
on this cm polling and specify various
build steps in this particular case for
our but main built will be off invoking
maven 3 and at the top of the page our
goals will won't be clean install we'll
need to update this so it says glean and
assembly assembly next we're gonna go to
post build and we're gonna specify to
archive our artifacts and we do want to
publish our j-unit test results and now
we can go ahead and click Save at their
top of the menu and we can mouse up and
click the build Now button to begin our
build now for the sake of time I have
fast forwarded this build a little bit
one of the things that I did want to
show you was ability to drill into the
build console and watch all the steps
that are taking place as part of this
build in real time
all right when the build is completed
we'll come back to our overview page
you can see that it's finished
successfully and now we're going to
create our first deployment step
to give our deployment a name
and on the right hand side we're gonna
select a deployment target which will be
new and in this case we wanted to apply
it to the application container cloud
service and now we're gonna enter in
once again our data center which is amia
along with the identity domain provided
to you in either your trial account or
from your instructor we'll go ahead and
enter our credentials for cloud admin
and test our connection successful we
will use it we're going to keep the
default accs run property and put an
artifact at our code and then choose
various memory perimeters in this case
to keep the deployment relatively small
you
once that's in place we can go ahead and
start our deployment this will tap into
our build and this once again was fast
forwarded but you can see what it'll
look like once the deployment completes
with everything in place let's go out
and check to make sure that that
actually occurred
so we'll navigate back to our initial
tab and open the application container
cloud service and here we can see this
particular micro service was deployed
and we're gonna go ahead and copy the
link address and in a new tab we're
gonna access this rest endpoint for the
micro service so we'll go ahead and
paste that in and then at the end of it
we're going to type the extension static
tweets slash static tweets you should
see information like this come back to
you
all right let's go back to our Java
cloud service we'll go into our agile
tab and now we can click on our active
sprints and since this first task has
been completed we'll move it from the in
progress when laying to the completed
swim link go ahead and specify next say
that we spent a day on it
click OK and that particular task has
been completed now for this next set of
tasks we're gonna actually go out into
eclipse and in this particular case
we're gonna tap into the cloud plugin
let's go ahead and search on the word
work hole and locate the Oracle cloud
plugin click OK at the bottom of the
page we're gonna go ahead and connect
here we'll once again enter our
credentials for our cloud click finish
and then in a moment it'll connect if it
prompts you for a password you can
simply use the Oracle or whatever you
want I can click no on the storage in
all right here we see our connection is
in place and we're gonna drill into our
developer cloud service we can see our
sprint for our alpha office product
catalog and we can drill into our code
base now in this particular case we're
going to Mouse up to the top and we're
going to import some new code
we'll choose our git project there
click finish and now we've imported the
code base for our static tweets directly
into eclipse we can go down to our
issues tab and we can actually just like
we did on the web interface see the
issues that have been created as well as
the ones that been completed or in
progress and in this case we're gonna
create a filter on our static tweets and
to do that we need to move the
particular feature into the in progress
swim lane on the past we did this on the
web interface but now we're going to
actually go out and accept this
particular task through the clips IDE
now when we do this if we go back to our
web page and refresh we can actually see
filter 2 is in the end progress Wembley
next let's go ahead and modify some of
our codes so that we can implement our
filter so it will open up the static
tweets dot Java file and what we've done
is pre-written this code for you so you
simply have to remove some comments so
we'll remove our first and second line
comment lines here so that the path will
be exposed and now we'll go down to our
test code and do the same thing remove
some comments
everything saved we're gonna go ahead
and switch to a new branch and create a
new branch to implement our code
you
so we'll call our new branch name filter
to
and we'll go up here to team and commit
the new branch drag this up and here we
can see the two files where we did make
changes have been staged we'll type in a
commit message go ahead and commit and
push this change back up to the cloud
all right so now when we connect our
cloud let's mouth up on the left hand
menu to our code and we should be able
to see that the new branch is there
yep there's our filter to branch and we
can see that we just added several
changes recently we can also even drill
in and see the exact code or the files
that were modified in this particular
branch if we want to we can even drill
into the code and take a look at the
lines of code that we just modified in
Eclipse earlier
I'll mouse down to our merge request and
we're gonna create a new merge request
as Bala Gupta so we'll select our
repository our target branch in a review
branch click the next button and in this
case we're gonna put cloud admin but our
reviewer would actually be in reality
Lisa Jones but for the sake of time and
logging in and out will specify cloud
admin and click create here we can see
the screen with our merge request and
we're just gonna back out and pretend
like we've just logged in this Lisa
Jones where we could see that the new
merge request was submitted to her
in this particular case she's able to
review the code changes make a final
decision on whether or not this should
be merged and then go ahead and create a
merge commit for our new branch now with
that in place there's some things that
will happen in the background
our CI CD framework will begin to
execute our build will start we can see
our build is queueing here there it goes
it just complete it it'll pass from our
build back to our deployment there it
goes
and now we can drill in and actually
take a look at our code so before we
looked at static tweets which will still
be there but now we want to access our
filter that we just created and filter
on the keyword Expo so here we can see a
filtered rest call that will return all
of the products with the keyword Expo in
it like Expo marker and last but not
least since this has been completed we
need to go back to our agile board and
move our particular feature we just
worked on from the in progress Wimbley
directly into the completed swamp and
that concludes lab 200</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
