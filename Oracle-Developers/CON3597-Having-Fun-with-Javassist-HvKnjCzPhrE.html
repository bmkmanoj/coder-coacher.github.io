you here even after the party yesterday
very nice very nice
those who sit on the back I suggest you
to come closer I have so many slides
with the source codes in the so you you
will not be able to read from the back I
think or I hope you will be able to read
from the front so my name is Anton I
live and work in Estonia it's not a
state it's a small country in northern
Europe I worked this your turnaround and
we create tools for developers and the
most famous one is terrible that does
class freeloading on the fly and the
second one is execrable
which is actually I'm working on right
now and those both tools are using Java
cysts a lot I am Not sure but maybe
those tools are the most like they used
to use Java C strike more than everybody
else and this is why I am presenting
about this tonight today tomorrow sorry
it's alright it's the morning all right
so what about you what why are you here
are you are you interested in Java cyst
itself have you used it have anybody
used is about 10% of the room so you
don't know about just in general
did you read the abstract and wanted to
become a better developer right away
after my talk not gonna happen
maybe you are interested in bytecode
instrumentation maybe that's okay
so indeed bytecode instrumentation is
just everywhere even if you don't use it
directly you are using some kind of
framework that does use bytecode
instrumentation let me give you an
example so you recognize this code right
it's it's an entity every Enterprise geo
developer who recognized this thing and
what it is handled with hibernate right
open up hibernate sources check it out
there is Java cyst inside it generates a
proxy so if you go and look on the uses
of gel assist out there the most common
thing is to use it for generating
proxies so and that that is boring that
is like one like five percent of the
chalasis functionality actually does a
lot more and those others ninety five
percent are actually applied in java
tooling a lot and yeah my products are
tools and and we do generate proxies
sometimes but we actually do a lot more
and this is what i'm going to show today
so it's actually about hacks when I was
preparing my slides I realized it
shouldn't have even called having fun
with jealous sisters should have been
called making pacts with Joe assist
alright so so what are we going to do
today I'll show you some jealousies
basics and those are actually enough to
get a grasp and get the understanding
what you can do with this tool which we
will talk about gel agents a little bit
because this is a very useful feature
that enables the tools to to actually
apply Java system in real life and we'll
talk about some applications of firm of
those features as well especially in the
context of terrible I will explain you
the scheme how it actually does apply
gel assisting in in its internals so
let's start from from the basics right
so the API looks very much like Java
reflection idea it starts it starts from
the class pool which is you can think of
it as a representation of a class path
basically you get all the resources
through that glass pool and you get the
representation as CT class and you may
think of it as a analog from Java
reflection API in the class class right
and from there you can iterate and
introspect on on the internal structures
like fields methods constants
constructors and if you get the
representation of any of those
structures you can do some kind of
manipulations on on that like adding
some fields adding adding new code
inside methods instrumenting it changing
statements and so on
so how does it look like in a very basic
case we get a representation of a class
path which in very basic case if you
just run it like this from me it will be
just the system class path if you are
working in a hierarchical environment I
mean I mean hierarchical cluster others
inside an application server then you
have all this fun with class loaders and
conforming to delegation model as well
so it has to confirm then you can create
from the thin air you can create a new
representation of the class say name it
class a and test to extend some Clause
so that's what you what it generates in
memory it's in memory then you can do
all kind of manipulations let's say when
when it has some methods or start adding
new methods there this is not that
important and if you write it out
somewhere on on a file system it will be
perfectly valid bytecode which you can D
compile and see what's inside and
execute of course if you have a main
method or use it from your own program
so this kind of use case it's actually
interesting if you want to generate
classes from some kind of a meta
information let's say you have rules and
you want those rules to be compatible so
you can compile those rules just fine
or you can actually post process your
classes after the compilation so this is
what we what we actually do also in our
case when we want to insert licensing
logic inside our products region we
compile we build our artifacts and then
we apply
a tool that inserts license checks
afterwards in various places so that's
that's kind of a basic basic application
of it you can also add some kind of AOP
functionality like cross cut cutting
functionality into your application like
this but it's just a very basic case we
can do more for instance again we can
start the application and ask for a
class a from the class path and check
not check but ask give me the method foo
maybe it's there and in this example you
can see the the foo method is just it
doesn't take any arguments returns void
but it can take also the arguments and
if you want to ask for that you have to
specify the signature and the signature
is specified like capital L Java slash
Lang's last string semicolon you can
imagine if you have many arguments in
the method it looks like this too long
right sometimes it's really too long but
well it is what it is so after that you
can actually start manipulating the
bytecode of this method let's say we are
inserting a statement system.out.println
statement in the very first line of that
foo method and this dollar one variable
is just local variable and local
variables are including the parameters
so the very first parameter of that
method is actually dollar zero which is
this reference and it's only for virtual
methods right
so in this case we will print what
whatever variable is passed to that
method and then we can actually convert
this city class representation into the
normal class representation reflection
API and get an instance and call the
method done so
but there is a little catch here this
this code that you write in strings it's
it's not perfectly valid Java code but
it has some rules let's say like for
instance in here I had to add semicolon
and it's very easy to miss when you are
just starting the cellist it's just
everyone who is starting with it would
encounter this kind of error and it's
really hard to spot when you have a lot
of statements in there so the best
practice is insert as little statements
as you can in those strings and
externalize the patching code or
whatever logic you can in choose let's
say static methods that can be compiled
from jello yeah so just add the
semicolon the error will go away and
you'll be fine so well I said it was
insert before we can also do insert
after the the statements can be inserted
as finally blocks basically into any
exit point of the method and with this
you can just implement tracing the very
basic use case not naive naive
implementation of profiling or or add
some login based on some kind of
conditions maybe you can also implement
the AOP functionality you know
transactions if you want not that you
have to of course but you can do that
there is actually one more method that
is much more interesting
it's called instrument and it takes the
expression editor so the purpose is
actually instrument the single
expressions single statements inside
your method maybe not your method but
any method right so it allows us to
let's intercept the new expressions
whenever you create a new object with
new operator you can intercept that you
can intercept nor of course so for
instance here
the new expression and then you can
replace that call side or that statement
where the new expression was called with
some new logic and inside that logic you
can use the precede function which is
built-in function of chalasis to
preserve the original statement acquire
the value that was created by that
original statement and do something with
it let's say when we are instrumenting
the code of the frameworks in for
instance spring framework we can
register all the beans that are created
on the fly inside our internal
structures like this or you can also
intercept method calls let's say I
encountered some kind of a println
statement in in Dakota and just remove
it forget I have used this example when
teaching students in the university and
they liked it a lot that you can you
know remove some statements and replace
them
basically it was a homework like remove
all the println or debug statements from
the existing program
or you can also replace field access you
can process the program check if there
are any direct field access it replaced
it with with statements like the setters
but it's it's quite quite brittle
actually so if you do manipulations with
the with the bytecode verifier will
check it for you and sometimes not every
time but sometimes depending on what you
are changing actually you may get some
spooky errors like in this case class
format error local variable types table
does not match local variables table so
sometimes you need need to do some more
work to actually enable jealousies to
generate valid byte code for instance to
solve this case we were just removing
local variable types table or that entry
from from the table to make it match
with the original one so this is like a
very basic introduction I take questions
on the fly so if you have any questions
to raise the hand yeah
they did the last exception that was in
the slide no it was it was an error
after patching an existing class of the
library so yeah on the fly it when we
are patching it adding some instructions
or statements whatever it was when when
the library started to work it thought
it wasn't a valid byte code so when it
was loaded it's very fire you know said
you cannot do that
no it's something you have to brighten
your coat when you are doing it
maybe if javis is did it automatically
you know it would be kind of a UX thingy
but you just have to be prepared when
you you know you sometimes there are
some corner cases and then you have to
understand okay what what does this
actually mean you can use Java system
you know to correct it yes
yeah so the because she is about the
language level of Chava cyst inside the
strings it's still 1.4 it doesn't
support generics so yeah it's it's it's
also one one little thingy that she will
encounter if you have program like Java
5 like compatible syntax for a long time
and then you start writing something in
Java system start applying those
generics and you get very very good
syntax errors it's one or casued
can I replace can I like at imports yes
I can usually yeah basically it's just
it you just import there is a import
package statement right so this was the
basic kind of you know functionality
there is more of course you can really
get into very little like internals of
the class file format to you know to
manipulate it but in most cases is not
required you can copy methods you can
add new methods new fields whatever this
is all good but how do you apply this
actually for tooling and the you cannot
just tell to the user that go tell my go
go take my program and some kind somehow
integrate that's that's not a tool
that's not a product product it's it's a
utility you can do that because you've
edges or frameworks that the user will
take it and start manipulating with it
inside his code but if you are providing
a tool it has to be just one-off
download it install it boom it works so
for Java Java agents are like a perfect
fit for this kind of tools that
manipulate bite though because Java
agents is the gateway to the class
loading process where you can intercept
the bytes being loaded and start
manipulating them so what's challenging
how many of you actually familiar with
challege ins they have been there for
ages okay yeah so Java agent is like
just a class plane no class simple one
doesn't implementing interfaces there
it's just a convention it has a pre main
method starting from Java six it also
has agent main method if you want your
touch to a running JVM but our tools are
mainly just applying the pre main method
ends just enough in our cases
the very inconvenient thing is that you
have to package the agent every time
when you rebuild it make a change I wish
one day actually there would be like
extension for those challege ins in the
API or you know I don't know spec so
that you don't have to assemble it when
you are developing a gel agent it should
be very simple thing to do actually we
did it for our use cases but it should
be some kind of somehow standard I think
and okay when you build it you can just
specify - Java agent argument and run
your program then you implement the plus
file transformer which has many
arguments and this transform method but
actually the most interesting one is the
byte class file buffer and the byte
array and this is what we are working
with and in there you can start applying
Joseph's API make a class out of those
bytes
I mean city class and start you know
whatever you want to do with it adding
new methods you know transforming it in
a way and once it's done you can convert
it to bytes again and pass it on to the
class loader again so it will be kind of
transparent now just to visualize that
there is a + loading process there is
instrumentation API that adds plus file
Transformers and inside those class
formers we can apply those libraries or
tools to transform those and in our case
the Transformers are actually terrible
plugins
and we use Java C still up there so I
have a little demo just to demonstrate
this Java is in concept for those who
are unfamiliar with it
one second sorry
so the example project is on github at
zero turnaround repository called caused
by that's a very simple agent actually
so it only adds one transformer called
coal spine and what it does it only
first of all imports the package right
so there was a question if you can add
new libraries into the code yes we are
adding new library on the fly which is
our lot a library into the instrumented
code then we can start let's say
filtering classes that we want to
instrument and we don't want to
instrument our own classes so if it's if
it matches my package I will not
instrument that just pass out the the
original bytes and then we can also
apply some some custom filters let's say
in if you have used profilers they
usually have a configuration where you
specify blacklist whitelist or inter
filtering rules this is usually
externalized but this is just for
simplicity's in my culture hard-coded so
I will only instrument if the class is
starting from composite' package then
so I will make a little bit smaller I
can start manipulating those bytes if
this is a bike applicable if the class
is relevant relevant to me and start
instrumenting those methods that are
inside that class just iterate on the
methods list and start adding some new
statements in this case I'm adding
insert before a call to stack push I
will show what it does and then it
prints a statement like prints a lock
message and when I'm exiting the code
when it when it returns I'm I'm adding
the stack pop so what it does it's just
a very simple class it has a field
inside which is a string and when it
does push when it enters the method it
will add an indent like a whitespace to
that field and when it goes out when it
cause pop it will just subtract one one
one entry from that string and log
statement is just printing printing
whatever method was called so basically
it implements tracing and it will write
like print out a call tree of the
program that is being executed when when
it executes very simple one let me
actually show how it works
stand-alone program
so just very simple Fibonacci sequence
whatever it is run
let's think that I don't know anything
about this program it's a black box to
me
right so if I calculate first ten
statements let me open up bigger a
little bit so I start the program and I
can see who so many times the the the
method was called so I have a tree in
the culture of the program now if I
didn't know anything about it if I
stroll it like this I can see that every
new entry in the list was recalculated
every like from from scratch since Erica
it's a recursion it doesn't memorize
there is the previous results it starts
calculating it from the beginning and
starts like growing the tree starts
growing right so if I didn't know I
would I would spot the problem here
right away it's just a matter of
visualizing your program and this is
what we do with our extra bone the
profiler
the aim is actually to visualize the
program so we would spot the performance
the potential performance problems by
the way
okay this is for the demo you don't need
that anymore
and as you see the two is very simple
you can just a little bit extend it to
your purpose and it'll be just fine
and you don't have to change your
original program to actually use that
all right so we have Java cysts
endurable just everywhere we have
integrations with about 80 frameworks
but all all the applications service
that you can think of different versions
but whatever like magic it can do with
them and I actually would like to show
you a little example of how it's
actually being used by the users and why
is it any good
so for instance here we have a spring
application based on Spring Framework
right uses request mappings right to
handle the incoming requests and
annotations are just meta information in
your code so it's a configuration right
and and with request mappings we are
mapping our application to you know
serve those screens and for instance
this screen is being served from if you
don't I think you cannot trade but
localhost:8080
owner slash new and for instance I
decided okay it's not it shouldn't being
you but I won't want it to be at right
it's not there obviously right if I
switch it to the code change it here
recompile the class
it's okay refresh and it's there
right what happened if I if I see in the
console here I can see okay jeroboams
reloading the class that I just modified
and it's reconfiguring the beam that is
assigned to this controller and as if
it's a beam inside the framework and
it's a spring framework and we know
about it
we have to reinitialize the depart that
is handling those mappings and right
away you have to restart boom
the functionality is there this is all
done with the magic of Java system
actually this logic is added into the
application with Java cysts and how does
it work
so we have a terrible core which is
responsible for reloading the classes so
when I recompile the class Cherryville
core detected that the timestamp of the
class was changed and it reloaded the
new version in into memory and
reassigned all the co sites to use that
new version and then it notified the
plugin that it was responsible for
spring that hey you have to reload that
part or I have a new version of the
class for you is it relevant to you the
plug-in and takes a look yes there is a
spring annotation and it was registered
before I will load the configuration
that is responsible for that part of
functionality good so and this all is on
in one jar which makes it very you know
conveniently usable you don't have to
set up or anything special to use that
ok yeah reloads classes notifies plugins
reload configurations and jealousy's is
inside those plugins job jariabek or
does not use any java sees there we are
using ASM for performance Java assist is
not that good for performance critical
parts but it's very convenient to
actually support the codebase because
it's so high level and those plugins
live inside the frameworks and so how it
looks when when when the plug-in works
and tries to instrument the framework so
for instance we have a framework class
which has some kind of a configure
methods you need method whatever else
sometimes the lifecycle of the frame is
quite complex if I could say in spring
eg B's or so it's it's quite complicated
and then you have a lot of code there
basic Java ceased code we get it from
the memory like the close plus when it's
being loaded through the class loader we
add the agent and intercept the loading
of this class and we get the
representation from there then we want
this framework to implement a
on listener to listen for those events
so we want that code to be in in run
time so how can we implement that we
just say okay framework class please
have new interface and that's our
interface right and afterwards we can
implement that interface and register it
inside our own internal collection of
those listeners so I have a little demo
as well that's some github again but on
my account
it's called Chi JJ point and the class
that demonstrates it a hooker is called
how it works let me
okay so the very same
yeah when you are using AP what can go
wrong right one second
something is really bad okay so in the
framework class just for the demo
purposes it just prints one statement
configuring the framework and returns
the object it's not really important but
it would be doing but the concept is
just to show the patching here next we
have terrible so it's not not the
original Cherryville of course but the
concept is there again so we have a
collection of listeners inside cherubim
which could be plugins if you if you
would like to think of them like this
then we have like singleton and we are
adding this nurse if needed and once
some kind of a change on the class when
we reload the class we want to notify
listeners we just you know call the own
event method on for every event if of
course in real life it's a bit more
complicated there are priorities you
cannot just call different places inside
the framework without any order you have
to specify like correct orders and joins
for the lifecycle frameworks but now how
it works
and the listener interface is just you
see the simple one and how it works
let me code it for you a little bit so
we start with again with class pool
right we have a class pool just for the
for the sake of simplicity in the main
method then we import package since we
are adding our own code of our own
listeners into the existing framework we
have to tell to the Java sister hey
there is a new namespace you have to use
it for a compilation to find those
classes then find find the framer class
from the class path
and sell to the existing framework class
hey you should implement listener add
new method there that is just will be
let's say we want to reconfigure the
framework every time when when something
happens and we just call the internal
configure method that is it but in there
in our existing class on the framework
and next thing when we when we
implemented this interface we have to
register it somehow and and the tricky
part is when should you do that
when is the right right place like which
place is the correct one to insert the
code to register the listener and in
many cases not not every time but
sometimes it's convenient to insert the
registration inside the Constructors so
whenever a new instance of the framework
is clearly created in the end of the
constructor you add a statement that
adds this instance inside our internal
collection so I would just attach all
the Constructors and in in the end of
every constructor I would add just for
the demo purposes right now
system.out.println statement that this
framework constructor is being called
and add the listener inside our durable
implementation so if I yeah
yes yes I can use this here as well but
um sometimes okay dollars are have two
meanings sometimes when you use it just
like this it it means this but dollars
that are used inside the instrument
method when you are using expression
editor
they are kind of applicable to that part
of the method that you are instrumenting
right now a bit different okay so so now
if I just create the framework instance
that is already patched and if I run it
I will see that when the constructor is
called I will see this statement there
like calling framework and structure if
I check the framework class here I have
a system.out.println statement inside
the configure method so I should only
see the constructor println statement
right
boom only calling the constructor so
nothing happened to the configure method
yep
now if something happened I reloaded the
class inside the core and I want to
notify okay I want to notify listeners
Charvel internally would call that
method and modify all the listeners then
obviously the listener that we just
registered from the constructor inside
our own collection would be called and
it would be printing out configuring the
framework good any questions here
not yet okay I hope it's all clear
alright so this is how it works but when
I when I show this strings normally to
at conferences and how we do stuff or
some user group meetups and how terrible
does things
it looks quite scary and people are like
doing big eyes and how you live with
this yes it's it's a hard work you have
to test it it like no change of the
framework goes untested the tricky part
here is that you using unit tests here
is kind of pointless because you're the
code that you are adding is being added
to the existing framework you have to
run the Union test of that framework to
actually verify if you didn't break
anything so there are two levels of of
testing for this kind of changes first
of all we take the unit tests of the
existing frameworks and make sure that
they run with the new added
functionality and the second level of
testing is our own functional testing
when we start up the whole application
check for the existence of let's say any
functionality in there in original
application make a change automatically
recompile some code and replace the
existing class and then check if it was
reloaded can be expected functionality
is being added so it's kind of a unit
test but it's the single unit test is
one web application a small one but
there is a lot of them and currently I I
once calculated how long it takes to run
all those tests one by one it would take
about ten days ten full days on one
single machine if you just run it one by
one to ensure that we saw it's so
correct and stable and everything and we
run currently those tests several times
a day so because it's clustered and
distributed in everything so Java sees
this kind of tool that you would like to
use but it's not really fit for you know
for normal normal but new a Java project
please don't do that
and it's just fun sometimes the
statement about becoming a better
programmer it's actually valid because
to actually patch the framework
correctly you have to understand the
framework have to go and debug every
single step into it and this is what
makes you a better programmer not just
learning Java system so if you have more
questions to me just shoot I have all
the slides already uploaded to the
speaker deck and SlideShare you can
follow me on Twitter if you have any
feedback from me please do write
questions on Twitter as well or my email
and go check out my products as well I
take questions now yeah thank you
do we support planets expressions you
mean reloading of Java expression lambda
expressions
what we do actually is for support of
lambda expressions is when you change
something so it would be correct they
are loaded because it's you know the
static static linking afterwards when
it's already being run and to make it
run correctly we have to reinitialize or
yeah yes
yes yes you can you can like check if
it's a synthetic method or not I I
cannot reveal the exact logic because I
just haven't implemented myself but we
have it's not just enough to instrument
that synthetic methods you have to
reinitialize the whole meta Factory to
reload it correctly it's not it's not as
simple just of you know synthetic
methods yeah
in that demo there wasn't there wasn't
the Java agent but the same this very
same code like in in real life this code
that I had in the main method would be
distributed in different places so just
for a demo purposes I I simplified it as
much as I could and put in one method
yeah one question
yes like it's usually applied in you
know we not to write business logic but
really as a tool or kind of cross
cutting tool right
adding statements like removing
something I even have seen use cases
where a developer discovered that there
is a contention like excessive
synchronization on some resource where
it wasn't needed
so he used Java C's just to patch the
library to remove it but if you are
doing that on an open source library why
aren't you doing a fork applying a
passion using that library why why do
you have to make bike phone
instrumentation for that
yes yes that's probably the simplest
simplest use case you had logging yes
yeah same as which you would do let's
say with a spec J probably it's even
more high-level and probably more
applicable to this kind of use case yep
more questions no yes
who means Java cyst JBoss contains
cellist yes yeah so how does it compare
to CG lip oh yeah I'm able to answer the
question
CG lip is a wrapper around a SM library
which is a good thing right because a SM
is a de facto standard too many play
byte code and it's fast using CG lip
it's kind of for our purposes would be a
bit inconvenient because you manipulate
byte code as as a model if you are
adding snippets of code inside the
existing framework in Java 6 you see the
whole string you can immediately
understand what it is with CG lip you
would have to parse the code you know
read it understand it and then realize
okay this is what it does if you have a
lot of that and you have to maintain
different pieces in different frameworks
this is like a nightmare so if you are
generating proxies if the main use case
is to generate props is CG lip is just
fine
there was a yeah other other like other
frameworks that use Java sister do we
run into conflicts with those yes we may
it depends on the use case but in most
cases jail as I said those are those
frameworks are using it for proxies
right so we actually integrate with Java
assist and repackage the original
jealously inside terrible so on a like
namespace level they don't clash and the
the main use case to instrument the
javis is this one you are reloading some
kind of genomic inside the framework
that generated proxies you would
register those proxy bytes somewhere
internally to regenerate them again if
need yes one more questions
if module system changes anything in
regards to gel assist I initially I was
afraid that instrumentation how they
handle instrumentation with modularity
but it seems not to be the case at all
like our our concern initial concerns of
modularity seem to go away as as we see
we we are testing with Java 9 already
and we don't see any changes for us yes
I've usually how we checked gee show you
mean the repo for Java 9 no no
unfortunately we haven't checked gesso
yet that's that's a good point we have
to check that but well have to figure
out what the use case will be if you
want you just to add new methods on the
fiim then what kind of fancy things you
can do
that's a challenge okay
yes
and how would I use help I choose
between a OB framework and Joe assist
depending on the use case if I just
wanted to add a cross-cutting concerns I
would just choose an AOP framework if I
have to instrument something in like
inside the methods you know copy methods
instrument single statements registers
something had new functionality and new
purpose just normal a opie framework is
not capable for that
that's like would be my criteria in most
cases for business functionality or just
adding blog blogging as we were talking
about just use a OB framework that's
better
yep all right I think I just finished
here and if you want to talk with me
just you just come and we can chat yeah
