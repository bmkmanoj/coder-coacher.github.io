Toronto I'm Bob Rubert with the Oracle
technology Network bringing you yet
another in a series of interviews with
session speakers from today's event and
my guest for this segment is parva syed
mohammed harvest tell me about what you
do for oracle so I started with Oracle
last year early January and I've been a
senior principal product manager with
Oracle's mobile cloud service so which
mobile cloud service is predominantly a
mobile backend as a service for all kind
of mobile apps and you know it has
various components you know which
includes the mobile core and then now we
have come up with you know cxa which is
our analytics platform and then our bots
platform I manage the mobile call side
of things all of mobile flow on all the
API is platform API that go with it that
support all mobile apps imagine that you
and I are falling from a great height
and we have about two minutes before we
hit the ground and I asked you to
describe your session today yeah how
would you describe it it's going to be a
little difficult what I can 5 so mobile
apps have two different parts idea one
is your front end and then you have a
back end now you know it has been in the
past few years the risk based API is
that mobile apps use to access server
resources I have gotten a lot of
prominence but it's still a lot of very
difficult to kind of figure out the
right kind of you know methods to kind
of browse and consume your third party
API and be able to get the right set of
data to shrink down the payload so it
works for mobile apps so it's all about
you know making the right choices so
your mobile app is fast and preppies
right and it's also about making it more
personalized in a
and you know you also want to be worried
about the security of the whole thing so
all of these are topics that every
single architect a mobile developer you
know needs to worry about and we in this
particular session we were to talk about
a few of those topics show what Oracle
has to offer in those fields and
basically have a live discussion and
some code to show you know how people
can do get things going so in your role
what sort of questions do you often get
from developers about the particular
environment developing in that
environment so developers you know have
you know when they choose our computerss
products they have a huge learning curve
they have to put everything themselves
together the results right so with our
colored MCS in particular it becomes
really easy for them to do that because
it's fully managed it's easy to use you
know but there are a lot of questions
like you know how do I get started on X
or how do I get started on Y and we have
lots of documentation for that and we
have been you know building our
resources to kind of you know get all
the documentation I would get all the
blogs out so my job is pretty easy when
it comes to developer questions you know
I just find them to reserve them it's
done but at times you know there is some
involved in our technical discussions
there I pull in the right sources to go
get those details so where will you be
talking about work or mobile cloud
service next I have a session in Moscow
that's next month and I it will be the
same session but it will be for a
different audience based on how the
audience reacts to my session today we
will modify that for an audience in
Moscow how's your Russian zero oh good
luck in Moscow okay if you'd like more
information on Oracle mobile cloud
service or anything related to the
Oracle code event please visit developer
oracle.com slash code you'll find a
complete list of all the remaining
sessions in this tour and some other
information that you'll do the
developers will find valuable for the
Oracle technology Network I'm Bob
