I'm Bob Robert with the Oracle
technology Network and my guest is Joe
Huang
Joe tell the folks at home what you do
for Oracle sure I'm product management
for the Oracle mobile and bot platform
so both a relatively new products for
Oracle Mobile has been around for a few
years that we're about to introduce a
new platform around bod and chat pod and
also the what I do and primarily a focus
down what we call outbound so work with
partners and customers and developers to
really adopt our technology so you have
two sessions at today's event right both
of them focused on chat pots tell me
what - what you're going to be talk
about in those sessions sure so the
first session what I'm going to talk
about primarily focused on analytics you
know how do get actionable insight into
mobile applications and about what I
mean by that is for example how does the
user actually use the mobile application
well how do they interact with the bot
and be able to get analytics information
to get feedback on how they're using the
lease application for one the other one
is while these applications execute
business processes and and operations so
how do you get insight into if user is
doing certain things for example user is
spending money on certain part of the
product or if user is using the
application and not able to complete all
of the operations and they get stuck for
example putting stuff into the shopping
cart we want to know why that's the
that's the reason then find actionable
resolutions to fix that so that's what
I'm going to talk about a little bit in
the first session is how do you go and
go about getting the insightful
actionable analytics information to
allow the developers to get insight into
how to make their application better and
what about the second session second
session will primarily just focused on
BOTS and Chapa it's designed for as a
both as an entry-level session to talk
about what bodies and how is it change
in transforming how end user is
interacting with businesses and one of
interesting things is the millenniums
and the newer generation of the users as
really embraced this chat platform right
so you know for example I have a 12 year
old doll she's 13 now and time flies
right and you know we got her a really
nice iPad pro for a Christmas gift and
generous did well you know and you know
she only runs 2 applications on my iPad
and Instagram and snapchat okay also
show all chat based application so the
millenniums are growing up to use chat
to interact with each other to be very
social yeah so now the interesting
opportunity then for businesses is how
this business reach out through these
channels to these newer generations of
end-users to try and sell your daughter
a car how exactly right and that that's
one of the challenge and the other
challenge which is really interesting is
you know traditionally when we talk
about application development you know
you're thinking about how do you design
the user interface how do you make the
application easier to use with chat bot
it's both different and also the same
right so it's the same that you want to
give the best conversational experiences
for the end-user to be able to very
quickly complete their operations
finally what they need to do through a
chat interface but it's also very
different is that thinking we're
building a good experience changes from
building a beautiful user interface to
design conversation like we're having a
conversation how do I make a
conversation easier for you to
understand I mean that's the type of
thing that we the challenge that the
building and developing a bot and making
that easier to use making it
for like a virgin' more human okay to
interact and to understand better that
that's part of the challenge that choppa
brings of course the other aspect is and
then how do you connect the Chapa as a
new channel to into the backend
enterprise application ultimately at the
end of the day just similar to a mobile
application bots are just another
channel to reach into the backend
enterprise data in application so what
is the technology that we will be using
to connect these bots and into the
backend application and do it in a
performant way because when you're
chatting you expect you know two or
three seconds response time yeah sure
and so you know that some of the
challenges that a bot developer is going
to face and that's what we'll talk about
a little bit about what we're doing that
area were the best practices and also
have a little fun on different type of
BOTS we have developed as we mentioned
you've got two sections going on today
if if someone attends a developer here
at this event it tends both of those
sessions what's the one thing you want
that developer to remember yeah that's a
good question I think that one that the
developer really to remember is how to
leverage this new channel two-spot
platform to connect into back-end
application what are all the different
pieces that involved to create a great
bot user experience and also be able to
use analytics to gain insight into how
user is actually interacting with the
bot so that's another key thing for
analytics is to be able to tell us
whether user you know halfway through
the conversation just gives up or just
gets frustrated with a lot of questions
a very long conversation where the user
is able to get to the what they find
very quickly and then how do you then
take that feedback into something to to
adopt so that's really what you know key
takeaway it is to introduce this new
channel and also introduce the best
practice
development leverages new channel that
you talked about some of the challenges
in here and working with chatbots yeah
but for it's clearly a big opportunity
for developers yeah
what are some of the gotchas what does a
developer have to watch out for in
taking those first steps and developing
chatbots yeah that's a good question so
I think first of all the first challenge
is to pick a platform that's flexible
what I mean by that is there are a lot
of bought platform technologies that are
rule-based rather rigid meaning that you
basically have to account for all the
permutations of how user may enter in a
request a question and then respond that
way if the user for example didn't enter
in the text exactly in exactly one way
or if user just as a screen
consciousness which I do all the time
right so stream conscious and in all the
time you ask a question out of the
context how does the pie handle it Gouri
matures the platform cannot handle that
because it's it's more rule-based and
it's still I you know we considered this
as a wild wild west all right so that's
the one of the challenges and I think we
wanted to talk about is being able to
pick the right platform that has the
right to language processing technology
but also flexible enough so you can
design a conversation to accommodate for
a you know stream-of-consciousness out
of the context type of request right and
another thing to think about
it really is also - how do you know so
this doesn't mean that and one of the
things about developing BOTS doesn't
mean that you don't have to worry about
and how to integrate with that back-end
system so that's the second thing that
that is very critical is how do you then
create a exposed to back-end
applications and data in such a way
that's easy for the bot to consume so
that also involves in best practices
around how do you so another key
decision for all bought developer you
have to make is how to design your
back-end API is to make it easy for a
bot to consume so pick the right
platform and also pick the right
architecture to architect your back-end
api's to expose the data to the chat box
so what's on your calendar coming up in
the near term were you speaking at other
events boy that's a good question and I
think we'll have some Oracle code event
coming up so are there are sixteen
events left in the series absolutely so
if you want to find out more about those
upcoming sixteen events visit developer
oracle.com slash code you'll find a
complete list of all the upcoming events
around the world and you'll find
information on how you can submit
session proposals for upcoming Oracle
code events Joe thanks for stopping by
time Alice yep for the Oracle technology
Network I'm Bob Rubert thanks for
watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
