know I hope the fault is big enough tell
me if it's not any few guys prefer to
move this way there's still a bit of
room there oh there let's go well I'm we
wish we were Larry Allison then we could
part the keynote because the board race
is about to start but we are not so I
guess we'll do the session so the idea
of the talk is well you well you are say
who you are oh yes sorry unit sorry I
guess we have been here too many times
yeah I know of me that long so I forgot
about it so I'm Antonio independent
consultant with my accent you can tell
them not American so I'm French and it
happens that I've been working in the
java ee space for quite a long time and
I'm arun gupta I work for oracle I'm the
java ee evangelist I'm responsible for
maintaining the brand at Oracle so the
idea of the talk as you could see on the
title it was well it I really is come
and play with java ee 7 so magic you
might have noticed there's a little joke
with a play verb because we are
surrounded by frameworks languages tools
in outside the java ee space that makes
life easier you know there's a I you
know myself i also use groovy and grails
and Grell is fantastic to you know kick
out kick out an application veeram very
very quickly and i think the problem
with ja ve for a long long time in
history was how do i create something
quick how do i create a simple website
quickly so the idea of this talk is
trying to make a trying because you know
the demos sometimes can can not work so
hopefully it will work so the idea is to
create a proper website not just a hello
world web
website so a proper website with a lot
of java ee 7 new features in one hour
and really showing you that with a bit
of tooling and i'm not talking about
fancy wizard stuff for you know
expensive tools or whatever but with a
bit of tooling you can create an
application in 50 minutes roughly a web
app and another aspect that we would
like to highlight is you know typically
when people talk about at least people
who left j2ee and what I'm saying j2ee
one dot for people who left j2ee them
coming back this oh no j2ee is confusing
yeah it was j2ee was that was like two
thousand four now we're in 2013 so
another concept that we want to
highlight here is how java ee 7 is so
simple and easy to use literally
starting from ground up we're going to
build a website use all the java ee 7
technologies show you how seamlessly and
cohesively they are integrated with each
other yeah that's the idea when you you
know when you go to a talk about a
specific technology you are plenty of
samples in this technology but at the
end of the day you go back to work on
Monday it's like how how do i bundle
that so here the idea is to create a
website with roughly about 14 or 15
technologies from java ee 7 okay so he
comes the difficult part I'm doing Java
EE how do I quick start a website
tooling you know either you take your VI
and you create your pom.xml because this
is maven driven and it takes you a bit
of time you know creating a palm and so
on and so forth so I'm going I'm going
to use a tool an open-source tool called
jboss Forge who has heard of jboss Forge
okay so you want to say something about
jboss Forge sure so now jay buzz Forge
is a tool which quickly it's a command
line driven tool basically it quickly
allows you to create a simple Java EE
application and get you started very
quickly
is by Jay bars so don't think its
proprietary in any sense it's a very
standard based tool it creates a
standard maven based application with
standard maven dependencies it provides
utilities and scripts that Antonio is
going to show throughout the talk how we
can use them so effectively to be so
powerful most importantly it gives you
the ability to automate the whole thing
you know how i can add the dependency
remove the dependency so very standard
based maven driven application yet very
effective and the other part of this is
because this is maiwand driven it's
completely IDE agnostic so you go to the
jboss forge website you download a zip
file and you type forge so it's a you
know ja Java so it fires a JVM and so on
and so forth and he and you are within
Forge it's you know a shell so when you
eat the tab you have code completion so
here you see that I can type plenty of
of commands like LS yeah yeah good point
so if you tap LS its LS within forge and
you'll see what I mean with that so here
I have least commands see when I hit tab
I have code completion list of commands
we're within Forge and you see this
plenty of them even if I tap least
command all that shows me all the jboss
forge command and we'll be using some so
you can generate you eyes you have
she'll stuff you know LS copy and so on
and so forth but then you have plenty of
commands to create entities adding a new
field to a beam and so on and so forth
okay so the good thing with Forge is now
i'm going to use force to
quickstart a nap l'occasion so what I do
is I do new project you see I I eat the
tab so we completes everything so that's
quite nd i'm going to give you the name
so Java one java ee 7 i'm going to give
it that package so org dot java one java
ee 7 i'm going to give you the type so
it's i'm going to create a war file you
know and again if i eat tab it gives me
all the choices so i can create a palm a
ja a war so you're trading a waffle so
you can see minimal set of arguments
with the reasonable default and tab
completion together it makes you build a
little bit more effective programmer or
at least hawaii developer so that's it
i'm creating a project with forge i
enter he asks me that you want to create
it here yeah why not and that's all he
did really it created a structure with a
poem xml an empty maven the rectory
c-src main java and so on and everything
is empty but i'm going to show you the
code using my ID so I using telly GID
but again as Aaron said this is maven
driven so i'm going to import this
project
java SE 7 because i'm going to use some
features of java SE 7 and that's it
nothing more pom.xml generated by Forge
which is nearly empty see there's the
wall plug in the maven plugin and that's
it no java ee stuff yet and the
structure is empty java tests empty ok
so what are we going to build well we
thought of creating a web application
about java e7 and java one so a java one
there's talks about java ee 7 their
speakers like us who speak about java ee
7 there is also fantastic books about
java 7 that we wrote plus a few guys you
know you can tweet about java ee 7 so
you can tweet now and push the put the
ashtag java ee 7 so we're going to
create a web application that is going
to take data of the books written about
java one talks about java one speakers
about java one tweets about java one so
let's start we need a database we need
entities and i'm going to do a bit of
magic here with forge I've created a
forge shell script so I've been typing
commands I did new project and so on and
so forth so I can either keep on typing
but that's going to be you know long and
error-prone but what you can do is
create a shell and give it to all the
teams you know or to your friends or put
in put it on your github account so here
with 4 i'm setting up the persistence
this line will create a persistent xml
then I'm setting up being validation so
that will create a validation dot XML
file and then I'm creating an entity
that I call speaker with the first name
a surname a twitter handle and the point
that i would like to highlight here is
for example here you are talking in
generic terms you're saying i want to
create a field it's of the type string
you're not saying java string or you're
not saying the VAR char or database
terms you're purely talking in terms of
the abstract syntax types and the other
thing is it allows you to completely
automate your development process
somebody wants to understand how the
project is created you give them the
script and then they can read on the
script to just create the project from
scratch and you see the speaker the talk
and so on and so forth I didn't even
create an ID you know I'm just saying a
speaker as it's an entity so I rely on
forged to help me with that and he does
have first name a name a bio and a
Twitter I put constraints so the first
nature the first name should be not know
same thing for the talk I talk as one
too many speakers that talk the title
shouldn't be now the room shouldn't be
know the language is just in numeration
because the book can be written in
English or in French and a book as an
ISBN a publishing date with some
constraints you see the ISBN cannot be
null and the description as a constraint
minimum size of 10 and a maximum size of
two thousand so here I can either type
line by line or put that in a file it's
a forged script so I go I go back to
forge and here I do run and I execute
this script bang it has plenty of stuff
for me
quickly good so now I go back to my I to
my IDE hope auto in port configuration
so IntelliJ IDEA is clever is figure out
that there's a persistent XML so Forge
as created inside a package by default
called model a book entity as you can
see it has created an ID and a version I
just asked for to create a book with
ISBN I title and so on he had the entity
annotation plus the ID plus the version
+ getters and setters an equal etc
etcetera I know why these do this kind
of thing with wizards this is just a
common line based he's the font okay for
everybody at the back okay
okay so i have an entity layer now i can
persist books speakers and talks how
well in 2013 you know it's hype to have
a rest interface so why not create rest
endpoints for books speakers and talks
again you can do it by n and 15 minutes
will not be enough or you can ask Forge
to help you a little bit so I go back to
forge and here I does this command call
rest setup what Forge has done it as
created the rest sir servlet into the
web.xml and you just changed my pom.xml
so if i go and look at the pom.xml Forge
has had it some stuff well first of all
from before it has had it jpa to being
validation servlet because rest needs a
servlet and jackson race api so just by
doing rest set up here's es donnell you
know all that so now one thing to
realize is even though it's adding those
dependencies that are jboss specific but
by no means you are constrained for that
and will show that in a little moment
how we can clean up our existing Palme
d'Or xml to keep it simple and portable
and now let's use force you to do a bit
of magic so there's this command called
rest endpoint from entity which entity
well i'm going to say everything in them
in the model package remember the model
package is where we have the book
speaker and talk entity shebang
look it has created a rest package with
a book endpoint speaker endpoint to
endpoint so what is a book endpoint it's
a stateless bin with a path notation so
it's a rest at jax-rs endpoint it
accesses the entity layer with a
persistent unit and as you can see
there's a create method so it creates a
book entity so you pass it you know XML
and then it persists a book you have a
divot by ID so you give the idea of a
book and it deletes it thanks to the you
know when TT manager remove fine by ID
list all and update so all the endpoints
book endpoints speaker endpoint to
endpoint are the same methods let's run
it will that work i'm going to set up
glassfish because we are doing java ee 7
i'm going to take the latest and
greatest version of glassfish the 401 B
3 I use them the default so another
point that I would like to highlight
which we mentioned earlier so here we
are showing how glassfish is configured
in a specific way and IntelliJ but by no
means because this is a maven driven
project you can do the exact same
functionality in netbeans and eclipse as
well or by n you know you can just start
glassfish on come online so glass fishy
is starting up the like when the
gloucester starts up
it deploys the application and here it
is boo yeah of course we don't have web
pages yet if you look at them web.xml
what Forge did it created them it added
the jax-rs servlet and he said
everything with the pattern rest is the
rest endpoint and if you go back to the
book end point it starts with a path
books so if i go here and i type rest
books the database is empty but as you
can see it went to the book end point
and here i can use a nice little chrome
plugin but that's plenty this is a
plug-in that allows you to do rest calls
because you know what browser only does
get and post with that you can do player
plenty of stuff so if i copy past here
the oops oh it's it's already there i
send HTTP GET so as you can see i'm
going to whoops make it bigger so as you
can see as it the rest endpoint by
default it does at least also it shows
all the content of the database it's
empty but i can do other stuff i can
create a book so look the URL is the
same i do a post here i put some xml and
when I its end I have a 201 created so
if I you know get all books now I have
one book in the database and you know if
I get one book I can also do HTTP delete
bang get all books the database is empty
I've just deleted one book so here I'm
using a plug-in I could have done curl
commands to is just to show you that
with Forge quickly we created an entity
layer and rest points for all entities
and I can do crud operations oops okay
but that's early we want a you know a
web app again we can go back to we can
go back to forge and do some scaffolding
so you do scaffold set up the sky the
scaffolding type its phases so I'm going
to create a jsf web app so this is just
the setup it creates gives and you know
CSS and you know to make it pretty and
again I'm going to use the same
technique I'm going to scaffold from
entity which one well all the entities
star in the model package speaker talk
book bang if I go back so here I'm
unfortunately I need to redeploy my
application and fortunately because i
usually use j rebel that does odd
deployment but it doesn't work with with
the latest version of IntelliJ ID which
is still in beta mm-hmm so I think
there's problem with the pom.xml oh I'm
going to show you the code first so it
has generated some jsf backing bins yeah
sorry
yep so I've set up the scaffolding type
to jsf and then I've said scaffold from
entity and it has created backing bins
so I have a backing bean for books a
backing bean for speaker a backing bean
fuh talk what is a backing bean it's a
stateful ejb because it access the
database it does crud operations to eat
a CD i bin so I can access it from my
pages and it's clone converses
conversation scoped and there's you know
crud operations so you will see that i
can create update delete and on the web
app it has created creates search and
view web pages for my book speaker and
talk so let's see so I redeploy my up
yeah I was saying that unfortunately Jay
rebel doesn't work with the latest
version of IntelliJ IDEA still you know
things are under construction this is a
typical Forge web app so as you can see
here book I have the books here I can
create a new book I feel the ISBN and so
on and so forth speaker I can create new
I can do search etc so again very very
quickly we created the entity the model
layer rest endpoints backing beans and
crud pages so you're going to show the
backing pages behind this you know how
this JavaScript front end is being
created what libraries are being used
and how people want to change you they
can change it yep enable facelet
supports so he doesn't show red and for
those of you
no Jeff this is common GSF stuff you
know the name space you have the HTML
namespace call facelets nothing fancy
here forge has created all the all these
pages you know this is how to create a
to create a book so you have a
input.text for the book ISBN you know
this one here the create so it's again
Forge generates a pure java ee code no
no magic behind so if i go back to the
IntelliJ if you go to the top now all
these namespaces are Java some calm but
in java ee 7 we talk about xmlns JCP org
so this is all style how do we get to
the new style of namespaces yeah we've
been talking for 25 minutes and what
we've created is a Java EE 6 web app why
well because as Darwin said the name
spaces are all EE 6 if you look at the
if you look at the XML deployment
descriptors if you look at the bean xml
it's a 1.0 and as aaron said it's java
suncom you know if you look at oops go
what am i doing if you look at the other
faces config it's jay a jsf 2 point 0
instead of 2.2 so this is a java ee 6
app and again if you look at the pom.xml
its jboss forge uses the ee 6 spec so
what we need to do this is running on
glassfish fall last wish for can run
ecigs up or e7 app now we have to tell a
glassfish that this is a ee 7 app we
need to change the dependencies on the
pom.xml and we need to change all the
versions and namespace of the other
deployment descriptors how are going to
do that well with forge and a bit of
magic from me I've created another shell
so this is again for shell saying remove
the dependency of jpa to remove the
dependency of being validation which
happens to be the one point oh so I'm
gonna run that to remove the e6
dependencies and add java java ee 7 plus
bits and pieces that we will see later
on ok so if i go back to forge whoops i
don't want to do that again and i run
this script that I called oops where
where am I um shell script oh I did a CD
wrong
exit when you are lost you just exit and
go back again
so sorry i was typing the question is
you know what if you introduce a new
entity and for that new energy you want
to create those crud pages again will it
reintroduce those java ee 6 dependency
no because you remember when I scaffold
you know the common was scaffold from
entity I did scaffold and I put a star
anything in the inside the model package
yep so the question is what happens if
you want to add something you can go
back to forge and said I create the
entity I don't know pizza and you go
back to the scaffolding and you say
scaffold from the entity pizza not
everything and it will just create the
pages for the pizza no is clever enough
to say I've already had the dependencies
in the pom.xml and on the web.xml are
not going to do that again so I run this
script and as I said you know if I go
back to the pom.xml so there's a little
bug unfortunate that shouldn't be here
but look at the pom.xml now is just the
Java EE vapi 7 and that's it here I've
how did some sugar candy will you you
will see why but this is just you know
the pom.xml just needs one dependency
it's the e7 dependency so we've done
that second and here I have to admit
that you know Forge cannot do it because
it doesn't know what to do e 7 stuff so
I did a little shell script that copies
things around trust me there's you know
no voodoo behind you just did yeah you
just change all the XML to the bean XML
is 1.1 the faces config is 2.2 with the
new name namespace so website is gone
but eventually when forced to point
comes out that's the goal you know it
will actually have support for these new
namespaces new versions so when you
create a project it will create a native
java ee 7 project where this would you
so to say we don't have to do that yep
so question no question no yeah so the
question is I if I rerun the event ET
script which I will not be doing will it
create again you know the those entities
Forge is Claire is clever enough to say
you know am not generating code again
what you can do with Forge is HUD fields
or remove filled with with a common line
but what you can do is wrong trip you
know engineering so if you go to your
code and delete an attribute in getters
and setters he doesn't know about it so
Forge is more a one-shot thing you can
do with four G's remove an attribute and
it will remove also the getters and
setters and redo the 22 string and equal
so it helps you a little bit in that
sense in general we need to keep into
the mind that all of these Wizards
whether it's a NetBeans driven wizard or
as a forge driven wizard these wizards
are generally very good at the initial
code generation but if you do some you
know something in the code the results
are typically unexpected so they are
good for initial code generation like
you generate your entities but don't
expect that oh you know i have now
modified my database tables and i want
to end it you to be automatically
reflected you're on your own literally
in that case or write a scrip which will
automate the generation of your project
from scratch and I think we are around
32 minutes yes ok so the web app is
there the database is completely empty
let's put some data in the database I'm
not going to do that by hand i'm going
to use bits and pieces of e7 so what I
want to do is
you know what are the e7 books around
well there's a little website called
Amazon that sells e7 books and they are
really kind because they give you web
services so if the network works which I
open it will you go so to get access to
the Amazon Web Services a bit of a pain
you need an ID you need to create an
account that's why the URL here is a bit
cryptic but this is you know I'm saying
give me on numbers on all the EE 7 books
and Amazon will return this XML I want
to take this XML and then populate my
database how would I do that well with
Jack's arrest to point own so what I can
do is I'm going to create an empty
project with a main see and i'm going to
use Jack's arrest two for those of you
who are here at our talk one of the new
things with Jack's arrest too is there a
client API so I'm going to consume the
web service from amazon and I'm going to
take this data and put it in my database
so how do I do that again with a bit of
a little help from my friend here this
is the URL that I showed you in Chrome
but because it you know I forgot about
it I created a shortcut with Jack's
arrest two point oh there's this new
class called a URI builder so you see
it's in the package Jack ceresco URI
builder it returns a java.net URI so
here i'm building the uri to access the
web service the rest service so there's
i'm going to create a client so again
that's new on jax-rs to
so I use a client builder to create a
new client this client will return a
response which responds jax-rs okay so i
have this client and I say target what
target the URL so this one the URI you
know one is on and do a request which
one I get could have done a post a
delete so as you can see the API is
quite fluent the response i will read an
entity this is XML so I'll just put it
into a string class and that returns
string java ee 7 books and now i can
print can even print the response status
so hopefully we'll have a two hundred
and well i can print the java 7 books
string so if i run that it's exactly i
will get exactly the same thing okay so
with Jack's arrest too I have now a
client api a portable client api so if
the network is with us yes i have
accessed the amazon web service now I
have all the java ee 7 books and i'm
going to put that into my database okay
so I I won't be doing xml parsing
because that's all in boring so again
I've have a little script here called
sequel and i'm going to show you what i
did behind the scenes with the xml
parsing i took all the data from
amazon and i did and i created this this
file that inserts data in the database
so i've cheated a little bit so i've
done the same for java one so here i
have all the books talking about java ee
7 all the speakers and all the talks
good so everything is in the file but my
database is still empty but now another
alternative thing that you can do is
let's say your api about amazon API
returns only XML representation but
let's say your API is returning JSON
representation then you can use the
newly added J's on processing API to
access the data once you get the stream
back then create a JSON reader or a
parser on it and then parse JSON data
and create your business domain objects
so that's another way which is a new
functionality in the java ee 7 platform
that allows you to parse json very
natively there is no need to bundle a
third-party library basically so here
I'm doing JP a 2.1 not 2.0 so one good
thing with JP I 2.1 is now it can
generate my schema and load data in a
standard way so look what I can do well
first of all I'm getting rid of this
eclipselink thing you know that I'm
saying use the default jpa
implementation of the app server
eclipselink is the default on glassfish
another good thing with jpa 2.1 is the
from now all the observers the EE 7
observers have a default data source so
I can get rid of the data source it will
take the default one then what I need to
do and again with a little help oops
all that the javax dot persistence our
property that are standard they are por
portable throughout app servers and look
what I'm doing here I'm generating the
schema I'm even saying generate the
create script and the drop script script
so you'll have the ddl all that in a
standard away and look at that sequel
load script source so I'm saying when
you deploy this application lo loaded
with the data that is in the insert SQL
file which is the one I've showed you so
if I redeploy the application now these
FEMA generation properties are pretty
extensive because you can tell them that
I want you to create and drop and create
my database either from metadata which
is the entity ends part of your war file
or from a script which is bundled as
part of your war file or the script
could be external to your war file and
in this case we are generating the
script as well so like we could generate
the script say take my metadata generate
my scripts we live somewhere else so
thanks to JP a 2.1 I have data now in my
database okay so i can click on the
books i can go back view them all so
either it's a typical crud you know
application so that's one thing with
java ee 7 we can stand you know in a
standard way load data what else can we
do with java ee 7 well look at the rest
endpoints they are stateless been why
well because they need to access the
persistent layer they need to inject the
entitymanager one thing with java ee 7
is we've taken out all the transaction
out of the ejbs to give it to manage
beans pojos servlet rest endpoints so
people generally say you know i don't
want to use ejb easy jb's are heavy as
for you Oh
yeah so people generally say EJ bees are
heavy i don't like them they're bulky
multiple classes are you telling me just
by putting that at stateless annotation
on a pojo is that ejb yeah that's all
you know those of you DG JB's long a
long time ago the planet has changed and
this was not new in java ee 7 this is
their sense exactly how is 86 what's new
in a 7 is you can say an ejb gives you a
lot of services but here you just want
to access the database so you just want
one service so the good thing with e7 is
you can change it to this new notation
called transactional and look at the
package it comes from javax transaction
so it comes from JTA we've updated JTA
to 1.2 and now we can just do do that so
this is not an ejb anymore it's a POJO
with a rest interface and thanks to
transactional it can access the database
so this code will run like this one
except this one is an ejb then this one
is a rest endpoint with transaction so
as you can see the limit is is narrowing
so by adding that add transactional
annotation on the pojo you said that ok
I want each a method of this pojo to be
transactional all the semantics that
were available as part of a jb are also
available here so for example saying
requires a new transaction or inherit
the parent transaction although
semantics are available the other
advantage is you can also put this a
transactional annotation on a method
that means I don't want all the methods
to be transactional put this on a
specific method and only in that case
that method becomes transactional which
is not possible in case of ejb another
good thing with java ee 7 is we put
being validation in the methods in the
return x and the parameters so something
i can
now with e7 is I can take a method
delete by ID so this is the rest point
now it's transactional instead of
stateless and what I can say now that
we're not work in e6 is I can say the ID
shouldn't be now so this not now is the
good old constraints from being
validation one point oh but I can put it
on a perimeter I can even put it here if
I want the response cannot be now so now
you're going to have to get used to that
we can put our notations in return types
and parameters what else can we do let's
go to the book and forge create some
kind of a rests like your eyes on your
JJ SF pages he chooses the HTTP GET from
jsf to so here if I want to view a book
you see this you arrived here I have the
idea of the book so if i change it one
it goes to a different book see this is
doing HTTP gets how with this tag here f
meter data and i have a view / param and
this is jsf to point to point zero now
what you should do in 2.2 is replace
that with a view action so I replace in
all the files the event listener with a
view action so again if I redeploy the
application things haven't changed so
we've been we've introduced the
transactional being validation on
methods and the new jay a jsf 2.2 tags
but now you know the good thing with jsf
it's people like me I'm I hate web
no layer each webpage i create is really
ugly and really full i tend to give that
to the other guys but I have to be
honest jsf is the only technology that
allows me to do web pages that look you
know kind of knew why because I can
cheat I can go to component libraries
such as primefaces I don't know if
you've heard of primefaces like
richfaces icefaces so these guys are
fantastic components you know like the
calendar look look at that it's full of
JavaScript you know they can do plenty
of sexy stuff that I can't do so the
good thing with yourself is you have
clever clever guys that can create a
component bundle HTML CSS and JavaScript
and create something like that how do
you do it really easily I go back to the
create book and when I create a book I
have a publication date and it's just an
input Texas see when I create a book
here create new book you just an input
text here for the date well look what I
can do I'm just changing one tag I'm
saying this is not an input text is a
fantastic component from primefaces
boobs
so IntelliJ IDEA is Claire is clever
enough say what is P and I said it's
primefaces okay so I've just change one
line I've taken a component from
primefaces or clever you know a clever
guy within your team that creates a nice
component and now i have redeployed the
application and if i want to create a
book I've got a calendar and I can do
even sexier stuff like the search when I
searched a book it you know brings here
a data table what i can do is get rid of
this data table because it's ugly okay i
can get rid of it and i'm going to cheat
a little bit and add a new component
from primefaces but again as you can see
there's not many lines of codes because
i'm mostly the putting the URL the image
of the book and so on and so forth so
I've deleted a bunch of lines to delete
this ugly table I'm adding a component
that someone like me will never be able
to do it because it's full of joy of
JavaScript and stuff like that and now
look at that isn't that nice ed works
you know if I do our room and look for
the books that are enough I've created
there's only one you know if I've
created a authors with a you know I can
so it works and I've taken someone else
brain cell and design you know to just
add a nice component see one thing we
like to measure is in a java ee 7
application your productivity by not the
number of lines you are adding but by
the number of lines you are deleting
from your java ee five and six
applications okay so now we have sexy
books sexy speakers no we can say that
let's have sexy talks now so something
new in EE well in jsf 2.2 is that you
can easily upload a file okay so let's
upload videos how do I do that well
let's meet close all the all the pages I
go to the top bin you know that's my
dress eff backing bin I had something
that has existed uploaded video
something that exists since servlet
three-point oh it's called a part you
see as you can see it's
javax.servlet.http.httpservletrequest
the upload video input stream okay so
this is an input stream here i'm using
the niÃ±o from java SE 7 what I do is I
copy this input stream into my web app I
put in an ID and it's a mp4 okay so look
at the lines of code I'm just saying
take the input stream of the part and
copied to my disk that's all now what I
have to do is on the create talk so when
I create a talk I need to upload the
video what I'll do is I'll go to the
very end
this is new in jsf 2.2 i'm saying i have
a form a multi-part okay so he expects a
binary format and here I have this new
component called input file that will
allow me to browse for a file and you
know uploaded so this is my uploaded
video and when I click on the button it
calls the method upload video so what is
going to do put it into my disk ok so
again very very simple and what what we
want to do then is view the video so
here it's a VIN it's even easier you
know how do you watch a video in java ee
7 well you don't you just use html5 so
here what I'm doing is I use this video
tag so this is just you know the label
and output text is just to Center it in
the page there's only one line i'm using
the html5 video and it takes on the path
of my web app the video the mp4 so I've
redeployed my app hopefully this is
going to work so I go to the talk I take
a talk edit so here you can see the H
input file ok so with one line of code
I'm able to browse yesterday up taking
some videos of my friends I javaone I
click on upload video bang it goes back
to the view and on the view I just use
the html5 video to watch the video so
again jsf 2.2 allows you to upload a
file in this case mp4 and I use html5 to
view the video so that I think this is a
beautiful combination wherein you can
use native html5
I've component tags with DSF 2.2
application how you can mix and match
them to create a truly rich web
application this is 2030 and 13 if you
don't have twitter yeah no good so you
know what we're going to do is we're
going to add a Twitter widget so we just
go to Twitter you know if you have a
twitter account you just click on widget
so here I've created EE 7 so please
tweet with the hashtag java ee 7 like
Antonio and Arun I great java ee 7 is
good you know you can tweet about that
so here I I just go to Twitter I you
know asks me what the color should i use
and so on and so forth and it gives me
two lines of code which I copy ok so
this is Twitter I go back to my code I
go wait a second I go to the template so
forge as create a page template here I
just need to find her I'm going to get
rid of that I know I can do here instead
of you know i can say java ee 7 at
javaone and here i just had these two
lines of code redeploy my up and
hopefully if you so as someone a tweet
with a java ee 7 hashtag so I go back to
my web page refresh it yes experimenting
with jpa 2.1 converters and that's it
really I can have a you know I think one
of the bad things with e 70s we don't
have a proper logo so I've created
no a logo here fo Java e7 welcome to
Java one I get rid of all that see once
again you know your productivity is by
the number of lines of code you are
deleting this is cosmetic in this case
though so Duke here again we are showing
a very subtle feature on how you can use
the source libraries as part of jsf 2.2
yeah here i'm saying i'm taking a
resource from from the web app and you
know if i go back yeah long hair beer
java 7 twitter books sexy books
components talks with videos 58 minutes
I'm that's it not bad coming where I
guess we have two minutes for questions
then
