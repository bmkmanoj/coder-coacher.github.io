someone who can work within a team at
the apartment cks you have to persevere
you can't get enough to understand the
logic of the college I have empathy for
their users posting as patients likes to
soul breathing clearly
their idea into things like human brain
interfaces and machine learning still
believe we have a bright future
despite the self-driving cars and the
artificial intelligence interacting with
our keyboard less layout I think we're
gonna see a lot more voice interaction
with devices themselves it's called the
singularity right
the most beautiful things in a job I
could imagine doing
good morning Chicago and welcome to
Oracle code my name is Cheryl pencil and
I will be EMC for today now today is a
really really really great day and it's
a really great event because we're
actually doing a developer event as
Oracle and when has that be the last
time we talk about a lot of amazing
things
anything that's buzzwords anything
that's trendy technology anything that
people are actually already doing
whether that's AI whether that's chat
BOTS whether that's blockchain we talk
about programming languages databases
and so forth you name it everything is
in there today
it's also a very special day for Java
actually how many people in the room are
Java developers perfect you will love
this keynote you will see it's Java
throughout and you will love this event
today now before we get going just one
small thing there is a mobile phone app
that we have called Oracle events that
allows you to actually follow all the
sessions throughout the day so if you're
somebody who likes to just be on your
smartphone and actually see what's going
on please just go to the App Store our
play store and download Oracle events 18
and and search for order code Chicago
and it will give you the agenda also of
probably more importantly please if
you're on Twitter tweet about this event
we have the hash tag hash or two codes
if you see engaging speakers if you see
your presentations and you will please
go ahead and tweet and shout out and
please also follow us on our new twitter
handle at oracle deaths where we will
share the latest and greatest throughout
social media now said it's a great day
for Java today I personally used to be a
Java developer before I got assimilated
and work for Oracle now still code some
Java in my free time are you ready my
colleague there's laughing how but do
you remember those days like whine back
20 years ago when Java came out right of
the people
like gaudiya Java will never be as fast
as C++ this thing will never take off
and see where we actually now we have
come a very long way throughout those
years throughout those decades literally
and it we have a very bright bright
future ahead of us as well now next the
first keynote speaker Ken cousin will
actually take us through his side of the
things of the past the color the present
and the future of Java of his experience
with Java can also has three books up
here that he will give away for good
questions engaging audience and so forth
he will make sure without further ado
please welcome to the stage Ken cousin
thank you
a moment just getting the mic fixed
thank you
welcome everybody glad to see you all
pardon me as mentioned my name is Ken
cousin I will go through some of this
basically there's my contact information
in case you want to get a hold of me at
any time there's Mike Mike one person
company is cousin IT Incorporated or as
my wife says cousin it it was her idea
yeah what are you gonna do
so I a few years ago I wrote a book
called making Java groovy it's a manning
book and then back in 2016 I wrote a
Reilly book called great old recipes for
Android and my current book the one that
came out last summer is modern Java
recipes that's the one where I have a
couple of copies to give away for
anybody who happens to want that I've
also got a bunch of videos and stuff at
Safari Books online but let me move on
okay basically I like that theme of why
I code as that's pretty much what we're
going to be talking about so this is
more or less my history with Java and
related technologies like so many people
in iti was actually a career changer you
know I started off in something
completely different in fact I was in
engineering
now I originally I thought I was going
to be a professor I was a physicist kind
of thing and I decided to go at it from
two angles from mechanical engineering
and from math and then I went to
graduate school and I was just one of
those people who'd never really wanted
to go out into the real world seemingly
and it was expecting to become a
professor but of course what happened is
the whole academic market collapsed and
that's much worse now now as it turns
out that was a good thing for me I'm
much happier doing what I'm doing now
then I would have been as a professor
but it's ironic that I've now entered a
field where academic advanced academic
degrees are actually viewed with a
healthy degree of skepticism it's like
okay I get it you're gonna tell me what
to do but can you actually code you know
so I don't generally talk about that
much but it just shows that I switched
over now when I was a when I left school
I joined United Technologies at the time
they were the parent company of Pratt &amp;amp;
Whitney aircraft engines and Sikorsky
helicopters and Otis elevators and
carrier Air conditioners just a whole
series of of things like that and pardon
me so when I was working there I was
working in an area called aeroacoustics
of jet engines which meant that my
coding was largely Fortran afraid to say
you know it wasn't my idea I tried to
avoid it but all the numerical libraries
were written in Fortran I had no real
choice we worked on workstations you
know back Sun workstations and IBM AIX
workstations all those sorts of things I
had an office mate I used to work on the
giant supercomputers and he would run
simulations of computational fluid
dynamics that would take months on a
supercomputer and produce gorgeous
pictures which may or may not have meant
anything you know when I look back on
that I realized that I worked on
programs that had somewhere between I
don't know 50 and 75 thousand lines of
Fortran and I now realize that I don't
think I ever saw anything that I would
currently identify as an actual test
case I know darn wonder nobody ever
wanted to touch the code you know
because it's such a potential disaster
there so I decided to switch from
Fortran to Java C Fortran 90 came out
and I thought that was cool and all the
engineers around me were like why do you
care about that and I knew again I was
in the wrong area you know I always
wanted to be more in the IT area and
it's Bruce Eccles thinking in Java book
that made that possible for me that was
quite a member reading the first edition
of that book I think I have a link to
the fourth edition and of course he
could seriously use a fifth one at this
point but that one made the big
difference for me and then I had a
and who ran an AI group at the research
center back then this is roughly the mid
90s so we're talking about 96 97 I
started off in Java at version 1.0.8
something like that not doing anything
very good at it but I that's where I
started off and he ran a group that did
genetic algorithms and neural networks
and things like that and I thought that
was cool but again I was looking for an
excuse to use Java wherever I could and
one thing I did and I think that I
probably am the only person in this room
who has this distinction I actually
wrote a program to put a java swing user
interface on top of a Fortran program
now that I said that than anybody in
here ever do that really my condolences
yeah I have yeah and we had the CBO
whole idea was they had these sensors
that were monitoring elevator behavior
for Otis and we're collecting all this
data and these massive data files see as
big as six gigs you know they were huge
right and back then that was big and of
course these statistical algorithms and
the AI algorithms were either in Lisp
which they weren't using at the time or
Fortran and I decided to put a java
swing GUI on it and I have a couple of
conclusions for that first of all don't
do that okay
secondly is it turns out Jay and I
really is a thing or at least it was
then and then of course the third one is
well it worked on my machine you know I
was never able to deploy it anywhere
else but it did work for a little while
and it was fun and I learned a lot but
that was the sort of thing I was
battling at the time of course what I
finally realized when I moved over to
this AI group is that 1012 years of
coding and Fortran hadn't really taught
me anything about software development I
tried to use good structure and
everything but Fortran had these things
called common blocks and I don't know if
you're familiar with Fortran but common
blocks is basically global data in other
words it was exactly the wrong thing to
do and of course anything could change
anything and it was just a disaster
so anyway I decided it was time to go
back to school at that point and I wound
up getting
a master's of computer science at night
and also I wound up getting that son
certified Java developer thing now that
back when getting certifications was a
thing too you know when that was a big
deal that again I owe a debt of
gratitude to Kathy Sierra and probably
Bert Bates as well not for the thinking
and not for the head for his job a book
this is before all that but for the fact
they created Java ranch and that was a
great place to study for certification
some of you may remember that if you're
back then back in the field at that time
eventually I got the son certified web
component developer and the business
component developer the head first EJB
book was the first time I understood EJ
B's at all so that was very very helpful
and unlike being in in in academia or in
a research area suddenly I had options
you know I suddenly I could actually
move around see this was roughly 2000
and the the bubble had burst but we
didn't know it yet okay so I had options
and I decided what I really wanted to do
was teach software development training
classes because this way I can always
learn the newest things you know learn
what was going on and then tell
everybody about it and that's what I
liked the most I've never been as
interested in being the person who comes
up with an API I'm much more interested
in learning about an API and then
helping other people use it that's much
more fun for me so that's what I got to
do so when I wound up back in 2000
becoming a trainer I guess you'd say
back then you teach an intro java class
a month and they would fill every month
um it was it was a big deal for a while
there and a lot of C++ people a lot of
VB people I remember vb6 I think it was
it was a mess and I wrote a little
applet and like like we all did back
then to start playing with some of this
job of stuff now I that's so many hard
drive crashes ago I I don't have the
code for that anymore but what I was
able to do was to resurrect that as an
actual swing user interface I actually
have it here I think so if I if I run
this I'll give you an idea what it looks
like you like my little nyan progress
bar by the way any rate
so what would happen now again this was
an applet in class but I'm writing it as
a desktop app now they said it would
take a bunch of terms that would come up
during class and just shuffle them and
grab the first nine and build a bingo
board and as you heard them during class
you would click on them and it would
just change color and disable the button
and if you got three in a row I actually
went to the trouble to find the old
Windows 3.1 - dasu - put in there and of
course the best part is you would win
fabulous prizes at the time the fabulous
prizes I used were wild cherry
lifesavers as I recall so this actually
now that I'd wasted so much time left so
I actually built this again in Java and
swing and this is in a github repository
that I have so if you want it now I even
have a menu now that lets me reset it
and restart so you know there we go and
I can mute it too by the way so that's
good but that was the sort of thing I
was doing finding an excuse to use the
Java coding to help other people learn
this stuff because the real battle in an
intro java class is learning the oo part
especially the terms because it's you
know whenever there's a choice between a
two syllable word and a 10 syllable word
they always went with the 10 syllable
word we can't say wrap we have to say
encapsulate right we can't say make we
have to say instantiate or even creates
not enough and the worst part is you
start talking like that you know so any
rate that was a mechanism to help people
learn that stuff so there's a picture of
that for example so it used to swing you
I and as I say it's in my github repo I
used the collections API this was pretty
new back then 1.2 and everything and of
course I had the resources in a wav file
and basically I could give people now of
course I generate a jar file with main
method in it so that you could just
double click on the jar file and start
it up
but back then of course it was an applet
so I would run a version of Tomcat
during class and people could access the
URL and just refresh their page each
time play with it that way now another
one that was a lot more ambitious
yeah the fabulous prizes of course I
wrote this thing called I called it
jeopardy just desperate
trying to avoid that is that trademark
or copyright infringement I'm not sure
which one but I was trying to avoid both
I suppose and this was basically a game
where I would put a game board in the
front of the room and then each person
in the room would get a little buzzer on
their machine again it was a jar file
they could just double click on it start
off a buzzer and this used RMI so
remember when that was a thing too so
that when you join the game you could
access the game board and all the scores
were kept by teams and at the time I
made the the database was everything was
on Windows at the time so I was using
the dreaded son Jay DBC ODBC JDBC ODBC
bridge driver remember that monster so
yes slow but who cared I didn't need an
actual database driver I just needed to
set it up as an ODBC data source on the
instructor machine and everything worked
fine
well I again so many hard drive crashes
ago but I actually found the code for
this one as a jar file and then I had to
go through the battle of downloading it
because gmail didn't want me to download
a zip / jar you know but eventually I
got it and I can't really show you that
code because I'm embarrassed at this
point I mean you know if you haven't if
you look at code you wrote 15 years ago
and you're not embarrassed I guess you
haven't learned anything I suppose but
you know but to give you an idea how
this worked so let me go to this one
here so I ran it with an ant build and
if I start up ant now I did switch the
driver so I'm using this you access
driver that is still accessing it the
same database that I made at the time so
I can get the categories and it'll give
me some some categories to grab and when
I select it I can create the gameboard
and this is what the game board looked
like and there's all the different
buttons and of course I was using
inheritance for the buttons it's a
question button that extends a J button
etc but even better if I go to here then
I can run let's magnify that a bunch I
could say Java - jar and then I think
it's in the dist folder and this would
be a client
so the
it would get a player in a team name so
let's put in a guru from Oracle of
course and of course the servers on
localhost so there's my there's my first
button and no reason I can't run another
one so if I go down to downloads again
let's run it again s jar just Jeff there
we go
and let's put this as a noob and I'll
put that I guess at Google right that
makes sense yeah so here would be the
buzzers on the machines around the room
and then I could switch over to the game
board in fact why don't I move that over
to where the buzzers are just so you
could see the whole thing like that and
you see how the scores were kept by team
so the team would come up here and
whenever I'd open up a question then
somebody could buzz in and there was a
sound and everything and and I'd say
whether it was right or wrong you see
that the scores could go up or down and
I'm really shocked to tell you that this
still works you know I I really can't
believe it I again I have to clean up a
lot of the code but man I'm thinking I
might even use this again sometime of
course the best part is let's see
where's my IDE here the Daily Double
is at 1/4 here so that would be 0 1 2 3
I think it's here nope the other one
let's click give them a score to 0 1 2
there it is there's the Daily Double so
then we click on it and then of course
you'd wager up to whatever your score
was and then actually had the wave file
in there and everything so hopefully
that was right
so anyway play that game and that was a
lot of fun and eventually that'll be in
my github repo as well if you're
interested but again it's all working
with an ant build at the moment so it
could run RM IC and everything I'm just
shocked that it's still working after
all these years the most fun I had with
that by the way or maybe not the most
fun but the weirdest situation I had
with that is of course I would make a
separate table for each course I was
teaching and this was the job a table
and I'd make different tables for
different courses but one time we were
having an open house at a training
company and there were a lot of salesmen
coming through so I made a board just
for the salespeople or whatever and I
learned something interesting about
salespeople the salespeople didn't care
at all about getting the questions right
they just wanted to be first so as soon
as I bring up a question you hear bang
bang bang bang is everybody's banging on
the button to try to get a hold of it
and you have scores of - 500 - a
thousand - twelve and they didn't care
at all they just wanted to be in there
first of all so go figure but it was a
lot of fun and again it was an excuse to
to write something Java related on all
of that so let me go back here
now of course in 2005 you'll probably
remember when the good old Ruby on Rails
meteor hit the Java world shaking
everything up so dramatically and at the
time I figured fine I'll go learn some
of that as well and unfortunately I I
wasn't really able to to learn Ruby very
well at that time now I probably could
look at it now and get it much better
but at the time it was much harder so a
year later I was in a I was attending a
spring users group user group meeting
and they had a presentation by Jason
Rudolph who was talking about Grails and
Grails involves spring and hibernate
both of which I was reasonably familiar
with and of course the ideas from Ruby
on Rails so I jumped into that of course
jumping into that man I had to jump into
groovy and to me it was like it wasn't
really leaving Java because groovy is
about as close a language as you can get
to Java and in fact Ruby's never
designed to replace job is designed to
supplement it every groovy system I've
ever worked with eventually has Java in
it as well so I could leverage all my
job in knowledge and had a lot of groovy
stuff so rather than look at any of the
the Grails apps or anything like that I
do want to mention something groovy
related I wrote an app called groovy
baseball and what this one did is it
consumed a restful web service that one
being provided by Google in the form of
their geo coder you send them an address
and you download either XML or JSON and
you could parse it and get latitude and
longitude data out of it and then I took
the data for the stadium locations and
save them into an h2 database so that I
could distribute this to people and
parse all the data to get the scores of
the games out of it and I use Gradle
with Gradle for the build tool with a
greddy
plug-in to allow me to deploy it so as
an example of this this is
let's see here you know I've got all the
team names and everything and I'm able
to grab the stadiums out of there and
create all of this is going to wind up
matching patterns and and doing the
Jason slurper to pull the data down and
all of that but the neat part is is that
I can actually run this by saying that
could say Gradle W and then can't
remember this app run or run app I think
it's app run from the Gradle plugin what
this will do is it'll deploy it on jetty
interestingly enough now they this
plug-in allows you to allows you to
deploy on jetty or Tomcat or a cluster
of all the above and there now it's
listening on port 8080 under groovy
baseball so if I can go here so if I
open this up and paste that in this is
what it does it brings up a Google map
and it's downloading the scores for a
given game and it starts with yesterday
and you can see these were all pulled
out of the Major League Baseball data
that's available online so again this
actually isn't a github repository this
is for my making job a groovy book so
all the code is there in case you want
that I've been updating that and pushing
changes to that as well and it was a
nice illustration of the sorts of things
you could do with groovy and therefore
underlying with Java as well so that was
a lot of fun ok ok now this one the
vampire movies one what was happening is
I was writing this this making job of
groovy book and I wandered into my local
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble remember when that was a
thing you know and I noticed that there
was only one shelf at the time that was
labeled computer and there were three or
four labeled teen paranormal romance so
I thought the only thing I can do now is
I'm gonna need to you know clearly what
my book needed was some groovy vampires
you know so I had to add that now what I
wound up doing is I consume data from
the Rotten Tomatoes API turns out that
had a restful web service as well and
because that was all Jason data I would
store it in a Mongo database so it gave
me a chance to play with no sequel as
and then I could actually take the data
and serve it up myself using either
rat-pack or Grails I don't know if
you're familiar with rat-pack at all
it's a micro service framework in the
groovy world that's based on the ideas
from of course Sinatra from the Ruby
world I mean just the fact it's called
Rat Pack I thought was sufficiently
amusing I had to try it out you know and
of course brailles does it as well now
that one unfortunately I can't
demonstrate I was playing with it and it
turned out that Rotten Tomatoes has been
acquired by Fandango I think and they
have their own API and they now say
right on the site they no longer permit
unrestricted access to their data you
actually have to fill out a form
proposing what you're going to do and I
figured no that's way too silly you know
so I haven't done that but I still have
the code and everything interestingly
enough now of course I
I took my book and I got my local Barnes
&amp;amp; Noble to actually get a couple of
copies and I put it it was in the IT
section and after a while I figured well
you know it's got vampires in it so I
took a copy of it and I moved it over to
the teen paranormal romance section but
unfortunately it just sat there for a
while and then one day I came in and it
was actually gone and I thought oh boy
somebody actually bought it I couldn't
believe it so I went to the info desk
and no they just moved it so apparently
the overlap between say you know
fourteen-year-old vampire you know fan
fiction fans and Java Ruby developers is
not as big as I was hoping so so much
for that
okay now later I was on the the no fluff
just stuff tour I'm still on that now
and we needed somebody to do some
Android presentations and of course
androids Java right except that depends
on whether you which lawyers you talk to
I suppose and I'm not going to get in
the middle of that one
but it was certainly easy enough for me
to learn because it was Java based you
know the whole idea so I'll stick with
Java based and hope that doesn't ruffle
any feathers the wrong way but feel free
to let me know and in order to play with
that I decided I was gonna go grab yet
another restful web service and for that
I went to I see NDB comm which is the
internet Chuck Norris native
like it's one of those serves up Chuck
Norris jokes and you have to be careful
with that because unfortunately not all
those jokes are really suitable for
public consumption you know so I have to
be dicey about it but if you restrict
them to just the nerdy jokes then you
get the good ones like I think my
favorite was Chuck Norris can make a
method abstract and final but there's a
pretty good skill so at any rate I have
that over here no the other one so this
one as you could see I put Brian gets in
there for the for the actual name and I
have it in Java here let's actually go
to the Java version and the Java version
is using well javis basically retrofit
and an async task and I'm also using
retrofit either synchronously or
asynchronously if you ever do look for a
library to do restful Web Services
retrofit is an excellent one by the way
it's from Jake Wharton at square well it
used to be at square now at Google okay
and I use a lot of that and I can go in
and I could change the actually let's
let me run this one because I think I'm
looking at the other one so if I execute
this one course it's taking a while
isn't it there we go now okay this has a
tiny bit of a story as well I made this
whole app and I use it as a teaching app
again to present how to write an app
that did restful Web Services and save
data and and did networking in
asynchronous tasks and all that all of
that and then I put it in the Google
Play Store because why not
you know and a little while later I got
an email from patent Boggs LLP the
attorneys for mr. Carlos Rey quote Chuck
Norris did you know Chuck Norris's first
actual name is Carlos Reyes I had no
idea
anyway it was claiming I was infringing
on his intellectual property and I'm
like I don't get it I'm consuming data
from a public website I'm giving this
away
what's the problem so I ignored it and a
week later Google's suspended my app
right now normally I'm way too much of a
coward to do anything about that but
this time I got annoyed so I rewrote it
as the Internet Carlos ray database and
if you actually went to Google Play so
if I go to play google.com and I look at
the I got to go to the apps section so
here's the apps section and I search on
I see NDB I think that'll do it
then here it is see the and you see I
even put the lawyers name right on the
icon there you know what that why not
right what are they gonna do make me
take it down again you know and you put
your pictures up there when Carlos Rey
throws exceptions it's across the room
or you know when Carlos Rey writes code
with bugs the bugs fixed himself a court
by the way you know I gave it a five
star rating you know I mean why not you
know and I have a few others and see
it's got you know best Carlos ray app
ever that's phenomenal I love that you
know I tried them all and this is the
Westmont you know so again I gave it out
then I did the one thing you can't do by
the way which is I lost the the key you
know because you have to you have to
sign it with a private or with your
public key you have to put a digital
signature on the apk and it's not for
encryption purposes it's for
non-repudiation
so if it goes wrong they know who to
blame you know and I lost my repo or
whatever it not the repo and trying to
think what all the certificate and
therefore I can't update it anymore but
of course I have much more update
versions this one like uses retrofit
this is using Hans doctors the head of
the Gradle project you know and I can
use synchronously and asynchronously
I've got Tim O'Reilly in there so I have
a whole series of them now so that code
is all available if you're interested
and it might get hep repository as well
as I see NDB underscore a s for Android
studio and of course recently I've had
to get into Kotlin a little bit here's
the shocking part this is prickly pretty
much the entire app in Kotlin I do have
this file which contains the classes
that map to the JSON structure come
back see I like this Jason example
because it's small and it's funny you
know hopefully but it's sufficiently
small that I could just write a couple
of classes and get back to see there's
my type as a is okay and and my rapper
has an ID and a joke and a list of
categories and then inside here it turns
out in Kotlin you can extend app compat
activity there's the base URL that I'm
going to access and I can actually use
Google's jisan and they even have do a
sync and then UI thread to get off of
the UI thread to do the networking and
then back on the UI thread in order to
execute it and this is the one where of
course I decided to use Brian gets as
the person we want to deal with so
clicking there never has to build
program to machine code machines have
learned to interpret Brian gets go
that's not bad let's see that's dated
see if we can do better yeah you do
better than that
okay that's not bad I mean it depends
you know and you can play with that as
well so I spent some time playing with
Android and now I'm using that as a way
to get into Collins somewhat mostly
because I do Android and also I do
Gradle and Gradle adding a Colin DSL as
well so I need to learn some of that so
any rate back to where we work so
there's your pictures these are some
pretty good ones can spawn threads to
complete before they're started that's a
good one or can't test for equality
because he has no equal I like that yeah
yeah all right so at the time then I
wound up writing this Gradle recipes for
Android book so it talks about Gradle as
part of the build tool lots of tips and
tricks and then just to kill all the
sales entirely if you were to go to
Gradle dot-org in the book section you
can download this book for free they
will ask you for an email address and
they you know they want to find out if
they can mark it to you for Gradle
enterprise but if you're willing to give
them an email address they'll send you a
link and you can have that book for free
now so there you go okay now then of
course Java eight finally came out and
we'd been waiting for years for that
speaking of Brian gets of course it was
instrumental and and all the the
functional changes in Java
eight or se8 I suppose I finished the
cradle recipes for Android book and then
I had this foolish notion that hey I
just wrote a recipes book for O'Reilly
how hard could it be to write another
recipes book for O'Reilly not realizing
that this one was going to be you know
three twice the size and much more
complicated and everything but this gave
me a chance to play with the streams and
lambdas and Method references and all
these different things as well which
need no introduction for you I mean for
this audience I'm sure you're quite
familiar with all of that of course Java
9 has been out so I have a chapter on
Java 9 that does minimal not a whole lot
of stuff but talks about private methods
and interfaces and and additions to
various classes and and some and a
little bit about JPM s as well so some
of that stuff is in there I thought I'd
show you one unusual example this is
they say you can tell a developer by
whispering in their ear the word
timezones and watching a shudder go down
their spine okay and this is the picture
of time zones in Antarctica okay so
there's a scary picture now in fact the
funny part doesn't even jump out at you
until somebody points it out here's the
funny part you see the South Pole here
the South Pole is part of what they call
the Ross dependency and that means it
follows the timezone rules it turns out
of New Zealand and what this means is
that the South Pole six months of
darkness followed by six months of
daylight is actually on daylight savings
time believe it or not well now of
course that they now that the Java dot
time package has been added to Java I
can actually check that sort of thing so
I can go over to IntelliJ let's see this
is here and this is my sorry this one
this is my Antarctica time zones app
which gets all the available zone IDs
turns them into a stream filters them by
Antarctica map's them to zone IDs by the
directly and then creates a own date
time using now at zone now is just local
date time now
and I sort them by their offset from UTC
in terms of seconds and when I execute
this you can see the time zones in
Antarctica here listed one by one this
trolls got to be a joke I don't know
what that I mean taking that literally
and I have another version of this app
in the book I'm not showing it right now
that actually checks daylight savings
time and yes indeed the South Pole
currently is on daylight savings time
believe it or not I have one other
somewhat amusing app from that same idea
if you are I'm sure we have some people
from India or people who have had
conference calls with people from India
or been there if you know anything about
India you know that the India Standard
Time which of course there's no such
thing right it's all UTC offset and
region IDs any rate Indian Standard Time
is UTC plus 5:30 see there half an hour
offset from GMT interestingly enough so
I thought well that's interesting and
then somebody said to me did you know
that there are time zones in the world
that are 45 minutes offset from UTC and
I'm like you're pulling my leg so now in
fact this is based on an example in the
Java tutorial but the one in the Java
tutorial doesn't use streams so of
course I had to clean that up so this
one gets a zone date time and then maps
them to zone IDs and I filter them by
ones with an offset that is not an
integral multiple of 3600 for the
seconds okay so again sort them and now
I'll print out the offset and the zone
ID and the localized day time and of
course my favorite method here is the
width own same instant so you could find
out what time it is there and when I run
this then you'll see for example that
there's a bunch of half-hour offsets
even in Canada Newfoundland apparently
st. John's is half an hour offset there
you go there's Katmandu and with both
with and without the age turns out all
of Nepal is UTC plus 545 go figure this
one I got it I gotta ask one of my
Australian friends eucla I had to look
it up in Wikipedia it's a an old railway
station population 600 okay go figure
8:45 and then the Chatham Islands off of
New Zealand as well so again just try
keep things a little bit entertaining
and their examples in the book as well
so okay now I have to of course talk to
you about cat pictures right I mean
that's the reason we have the Internet
at all
and what I wound up doing is again I'm
using Java now but I'm still using
groovy to an extent and Kotlin to an
extent as well so what I did is I went
to Flickr and Flickr has what we would
well what they would call a restful web
service but that real rest advocates
would be appalled by you know cuz it
actually has method names in it and all
of that by the way you know what those
rest advocates call themselves do you
know that yeah they call those Resta for
ian's you believe that yeah I I didn't
come up with that one you know
oh speaking of jokes I didn't come up
with a million monkeys that a million
typewriters will eventually type a Java
program and the rest will be Perl
programs
feel free to reuse that yeah oh and I
suppose if we have time at the very end
I can give you the worst sequel joke
ever told so but there's no going back
after that so I have to do that the very
end but I do have a good no sequel
variation so any rate I decided to
consume this Flickr API with a get
request and parse it and use groovy to
do this and what I want to show you is I
actually have this app called parallel
kitties so that I can actually use Java
eight streams in parallel to download
all the pictures ostensibly at the same
time so if I go to that so oh it's
actually that's the same one here
so this is groovy code I've got my
flickr key and you know that meant i had
to go and get a key at Yahoo and boy
that's painful so it's in the repo try
not to do any serious damage you know
whatever and I search on kitties and
here's the API I'm gonna do a Flickr
photo search I want JSON data back and
photos only once six per page and this
is going to take those parameters and
build a query string out of it and I'll
print out the URL and then groovy will
let me convert that to a URL and the
string representing a URL into an
instance of java.net URL and then
download the data at that location so
I'll get back to JSON data I write it to
a file pretty printing it and then I
parse it and grab the photo elements
inside there there's a root element and
it has photos and then inside each
photos inside the photos block pardon me
there are photo elements and now here's
where I'm going to use my Java eight
parallel streams so I take my photos as
a collection and I use my map method and
I could print out the thread to see
which which thread each one is using but
right now I'm not printing that at the
moment this is the URL Flickr uses for
the actual image so I pull data off of
the JSON structure and plug it into this
URL and that'll give me the image and I
go turn into a URL and get the bytes so
this will all in principle happen in
parallel collect them into a list of
images and then this is a swing builder
using on the events dispatch thread
where I make a jframe and I put each
image and an image icon you see how
groovy likes to mix Java and groovy
pretty much line by line pretty much the
same now I'm gonna run this but I have
to warn you I don't know what I'm gonna
get okay once I got tractors and I might
track 200 caterpillar
I get it you know once I got dogs I got
monkeys I have no idea if it's it's just
gonna be the latest six images that are
tagged with the word kitties which I
figured is as good as I can get if it's
totally inappropriate I'll just close it
okay so you know you're warned let's see
what happens here so if I run this guy
you'll see that there's the J
and data coming out and then it's
downloading the images ah looks like I
got cats how about that and I even put
in the mouse over I think or did the
mouse over not working well any rate I'm
declaring victory you know that that's a
win right the fact that they actually
look like cats is a pretty good one
so there's your concurrent or I suppose
parallel kitties can you design for
concurrency you implement in parallel
right and this was trying to execute in
parallel again if I uncommented this
line I could see the individual threads
running out of all of that so now of
course I mentioned the past and this is
getting pretty much up to the present
the president of course is that Java ten
comes out today yay you know so that'll
be good right yeah feel free go get uh
plot that except that's shouldn't be
flooding me for that right that'll be a
lot of other people but there'll be
talks all day long on that of course we
have our outline of our our agenda of
what's going on today and there'll be
lots of opportunities to learn these
things and I guess one of the messages
that I feel like is that Java has
basically been the background music to
my career change you know to the second
half of my career I was a very unhappy
person in engineering working on things
I didn't enjoy in a company I didn't
like and as the first time I saw Java
I'm like hey I like that remember when
it was small you know that was fun I was
like wow this is really good I like this
and over the years I've just found
plenty of things in the Java ecosystem
that I've always enjoyed doing and when
Java kind of stagnated for a while with
Sun then I was able to move to the
groovy ecosystem and see a lot of
innovation over there and find out about
all the functional ideas etc and then
when Java came out with se8
from Oracle then now I'm able to boot
back into that area also and I'm really
looking forward to whatever happens in
the future as well
so enjoy the rich ecosystem around Java
I mean there's plenty of stuff there
there's always something that looks
appealing to me any rate I really like
of course you based on the fact that I I
negotiated a royalty on the book that I
just told you how to download for free
you don't want me negotiating your next
contract just letting you know on that
particular one so what I will say is I
do have these books to give out I don't
have a good way to do it so I do want to
say one thing that we're having that
Women in Technology luncheon right so
one of the any woman who's planning to
go to that or whatever here give this to
one of them yeah okay right up front
that's perfect I mean if I can help
support women in computer science I mean
that's a good thing and then the rest
can go to anybody so here you're gonna
pick somebody I'll do I do I pick so
okay there's one back behind there and
then somebody further in the back sure
back in one of the last two or three
rows on the left there yeah and if you
didn't get one you know talk to me I've
got some ebooks too I can I can work
something out but there that's basically
what I wanted to talk to you about I
wanted to give you a little bit of my
history in the Java world and how Java
has really enabled my career basically
you know I'm now this Java champion this
Oracle Def Jam it's just it's funny how
that is as evolved and oh I guess I
should show you in case you are
interested other way no here's the
github repository I was mentioning so
the github repository is kind of get to
get rid of that picture but any rate is
on my last name okay kou sen and i have
several of them the making job a groovy
one I've got the ICN DB one in there the
bingo app is there and the job eight at
Java nine recipes is also in there
that's from the the actual book itself
this is a reactive spring because you
got to you got to follow the buzzwords
right so I saw that they had the
buzzwords up there for blockchain and
and all the others but I'm looking at
reactive as well with spring five and a
handful of others so you're welcome to
take anything you find there and good
luck with it
so I'm gonna basically leave it at that
point
and say thank you very much and I hope
you enjoy your day today
you're really you're gonna regret that
I'm telling you this is a bad move
okay worst sequel joke ever told you
ready sequel query walks into a bar
selects two tables says mind if I join
you
that's really awful in it here's here's
though no wait wait a minute I got a
better one the no sequel variation DBA
walks into a no sequel bar can't find a
table so he leaves that's ok alright
thank you very much fantastic thank you
very very much can really enjoy could we
switch the slides over please thank you
perfect
okay thank you
so they loved the joke and I don't see
anything wrong with running COBOL with
Java or perhaps great this was a great
great personal story and surely very
much about the history of Java for an
individual thank you very much can now
we actually heading towards the future
our next keynote speaker George saps
will tell us about where Java is going
he's the vice president of our Java
platform group so you can ask him all
sorts of questions Chavez all day long I
also have to warn you we had a slight
debate whether or not to put this
picture up there because the person the
gentleman who will come up a stage in a
minute does not really look much of the
picture at least I think anyway without
further ado please welcome George Saabs
thank thanks Cheryl you know I like to
tell people this is my evil doppelganger
look no seriously it you know it's sort
of like Ken was talking about earlier
that's kind of how I looked you know
when I started this job and it's really
you know don't start a job like this
you'll like grow a beard and it'll turn
gray and it's it's really really
difficult this next slide is uh-oh it's
switched over the wrong way here we go
is always fun so please memorize this
there'll be a quiz I like to start first
of all just to reflect a little bit on
on the things that Ken was talking about
here because for us you know ken is
really kind of typifies the experience
we like to see that people have which
are right for him Java is not just a
tool that he uses it's something that he
clearly loves it's something that has
helped to shape his career and the
direction of it and you know basically
to summarize what he said at the end it
turned him from a really miserable
person in a bad situation to a guy who
just loves his life and you know it
really shows and and you know nothing
that's gonna happen for everyone who
programs in Java but it could so you
know if you don't you might want to try
seriously though the the four things
that you see on this slide or some of
the things that we think about when we
think about the Java community right and
all of the resources available one thing
that's important to us is communication
around Java and you know this is kind of
one example that Oracle funds the Java
magazine which if you haven't checked it
out please do it's it's just a
tremendous tremendous resource it's
beautiful and it has great articles and
I didn't write any of them so I can I
can actually say that or I have it yet
anyway I've submitted but they'll never
take mine so in any event there are a
lot of other publications that are great
there
are wonderful resources in the user
groups and in fact later today there
will be a Chicago Java user group
meeting it's I think it's six o'clock we
have some more information and I and
some other folks from my team will be
there to answer your questions so please
join us for that collaboration will Ken
mention that he's a job a champion for
anyone who who's not aware of this
program this is actually a program which
recognizes people who have been
instrumental in making Java successful
and continue to do so and you know
typically this is people who have done
that not just as a part of their career
but or their sort of daily work but
people who have gone above and beyond
and this is a program that Oracle takes
part in and helps to fund but it really
is run by the Java champions themselves
so the people who are in that are chosen
by Java champions and and if you go and
look and see who some of the people are
there I think you'll recognize some of
the best speakers in the industry some
of the best minds in the industry and
and we really appreciate everything they
do final C here is his contribution and
I'm going to talk a little bit today
about open JDK because this is where the
the construction of Java really goes on
today and I think that this is actually
at the moment kind of a an underutilized
resource in terms of figuring out the
direction that Java is taking the design
decisions that are made you can see in
open JDK the current state of
development and the discussions around
new features it can help you understand
why certain decisions are made and
really get some insight you can even do
things like look at individual code
contributions patches and fixes as they
go in and even the code reviews so it's
a great place if you want to learn about
Java and you want to learn about its
direction to go and sign up for the
mailing lists and kind of understand
where things are headed
okay so this is sort of the Harper's
index of numbers around Java I won't go
into great detail here let's you know
just suffice it to say that in the last
just over two decades Java has gone from
you know something that was kind of new
and exciting and as Ken said small to
something that is big in every respect
sorry that was a not a very good joke in
fact you know Java is is tremendously
popular it is a great choice if you want
to learn a technology and know that
there's gonna be a lot of demand for
your expertise it's just a terrific
place to go and I think this is
something that you know we've always
viewed as an important facet of Java we
try to make Java something where the
programs that you write will continue to
work and the techniques that you learn
will continue to be relevant
even if new ones come along and in many
ways what we try to do is do a lot of
the heavy lifting so that when the
computing environment around you changes
you're somewhat insulated from that and
so this is I'll give you just an example
of this we saw an application that
camera at him now he said well I took
this code and it still ran and I think
what you failed to mention was the
version of Java that you were running
was a current one right it was probably
Java 8 and when you originally wrote it
it was probably 1.2 it had swings so it
had to be 1 not 2 at least right so
that's you know that that seems really
simple and obvious but the more
experience you have in our industry the
more you realized that that's actually
kind of an anomaly it's something kind
of special when something that he wrote
20 years ago he can just take and and
run and it still still works another
example you know as we move forward
there are lots of things around you that
are changing the hardware is changing
the operating systems are changing and
in fact even the
I mean language and api's they're
changing but what we've tried to do is
make it so that your Java program
actually will still work and be able to
take advantage of all of those things
that are changing around you so this is
sort of something that you know may not
reflect on too much but if you think
about it as hardware is improving
software doesn't necessarily
automatically get all of that
improvement somebody is doing the hard
work of actually making it so that your
Java program converted into byte codes
and then into native code is actually
writing to use the optimizations in the
underlying hardware and you know there's
a lot of heavy lifting that goes on
there a lot of it comes from my team but
frankly with open JDK a lot of it comes
from the industry as a whole and so what
I mean by this is if you go to open JDK
you will see people from work all taking
part you'll also see people from places
like red Red Hat and Microsoft taking
part you'll also see hardware
manufacturers like Intel and arm taking
part and so you know that's that's
pretty neat and pretty unique and it
really can only happen because of the
open ecosystem around the development of
Java ok so I mentioned this before Java
development is is done in the open and
increasingly so and I'll mention
something on that in a moment it's
evolving and and as Ken said there was a
little period there where not so much
what's happening there actually was a
lot happening then there were just not
new major versions of Java the VM was
continuing to evolve the implementation
of Java was evolving but essentially the
language in the API is we're not going
through a lot of change what we have
seen and what we're seeing increasingly
going for it is more change more rapid
change and hopefully more rapid change
that improves your life doesn't make it
harder and so you know what I'm pleased
to say is we have a lot of tools in the
Java ecosystem to make sure that
as we're moving into the more rapid
change with six-month releases that is
something that happens in a way that
that works smoothly I'll give you an
example of this has anyone heard of the
TCK do you know what that is okay so
only one person and he works for me so
that doesn't count
so the the D CK or sometimes it's also
called j ck is a compatibility test kit
for java it is something that we've
built up over the last twenty years it
has literally hundreds of thousands of
tests that test compatibility of the
Java implementation to make sure that it
is consistent across different operating
systems and platforms and windowing
systems and also across versions of Java
so this is something and this this
sounds really simple and obvious right
of course
there's a test suite but keep in mind
this is a test suite testing and
implementation against the specification
of Java now how many of you you know on
a daily basis read the Java
specification a lot of people well I'm
not surprised by that there is I will
say a colleague of mine here on the
front row who is heartbroken to hear
this because he spends a good deal of
his time making sure that the Java
specification is up-to-date that it is
complete that it is good and consistent
and coherent and in fact I'm going to
bring him up to say a few words in a few
in a moment here so he can he can Damone
the fact that you don't all read the
specification every single day having
said that you shouldn't have to right
nobody should have to but it is there
and it is fairly unique I think you'll
find for programming languages that Java
has this and it is something that means
that we are have you know a great
resource to be able to tell as we're
making changes whether those changes are
going to break you or
not and try to make sure that we're not
breaking things so you know essentially
our goal is as we're moving forward more
quickly to make sure that we're doing so
methodically and carefully and in a way
that's that's making improvements I'm
going to also mention scalability
because I think that this is something
that we've sort of noticed over the past
probably three or four years you know we
see the other programming languages that
are out there and that have gained some
traction can mention will be there are
certain certainly others that were
recently have been getting a lot of
enthusiasm and noise and this we
actually think is great we have a lot of
those are actually built on the JVM some
of them are not but I will say that
there's a tremendous community around
programming language development most of
those folks all kind of know each other
many of them are actually on speaking
terms which is is great in fact more
than that we we actually have a small
conference which we've hosted for almost
a decade now where people who are
working on programming languages get
together and talk about their
experiences because you know this is
something we are you know we think that
most designers of programming languages
have more to learn from each other from
talking and sharing and kind of
understanding well you know what did you
guys try over here how did that work has
it gone well is it not gone well what
you know what new possibilities that
bring about what kinds of challenges
were inherent and and and so that's kind
of cool
one of the things we've seen with all of
these languages that have come around is
that many of them sort of they come
about there's a lot of enthusiasm and
kind of growing community around them
and then over time people kind of figure
out the things that they're good for and
maybe the things that are not quite as
good for one of the things that we've
seen is kind of an ongoing trend is a
lot of people trying these out as a way
of getting more rapid development right
this is something that really supports
me I can I don't have to write as much
code it does a lot of things for me but
then often
that is is great when you're getting
started and you just want to get
something up and running because
nobody's gonna keep funding you if they
can't see that you built anything on the
other hand the next step is going from
that to you know hundreds of thousands
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
millions hundreds of millions of users
and when you need to get to that level
of scalability many of these tools that
are new or have not quite gotten to the
point of maturity yet where they can
handle that and so a lot of people have
been turning to Java so we've we found
there sort of a complete group of people
who maybe weren't introduced to Java
maybe they you know thought it didn't
seem that appealing it was like oh man
my mom wrote in that language I don't
want to write in that language but you
know now they found that you know when
they really need something that's going
to support them for the next stage of
their growth they turned to Java as as
that thing our goal now is actually to
get back to the point where people never
need to make that first step of choosing
wrong and they can just choose Java from
the beginning so that's part of what the
six-month releases are about is making
it so that some of the small
improvements that we do you don't have
to wait for two or three years for them
to become available to you in a ga
version instead you can get them right
off the bat okay
this is also something we're seeing as
as people move to the cloud is you know
very interestingly there are a bunch of
clouds out there that are provided by
vendors other than us I know that comes
as a surprise but in fact there are and
in fact what we tend to see is a lot of
noise from many of those vendors about
Java and you know part of the reason is
what they tend to find is that a lot of
the workloads that people run in the
cloud are actually Java workloads
okay so on the platform side what are
some of the things we're investing in
well I I want to say first and foremost
that security is always our number-one
priority
so you know we will always if we have a
choice between working on making
something more secure or adding a new
API you always will work on security
first and I think we're gonna see that
that becomes even more important in the
cloud I think there is stuff in the news
about this even today and the fact that
there's a debate about whether that's a
security breach or not is an interesting
one but I do think it's it's kind of
undeniable that you know security is one
of the most important topics in our in
our industry working on developer
productivity and compatibility right so
compatibility I just mentioned also
trying to find the places where you know
Java rightfully was given kind of a
reputation as boilerplate heavy or you
know being very verbose and not in a
good way we've been working on ways to
slim that down and make the compiler and
the runtime smarter so that you don't
have to write as much increasing density
now this also is is a very very
important topic as you're going to the
cloud basically the more you can get
running on less computing resources
unless you're going to have to pay for
in the cloud and that's always good
same thing with startup time as we're
seeing people run some kinds of
workloads there are smaller things that
need to just come up do something and
then go away you want to make sure that
the overhead of startup time each time
is is not eating a lot of resources also
working on predictability I'm gonna
mention this a little bit later we're
going to talk about it some more and and
finally making sure that what you're
running is actually something that where
you can understand what's going on
so flight recorder JFR and Mission
Control are two important parts of that
so at JavaOne last year a few months ago
is basically September so just about the
time that that Java 9 came out we
announced a couple of pretty more
things one of those things was that we
would start Oracle would start someone
is getting a call here whose phone is
this you want your phone here you go
ken is calling I should have answered
that would have been fun all right so
yeah so so we announced that Oracle is
going to start producing open JDK builds
and in fact that is something that we're
doing you can go and get Oracle built
and tested open JDK bills and those are
always going to be at the latest Java
level we are also licensing licensing
those under an open-source license and
that of course means that you can take
them and use them according to that
license for pretty much anything you
want there are of course obligations
that the GPL imposes so that's good to
be aware of we also took a set of
features that we had that previously
were commercial and closed source and
we've opened those up so I'm gonna talk
in a moment about some of those and then
the final thing here is is you know as I
mentioned open JDK is a large community
and it's a community of a bunch of
companies but also a lot of individuals
who have gotten together in order to to
implement Java ok so Java 9 the last
version that came out of course brought
us the jigsaw module system this is
something that we've seen in the past
six months a lot of people playing with
experimenting with trying it out
swapping war stories are one of our
goals in this really was to make the
transition fairly easy so it was an
important design criteria that it not be
all or nothing right we didn't want you
to have to go and and go through an
entire exercise and modularizing all of
your code and having the whole industry
have to do that in order for you to be
able to start and so a good deal of the
work and why it took so long to deliver
was making sure that it would be
possible for you to start using it
without module or icing and then start
to modularize pieces as you went along
and allow the industry as a whole to do
that without having some kind of Big
Bang moment and in fact we used it as
well to module rise
the JDK itself okay and you know this
this sounds obvious maybe it sounds
trivial but in fact it was quite a large
exercise so you know we found that in
fact it took us a couple of major
releases to actually go through the JDK
am fine places where there were
dependencies that we weren't even aware
of and clean those up and basically get
to the point where it could be
modularized now why is this important
well we talked about smaller footprint
and higher density right we talked about
security
well actually having a motorized JDK is
important here in fact what you want to
be able to do and what Java 9 lets you
do with jigsaw and with j-link
is basically create a custom runtime
that has all and only the pieces that
your application needs right now why is
that important what of course it becomes
smaller it also becomes more secure
because you know if you don't need say
the desktop module for graphical user
interfaces you don't have to bring that
with you you just need the pieces that
are there and so if there are
vulnerabilities that crop up in those
areas you can rest assured that you know
that code is not even there so that is
not a venerability that it affects you
this I think is something that we're
gonna see becoming even more important
as we're going forward okay there are a
few other features in nine
I'm not going to go through that but of
course you know 9 was a big release that
had a lot in it it took us multiple
years to deliver and so in fact there's
a tremendous amount there and by the way
I think I have to give a talk and talk
about containers right so a lot of what
is there and a lot of the things that
we're working on going forward are
actually thinking about things that can
help Java play well in a containerized
world ok and that's really because we're
expecting to see some of these aspects
right it basically becomes very very
important for Java to be able to
understand what kind of environment it's
running in and for you to be able to
tailor what you're doing into the kind
of environment that that containers
afford you and I think we're actually
gonna have a number of talks I see
somebody here today in an orange jacket
who's going to talk and there are two
guys in an orange jacket only one of
them will be giving a talk on containers
I bet though ok so so why does this help
well of course you know you get all of
the benefits of a managed language and
runtime right but you also have a
language which is hardware and operating
system agnostic in fact you get the kind
of safety and security that the JVM
gives you but with reliability with
compatibility and a tremendous echo
system available to you so you don't
have to write everything yourself
you know if you need something there's a
really good chance that there's a
library of framework out there that
provides it for you already so this is
something that we're committed to going
forward you know we see the great use
that people are making of Java in big
data and machine learning and that kind
of you know super large heap environment
but we also see people using Java
extensively for things like micro
services and using things in containers
and so we're we're really focused on
trying to understand the things that we
can do in Java that that help make that
better as we go forward
okay so I mentioned earlier open
sourcing commercial features I'm gonna
mention a couple of those now
Mission Control and flight recorder so
flight recorder is actually this now
this sounds like well you know I've seen
a hundred things out there that tell me
what's going on and help me diagnose
performance and threading issues and
that kind of stuff in the JVM the
difference about this is the flight
recorder actually uses the data that the
JVM itself is generating in order to
make decisions about when to optimize
you know what code paths are hot when
memory allocations are occurring when a
garbage collection is occurring and so
many of the other things you'll see out
there are sort of an extra layer that's
collecting more information and that you
know can be a huge source of overhead
and in fact that overhead itself can
actually change the behavior of the JVM
so that what you end up debugging is
something completely different from what
happens when that debugging information
is not there when you use flight
recorder you don't have to do that right
it is using information that's already
collected by the VM it's just surfacing
it in a way that you can access with a
tool like Mission Control also being
open source which will allow you to
really dive into depth and kind of
understand what's what's going on class
data sharing this is is basically
something that allows you to take the
code of your application and put it into
a shareable library right a dynamic link
library and so what that allows you then
to do is share the code not only of the
the JDK but also of your application
across multiple instances that are
running in the same operating system or
even across operating systems so again
that helps a lot in the startup time it
helps a lot in reducing overhead and
footprint and then usage tracker is
something that that we built and have
used at Oracle and now it's being open
sourced that allows you to keep track of
how many VMs you're actually running and
where they're running and what versions
are running and other stuff like that
okay so if any of you I'm sure probably
a lot of you just before coming into
this said gosh I'd really like to
download Java and so you went to a site
like the Oracle site and he said I'm
gonna download it this is what you saw
no that's kind of exciting but you know
it feels a little old and stale to me I
mean this is like six months old right
that's no good so I think we should do
something about that
in fact Alex could you come up here this
is Alex Buckley and I think I want I
want you to help could you just can you
press that yeah press the big green
button all right and we had a long time
figuring out oh now look at that
somebody has press it again that's no
good yeah somebody's trolling us all
right okay well there we go so now what
will the page look like even more
exciting let's see ah all right Java 10
alright this is not live but it would
actually it may be as we speak actually
live if somebody wants to check it if
it's not don't say anything all right
we'll put it this way by the time we're
eating lunch today it will look like
this and in fact even more exciting I
mean this is all kind of commercial and
stuff can we like shouldn't there be an
open-source version - all right there we
go
this is the open JDK site and general
availability of Java 10 at at what time
10:20
all right right so I you know Alex I I
think what would be kind of fun here is
maybe we can talk a little bit about
what's in ten and I think the first
thing to notice I remember that big long
list of stuff that was in nine the list
that is in 10 is a little more svelte
it's kind of yeah it's you know it's
slimmer it's but it's very good and so
why don't you am I can you can you who
can not hear me excellent no one can not
hear me everyone pay me good so my name
is Alex Buckley I work in the Java
language team and my day job so to speak
is to edit the Java language
specification so I am I wouldn't say
heartbroken that people are not reading
it against quite a few references also
who who is using Stack Overflow
regularly yeah that that's that's a lot
of hands I
dude I'm always actually pleased to see
the ones that are quoting the Java
language specification and linking
directly to 841 a method overriding so
let me talk about the most fun and
develop a focused feature of Java 10 we
often hear the criticism the Java is too
verbose has too much redundancy and we
can't change the Java language overnight
but if you've looked at Java rates then
you'll know that lambdas and streams
were a pretty successful down payment on
reducing that of debt of redundancy and
the main trick that lambdas have for
avoiding redundancy is type inference
now Java is statically typed and always
will be but you can see that in short
snippets like I'm passing to the filter
and map methods they're just as readable
without explicit types and declarations
than if I had to say what the type of
the block and the type of blue ah now of
course the the types are still there but
the compiler infers of them so that your
IDs can can still work well that was all
pretty successful so in 10 we're
introducing the VAR keyword to bring
type inference to local variables this
is the most frequently requested feature
from developers coming to Java from
other languages Scala and c-sharp
and even C++ all have this feature now
Java is late to the party
on purpose because when you're adding
features to the number one programming
language in the world and you're adding
those features for all time the cost of
a mistake is very high
so we think very carefully and
cautiously before adding a feature even
as small as this one keyword to the Java
language what we've seen developers
coming from those other languages is
that once you've used this feature it's
hard to live without almost like now
some people will freak out at the loss
of type information who is freaking out
right now there are hands not many hands
thank you but thank you for being honest
because I mean seriously because Java is
not just statically typed but it's it's
always had you know types to the left
and to the right and to the up and to
the down but if you think about it
what's important in short snippets of
code like this is it the types of the
local variables all their names we would
argue that it's really the names because
as you read the code and bear in mind
the Java principle the reading is more
important than writing as you read the
code you're looking for the names in the
flow of the code the types of the local
variables are often just implementation
details if you choose reasonable names
for your local variables and often the
code with var is more readable than the
code with explicit types at the top
because there's none of the repetition
between the type name and the variable
name and the brevity of our increases
the prominence of the variable names so
this is in Java 10 it's in at least one
noted IDE right now I encourage you to
try it out and with that I'll hand back
to George thank y'all
what Alex wasn't gonna say is it also
lines up really nicely okay and for
anyone who's curious I mentioned the
development being done in open JDK that
means you can actually go and read the
JEP that is the JDK enhancement proposal
which talks in quite some detail about
the design and design decisions made and
in fact you'll see you can see that as
well for some of the other features that
are are intend okay and the next thing
that I wanted to mention and I'm
actually going to bring another
colleague up on stage to talk a little
bit about this so we've done a bunch of
work on garbage collection specifically
the g1 garbage collector in intense so
I'd like to invite Charlie hunt to come
and talk about that Chicago local
Charlie hunt alright thanks George
as how's walking up here kind of felt
like Jim Valvano on he's SP speech but I
don't think I'll have something as
entertaining us as Jim would have to say
up here so in in jdk 10 we made some
really nice improvements with g1 the one
that's getting a lot of attention is is
we've multi-threaded the full GC so if
you're having to get to that situation
where do you want us got to go into a
full GC it's now multi-threaded there's
some other things that we've done to
reduce pause times or we've refactored
some code or we're in pauses in g1 which
make those pauses faster what you're
going to see out of that is because g1
is time based you know so you set a goal
for a pause time so you say ok so my
pauses are going to get faster okay but
how does that work with a pause time
goal what's going to end up happening is
you'll have less frequent GCS because
you're able to do more work in other
words you going to collect more regions
if you remember g1 is is region-based
so you'll have less frequent GCS another
exciting thing in the area of garbage
collectors as you see on the slides here
there's a project called z GC z GC
borrows from the name of the ZFS
filesystem from solaris d GC is a low
latency garbage collector so if you're
in this realm of you're looking for
lower latency than what you can achieve
with which g 1c GC is worth taking a
look at although it's a new project you
might think well there's a lot of work
that goes on with collectors there's a
lot of evolution or maturity that has to
go along with collectors z GC is very
well along its way to being mature I've
been beating on this thing on an awful
lot over the last year and I'm really
impressed with it
it's it really is closing the gap in
that need of low latency I think with
that I think I'll turn it back over to
you alright thanks Rob
okay and in addition I should mention
the code for z GC is in open JDK and in
fact there are also early access
binaries that are available so you can
take that you can download it and try it
today as well as binaries for other some
other projects and in fact with that
let's look a little bit into into the
future here so Java 11 well what do we
know about John 11 and we know one thing
about it it's coming in six months from
today I think and in fact it doesn't
have very much in it yet and the reason
I say yet is because the model that we
have with these time-based releases is
essentially that features are not added
to a release until they're done so
basically you can see that in fact 11
already has a few things that are passed
the gate and over time it will have some
more things it probably will be roughly
the kind of size that 10 is so it's not
gonna you know be like 9 and that's
intentional again
we want to make sure that you're seeing
rapid evolution and getting features
into your hands quickly but making sure
that the features you are getting are
well tested well thought-out well
designed well specified and and and so
again you won't see features coming into
the 11 early access builds which by the
way are available on about a weekly
basis and until those features are are
really done and really solid and those
early access bills are provided so that
you can test them early so that you can
try them out and understand how they're
going to affect you or what what
possibilities they bring to you and so
that you can give us feedback so even if
you don't want to come to open JDK and
start you know hacking on the JVM a
great thing that you can do to help
yourself and to help folks in the
community is testing and giving feedback
of those early access bills okay so out
even past eleven what are some of the
areas that we're looking at I'm just
going to mention a few things very
quickly one of the the things that we
think is a a big challenge that we are
tackling with I think you called it what
was it the Brian gets down payment
system you know basically doing small
bits that were biting off in each of
these smaller releases as they come
along is actually working on object data
layout and what I mean by that is let's
see if you were to look at the way that
Java the Java Runtime lays out memory
and puts objects into memory and then
you were to look at what hardware
designers think of in terms of how they
think data should be processed and the
kinds of optimizations they're putting
in these two things actually don't go
that well together
Java essentially from it's very
beginning had as a a philosophy that
there were primitive types and there
were object types and you know you were
kind of one or the other primitives gave
you you know the possibility for great
speed they essentially were
native types and handled that way by the
runtime objects were not objects gave
you a lot of flexibility but sometimes
could be a challenge for performance
because the runtime had to make
assumptions about them and what it could
do with them things like garbage
collection right so basically what we're
looking at doing is understanding that
in the past 20 years the world has
changed and the biggest change is that
CPUs have gotten a lot faster but memory
access has not really in fact things
have gotten very complicated in hardware
design with all kinds of levels of
caches that the hardware uses to be able
to do things more quickly so it really
becomes a problem for a managed runtime
of trying to make sure that the memory
you want to do work on say you have a
large collection of objects is all
actually properly aligned and available
to the CPU that's going to do an
operation on this set of data so that it
can do it really really quickly for you
as a Java programmer you don't get to
make those decisions of where things are
and how they're actually represented we
want to make sure that Java is doing a
great job of this for you and make it so
that you can just write natural great
Java code and the runtime will do the
magic to make the performance be
excellent so we think that part of this
the next step here is basically making
it so that you can indicate certain
kinds of data where you're prepared to
give up a little bit of flexibility that
you get with objects in order to have
better performance and so what will
happen eventually is some of these more
complex data types than primitives
you'll be able to indicate are something
that the the runtime can actually deal
with in a way that allows it to make it
very compact that makes it possible to
fit a lot of data into a cache line so
that the hardware can process it really
really quickly when it's needed to the
main key here is basically giving up
object identity in order to embrace
immutability and I think that you know
this is something if you're interested
in this
look for talks on project Valhalla its
you can think of value types here and
you can actually go to open JDK and see
the ongoing work on this and in fact
even bills that have early prototypes of
this today another area that we feel is
important is native intro so ken mention
earlier j'ni Java native interface he
said try not to use it it's really
painful I can actually tell you because
I was there at the time that the Java
native interface was not really designed
to make it easy to to call between Java
and native languages and in fact it is
possible to do much better and we think
now is is the time to do so so we have a
project called Panama which is working
on doing exactly this and you can kind
of imagine the way this works is you
sort of feed a particular tool a header
file a native header file and it
basically creates everything for you in
order to make it so that you can call
back and forth between native and Java
and use data between native and Java but
in a way that is both more performant
and holds them more secure than what J&amp;amp;I
lets you do today another processor
that's project Panama you can check that
out a final project to mention here is
loom and this is this is about bringing
fibers to the JDM so basically it's
about letting you do things with
extremely lightweight threads very very
lightweight to create invoke and switch
between and and so that's something that
we think will be sort of the next
evolution of support for parallelism in
in Java ok
so finally just to kind of bring it all
together here we see these trends in
computing and we are always looking at
ways to try to make sure that Java is
bringing you the possibility of taking
advantage of those things right so we
want to always make sure that as new
things are coming down the pipe whether
it be new hardware or new programming
models that Java gives you support but
in a way that as Alex said is very
thoughtful and you know we're we're
designing not just for the thing that's
trendy this year but for the programs
that you know twenty years from now one
of you is going to be standing up on
stage and showing a program that you
wrote in 2018 and it's still gonna be
running on the latest the latest version
of java by that point we'll probably
what will we be will be it like Java
like 400 or something it's gonna be
awesome
okay so in any in any rate thank you
very much congratulations to everyone
for getting to this point where we have
Java 10 and I wanted to mention a few
talks that are going on so please check
these out and as I mentioned there will
be a Chicago Java user group session at
the end of the day where you can come
and enjoy some beverages and also ask us
questions so with that I'm going to hand
it back to Gerald and don't go because
he has some important things to say
right thanks
Thank You Church thank you very much
George so of course that now means that
my java talk at two o'clock in the
afternoon I have to update now to Java
ten right some more work for me before
letting you go just a few housekeeping
slides when you go out on the left hand
side from my direction right hand side
from your direction there is the Oracle
developers launch and one thing that
we're running is the sip labs those are
compressed hands-on labs that take about
half an hour for you to run through
there are in a competitive fashion so
you can go there sign up and then you
run through some self-paced hands-on
labs whoever is the quickest though to
finish those labs can win this nice
little drone there on the top right so
it's the only one so you know ago but
there you can do as many laps as you
like while you there and whoever is then
there's a leaderboard you will see where
you will be whoever ends up by the end
of the day on top will get this nice
drone also as can already said before we
have a women in technology lunch going
on today this is for our appreciation of
the diversity and inclusion now the
women in technology lunch is open for
everybody so whether you are women in
technology whether you would like to
participate as a man show your support
etc please go and find that lunch and
participate in those talks from other
women we have there talking about their
experience in IT big thanks to our
sponsors that make Oracle code happening
sorta code is not only Chicago event we
actually have 15 events worldwide
Chicago being the third one now we just
kicked off in the u.s. thanks to our
sponsors that made this happen
also if you would like to do more
training learn at your own self-paced at
home you can use it with Oracle
University we do have some educational
material that you can just sign up go
there education or a two-column slash
code day and then you can do many many
different courses where it's Java or not
on Oracle technology at home and then if
you haven't seen yet we do have a new
developer portal developer dot
oracle.com this is a new portal for any
developer using Oracle technology is
basically a landing page that you can go
to and find all the information again
whether it's Java or any other
technologies that Oracle provides the
agenda is set before make sure that you
download the Oracle events app if you
don't have done already look for Oracle
code Chicago and then you actually do
have the agenda at hand as well as the
sessions we now have after this keynote
a short coffee break for about half an
hour and then we're gonna kick off at
11:15 our belief with the sessions as
well as hands-on labs as well and then I
said before we do have to ask the
experts panel so all our Java guys here
in front if you didn't get a chance he
had to hammer them with your questions
around Java will still be there at 6
o'clock tonight and you get a full hour
to handle them with questions also I was
told we do have the and I think George
mentioned that before the Chicago or to
use a group here present as well today
that have nice little laptop stickers
Alfredo is somewhere here there he sits
the president for the Oracle user group
Chicago so if you aren't member yet to
come and find him he will be around the
whole day get your sticker I've become a
member of the user group it's a free
user group as far as he told me right
yeah great last but not least we do have
promotion going on today for to code
participants for all of you we have $500
trial credits for the Oracle cloud
you will see those fliers around so you
can just pick up one if you like to try
out Oracle cloud you can just enter the
promo code there it will take you to
your page you register and you get five
hundred dollars of free credit to try
the Oracle cloud and with that I would
like to thank you very very much for
your attention and I wish you a great
orator coach Chicago thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
