among and many things the v jug founder
and organizer a java champion a
developer advocate at zero turn around
and one of the emerging languages track
committee leads simon thank you for
joining us today now so pleasure thanks
for having my great so could you tell us
a little bit about your experience as a
committee leader at this year's java one
yeah sure lady um so yeah earlier this
year to be a committee to be a co-lead
for the emerging language track with
markers log wigan and together we we put
together a list of people who would who
would help us from there on the
committee and it was it was interesting
actually one of the differences with the
way the committee works in java one
compared to other conferences which i've
been on the program committee for is the
job of one committee have specific focus
groups around each track and when the
sessions are submitted each focus group
will focus most you know typically
slowly on that group so we have a we
have a very focused set of sessions
which we which we voted upon and yet we
had a great number of sessions in for
the jvm languages track and we did a
round of voting on them as well as
adding in our comments and then we
decided as a group and i think they
would probably around will quite a big
group actually bigger than bigger than
many of the other tracks this year at
job or one in terms of numbers on the
group and i think we were maybe about 14
16 people and we added all our comments
we had a lot of discussion about which
ones are going to suit the track and we
put our track together yen it's a really
great set of sessions looking forward to
it a lot glad to hear it could you tell
us a little bit about how java one
differs from other conferences you might
have taken part in as far as the
choosing of the sessions and what you
can expect sure yeah i mean as i
mentioned when from the program
committee side it one other things i i i
haven't experienced in other conferences
is this is this you know grouping around
a track normally what would happen is
everyone in the in
program committee would vote on all
sessions across tracks but I think one
of the differences which makes Java one
special compared to other many other
conferences around the world is really
the the typical set of speakers on the
set of people that will actually attend
for me as a speaker that will travel
around Europe ER in the US quite quite
often I will see many different speakers
but typically you don't see them all
together at the same place so if i'm in
a european conference maybe I'll see
more Europeans because to us and vice
versa when I travel to the US one of the
great things in job one it's this it's
this almost like party atmosphere
because every night you when you go out
you will see a whole bunch of speakers
all together and it's really really
great to have that networking and that's
both from the speaker point of view as
well as an attendee point of view
because you know as an attendee you get
such a rich group of speakers that you
can talk to and equally attendees as
well it's really really great to make
use of your time talking to people
rather than just going to sessions you
can you know view a lot of sessions
online you can be a lot of online
content from from various different
libraries but you know making the use
making use of your time with the people
that you're talking to you face to face
is one of the big keys for me in the
success of Java one yeah driver 1 is
great for a building that network with
tons of people from around the world and
I know you're not only a committee lead
this year but you'll also be hosting a
few sessions one with quite the title
called productive java development you
weak-minded for which could you tell us
a little bit about that absolutely yes
so so basically as a developer for many
many years from be like 10 14 years and
me and a little less over the last
couple of years I've been doing it wrong
essentially what I've been doing is I've
been you know trying to develop in a
very productive way trying to get the
most out of my days and trying to reduce
all this all this kind of stuff that
gets in your way these delays these
things which body I've been getting that
entirely wrong basically what we want is
for things to take longer we want all
these interruptions in our daily work
and what I do is I
in this session I will go through maybe
10 12 different tools and processes
explaining how they're saving you time
but also explaining all the problems
that you're going to get from that I
mean it's very much a tongue-in-cheek
kind of kind of session but we do talk
about a good number of tools including
you know from juror and confluence
across the app servers from you know tom
cat Tommy a little bit about Jay rebel
and ex-rebel achillion jboss Forge
IntelliJ Jenkins Gradle there's a huge
number of products we look at we do a
whole bunch of demos it's actually a
very I've done I've given this talk once
or twice before once at Java land
actually as well and it got a really
great reception so I'm really hoping I'm
really hoping I can give the same
session again sounds great so if I'm
understanding it correctly a bit of
self-deprecation there you are the weak
minded fool as most of us are capsulated
yeah absolutely and so I also understand
you are founded and organized the V jug
virtual Java user groups could you tell
us a bit about what people can expect if
they want to check out a vdrug session
sure yeah and so yeah the V jug is a
virtual Java user group and in fact was
created as when I was i'm also a London
jug leader and when I had a family I'm
probably about an hour away from them
that when I had a family is hard for me
to go into London there another round
trip is around two two and a half hours
and so it's hard for me to be able to
hit that time away so I thought well
wouldn't it be great if we could have a
virtual online session so that's exactly
what the virtual jug is it enables us to
actually get great great speakers from
around the world without them having to
travel without them having to get budget
to travel so we've got some amazing
speakers such as james gosling and such
as Josh Bloch Stuart marks Simon Ritter
Aaron good three or four times we get
some really really great because I can
carry on Venkat Heinz kibitz it's
amazing
the list of speakers we have people we
have about two sessions a month
sometimes more depending on if we have
sessions at conferences but the key
thing is all our sessions are recorded
so you can view replays whenever you
want and also sessions are interactive
as well so when people join the sessions
that there's an IRC chat happening
alongside and people can discuss as well
as ask questions to the to the speaker
and I say we're only about a year and a
half old now coming up to two years and
we've already got just over 4,000
members so we're growing very very
quickly if anyone wanted to have a look
at that it's virtual joke calm signups
free of course and yeah it's just free
content that people know non gated no
account free content that people can can
look up sounds great and sort of to
start wrapping up here could you give us
a little bit of your favorite thing
about javaone and what you're looking
forward to this year not to play
favorites of course as a as a co-lead
well I'm going to attend all the
emerging languages okay basically you
know the variety the variety of sessions
enjoyable one is really great but for me
when I because I go to so many
conferences in the year for me it's
really about making that time to network
and speak to people there are a couple
of things I am looking forward to
specifically and one of them is actually
the community day which is going to be
on Sunday which i'm looking forward to
and also there's a couple of other java
champion events one is actually a job
champion breakfast in the morning on i
think sunday but yet that networking
talking to people going for a beer with
people or coffee for with people is
super super cool the second one of the
other great things i'm looking forward
to is the parties in the evening yeah i
wouldn't go to job of one if you if you
really intended to sleep that much
because you know between doing lots of
sessions and lots of discussions lots of
partying that there's plenty of time the
week after to sleep obviously I'm going
as well as speaking there i'm actually
going with zero turn around we have a
whip we're sponsors so we all have a
booth and it's really great to chat
people who use our products it's always
good to you know understand how people
are getting on what you look what can
you make it better for them what how you
can make their lives better with your
products so yeah all that mostly mostly
just talking to people is this is the
biggest thing great well Simon thank you
so much for joining us and for those of
you watching don't forget to register
