we're ready to start here if you want to
do any less settling in things right now
no are we good is everyone a week it's
before noon i'm one of those people who
thinks that nothing should ever happen
before noon and so i'm suspecting weighs
at least someone else in the audience
who's also still just barely waking up
to be here and I really appreciate that
I extra appreciate that because I know
how hard it is to wake up when you think
that nothing should ever happen before
noon so thank you very much for being
here today we're going to talk about
cross-functional code reviews and I'm
going to start with a little bit of kind
of housekeeping stuff if you want to ask
questions I will certainly take
questions from raised hands but I know
that we have people here from all around
the world who may not want to talk in
front of this many people out loud so I
will also take questions at the end and
the questions period from my Twitter if
you need to note down the handle right
now it is right there on this first
slide and you can write a question on
the Twitter so you don't have to talk in
this room full of people and I will
switch my phone off airplane mode at the
very end and take those questions so an
overview of the talk itself first we're
going to talk a little bit about why you
would want a cross-functional code
review what kind of research what
background is there that indicates that
this is a thing worth even wanting to
have then we're going to talk a little
bit about how you would implement this
for code review specifically the impact
that this research has on this
particular process and then finally
we're going to talk about how to do it
once you get into the really
nitty-gritty implementation details and
you have really reasonable objections
from well-meaning managers who want to
do the best by their people but maybe in
a way that's going to conflict with your
desire to implement this new shiny
process so first during my practice
talks a bunch of people asked who I was
quoting here I made this up this is not
quote from someone else I really think
that innovations and the real genius
comes when you combine one disciplines
insights with another disciplines
practice
and when you create a cross-functional
code review you are able to bring the
discipline that whoever you're bringing
in has studied to the practice of
creating code for your customers when
you build your team you want to build
the team this few blind spots as
possible diversify construction and
guide them to their potential this
article is a great article it's actually
about something called identity
diversity and right up front here I want
to differentiate between identity
diversity which is what they were
talking about in this article but this
quote still applies and functional
diversity functional diversity is what
we are going to talk about today it's
different approaches to a problem and
different ways of acting on those
approaches identity diversity is the
diversity you usually hear about where
you have a certain number of women or
people of different ethnicities or any
other kind of metric of the person's
demographics on the team I do think
that's important but it's not what we're
going to talk about today so when you
build the team with as few blind spots
as possible this is really kind of a
shout out to functional diversity which
some people believe correlates with
identity diversity but it's still up for
debate enough that I'm going to kind of
side table that for this talk the model
of functional diversity that I'm going
to use here is mostly defined by Hong
and Paige in their 2004 paper titled
groups of diverse problem solvers can
outperform groups of high ability
problem solvers from the title you can
probably guess what their conclusion was
they found that diverse teams formed a
more creative whole by creating more of
these perspective and heuristic pairs
the definition of perspective they used
was that it's the representation of
solutions in the problem solvers
internal language so when I see a
problem I'm going to think about it in a
certain way and when I do internal
processing on that problem i'm going to
process it a little bit differently than
if say you or you in the audience we're
seeing the same problem and deciding to
process it yourself so there's a first
layer of possible functional diversity
there
then the heuristic is the methane which
they denoted by a in their model from
the solutions in your internal language
two subsets of actual practical doable
things and it captures how you decide
what you should actually act on here I
have a little bit of process map I'm
gonna use the laser pointer on the side
and then on that side if I can get that
far so first you have a real world
problem and then you use a perspective
to take that problem from the real world
thing into your internal language this
is going to be a description of all of
the possible solutions to that problem
as you see them as an individual then
you have your internal processing this
is where you're trying to figure out how
to solve the problem and as you're
trying to figure out how to solve the
problem you're doing different kinds of
things in your head that are also
possibly a benefit of having a
cross-functional team then you Mac with
heuristics the things that you are
thinking about oh I can't get my laser
pointer anymore the things that you are
thinking about as you do your internal
processing into a possible set of real
world solutions this is kind of
converting your self-talk into something
that you're actually going to do and
then finally you end up with a result
the result is the thing you're going to
implement and this is just one model for
how people are solving problems using
the different thought processes that
they are bringing to the table a common
question when you're composing a
cross-functional team for really any
reason is is this worth it diverse
groups perceive interactions is less
effective they report low confidence in
their performance they just don't think
they're doing very well but what this
study among others found that the
performance was actually better than
homogeneous groups despite the fact that
they felt like they were performing
worse and this was not just because new
ideas were brought in when they had the
same number of ideas brought in by
people of a diverse group as in a
homogeneous group they still performed
better in deciding which of those ideas
to implement
and the actual implementation in case
you're still not sure the slides will be
online that previous paper I mentioned
has a fabulous bibliography I've put
full citations in here and these are
some extra things that have been
released this year that I think look
kind of cool on this topic I'm not going
to go into great depth on any of these
things right now but they do exist
they're fun these are unfortunately all
behind paywalls but you might be able to
get into them with a local library card
I was able to get at least two out of
three with just a library card so what
about you think about the specific roles
that you have on your team and this is
not your team and the scale of the
people you work directly with every day
but your team and the scale of your
company maybe your engineering
department all of the people you could
be working with on a project who could
you include in a code review process
this parts a little participatory who
could you include I'm going to wait
until I get answers what was this
quality control team yes writers
business and customers back there I see
one product and program managers yes
client-facing teams architects IT other
developers yes that's a very important
one that gets overlooked a lot anything
else no okay that was that was good so
the tricky part think about all of these
people we just came up with whichever of
them you have at your organization even
if you didn't say one and think about
why that person could be valuable in a
process what would that person add
objectivity okay a different point of
view think about more specific things a
different point of view would bring what
maybe you have a well I'm going to give
my examples in a minute so I'm not going
to lead this too much right now but when
you have a cross-functional code review
it's very important that you don't just
include members from other teams
especially not for the sake of just
including them each person you bring
into this process needs to have a
different type of feedback that you're
going to get and you need to be willing
to accept and implement that feedback
this is not me saying oh you need to do
everything that someone says in code
review every time that's ridiculous no
one wants that you'll end up with some
weird hodgepodge of all the suggestions
you got from all of the people at all of
the layers and some of its contradictory
part of your job as the recipient of a
code review is to kind of get through
that smooth it out a little bit figure
out which parts make sense but you do
need to be willing to consider the
perspective of the reviewer and you need
to be willing to possibly implement the
feedback that you get from anyone at any
point in the process
this accepting and implementing
different types of feedback is really
really important it doesn't matter what
you call your code review process until
you're ready to accept and implement
different types of feedback it will not
be a cross functional code review so
I've given my examples of who could
participate you can have developers on
your team you can have developers on
other teams product managers technical
writers UI or UX designers but why are
we bringing them in not just for the
sake of representation but because each
of these functions has a unique
perspective that can add to the
functional diversity and make it a
stronger team this allows you to improve
your functionality ideally and produce a
better customer experience we're going
to come back to this a little bit later
but this better customer experience is
what we're always striving for sometimes
it's hard to remember that when we want
to make this functionality because it's
going to be really cool we want it to be
really cool because someone's going to
use it and it'll be cool when they get
to use it to solve problems in the real
world we like to solve problems with the
code and we like to solve those problems
so that someone else can solve another
problem we're solving a meta problem
every time we program it's super cool
and so I've provided some example
reasons why you might want to include
these people depending on your
particular organization all of this is
going to vary you're not going to get
the same reasons for inclusion or the
same groups of people on every review or
at every company but for example you
might want to include developers on your
team to check for accuracy and use
patterns or adherence to team norms some
of this you can do with an automated
test but anything that you can't do with
an automated test that falls into this
category you want to have someone
covering you might want to include
developers on other teams to maintain
flexibility across those teams they can
build institutional knowledge if those
people know how your code works then
your code is not a silo anymore and the
more code reviews you have them involved
in the easier it'll be later if you have
to have them come in to help you out to
maintain this functionality to do
something else in your code to build on
it to integrate with you it's good to
have that knowledge up front so that
you're not scrambling to teach them what
the code does and have them build on it
later
you might want to bring product managers
in at the slightly earlier stage so that
they have early insight into how it
fulfills the acceptance criteria maybe
there's something that just obviously
doesn't fit the criteria they meant to
define while if it if you don't have
clear enough acceptance criteria you
make it to a code review that's another
problem it's good to catch these things
when that problem occurs as early as
possible so that you don't spend all of
this extra time polishing this work that
you just did you already built something
that's not going to be accepted and
that's bad enough don't make it worse
you have technical writers who can catch
bugs and UI strings before they become
customer visible they might also catch
other stuff it depends on what their
background is a lot of technical writers
come in from other things like
development and so if you have a former
developer in your tech writing team then
they might catch regular bugs you have
UI designers who can verify that changes
to the style since the work was planned
or implemented correctly you can't
always Rican sult with them during the
actual development process so maybe they
gave you a spec something in that spec
didn't work out you didn't have time to
get in touch with them again but if you
bring them in in the code review process
you can catch those kinds of little
minor changes that may have some set way
and their style guide of being handled
in other parts of the product and UX
designers to find the pain points before
customers do back again to this idea of
improving the customer experience with
these code reviews you really want to
get these people in ahead of time not
because it's just cool to save work it
is cool to save work but also the
earlier you get them in the less
likelihood there is that a customer is
going to have to deal with this problem
before you catch it yes
yes ideally you should I am by no means
saying that you shouldn't have these
people involved even earlier working on
the specification or requirements
gathering but what I've seen happen
sometimes is that you'll have all of the
people you need during the specification
requirements gathering phase then they
kind of go away and don't come back
until it's finished and when they go
away and don't come back until it's
finished that leaves you kind of a long
stretch where a lot of minor decisions
are being made and sometimes those minor
decisions can have a little bit of a
snowball effect so you end up with
something that's way off base by the end
of that time period I have another
question here
so the question that I've got here is
what if the people you want to get
involved in a code review aren't code
savvy and they don't they aren't
familiar with that level of it and that
is a very common problem many places
have functions who would be extremely
useful at the code review level but who
aren't so code savvy and I'm going to
come back to this a little bit later the
answer is mostly to provide resources
and support people can because well I'll
just give a little part of what I was
going to say later right now because you
guys are Java developers and Java shops
your code is actually much easier to
read than some other places you guys are
not Haskell developers you guys are
writing something that the average
person can pretty much metal through and
so provided your code is well written
and adheres to your best practices there
should only be a limited number of
things that that person needs to look up
or learn and I'm going to talk about
some resources for getting those basics
of programming itself covered later on
so in my experience have I found an
ideal number of people to have involved
in this process and how do you avoid too
many cooks while there is an ideal
number of people to have it is different
for every review it depends on the
functionality it depends on the
individual people it depends on how
significant a change to your individual
product that functionality is if it's
something maybe you have a word
processor and you're adding at alexs and
you already had bowled then that's a lot
for minor than if you had a word
processor and you didn't have any text
styling and now you're adding at alexs
and so you want to keep in mind the size
of the change itself you also should
make sure that as you decide who's being
added to code reviews you're being a
little bit ruthless with that you want
to add everyone who was going to add
value and no one else if you're adding
five developers from other teams and
they're all from the same two teams then
maybe you don't need to have them all
look at that piece of functionality you
can kind of spread out the love a little
bit there are always going to be lots of
code reviews that need to be done and
because you will always have lots of
need for code reviews there are plenty
of opportunities you can give someone
who wants to code review a particular
piece of functionality an opportunity on
a different thing if you already have
kind of the too many cooks problem
popping up so here is my kind of
humorous example from harvard business
review of a successful benefit from an
organization's knowledge we have mr.
dinosaur and mr. human and they're going
up to eight cyan't meeting and mr.
dinosaur sorry mr. huben says I'll go up
first and make a good impression then
you come up and eat them and so what
they're doing here is really combining
the two sets of skills that they have in
this case maybe the customer won't be
thrilled when they get eaten but what if
mr. dinosaur was going to provide
something the customer does want then
this would be a great team very
effective so when you're choosing your
code reviewers I suggest you start from
a chart like an org chart just to keep
in mind all of the functions that you
have available at your organization this
is not to say that you should be sitting
there and studying your org chart for
hours and hours just remind yourself of
what's around who you have maybe someone
you wouldn't have thought of off the top
of your head is going to provide the
most value of any function at your
organization then for each function you
think you might want to include list
reasons why what kind of benefit do you
see them bringing to any kind of
functionality because this is just for
the general process development you
might want to say well if there's a UI
string that a technical writer is
valuable if there's not a UI string that
I don't see them bringing anything and
then you would only add them later on to
the ones that had a UI string but up
front decide when you would ever want
this person then decide which types of
changes that function should review if
you don't have a reason why you would
want them on this type of change then
you're going to run into this too many
hooks problem because you're just
bringing people on unnecessarily
creating busy work no one's going to be
happy with that decide how to choose
specific reviewers that's individuals in
this role in advance this is not
necessarily setting rigid criteria I
honestly don't think any of this should
be rigid you should be flexible you
should adjust the process as you go
through if at any point of this process
becomes set in stone that's the point
where it's going to start having useless
parts and being a bad process but come
up with some general criteria like maybe
if I choose a technical writer it should
be a technical writer who has
information architecture experience
because I want them to review changes to
our menu structures maybe if i'm going
to choose a product manager then it
should be a product manager who has
worked with this section of our
functionality before but also who has
experience in another area so that they
can do a little bit of a consistency
thing from the product side what these
specific reasons are will be different
for every organization but have an idea
of what kinds of things you might want
to use
if you can make it optional for
developers obviously it's a core part of
the function to review code but for
other people they may or may not want to
do it you'll hit some people who are
really excited who would love to review
code who really want to understand how
this works and how the process goes but
you also have other people who just
don't want to be involved with this at
all who didn't sign up for this and who
don't want to be there if you're going
to make them code review and you don't
want to make people miserable ideally
every process should make people happier
it should make the people who have to do
the thing happier it should make the
people who use the product happier and
if it's not that it's a bad process I do
not by any means want to condone endorse
or encourage bad processes please no bad
processes and finally make sure you
ensure that reviewers and their managers
see that they're adding value to this
process if you have the opportunity you
can come back to them and say like hey
you gave this comment and it avoided
this bug which we may be ended up with
somewhere else or in a previous time and
I'm really grateful to you for helping
me avoid that less directly make sure
that you don't have the Phantom
mysterious disappearing code reviews
where you have a meeting and no one
takes notes and nothing happens and then
the problem that they pointed out to you
just gets into the product anyways that
doesn't make them feel good it makes
them feel like the times been wasted
especially if it's an actual problem
part of this sometimes you'll have
changes that don't get implemented
because good discretion indicated that
you shouldn't do that thing but if you
have changes that are actually a value
you want to make sure you're tracking
that as well as possible so that things
aren't just falling off when you choose
specific people to code review within a
function you'll also want to set up some
criteria for that once again it'll be
organization specific but these are some
examples of things that you might want
to consider do they enjoy reviewing are
they going to like this or is this going
to make their job worse are they going
to hate their job while they're doing
code reviews do they have a background
in the language as I said earlier this
not as important with java's with some
other languages but especially if you
have different pieces interacting and
some some of the jvm languages are not
quite so easy to read if you don't have
a programming background then you might
want to be careful and or for specific
types of changes you may also want to
choose people who've at least some
passing familiarity with the language
people who have seen it before does a
person need to learn more about a
product or component can work in either
direction you might want to pick
specifically people who need to learn
more about this product or components so
that they can do this code review and
get more familiar with the functionality
or in some cases there's something
really critical and you want to make
sure it's people who already know it
pretty well is this person already
overworked compared to their teammates
if so you might not want to pick them
for the code review because once again
that's where you get into making people
miserable does the team have capacity
this is probably one of the hardest ones
on here because sometimes there's a
function that you really want to review
some functionality it would really add
value but the team has no capacity at
all there's just not room for it
everything they have is higher priority
than your code review and you have to be
willing to give it up when necessary
it's the toughest part of this but it's
also very important the manager buy-in
is also yes question
so what I'm getting here is does
everyone have this responsibility when
you give it to the individual developers
it gets very complex for this
responsibility do you mean ensuring that
code reviews are done or do you mean
specifically choosing reviewers okay
both of choosing reviewers and getting
the coder if you've done so in terms of
getting the code review done in general
it's useful to have an overarching
process that everyone has to follow some
places use a tool like crucible some
places have a workflow that kind of
forces the code review and on people
what kinds of things you can do to make
sure that any code review is getting
that is a little bit beyond the scope
here but we can talk about it afterwards
if you like in terms of choosing
specific people you want to make sure
that everyone is aware of how they can
choose a code reviewer and that whoever
usually make makes that decision in your
particular process knows that these are
the kinds of things they should be
looking out for if every individual
developer is doing it then you might
want to have a specific place where they
can go to see like okay these are the
people who enjoy code reviewing who have
volunteered to take on extra code
reviews and who want to look at this
functionality you might want to make
more resources available the lower down
it is and then the more of the
organization that is in their daily
purview the less guidance people
probably need
okay so what I have here is what if
you're working on a single product you
only have one architect one product
manager and all of your developers have
the same code reviewers all the time so
an important thing there is to come back
to bring on everyone who will add value
and no one else don't bring people into
this just because you think it would be
cool to have an architect code review it
but because you actually need the kind
of feedback that your architect can
provide and in those cases you might
want to give a more specific code review
and instead of going to a different
function within your organization go to
someone who has experience with that
function and say like hey you are one of
our senior developers but I know you
were an architect at a previous company
and I'd really like a review from the
point of view of an architect on this
thing can you help me out this is really
about using the skills within your
organization and someone's current role
is the easiest way to find out that they
have that skill but if you know that you
have these resources from other sources
and people have experience in other
areas then that can work too and of
course
companies doing outsourcing especially
for communications agencies agencies
okay okay so if you don't have in-house
development resources I don't personally
have very much experience with firms
that outsource I'm guessing that you
could use some of the same elements of
this process within whatever team you
have at the site working on the project
what you might want to do if you have
say a couple of consultants on your side
and you are the out outsource workers
and you're trying to work on something
for another company is ask if they have
someone who would be willing to
participate in a code review process and
that might require a little bit of
training your customer but I think that
you still could get someone probably is
that an answer to your question no
you're working a government agency you
do outsourcing
okay so you're working with an agency
that's providing outsourcing and you're
doing the project management side of it
okay
ok
so the vendor does their own code review
process that then you want to have like
a secondary review on that okay so I
think what you can do there is come up
with sort of a structured tool you might
want to use crucible I know crucible is
really good for this where you have
certain criteria that people should look
for and you can put that in your coterie
description you can put that in the
there's like a specific field that
appears to people when they do a pull
request if you're using it and tell
people what specifically they should be
looking for at various points you might
want to provide the development agency
with a list of concerns they should be
watching for during code review as part
of kind of your standards for what you
want back from them and then you on the
project management side can provide a
second list of concerns to your code
reviewers so that they know what to look
for as well that okay thank you sorry
and of course normal team considerations
always apply you want to consider
whether you have two people who
absolutely hate each other and if you
put them both on the same project then
they're going to fight the whole time
maybe just do that all right so here's
kind of the tough part a lot of the
standard change management issues apply
to changes to code review process and
there are also additional issues because
the code review process is something you
do so frequently you do this all the
time you're going to really have to deal
with this and so when you're doing code
view process changes you need to be
extra careful I'm going to talk here a
little bit about the relevant objections
that managers might have so our first
imaginary manager here says that changes
to review processes are hard to keep
track of she just wants to keep it the
same because that way no one will lose
track some ways that you can deal with
this r by providing checklist I don't
know if any of you are familiar with the
checklist manifesto fewer things get
dropped when you have a good checklist
it's also important that you have a good
checklist not just any checklist you
can't just keep thumping things into
your checklist over the years and as it
gets longer and longer hope that people
will still use
it you want to keep this ideally under
10 items at any given time these are
just some sample checklists that I
created for two possible code review
processes you have one team who check in
the code update the issue status create
the code review doc and fight reviewers
follow up if needed and implement the
feedback you have another where they
have like a folder they're putting the
code in they invite the reviewers review
the comments meet to discuss the
comments and then post a final version
before they check in in each of these
scenarios you are not losing this
because you've added this additional
invite reviewers step and at the invite
reviewer step they know that what they
should be doing is considering which
functions should review which people are
not so useful in this case and who they
need to get feedback from before they
can move on with their imaginary process
checklist another way to have to get
around problems with people from getting
a process change is to incorporate when
change is expected this is going to be
different at every company but you might
have a point where you do a process
review like the end of the sprint to the
end of the year a goal-setting period or
just after a major release where you
review all of your processes and at that
time because people are expecting
process changes they've prepared for
them they've kind of set up the
infrastructure for learning new
processes you can make changes more
easily without people getting confused
because it's a random thing and you're
in the middle of a release and they're
just not ready for it you can also
incorporate reminders into the workflow
here i have another sample workflow you
create an issue assign the issue draft a
solution code review and resolve maybe
you go back to drafting a couple times
in the code review process and at any of
the plates i've marked with a star
drafting a solution code reviewing or
resolving the issue it's a great point
to remind people of the process at draft
of solutions say remember while you're
drafting that you should be thinking
about who should look at this at the end
if you see something and you're like oh
I'm gonna do this right now but I need
an architect to double check that this
is okay and this isn't horrible then
maybe jot down a note like hey invite an
architect for this one during the code
review process is the perfect time to
remind people because that's what
they're doing they're inviting code
reviewers they're working through common
they're actually doing this stuff and
then resolving the issue did you get
your code review did your code r you
have enough people on it did you just
invite one of your friends to your home
review so you could check off the box
that it's done just because you have a
checklist doesn't mean that you're just
trying to check things off remind you to
actually do things you need to actually
do the thing not just fulfill the
minimum requirements second imaginary
manager says our developers don't like
or need these other people in their code
there's a little bit of an encroachment
on territory kind of a feeling behind
this one and sometimes people do get a
little upset about this so this is a
legitimate objection for this manager to
have but if you communicate nobody wants
to produce bad code people don't say I
want to write this code so that it has
at least 100 bugs and I don't have to
work on anything else for the next 10
years because I'm just bug fixing all
the time and creating nothing new and
doing nothing interesting no one wants
that so if you communicate that we're
changing this process because it can
help you so you get to work on more
interesting things you get better
feedback you get more of the kinds of
feedback you want rather than just like
yeah you looked at it really carefully
but I looked at it too and I'm on the
same team so I have the same opinion
provide resourceful lead in what sense
so it once again I know you guys are all
going to hate this answer by the end it
depends on your particular organization
I think that a good source of this is
either a technical lead or development
manager because they have an idea of
what's going on with the functionality
but they also have an idea of what's
going on a little more broadly at the
organization the more specific you get
the more guidance you're going to need
but some places you will want it to
originate from the developer so that
they're in control of this process and
they're inviting in people they want it
really depends on your individual people
and your structure provide resources
this goes back to a question i had from
over there earlier you have to learn
what your reviewers know and help them
fill gaps if your reviewers don't know
how to read java and they're really
scared because what are all these
semicolons doing in here and i don't
know what to do with that sometimes
people can panic they'll freak out a
little bit and even though they could
really figure out what it is they'll get
kind of paralyzed by the fear and not
actually read it well enough to
understand what's going on but if you've
helped them fill those gaps then you can
build their confidence you can build
their skills and they're more likely to
see the code review as an opportunity
rather than just this thing that's being
foisted on them with no benefit to them
when I say you need to help them fill
gaps you need to produce resources some
people get a little scared that sounds
expensive that sounds like I'm going to
have to pay for lots of things but you
don't need to send them off to some
coding boot camp to become full-fledged
developers you really just need to
provide some basic resources to build
that basic confidence you can give them
code Academy for basic programming
concepts they have a really great
JavaScript course that while it's not
going to teach them Java certainly and
it's not going to bring them up to speed
as a full-fledged programmer goes over
things like loops and basic syntax in
pretty good detail and can help them get
to the point where they see code and
they're like all right I couldn't write
this but I know what it is I know how to
deal with this you can send them to
stack overflow for syntax questions we
love Stack Overflow everyone else can
use it to it's not a super secret magic
you can just go their answers to
everything especially the kinds of
questions that'll be getting code
reviewers going to have and you can
always have some books laying around for
curious readers that one you might need
to put some money into but it's a
one-time upfront investment it's not a
continuous one thousand dollars every
six months maybe have somebody get a
book or two every time they go to a
conference and most of all just ask what
they need as people are learning this
stuff they might have some vague
recollection of it but maybe their
confidence was shattered when they took
a beginning programming course and they
failed and now they think that they have
nothing of value to add to the code but
actually they have all of this knowledge
that could be brought to bear here and
what you're really looking for is not an
extra developers perspective but their
perspective and so giving them the
resources they need to build up that
confidence is really the most important
thing at this point presented as an
opportunity they're learning something
they're growing everybody gets to learn
about each other's jobs the developers
are learning more about what it is to be
a technical writer or a UX designer or
an architect the architects and UX
designers and technical writers are
learning more about how development
works and what it is that these people
actually do that comes out looking like
software on the other end and so this
really is a valuable skill exchange
opportunity our third fake development
manager says she doesn't want her people
involved so early in the process because
it's wasteful and the time is valuable
no one wants their employees to waste
time and so this is also a totally
reasonable objection to have but if you
are in a position of power you can
reduce other work by finding
inefficiencies in other processes once
again I hate bad processes bad processes
are the worst maybe you have the power
to produce fewer features while the
process ramps up if you are that magical
unicorn go for it and are any of the
people you want to have code reviewing
doing things that could or should go to
others maybe you've got a developer who
used to be an English shooter and
they're editing a bunch of people's blog
posts could you maybe outsource that to
marketing instead it happens sometimes
and that's usually going to be your
easiest way of reducing an individual's
work so that you can get them available
for code review emphasize the long term
reduction of Labor this is going to be
less work for you overall you are going
to reduce the number of bugs with your
feature you are going to reduce the
number of weird things that your feature
does kind of architectural your
structurally that you're then going to
have to replicate on other features you
build in the future for consistency
you're just making your whole future
life much much better by doing this
upfront and look at the actual waste how
much do you keep after code review you
probably keep those things that make it
that far a lot of people have this vague
at the code review stage we still might
throw it out sense but I've only heard
of two or three companies that actually
regularly district discard code reviewed
code do we have questions yes so the
question is how do you measure the cost
benefit of the process so that you know
whether you're adding value there are
kind of two ways to do that one is to
look at the area overall you can
implement the process first on a subset
of your code or your teams and look at
the difference in their bug count over
time or in the customer satisfaction
with their part of the product over time
or their product if you're a
multi-product company or at a lower
level if you're trying to see if a
particular role is adding value to a
code review then you can look at how
many comments they gave how many of
those comments were implemented and a
comparison of situations where the
comments were vs. were not implemented
so that you can see what the customer
satisfaction or the bug count was in
those cases if we don't have other
question yes
where I see an issue that you're either
dumbing it down so I'm hearing you when
you're doing the code review you have
people with varying levels of technical
skill you're either dumbing it down for
the people who don't have the technical
skill or you're boring the people who do
but you're boring someone because you're
at the wrong level okay so I'm guessing
this is with an in-person code review
process where everyone meets in a room
for the code review okay so if you have
a meeting where everyone is all together
then you're going to have to kind of aim
for the middle in some cases you don't
want to go way down to the most basic
thing in the meeting you want to allow
that person to move up but you also
don't want to aim for the highest person
in the room and have no one else
understand it um a lot of that can come
down to kind of training but you pretty
much don't want to alter the way you're
explaining your code you're hoping that
these people are looking for different
things visually and the code but you
still want to explain it roughly the
same level you would have previously
done unless that's some super high level
well maybe misspelled words is what
you're looking for from that person but
maybe it's not and if you give them
clear guidelines as to what they should
be looking for then they should be able
to provide reasonably valuable feedback
because Java is readable but to be here
in the keynote on Sunday it's more
important to produce readable code than
to produce lots of code I just
remembered now that I promised i would
take my phone off of airline mode at
this point and check Twitter for
questions do we have any other in person
questions while the internet is loading
yes
so running the code review event itself
this is also an in-person code review
process okay so for an interesting code
review process you want to apply the
same rules that you would apply to any
other good meeting you want to provide
an agenda and any materials the
attendees will be expected to review
well in advance you want to make sure
that people are actually reviewing those
materials in advance because that's
going to be one of your most important
parts and you want to make sure that you
start and end on time and that you don't
overload the agenda if there is room for
things to slip off of the agenda then
that's always better because then if
something goes long you're going to be
okay for an online code review process
or some sort of a file based system you
should emphasize clarity make sure that
the code you're writing is actually
readable it's not something cool that
you figured out how to do that no one
else will ever recognize but it uses
this super obscure Java feature and now
you get to learn how to do that you do
want to do it the best way possible and
as you're going through the online code
review process you want to make sure
that you have check-ins regularly follow
up with your reviewers make sure that
you're getting what you need if you're
not sure what someone said ask them what
they said ask for a clarification or a
new description of the same thing just
get as much information as possible okay
okay so working a little bit on starting
to bring automation into this process
what I think is that automated testing
is sort of a kind of checklist you make
a machine run this checklist so that you
don't have to use human time on it and
anything that you want to get out of a
code review that is going to be the same
every time if you want all strings to
start with capital letter or to end with
a period if you want all X to do y then
that should be an automated test you
should run it locally before you go to
code review and you should not make a
human try to remember that that is
another way you can keep your humans
checklist short and it's going to have
less of that human fallibility problem
that you're going to run into with the
in-person code reviews or sorry I think
human coat reviews some of the better
tools out there I am not familiar with a
super wide array I've mostly used the
same couple but there is someone who
worked with me while I was working on
this process who is in this room right
now who I think would be better to
answer that question and so I will
introduce you to him after at the top
yes
ok
so we have someone back there who is
using jdeveloper and who wants to know
if I've found that code reviews are more
successful when you have an ID that's
designed based to present the code in a
more consistent way it's definitely
always good to do anything you can to
add readability and consistency to the
code that people are going to have to
deal with I haven't worked specifically
with using jdeveloper for this purpose
but I do think that it's more successful
when you have things like syntax
highlighting so that people know what to
look out for especially if they're less
familiar with code if they can recognize
like okay the word string is going to
appear in green and when the word string
is in green that's where I need to
really pay attention so that they can
kind of skim and find more easily yes
behind the pole
so we have a question about consecutive
code reviews maybe there's a problem
that you don't want to use the technical
writers or UI designers time for that
could have been fixed first I have kind
of mixed feelings about consecutive
reviews right now because on the one
hand it can save time but on the other
hand it can produce conflicts in some
cases you will end up with a situation
where everything goes well you save time
everyone's happy but in other cases you
will get some comments you will
implement those comments and then you'll
get another comment that says you were
right the first time and then you have
to decide well do I undo this and go
with my initial gut instinct or was this
person really right and this person's
just used to seeing other people make
the same mistake i just made any other
in person questions i'm not seeing any
questions on the twitter feed but thank
you to the first time you said it was a
nice presentation yes
so what I have here is if you have a lot
of automated tests for continuous
delivery then what does this add on top
of what you can already get from the
automated testing and my answer to that
is this can add wherever you want
inconsistency maybe there are things
that would look the same to a machine
that are actually different and when you
add a human into the process you get
that context the context is why it's
worth introducing the error of having a
human try to find something yes it is
also a latency it's not always worth it
I'm by no means saying that you should
go full blast on this process every time
sometimes you might want to do just a
little bit of it sometimes you might not
want to do any of it if your automated
test is already going to give you
everything you need then sure but kind
of consider the automated test suite as
another code reviewer think about what
you will get from that person who is
your automated test suite and whether
there's something that another person
would be able to add
so I have not intentionally had someone
review parts but not others but every
once in a while it happens and there is
a pretty consistent higher rate of
missed things when one person doesn't
get the code review I don't have an
exact metric on hand right now but I
know that in at least one case someone
was skipped for a code review and when
they were added on later so that they
could look at it but it had already been
deployed to the customer they found a
credible bug that had been deployed to
the customer that they would have caught
on their first pass before it was
deployed to the customer if that was
when their first pass had happened yes
the question is have I ever placed my
reviewers in a streak identifying matrix
and yeah oh the gallop strengths finder
tool I see have I ever placed my
reviewers in a strengths finder tool
you don't I hadn't used it for that
purpose my current team does actually
use it we have a spreadsheet that has
everyone's Gallup strengths on it but I
hadn't thought to look for that in
correlation to the review process and I
might now have to go home and look up
how people's strengths correlate to
their past reviewing performance that's
a really good idea thank you very much
we do actually use it but not for that
that sounds like a fool use anyone else
I think we're running up on time here
yeah there's about five minutes left had
bonus content in case we didn't have
enough time or in case we didn't have
enough for the time but I'll just put
this up as people leave thank you for
coming I hope you enjoyed it I hope
everyone got something valuable out of
this don't make bad processes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
