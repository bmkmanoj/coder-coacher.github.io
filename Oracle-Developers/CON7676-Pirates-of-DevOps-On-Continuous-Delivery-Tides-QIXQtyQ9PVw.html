right my left we check the last slide
the laptop shut off because lat Barry
that's pretty good right and I'd like to
start no still have one minute right so
like to thank someone that I don't know
exactly who he was but already came here
took a picture of this light and already
post on Twitter that's great thanks
thanks a lot and I think that's part of
you know one of the things that we'd
like to say a lot is that the reason why
we are here an event is to me people
right we're not hearing the events to
necessarily wash talks I mean Tosh talks
is nice right but you know this talk is
being streamed for example and you could
could watch this talk later but the guys
sitting right beside you it's that's
that's important person that you need to
meet right now you know I'd like to see
on the events you see like you know two
guys and then there's a chair in the
middle and then there's two guys i bet
you guys know each other no you don't
right that's rare but you know huh yes
you do not yeah okay and then there's a
chair and there's two guys and there's a
chair again is you know because you're
our nerd right we don't talk to each
other so you know so that's a good
moment right now why are you still have
one minute before the talk starts just
say hello to the guys seen right by you
know he's interesting their votes right
like that like you are yes oh no so
maybe that's yeah so maybe that's
exactly the guy you need to learn you
need to know something about you know
you might yeah so lots of talk yeah
that's good you know the guy sitting by
you is probably the person that has the
same problems you have or maybe you know
he's trying to do the same thing in a
different project so it's it's a pretty
good it's a pretty good opportunity so
take this chance you're here you're
spending time you spending money to be
here and events use that to meet people
because that's what makes a big
difference for in our lives okay then
takes chairs out
just click space right leave right here
oh okay because we are on camera we
can't move farther from the chairs okay
so that's good alright guys thanks very
much for everyone to be here we you know
again I start here going to talk a
little bit about the parts of DevOps I
think you most of you probably know the
movie you know the parts of the
Caribbean this is one of the last known
movies i guess and parts of the
Caribbean but interest interesting movie
because as you know the the main
character of this movie Jack Sparrow on
this particular movie he doesn't do
anything you know he is the guy just
being his he gets arrested putting a
ship and you know everything he does the
whole movie someone tells him to do he
doesn't you know everything he doesn't
have the power to do anything but by not
having the power to do anything he
completely changed the story right he
gets everything you know he gets people
to do things he completely changed the
outcome that everyone expected and I
think that sometimes you feel like this
don't we all right sometimes we feel
like you know we don't have the power to
change things that we are just following
orders and so that's that the analogy
we're going to do here right it's you
know it's it's we sometimes have a lot
more power than we think and to talk
about this i have here for me my good
friend at cienaga add sony's the the
most recent java champion who's just
vote as a java champion cup of a couple
of weeks ago he is a very well-known
developer in brazil he works a lot with
you know his a constant works a lot with
companies they are trying to implement
those kind of things in in there you
know in their project and everything and
edge son has a very interesting
characteristic he works he's a promoter
of the softer craftsmanship movements
and I love this because as a softer
craftsmen's you you know you you you
take very good care of what you deliver
and I think that this is the most
important message that we have here is
that we're going to talk about DevOps
going to talk about delivering software
and if you want to talk about delivery
soft we have to care about the process
of delivering so you know a hand of
applause here for Edson thank you thank
you hello everybody I like the message
that we have to deliver software it's
left okay and that as developers our
mission is to change people's lives for
the better of the things that we do
every day and we can do always do better
we can do better code we can deliver
better software and to talk about DevOps
with me I have Bruno Sosa i'm pretty
sure that most of you already know him
but he's the guy that brought was a Java
to Brazil 20 years ago he's known in
brazil as the java man here since the
brazilian java man a que the guy with
the flag so this year is a special flag
yeah she promotes not wearing a
Brazilian flag he has a 20 years of java
flag yes so that's a very special days
for for all of us okay so let's talk a
little bit about you know about what one
means to be a part 1 but first of all
you know this whole discussion about
DevOps right we we have this false fight
in our companies in our projects between
you know the team that does developments
in the team that does operation right
you know we took out the years we kind
of created this notion that oh you know
developers have to innovate developers
have to create new stuff now I
developers have to general that's that's
our job right we have to create new
ideas and create new soft it doesn't
exist we have to innovate so we have to
be fast you have to be agile and all
this kind of things and then the guys on
operations like oh no we have to keep
the quality of the system right we have
to keep the system up and running we
have to guarantee the performance so to
guarantee quality to guarantee it up and
running we have to minimize change
and then you know developers have to
maximize change because that's what we
do and then the operations like no no we
have to minimize changes so we kind of
create this idea that you know we are
like fighting each other you can choose
which one you are and you know you're
trying to fight each other here to try
to get something but the truth is a
service it's software running there's no
fighting this discussion right if we
think that's what we need is provide
value to our end users that's what we do
right while we do what we do right so we
don't do softer just to do softer right
we do software because we want to
improve someone's life there's someone
in the other side of our our application
that's you know once better
entertainment once an easier way to rent
a hotel once you know gets a cab because
you want you need to get to it get back
home you know this person needs a better
life somehow and that's what we provide
right we don't provide software we
provide better life and provide value to
our to our users and there's no value if
there's no software and there's no value
if it's not running right so it's a
false discussion because our objective
is to deliver software good quality
software right with new functionality in
the hands of our users so the whole
objective here when you talk about
DevOps is that development in operations
need to focus on delivering software not
focus on writing software not focus on
on getting quality of soft focus on
delivery software right we all need to
be on the same boat right and if we
realize that we are in the same boat
that makes things a lot easier yeah
let's say that dev development and
operations is a false dichotomy because
usually as Bruno said each of these
parks are interesting a different thing
and usually we only care about our own
job developers care to code operations
care to keep it running and when you
have a system you have that area of
constraint
when you have a system of a process
where each process follows one another
when you maximize try to maximize each
one then you always do you never get
optimal outputs so instead of trying to
maximize your own job we should try to
maximize flow so that we can deliver
better software to the users instead of
maximizing codes and maximize operations
so we are so that's that's kind of the
idea of DevOps but the problem is we are
all developers here right and so we all
don't feel that we have the power to
change things and the one of the
problems DevOps that we talk about
culture right everyone that talks about
DevOps a DevOps is culture have to
change the code of the company do you
feel that you can't change the couch of
your company right you know your
developer I'm sure you felt like this
everyone is against you at some point
right you know so how how do we change
culture and the worst of all mean absent
we're consultants right it's even worse
when I consider the guy that comes in
and everyone assumes that we do we get
more money than you do that's not true
right everyone assumes that we know less
than you do that's no that's might be
true to right and everyone assumes that
we're there just to tell you what to do
and then we're going to go away right so
everyone is that no one wants you to
hear what we were talking about right so
how can we actually go inside a company
and say we're going to change your
culture right culture is it's not what
we want to do couch is what we do right
so we know we feel like this all the
time you know everyone's against us
right I'm sure you felt like this tied
to your chair you can't get out even to
go eat lunch or go back home right I'm
sure you also felt like being you know
drager to endless meetings that you
don't want to participate worst of all
you know you have to find very boring
pain painful people in those meetings
right and it doesn't you know and then
you know you are always put to do the
worst job of all right and you know how
can you actually do anything how can you
change culture if that's that's that's
your daily life right so and then I'm
sure you
fuel no I don't have the power to change
the couch of my company so when you hear
about people talking oh you know let's
do DevOps right and you're like oh this
develop things all about culture let me
just keep doing what I'm doing because
you're never going to change a culture
of my company and we say we must have a
culture change you must change it but
every every city ocio talking about
changing a company culture I liked this
definition company culture is what we do
so how do we change what we do that's
the finger we must have in mind when
talking about DevOps because the wops it
doesn't follow a top-down approach the
verbs Rises but what you can you can you
do to make this change rise that's why
we say we are we must provide a system
of very small steps that can change your
everyday work because culture is what we
do so well how can we provide a system
of very small steps that can do that we
can press and do every day to improve
the things that we do every day so that
later yeah I don't matter it doesn't
matter if it's a week later a month or
six months laters we can have and be
able to say that we are doing devops so
so we're inviting you to be part of this
what we call the parts of DevOps because
sometimes we've got to be pirates inside
our own company right sometimes we got
to get on the table and kick everything
sometimes you know we got to jump all
the windows you know to get out of that
that that environments right sometimes
we've got to jump out of art of
waterfalls in this case right you know
what does what what do you do if your
boss tells you to jump out of a
precipice right what do you do are you
jump right it's your boss right you know
so we're going to tell you you're going
to teach you how to jump out of a brace
bisous a new ball your boss tells you to
do you know jack had to do that in the
movie you know a lot of times you have
you know sometimes you might even have
to to trick your boss I guess you know
so Jack
this moment on the movie where he
basically had to trick his boss just
save her right from from the destiny
that she that you know she's going to
die at some point so we are actually
asked in our heritage inviting you to be
agents of change right to be the person
inside your team inside your company
inside a project that does those small
steps every time and then you know even
if no one else wants to do anything even
if it's not a top-down approach even if
your organization doesn't want but if
you can if you focus on delivering you
can do you can change all those things
and you can make those things daily yeah
we're asking you to do the only thing
that you're capable of doing the only
person that you can for sure changes
yourself you need to change and we will
talk about system we can't change people
but you're able to change yourself you
can't tell someone Oh tomorrow you're
going to be a DevOps guy tomorrow you're
going to do DevOps we can change we can
tell anybody to do that because they
want but we can't change the
restrictions of the system when we say
the culture is a system it is another
definition of relationships between
people so how do we change these
relationships how do we change what
people do we change the restrictions of
the systems of the that that apply to
the people instead of trying to change
the people one of the things that I'd
like to say that which kind of
restrictions can we change in our
relationships one of the best words that
we learn in restrictions change is about
say no because I guess it's all around
the road in Brazil we're very used to
say yes to everything but then we don't
what about we say start saying no to
something that's the change of
restriction because if people are used
to hear something from you but you don't
then you start saying no but when you
say yes you really do it is a change of
the restrictions and I'm saying just
saying a very small example or what your
attitudes
of changing a single restriction
modifies behavior of other people so
which what we're trying to show you is
that we're going to create a system of
very small restrictions changes that you
do every day to implement culture to
change what you do and watch people do
yeah so the you know so we're proposing
here five simple steps that you can do
every day you know take an hour a week
to do those things for example or now
you know that you can do every day or
one of the steps each day small things
that you can add your project and then
you know you know in a few months that
will change a lot of things for you and
that will change a lot of things for
your your whole project now I guess
everybody here can can take at least one
hour per week to do at least one hour
per week to do one of these five small
steps to improve your career to improve
your software development process to
improve the things that you can do to
change people who love people's lives
right so when we talk about DevOps
there's a lot of you know there's
several different definition of their
webs are out there in your ad said you
know you got to be a DevOps sometimes
you know if you have DevOps in your
title people say you know if you have
the DevOps in your tire you're probably
doing wrong right so you know but one
one thing that we notice is that you
know the one thing we like to say a lot
is that DevOps is us together doing
continuous delivery it's us together
delivering softer so when you get the on
this mindset that your whole objective
as a developer as a company as you know
as a project is to actually deliver
software because unless you deliver
nothing is going to happen right if you
get on this on this mindset those those
little step is going to help you
actually focus on delivering we got out
we got to get over the fear of
delivering it's so funny that as
developers our whole objective in life
is to create something that other people
going to use so our whole objective is
to deliver software where you are all
the time creating excuses to deliver
software oh it's buggy oh it's not ready
oh I need you testing one more time oh
there's one more meeting Oh someone has
to approve oh I can't do anything about
that oh it works on my machine right why
do we know it's not it's not not going
to work in customers and we're all full
of excuses because we have this huge
fear of delivering the software you know
so many people I'm from the open
sourcing I'm one of the directory open
source initiative so many people tell me
oh I don't participate it open source
because you know if I put my code out
there what people going to say yeah
we're all full of those excuses we got
it we got to get over them right because
that's our objective is to get soft in
the hands of people so let's make it
happen so what are those five steps
first one of them it's automate right
you got to do automation one of the
funniest thing of all is that developers
you know one of the best thing that we
got to do is we know out the things that
we do all the time is ultimate other
people's life right isn't isn't what we
do as a job right you know we make you
know we automate how people rested for a
hotel we automate how people register
for a conference we automate how people
ask for this or do that and then we get
you out what we do we say oh no it takes
too long child to make things right I'm
going to do this tomorrow it's just one
time right i'm not i don't need to do
I'm not gonna automate this now because
i'm just going to run this one time and
then we're running for a deer hunters
time like oh that's the last time I
gonna run this by hands right so I'm
gonna I'm going to knock out omit now
because I don't have the time so
automation something that we do for
everyone else we got to focus on this on
our life right so we have to eliminate
repetitive tasks we must automate to
save time so what we're proposing that's
during the next week yeah because here
this week you're at javaone yeah yeah
okay talk about tues and what tools you
have you you can use to automate your
test every day we selected some all of
them open source if you well we that we
work with Java so some of the tools that
we can use to automate daily steps
for example beaut automation may even f
maven and Gradle you can use out
infrastructure automation tools just
like ansible chef puppets you can
automate scam evolution of databases
like Flyway in fact many of these tools
they are we presented them last year so
there's a presentation available parlays
if you like to know more about these
tools we have a red explain them in an
online session and we can use and one of
the most important tools of automations
is the continuous integration server so
we selected to open source continuous
integration service like Jenkins which
of course is the most popular one and we
also provided go which is a to that was
recently released as open source by
ThoughtWorks the main difference between
Jenkins and go Jenkins has a much bigger
user base much more plugins but Jenkins
focuses on jobs individual jobs and go
focuses on software pipelines so you can
have the whole view of what you're doing
in every one of these steps instead of
individual views so any one of those
tools we allow you to do a little bit of
automation whatever part you are so if
you're working with the database this
week maybe you could try Flyway and
automate you know the creation creation
migration for your database right if
you're you know if you're doing builds
you could might lose one of those suits
you automate or build anything that you
can do to improve the automation for
process any one of those two that you
can learn to do those things that's
going to improve the way you do
automation yeah don't spend more time
creating that email to the DBA bow when
the next software releases gets on air
you have to apply this superscript to be
run of the database no automated that
user to to do this job for you so this
time we're proposing that during the
next week you spend one hour automating
the task that takes most time of your
week out so take anything
if you have to upload a file you have to
execute five single steps on the comment
line to do something take that putting
on the script it can be a shell script
it can be a powershell script it can be
an ansible script you can be a job on
Jenkins do anything that you need to do
to automate one single step to save this
time for the next week so you spend one
time one hour this week to save a lot of
hours in the next month's that you're
they're about to come and it's funny
that a lot of times we don't realize how
much you know if we don't have the
mindset of automating who don't realize
how much steps we do by hands I remember
that I got in a project one time and you
know the guys were having like the long
problem with deploys and you know when I
got in I was a consultant right so
everyone is against me so I've sat in a
meeting and the guy said no it's all
automated now right and and so the the
manage was like no no it's I don't know
I didn't see it yet to say okay so
they're Saints automated so let's just
assume it is let's let's let's just see
it and she got mad at me because you
know you should have told them it's not
automated so I don't know they said it
is so we went in they actually get the
guys did automates and lots of lots of
interesting things and then when they
showed me what you're doing they had 56
steps to do a deploy 56 right and they
had automated four of them and they you
know for them it's all now out all
automated because they didn't realize
how much of the other steps they were
actually doing it so sometimes we don't
see until we actually put on paper
everything that we do right so this is
really important for gonna miss my dad
automation has another advantage it
prevents you to put things on paper you
can put it on codes which is a live
representation of what you're doing
that's process documentation and the
script it's alive documentation of what
you're doing okay so that was a first
step second step is dashboards right you
know as an earnest ship you're trying to
to to navigate in the middle of the sea
sure you have a map right I'm sure
you're looking what where you are right
now and where you want to go and you're
taking a look at all these and a lot of
times we are trying to do things and we
don't we don't have visibility on those
things we don't we don't map what we're
doing what the results we're getting and
where works out you want to be right so
there is a whole lot of dashboards you
know open source dashboard software you
can use just to see how your project is
right now it's extremely important that
we track how our project is how are you
going how we're actually getting where
we want to get yeah how do you know if
you're delivering good software how do
you know how much time are you spending
on delivering this software how do you
know if you're improving or you're
getting worse you must measure something
to get this kind of sites so what we're
asking instead of I think I'm doing this
week better than last week in fact is in
fact of of just thinking about it what
about creating a number so what we're
asking you this week is to get and
provide one number yeah that we
represent what you do this number could
be the total count of bugs that you fix
it this week the total downtime of your
service and production this week but we
want you to create a number it doesn't
matter if you create a script automated
script of course two three shoe a QE to
your database and get the number but you
will simply provide a number that means
something to you and when I say what am
I going to measure measure something
that is important for you measure
something that is supported for your
boss but just create a number we need
numbers to check out how we're doing and
there's a lot of interesting tools out
there we just select you hear that you
can easily use to do those things
because but because one of the problems
the number is that a number by itself
means nothing right you have to have a
history of numbers right if you get your
boss and it's how about my your boss so
this week we had 50
minutes of downtime he's probably going
to get mad of you right you know he's
probably going to say something bad to
you now if next we could say boss this
week we proved it in fifty percent our
up time right now he's going to be happy
so we got to get those numbers so dash
builder it's an easy it's a nice little
little jboss tool that you just upload
your you know just just a warfighter you
can install your in your application
server and it will run queries in the
database you will get numbers out of a
CSV file we get it gets numbered all a
lot of different places and drop you
know plots things to you and make sure
that you have the history of the things
and showing a nice nice dashboard for
you but you know if you think that's
putting dash builder and find their
numbers too it's too hard maybe just
want to install son are right sonar you
just install it point you to your cheer
source code repository and then he just
creates a lot of dashboards for you so
now you can select some of some of those
of those numbers to keep you know to
keep paying attention at you know can
start with with some small things don't
need to look at so now has all kinds of
different information don't you look all
of them at the same time or at least you
have some ideas would be nice yeah so
now Cuba is a very available a static
analysis source code to you can it can
provide you a lot of numbers including
the amount of cash would you have to pay
to to to resolve your technical depth
and dash birthday disputer is much more
flexible because it's kind of a bi to
you can run anything that you need a
sequel Curie or even the script just to
provide anything that you run that can
return a number dash buter can save yes
and this whole thing add some kind of
really quick up to talk about your
technical depth and that is one
important thing that might that will
interest a lot your boss right so if you
don't measure you know that's we're
going to talk about visibility in a
minute but one of the important things
for you to give visibility in your
project is how much you
no you're you're acquiring of technical
depth because you know a lot of times we
do you take decisions like you know
there is a competitor that just release
it something or you know the marketing
guy just asked something really
important so we had to do a workaround
to implement that really quick every
time you do this you require technical
death if you don't deal with the
technical depth in eventually your
application going to be so complex and
so hard to change that you won't be able
to do any change so the sooner you start
paying your technical debt the last is
the chance of your of your depth
actually exploding at some point so but
the the funny thing is that when
you have depth in your bank you see
these every month right receive the bank
statement you know you tell you dear
your depth is increasing so you want
your really to go and pay and do
something to pay that that but technical
death is usually hide him somewhere
right it's in the middle of your code
somewhere you don't see it and since you
don't see it you don't realize how much
it is and you don't hear realize that
you do have to spend time paying for
that yeah we're not interesting if the
metric or the number that sonarqube
creates is it's real but at least it's a
number it's something that you can see
in check and you can track and see if it
improving or getting worse a lot of
times it's not you know it's not the
number specific it's important but it is
you know how it's growing are reducing
right and one of the problems that we
have also is visibility now we're
talking about putting numbers but you
know jack on this on this one of the
steps they had to do in this this trip
they had to capture a mermaid right and
you know so they put a little bit of
visibility they wanted to do this they
kind of put a beam of light over there
somewhere in the sea and so they were
able to put some lights on the mermaid
they want to capture right so this is 0
0 so you know just a little bit of
lights we can start seeing things but
sometimes you know the problem that we
have that you know we don't keep our
focus on the objective right we get
fascinated by just one thing that we are
able to see and you say okay so this is
so great I'm being able to
see my technical debt for example and
you started lose focus that our focus is
on delivering software and a lot of
times what happens is that you know we
get fascinated and we don't realize
what's worth right we see this beautiful
problem that we just we just focus on
and funny enough we do have two
different types of problems right you
know or we have all kinds of internal
problems you know our application has
problems you know our codes is messy for
some reason etc and then our you end
users also have problems and a lot of
times we focus so much on the internal
problems that we think they are huge so
we say all next let's less less time
that we try to deliver an application we
had this problem of the database oh it
was a huge problem right you know so
we're going to delay our next delivery
we're going to have more meetings we're
going to have more discussions because
it was a huge problem for the database
less time and re end user didn't notice
anything right because the end user was
not access application at a time or
whatever our end user didn't see how
this big problem that we had so we are
now delaying the application we're now
not putting new functionality hands of
our users we're not improving their
lives because we have this huge internal
problems that we didn't know how to
handle it because sometimes we just put
the lights in our internal problems and
they get huge they get big and we forget
they're our biggest problem of all is
our end users are not happy right and
that's hard to measure that's hard to
see so a lot of times we gotta you know
and then we what happen is that helps
you know we end up getting bitten by our
problems right so sometimes we got to
know jack did this he's exploded
something internal right and put a lot
of like the size of problem then we see
oh come on the problem is real it's
different right so we got to focus on
the right problems we got to give
visibility to the things that really
matter we got to give visibility to the
proper to the things that matter for our
project the things that matter
for our customers so we actually have to
focus on delivery software and give
value what are the things that we got a
measure to give visible to that that
part and we talk about visibility we're
talking about metrics we need that
number is that we gathered last week
that we're using we have we have a next
number last week now we have my number
this week we're going to compare just as
Bruno said one number alone usually
never means anything but you need two
numbers to compare if you're improving
or if you're getting worse so instead of
just getting dance numbers saved on a
database we're going to see and compare
we're going to create a metric a metric
that will trend upwards or downwards
depends on watching what we need and
what kind of metric can we provide to
our system so we're asking you now the
next week to create the numbers that you
use the past week and create a metric
what kind of metric must I choose if you
want to convince your fellow colleagues
the oh look what I'm doing I'm doing I'm
trying to do to do some de Bob's here to
improve our jobs you're going to use a
metric that can improve their time if
you want to impress your boss you're
going to create a metric based on the
value that is the the software that
you're creating can provide your users
oh this time i'm selling $10,000 this is
the next week i'm selling ten percent
more that's kind of metric that you must
create ok so now we're going to teach
you how to jump out of recipes right so
at some point jack on the movie uh you
know his boss tells him you gotta jump
and said you know I'm I can't jump right
of course he can't jump off recipe so
you know no so he you know but he didn't
didn't have a no option isn't isn't this
a few lot of times you know chefs your
boss say you know you gotta put this
soft in production you like come on I'm
not ready right I don't know he's going
to work what's going to happen so now
the way for each
out of Krispies you all know this very
well is testing right so Jack does this
he gets a voodoo doll and he throws a
voodoo doll on the depressed piece right
so when he the dog gets in the end well
his ops 2 alive so he can all he knows
he can jump right so testing his fries
is pretty similar like this right we got
it we gotta do our testing we got a butt
but the thing is we got a test important
things with a lot of times of course
unit testing is extreme important of
course tdd is extremely important i'm
not saying I'm not discussing this but a
lot of times we kind of create all this
test infrastructure to test technically
only and we forget that the most
important thing is that our end user
it's able to use the application right
way it's able to use application so for
example if you're doing a Commerce
application right there's a lot of
things you can test where you can test
if the labels are pretty right if the
image of the product is ok you can test
all those kind of things and you can
spend years testing all of these but
really all you want to know is if the
user can buy or not right because if
your last application the guy the
designer made an error on CSS and the
buy button disappear it doesn't matter
the rest of the statute beautiful or not
right it's simply simply not going to be
useful for users not for you so
sometimes we have to streamline and find
exactly what what are the most important
testing that we got to do you know like
Jack did you know the most important
test is he's going to be alive or not
right everything else he can he can deal
with it but that was the most important
testing so we got to focus on testing
what is really important for us no tools
and what about the tools that you can
use to do to test your software of
course we have j unit everybody knows
about june you can provide your unit
tests you your integration tests jane is
a testing framework to provide some
integration testing you can use spring
framework if your spring user if you're
not you can use your key Liam for java
ee software and you can so you can also
use for interation testing like for web
pages you can use selenium these tools
are new they're very consolidated
markets but more than just using the
tools what we're asking you to do next
the following week is choose what to
test because we know it's impossible to
test everything so instead of focusing
Oh J unity is important for code quality
integration testing is good to see if my
code is issuing correct here is to my
database or two different providers
selenium tracks the user interaction
with your system but we're asking you
what would be the smallest simple thing
that you can test that you provide
confidence to you that you can put this
software into production sometimes you
you can test the logging sometimes you
can test just if some number is
appearing but just as brain said take
the smallest finger think that you can
test that will assure you that you can
put this software in production
sometimes these can they user get the
product and parked in the shopping cart
and and and press pay yeah because
anything else usually doesn't matter he
doesn't have to check his orders you
will not pretty to do not prevent him
from buying so take the most important
value metric that you can provide and
test it and we say testing test it in
your software development pipeline later
you can monitor this tests also in your
production servers and of course that's
how you jump out of frisbees right when
you have trust when you trust that you
can jump that's nothing going to happen
right when you have confidence that you
can actually do it and then it's the
whole team works a lot better right
because because this is a very important
step for you as a developer but very
important step for the whole company if
the company trusts that you can actually
jump out of the precipice note without a
problem it's going to be a lot easier
right for you to deliver software it's
going to be a lot easier for you to
innovate faster it's going to be a lot
easier for you to actually focus on
delivering right and that's probably the
step that will help you most resolve
your fears because not your personal
view but the fear of the company right
the company has a fear of somehow making
a you know making a bad thing for the
user right so those tests are the ones
that we get everyone both development
team the operations team but also
marketing and management everything the
confidence the trust to actually do and
move faster yes intestacy you testing is
so important because usually when we
talk about DevOps we're trying to oh we
must have tomato software deployment
pipeline but nobody usually tries to
automate because oh I'll never know if
it's working before a part in production
so testing is one of the most important
things that you can do to provide the
enough confidence to create a continuous
delivery or continuous deployment
software pipeline you must do its that's
the technical thing that you can do that
will improve the most they will create
the most confidence in you that you can
put your software production so next
step is virtualization everyone is
talking about cloud computing right yes
cloud computing is great but what behind
cloud computing is virtualization right
so you don't need oh I company you're
never going to go to public cloud I'm
never going to be able to put anything
on Amazon or maybe you're the artery
round right you're already using all
those stuff so visualization is the
important thing because you can use no
cloud
visualization in your laptop in your
internal server you can use anywhere and
that's extremely important for us first
to do things especially one important
one very very important thing there's
the containers right here we have a
whole ship inside a bottle right in a in
a kind of content but that's it's it's
probably the most important thing that
we can do right now you know a cloud
technologies are important but
containers are going to be the most
important thing for us developers and
operations to do DevOps yeah we like to
talk about virtualization and containers
as the single responsibility principle
just I don't know how many of you have
heard about clean code and solid
principles but this is on solid is
single responsibility and just as we use
the single responsibility principle on
code we should apply the single
responsibility principle on an
infrastructure because what what does
this principle applies to code it
minimizes the changes or possible
outcomes that you can have on a given
class so but when we provide a server
for production usually we install a lot
of different things running on the same
server it makes it very hard to change
whoa I have a full stack of things
running on the same server but I can't
just choose one to upgrade because we
broke the rest of the things I can't
change it individually and usually you
can't maintain history or what change it
during that time so that's why we asked
you to apply the single responsibility
principle on your infrastructure so that
every piece of software that you need to
provide yourselves running we run on a
different container that makes it
extremely easy to scale to replicate to
upgrade your different kind of services
that you need to run in production so so
there's a lot of different tools that
you can use out there for containers
darker has created for the first time
you know content is the technologist
this reasonably all just seems from it
from the 70s there
as containers but doctor for the first
time created like this standard that we
can you know that we can actually like a
beaut a container and run this
containing in all kinds of different
providers in different places so with
that standard for the first time we're
actually able to move containers between
providers and move containers and
creates a clear interface between what
we do as development and what we do as
operations a lot of people think the
DevOps is development operations working
together in the same room like so there
are companies that do this right you
have a war room where developer in
operations got to sit together side by
side and work like this that works right
you can do that but that's usually a
huge change in company culture that's
probably not something easy to do so you
can actually do a much better way of
working together we're making a clear
interface between what I developer do
and what you operations work with
containers is a very very good interface
between development operations and
that's an amazing way to do to do DevOps
right II doubt having just sit down side
by side because you build your container
and the guys for operations he doesn't
care what's inside he knows how to stop
start back up disaster recovery scale
the container doesn't matter if you put
job inside or Ruby or or PHP or no GF
doesn't matter what you put inside right
so that is a very clean good interface
between those two teams okay so what
we're asking you is that is spend some
time on the next week to get one thing
of replication and put inside a
container right just whatever it is you
know download a pre pre-dawn container
with tomcat for example just install
application in it whatever you do it's
going to be a huge step forward because
that you know containers in the next 22
to 25 years containers will completely
change the way we develop software yeah
and some of you might be thinking but my
company doesn't use the containers yet
I'm going to to do it what instead of
containers if you can't use your drug
companies infrastructure you can
virtualize anything on your own machine
so you can just download virtualbox
which is a free brutalization to install
it on your machine and we're asking you
to take anything that you use every day
and utilize it into a vm or inter
container into anything that's possible
just even if it's just for that the next
time you need that too if the next time
you need to upgrade the two you won't
have to format your machine and
reinstall it again so that you can
upgrade the tools that you have in your
notebook individually so they can have
both running oh I'm going to test the
new version of the to install it's a
virtual machine or in a container you
can test it if everything goes right you
can use the diversion if anything goes
wrong you already have the older version
running into a virtual machine or inter
container it allows you to change your
tools into your notebook independently
so if you can't change your application
in your production infrastructure you
could at least try and turn notebook
because in your notebook you usually
don't have to ask anybody ok so we just
just some some tips here it's it's
usually you know these parts of DevOps
thing is usually a lonely a journey a
lot of people you know you're going to
have to keep doing it and two other
people can start seeing the results so
that's that's normal right and we can we
can we can do a lot of things without
having to change everything the company
right but one thing that we want the
same way to does in the movie that
they're looking forward you know the
water of life right that's what we want
right we want that you have a better
life that you have a better career as a
developer that you can work better and
things so what we wants to everyone in
the same boat go in the same direction
DevOps is we all together doing
continuous delivery you want interesting
things that when you start say about
computers oh do you mean like I commit
the code he goes into production no
that's not what we mean we mean that if
you deliver
once a year let's let's see what you can
do to the river software once has over
six months right if you do deliver
software once every 40 for months let's
see what we can do to deliver software
ever every two months if you're ready
delivery software every week let's see
what we can do to the liver twice a week
right let's cut by half the time that we
take to put a new version in production
yeah let's cut the risk in half let's
cut this delays the cost of delay that
we have in our system so so just to say
I will repeat the five steps that you're
going to do in the next five weeks so
you're going to automate you're going to
measure something you're going to create
a metric that represents something to
you or to your company or to your boss
you're going to test if the software can
go into production and you're going to
virtualize anything that you need that
you can use any day that's the five
single steps that you can do to provide
because we know we are what we do
culture is what we do so we can change
things by changing the things that we do
and we learned in front of many years
that we're working on it to change
anything that you do you must spread so
y 5 single steps so that you can press
at least once a week what we do to
change your culture and unfortunately
not everyone right that's the same on
the movie in and Jack had to leave his
boss away right but not necessarily a
boss but sometimes some people in your
teen some people in your company will be
the naysayer is going to be that's not
going to work i'm not going to do i'm
not going to change that's okay right
just keep doing what you're doing just
keep focus on on being on delivering
software that's the important thing
right so you can have life right I'm a
better life that's what we want to know
if you can do like Jack and his partner
with four hands full of containers you
know going home on a nice time that
would be wonderful and just to end here
and i'm not sure if have time for
Question think we're already over time
here we do have
those slides and we're going to send you
some bonus material if you want it
there's a little jazz a form here java
mm / career you know you can you can get
a you can access there and we're going
to going to send you the slides and
links and information about this and
keep you up to date on things that you
can do to improve your project or a
career I finish it's good okay thanks
very much guys
yes no time compression yes oh we have
time for questions okay so you anyone
has any questions or comments or yes
there's no microphone is okay so the
question is how software configuration
management tools like ansible chef and
puppet can cause it with docker yeah in
containers in a general way we believe
it's there they're a perfect match this
their complementary yeah you have to
quickly they they work very well so
particularly chef and puppets they were
designed to to manage virtual and real
servers so they have you have a chef
server and a puppet master if you change
anything it rolls back your your your
modifications and turn it to into its
original state but instable for example
is the two that was designed it just to
to have an ssh connection it connects
and it provides your infrastructure but
in a simple mode in installs everything
that you need to run your your your
application so the best thing about
containers I'd like to say container is
a diet vm so what we do in software
development pipelines we use to like
darker and unstable or share for puppets
to provision the container image so we
use them oh there's a blank container
use provision and save so what you put
in production you just instantiate that
image so these tools are used to create
content images another tool is very
useful for this pipeline is pecker
peckers allows you to automate the
creation of your virtual appliances you
because appliance is the term that when
you pack infrastructure and your
application in the same thing we call it
virtual appliances so pecker is a
virtual appliance creation too that's
one you should be using but we will if
you subscribe
do the links yeah so basically so
basically what we want is is immutable
infrastructure right so so all those
chef and puppet our usage kind of
evolved infrastructure right you know we
can use them to kind of create
infrastructure that's inaudible later so
it's they work well together there's a
phrase we would say about servers we
just talked about cloud computing that
is cat or kettle if you deal with your
infrastructure as cat because cat
usually is our pet we give names that
this is my cat is another we cherish our
service but when you say cattle usually
you don't want to know from which cattle
can your steak so it's like it's
carnivals it's disposable so when we
talk about containers usually what if
it's a it's a high level of DevOps
because you're already carrying about a
disposable infrastructure right it
doesn't matter goes down it's much
easier to spin anyone rather than
figuring out Oh what happened with that
right yeah there's another question over
there no okay that's an excellent book
the Phoenix project in fact I recommend
if anybody haven't read the eight yet
the Phoenix project is it's great he in
fact it doesn't even appear to be a
technical book it's a funny story the
Phoenix project that's from Jinny Kim
yeah yeah it's it's like a novel of
DevOps right so it says a lot about our
lives what we like about what we usually
try to say about the business value
because people are big companies are
used to have I to to provide the confirm
the software configuration management to
control what changes but in fact when we
control what changes you increase the
delay and this is they it has a costs
usually people prevent change because it
prevents risks but we've develops is the
opposite you increase change to prevent
risk it's not it doesn't sound
economical but when you think about what
usually bro
take things in production change your
things if you increase the batch of the
things that you change you increase the
risk of something going wrong but
instead if you if you reduce the amount
of batch and you put in production the
only thing the only risk that you have
that's little modification that you had
to do a code might go wrong so if
anything goes wrong whoa we are sure
that that method that we change it
provided that the default so when you
know exactly what you look for but when
you increase the batch of changes man I
changed three thousand lines of code
which one is causing the problem it's
much worse I know we have a hard time
convincing business people that instead
of increasing the delay we must reduce
but that's what pratts has proven to us
you reduce the batch of change you
reduce the risk it's in fact in most of
the cases when you have a very small
batch but in software production it's
much much easier to spot a problem
correct it and put another in production
than rolling back yeah because I to
requires you to row back but I've never
seen a successful row back in production
every time somebody has to do something
to put it back in production so what we
were asking it it's economically if you
think better it makes economical sense
to reduce the bed size right yeah and
that's that's why so so reducing the
risk it's so amazingly important for
each delivery software right that's
that's that's why automation in
visualization are so important because
our whole objective is to be able to
really fast put another another version
production so it has to be automated it
has to be visualized it right begin in
Denny and you have to have some form of
testing if that's working you know if
you don't have those things how can you
quickly put a new version in production
you can so the whole objective here of
those those steps is to reduce the risk
put less things in production and get
more so so actually it's a funny thing
right because because we at the same
time we reduce the risk we accelerate
the
the delivery and we get more value to
our customers I mean it's it's like a
win-win-win situation all the time right
and the problem is that we are so afraid
of it that we kind of we kind of
generated excuses to not do it right
although it's only wins we say no no
something's going to go wrong so let's
let's just delay it and delay it and
delay and delay so we never do it right
and then the worst thing of all is that
we delay delay delay then suddenly
someone I'd say we have to put this now
and then you put whatever you have I
mean that's huge risk right because now
you now you don't even you know all the
proposal I improvement that you are you
thinking that you're gaining by delaying
you actually lose the whole thing
because you now have to put in
production rushing yeah the fact that
the the action of you have to put it now
is one of the key chapters of the
Phoenix project yeah you have to deliver
now because because that the dates men
yeah it's not because it's ready yeah
but DevOps in fact all of the step that
we we we told you about trying to
improve the verbs we will allow you to
deploy it any time because you will be
ready at any time yeah so you can reduce
that risk okay guys think I think we're
out of time here just let me just let
everyone whoever we're gonna be here
discussing more things right but I have
to leave the room but we just the
science yeah but we're going to be here
right so whoever wants you to ask more
questions or you know we're already
we're going to be here the whole week
I'm easy to spot right so and but thanks
very much for being and staying for the
stove that long thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
