our talk what school in our sub champion
I'm Thomas Lee and I'm at ap since 15
years first years at the database
porting probe than 10 years and
suffragists check soft Lea logistic and
since 3 years I'm yeah at the SI p h FM
group mainly in the tools area I'm
cuttin in Maya I'm also I'm working at
sa P I am working there for eight years
now started with the Itanium part of our
s AP JVM and then since then working in
all kind of areas on the virtual machine
ok our talk has basically four parts we
start out telling background about our
virtual machine we show some of our
support ability features we added to the
virtual machine you use a demo there and
then we talk about our profiling tool in
our debugger ok let's start with the SCP
JVM so ok what is such a vm s a peach I
am sorry
oh it's a standard regular little
machine which is able to run a trouble
code in the different kind of JDK 4 5 6
7 and also eighties in the yeah in the
work or on the on the road now at least
in our team so we are supporting all
platform and architectures where we have
s AP products on we will see that later
on you will ask yourself it's a complete
new job a complete you Chive am no we
didn't we as a source because we are
source code lines he of the record
hotspot and yes we got the software and
code software gets a software from
Oracle and put our
to that end part the staff to our
Hardware us platforms we around about 25
people's we are located in Waldorf and
yeah get used in all the AP products
mainly the s AP netweaver which is a
travel application server but we are
also used in the business object area
Sybase success factor and also in the
Hana cloud environment
so here you see oops
our that forms ooh okay and it's in this
table you see the columns and rows we
extended the Oracle source code so we
are using seven of the platforms that
come with the Oracle source code on x86
and spark and we ported that to PowerPC
titanium to set arc and to pa-risc we're
actually supporting pa-risc
and with these hardware architectures we
have to support HP onyx AIX and i-5 OS
we support all the four Java versions on
these platforms except for pa-risc we
actually don't have new customers on
pa-risc and we recently started
supporting mac OS parting the vm to a
new platform is quite an effort we chose
to port the c2 compiler which is
probably probably the biggest task to do
in the if you want to port the hot spot
to another platform we did a lot of
optimization on these platforms and
tuned the virtual machine to our
applications yeah so actually we added 8
new platforms to the seven ones we are
using from the Oracle source code
so why did sa P that investe investigate
the investment of having an own virtual
machine our problem is as you saw that
we have yes so called platform su and we
have on all that notes we saw on the
last slide different products and inform
a time we have we had on each node all
the different vendors which get used
regarding the virtual machine and that
ends up in a tremendous amount of
different configuration which is very
hard to to to handle at least on our
support q and also as a behavior is
slightly different between the different
JVM vendors yeah and also they have
little differences in implementation of
for example the XML parsers which makes
life of our application developer not
very easy and at the end we have also
although we had also very different
analyzers tools which is also a big
problem if we have to solve a problem at
customer side another big advantage is
now that we are completely independent
of a vendor on a virtual machine vendor
so we are able to bring out a fix
immediately after it is fixed at us by
us and also we have a big problem
or advantage that we have very long
already cycles of our products so our
famous is Java gets supported until 2020
and is using a 1.4 travel virtual
machine as a white no two years ago the
support of 1.4 was discontinued and that
was exactly at the point in time where
we started to have own
travel machine 1.4 exactly for the
reasons that we could support our
customer until hopefully 2020 maybe a
little bit longer
we have also now the possibility to put
our virtual machine into the offering to
our customers so that means we can yeah
I put all together in one packet and
install it directly on customer side
without asking of the customer oh come
come on go to this site download JVM and
install it and do that and it's very
easy now to install our products because
we are able to pre-configure also that
offering and at the end we are at the
end and this own chavatal machine gives
us opportunity to bring in very
productive support ability and also
development features we will see now or
later on and we did also some
improvements regarding our runtime
performance so actually we got involved
involved in the open JDK process in the
beginning when we hit the close sources
it was quite complicated to give back
changes we made to the source code but
with the open JDK that got much better
they still had to convince our lawyers
to let us do that but we managed at some
point and since then we contributed a
row of bug fixes also some features
improvements in the build and several
things to the open JDK main line and
most recently we are working on the
contribution of the PowerPC part we
initiated together with IBM the PowerPC
a are exporting project that will result
in two new platforms in the hotspot
codebase currently you can download or
can you can check out a Java 7 compliant
port in the Java 8 development
which is pretty much to the top level of
the Java 8 directories you can build it
and run it the Java 7 port is um
drivers have been compliant yeah we do
this because we want to share our work
with the open and hope that we get input
to further improve it and thus can
profit from this activity ok um now we
will demonstrate to you some of our
support ability features it's small
enhancement but very useful enhancement
for this we want to use a small demo
program which is a spring cleaning
application it's a demo program for
spring you can get on the Internet
small and tiny you can easy handle that
and we've got two shelves here too just
to show the difference is because they
are small and and this one here it's
running somewhere the UC is a pizza Java
server virtual machine and in this shell
we run another state-of-the-art virtual
machine happens to be the hot spot and
this is the application running on on
hot spot it's the application running on
the SCP JVM so I keep doing this ok so
you can see what you can do here this is
represents a pet clinic and there are
owners of pets you can list the owners
you see the virtual machine is doing
something and like George Franklin he
has a pet you can add new pets and he
owns a pet named Leo which is a cat and
your veterinarians which can treat the
animals so it's assumed this is a really
big application and the administrator of
the
administration sees that it's running
into trouble and he wants to get a stack
trace to see what the threats are doing
so I hope this works now this had some
problems before and then you have a look
at the stack trace you do a control
break you might want to see thread doing
socket reads
you've got a stack trace of a fat doing
sockets read and you see this text stack
trace and to threaten what's going on in
a virtual machine so let's do some
clicks here too so we have running
threads
this does not look good unless it's
supposed to be
so let us we started before I did not
work with the other virtual machine
okay okay so let's see click the find
owner go to George Franklin
he owns the same pets here so that's
fine and do the control brake get a
stack trace and let's find the
edit find right
you get it right away okay you get the
threat done from the from a socket read
and you can see like here's the the
thread name and here the thread name of
this thread but you get a lot of a lot
more output which enumerates the
activities of this threat for example
you see the CPU it used so obviously
with the news it's read it all yet you
see the elapsed time since it was
started you see the files that are open
by this fed the net i/o Dundas by this
read and here in square brackets you see
some information telling reset actually
our application can get via Java code to
these counters and reset them and this
tells you when it last was reset so the
application can measure what one
transaction is wasting on CPU time or
something which helps a lot to drill
down problems to certain applications
running on your java virtual machine
okay so now let's look at something else
we have here a list of veterinarians and
we try to extend this application we
want to configure the name display so
that the for example the last name is
listed first and then the first name
this is supposed to be done by this
button and well this works very nice and
the developer proposed another solution
to this and so this is this button and
oh this does not work so there must be a
bug a flaw in this implementation and
this is a proper VM it has the same
problem so after so the application does
not treat the request does not return
here nor here so the administrator
assumes there's a deadlock and you can
look at the deadlocks by also looking at
the threat dump
and you can see the the the deadlocks
found by the threat dump utility and it
tells you that there's three three
threats which can proceed because they
are waiting for a lock and they're
deadlocked let's do this here you see
similar information but you only see two
threats listed here this is because we
run a small analyzes on the threats in
the locks and we find the innermost
circle representing the these threats
that are causing the lock or the causing
the deadlock
it's rather um convenient if you have a
lot of threats your users clicked a lot
of times and many threats are waiting
for this deadlock and makes it much
easier to find the real cause of the
lock threads this thread which is
waiting this is the threat of the second
button which is waiting for these two
locked threats which happened to be in
this extension of the thing let's list
it in an extra section down here so this
information is not lost
it's just displayed differently also we
we print more information because if you
click several times we're gonna get
several times the same threat with the
same name but here you have the thread
ID so you can distinguish between in the
single threads yeah oh I actually forgot
something to show you something in the
stack trace before
I go back to the to the socket read
because um and if I could show you that
the the output information about the
internet connections which are held by
certain stack frames in the stack trace
so like this this locked issue which is
also available in the and the other
virtual machine we print this kind of
information in this neck trace
okay now let's make sure I can continue
with the applications and I want to
demonstrate a third small difference I
have to reload this here and this is a
variant of this application that
supposed to only list their last names
and this is immoral bogus on raisin no
point exception and you get a nice tech
trace here and you see it's no pointer
exception you all know about this and
you get the class and the line and you
can easily go to eclipse in this year
you can go to the class web controller
to line 94 and you see a long statement
and it's unclear which rather no I'm
appeared in this long statement there
several are three objects involved in
each of these could have been the null
object and it's rather easy hmm
yeah it's what he did here let's have a
look what happens on this side here we
get an error message on the website here
didn't get one here and that error
message we find also in the the null
pointer exception it tells it why we
were trying to invoke the method at all
on a null object which was returned from
a call from a call to get wet list the
last letters missing get wet list and
now if we now go to eclipse it's very
easy to to find at least the object
which was no here we go so
was returned from capitalist n and so we
know the null object appeared in this in
the statement at this point well it's
basically what the C compiler that's
when he tells you when you're aligned in
the errors now we can open the
Declaration of this method and we see
okay there be returned also this is
actual a problem okay
now let's assume we are running a big
application here we're running in test
mode we are testing the application it
it took quite a while to start it up and
if you want to fix this back now we need
to shut down the application fix the
back and start it again because you're
testing under productive conditions and
so we don't have the debug mode enabled
so this because it's quite bad
turnaround times and as the our virtual
machine is designed for such big
applications we designed it so that we
can do all these can we so that you can
switch on much more things on demand
all these supportability features and
profiling stuff we can switch on
on-demand in the virtual machine do
profiling on to debugging and then
switch it off again and this Thomas will
showed to you know okay so one part of
the story is missing after three coffees
I think it's enough with a long
turnaround times it was a choke which
was missing but yes we have the
so-called lightweight monitoring cue
let's share the m12 it's located in the
bin directory of our virtual machine we
have it in a very end and also in a
command line mode I will present the
Wiimote and after starting you get an
overview or well the ASAP
virtual machines running on that home
house sorry belonging a two of the
current user you get an overview over
the details or over the parameters of
that virtual machine regarding the
version the Java arguments and also the
VM arguments and here I think we should
have our launcher yes it's our launcher
you get also the overview over the
memory configuration some performance
figures information about do we have an
active debugging module and we also have
the section with the trace flex which is
one interesting thing because you can
enable and disable traces on demand that
means we offer you yeah some traces for
example here we have the net IO traffic
sent receive data trace you just shift
it to the right and press apply if we
are now go back to our application and
yes output and causing some traffic here
I think it's yeah and here we have yeah
the complete network traffic written to
standard out or to them to support
configured during startup of that
process so if you have enough of that
information just go back revoke trace
apply it and and if you're now going to
your application you see okay these
three traces are switched off and if I
now go back to my application it works
as before so but going back to our JVM
on
we have also yeah the possibility to
print the stack traces that means gets a
stack traces from each and every process
which is listed here you can get this
last statistic and yeah it's now at the
end of that window and after clearing it
yeah you get it also in the visible area
and yeah you have also some commands to
force a garbage collection for example
and some other very helpful switches for
our supportability engine yes but we
want to start a debugging and it's very
easy just start packing okay run further
and wait for Rebecca and now we see here
okay debugging started was enabled but
no one is connecting the program at the
process at the moment so now we're going
to our Eclipse go to our deeper
configuration and ask Eclipse for doing
a connection to localhost 8000
just enabled for our process
okay we're connecting the process and
here we are here is a process of our pet
clinic and because we are know we know
we want to catch a null point exception
we just tell the breakpoint list Rebecca
please hold if we get a null point
exception we force it okay it's blocked
sure because we are now at our break
point and the able to fix the problem
just doing hot hot code
replacement
right now
oh and remove the nullpointerexception
and run again and here we are something
happens with boss the first try and now
we got stuff working so that means we
have now our application fixed and can
do the next test so and after we why
didn't that move to the right view yes
and after fixing the problem we can just
go back to the JVM on ok it's still
enabled and just yeah we can just
disable it here now and we will see it
in our Eclipse environment that
secession is terminated automatically so
let us go back to our slides for
checking what we missed this is what we
wanted to show about the software
ability improvements of the virtual
machine and to conclude we have the on
demand we showed the on-demand debugging
and also on the on demand traces we
showed that we have more detailed
information about critical Java
situations like exceptions or the threat
dumb utility there's more of these but
we don't can show all of them now we
have powerful support ability tools
around the virtual machine and we have
56 different virtual machines versions
GPUs operating systems all running on
the same core they are all based on
hotspot 24 currently what I forgot to
mention is that we also being at be able
to get that information from remote
systems just by starting a little proxy
on the remote host we can connect I just
can I will demonstrate it later we can
just connect the remote host and then we
have exactly the same view over the
processes on the remote host
okay coming to the X portability tool or
so-called profiler
why the hell is s AP developing and own
profiler
I think well slowly the decision was
made long before I joined the group and
I think the reason for that was that
tests showed that each profiler they
tried to profile our web a pic
application failed failed in regards of
out of memory trouble eyes and also
native wise and I think yeah there was
no chance to fix that and at the end the
decision was made to develop a
completely own profiler solution in
order to yeah being able to profile our
as I said very big application server
and chopper tools in principle the
profiler consists of two part front-end
part is a clips plug-in and the back end
part
yeah it's related in our virtual machine
itself and there it's enabled and
disabled
yeah collecting data that has compact
the data transport them to the front end
and yes it's also yeah on demand feature
that means you are not able to sorry you
are not forced to use a specific
configuration or startup parameters just
connects system and profile it yeah this
is possible with each and every virtual
machine no it isn't because we did a lot
in a hot spot itself in the virtual
machine to get all that information we
need to be able to analyze all our
different aspects we want to see
okay so I think it's time to see what a
little bit in the real world going back
to our Eclipse window so as I said it's
a normal Eclipse plug-in it's also
installed right like normal Eclipse
plug-in and we also offering an RCP
variant for that that means a standalone
variant what you here see is our profile
inversion to that out it's hopefully
released in the next two weeks if we
docked if we get the documentation ready
and yes so here we have our view about
active connections to different yeah
potential different processes we want to
profile and we will declare them that we
will see later on here different
configurations or also called snapshots
and we have here our VM Explorer which
remember you may be twos a bit to the
jvm monitor tool also here you have a
list over all the processes that as ap
when virtual machine processes on the
local host and yeah here you are able to
to ask for a specific information of
that processes for example you can put
the workspace directory in the main view
ok I do not want to see that you see
stuff but I want to see the final or
stuff and here we have the final Oh
figures and yeah all the information you
want to see and here we have a badge
nice button which we also have in the
Chairman tour which allows you to
connect to that little proxy running on
yeah whatever system to do the same
stuff with virtual machines running up
the remote host so if we now click one
of the processes you get the
your informations for that process
regarding general information okay when
it started and here we see also oh there
was a debugging session since since 12
minutes after 12 minutes we had a debug
session yes we also see different system
information regarding OS CPU and so on
also generic performance informations
are listed here garbage collection in
informations and also there are some
figures regarding our cheat compiler so
how the hell do we now profile stuff two
possibilities first just do a context
menu and connect it why are ya the menu
but you can also just do a double click
and your front end is now connected to
the back end profiling back and running
on the process which are selected you
seem okay we have an active profiling
surfing session and here you have you
have the overview over the traces or
analyzers you can now start you you have
some overview information regarding CPU
or in a very strange memory behavior I
will show you that later on what's the
reason for that and yeah you can do here
for example heap dump analysis I want to
stress that point because in the
background we integrated all the memory
analyzer that means we requesting the
heap dump of the process and feet if I
press a link here this memory analyzer
standard memory lies with that
information and you can just do your
work with a memory analyzer as you would
do it in in other environments so it's
fully integrated and it's also possible
to navigate for
and back between statistics coming from
our profiler and the memory profiler a
memory analyzer but therefore you have
requests some specific traces here so
coming back to the overview yes as I
said it's a very strange memory behavior
we see here let us to start the
allocation trace just by clicking that
link we asked the backend oh please list
all the allocations happen now and here
we see okay at the moment around about
200 objects and 600 700 megabytes I
think it's enough to see what is going
wrong here we can just click to that
analyzes and yeah here we see Oh very
much not so much objects but a huge
amount of memory we are fully integrated
to the Eclipse environment just by
adding the source code of our project we
are able to navigate to the source code
who looks not so bad actually it does
nothing I think we have to double check
the check our list oh yes yeah we have
an array of that stuff and let us take a
look who is calling that Oh controller
again let's go back to the source
mmm yeah it's really nonsense to have
such thread just for having that nice
memory behavior on that overview so what
we also brought out with a - Oh session
session we the two old version is a very
powerful garbage collection analyze
subsystem we take a snapshot here over
the last three minutes this is exactly
the time we connected the profiler to
the back end
and we see here oh now Fuji sees but a
lot of partial feces we have also some
general information about that runs we
are now able to ask for several views to
that information stored in that garbage
collection snapshots are the name you
have used for that do we have the
general list of that runs also here we
are able to to select each and every
detail of garbage collection run just by
selecting the corresponding field add
them to the table view and yes here now
you have the information you were asking
for and what I think it's also very nice
if you are now selecting some of them
and request detailed few of them you
will get in the overview hopefully and
you can do very nice things for example
you can just by clicking here through
that for marked entries of the table and
you can see the differences between the
runs you see that the updates of the of
the fields and it's very powerful oh
yeah thank you for God okay so um but
also it's a very powerful Beach feature
is that custom selection so we have some
predefined events which may be
interesting for you or for customer but
you can also select pre-select some of
us so and now you can yeah do whatever
you want or ask forever what do you want
to know from our from the garbage
collection runs sorry I'm little bit too
fast
just by maksim and add them to the list
and you will get a very nice table few
regarding the information
yeah you just selected and I think I
didn't show that we also have the
traffic analysis where you can use each
mostly each and every information coming
from a garbage collection run to get
placed calculated into a nice diagram
diagram here so here here you can ask or
select sorry the next five minutes will
answer your question no but this is
actual data this is really actual data
okay here we can just add the
information to and graph where to
diagram serve thank you and you get
exactly yeah a few of that attributes
you just selected so coming back to your
point we are now having here the few
over the last four or five minutes
exactly the time when we start the
profile when we attached the front end
to the profile but we also have the
possibility to ask the process for
cheesy history file if you configure a
process in the proper way that garbage
collection history file gets written and
now we are asking the process okay
please write that file to that directory
and this file can then be easily opened
by our profile at Jasper
file navigate to the correct directory
okay here is Ron yeah 1.12 it fits to
the system time so no fake and where we
are here we have the complete view of
the garbage collection run since the
start of our pet clinic which was 28
minutes ago yeah moment I will show you
this one here we have an overview our
what was going on regarding the garbage
collection here we have the startup
phase and here yeah
special threat was started which does
nothing except memory management and
memory consuming and yes you are you are
now able to zoom into that and yeah do
whatever you want with that information
you are also can go to that view and
take a look to the yeah garbage
collection run so it's very very
powerful and I think that was the
information we want to give about our
profiler just yeah
buddy no no okay
yeah it's a jaebeum profile it's also
demand functionality no prerequisites no
configuration or also no restart is
required yeah if it's turned off no
overhead and if it's turned on yeah it's
really acceptable depending on what
residence you wanted to have but we did
add customer side profiling runs sure
the customer was informed okay it could
be a little bit slower but at the end it
is also a tool which could be used for
productive systems so we will not yeah
turn it or ta town it's integrated in
our developer studio on sap netweaver
developer studio and also into eclipse
yes yeah an in point of that's the
tricky combination on demand takes place
because that we were able to to get our
profiling points and yeah we also have a
fully integrated memory analyzer
oh this was not so good because I think
I just can use this we will show you
some about our SE p JV and debugger also
here one can ask well why why do the
implement men a debugger of their own so
I want to motivate it on the next three
slides you probably all know how um how
Java debugging is working you have a
java application here on the right and
you have a debugger and they talk to a
DWP with each other and the jdw protocol
does anything you need to do debugging
but it has very fine-grain communication
and if you get into a
duration with a network and the network
happens to be slow I have a high latency
this can this can cause problems first
if you're in a remote scenario you might
have security problems because jdw piece
unencrypted and and using open port and
the other problem is that if you get
high latency like if you debug in a
cloud then you can get unbearable
response times of your requests you do
in the debugger because a stack trace or
any other request has to do a lot of
communication with the java application
and altogether it can cause a very slow
behavior of a debugger and might even be
impossible to debug at all to solve this
problem we implemented our own debugger
infrastructure we place a daemon next to
the okay we place the daemon next to the
virtual machine or next to the
application on the virtual machine it
can be on the same machine but it can
also be remote but what is important is
that the latency between this headless
debugger and the application is small
this headless debugger talks jwp with
the debugging and on the other side it
talks a proprietary protocol which is
much coarser to the debugger in Eclipse
each of us likes some works so we did
not implement a full debugger we just
implemented a new model for the debugger
in Eclipse which uses this new protocol
it for example it tells the headless
debugger didn't that a stack trace was
requested and then the headless debugger
collects the stack trace and does a
single response to the debugger over the
slow part of the network this also helps
with the security because we tunnel this
protocol on HTTP
so that we can get into our cloud or to
any other tea buggy which is hidden or
which requires secure access so now
Tomas will try to show you debugging our
ASAP Hana cloud with this solution and
we hope that the network allows us to do
this properly
yes so unfortunately our headless
debugger is not yet in the public area
or maybe since yesterday but it was a
little bit too risky for me to prove
what to trust on that that's why I
connection is still there I didn't the
connection to our internal network and
which allows me to do a request to my
little application which is not so big I
will just show you the code of that
application what's one moment so I want
to have the cloud service projects and
yes I wanted to have it open yeah here
you see the standard hello world
self-serve late-- which does nothing
except an hello world and that
application is deployed to our s AP and
a cloud environment
I think involved off so at the end
anywhere in the world where the cloud is
located and yes so as mentioned we
implement our own motel our own model
for reducing the charity Deepika the
clips charity Deepika and yes to be able
to test it yeah
we use it now
for all our debug work so we can use our
SAPT baka tool also for local or local
remote debug scenarios which enabled
which gives us a much broader test
scenario and the only thing which is
left to test in the cloud environment is
a communication over the HTTP connection
from the client from the Eclipse client
than to the headless debugger here you
see the parameter I need to connect our
application or our debugging service in
the cloud
here is a debugging service itself this
is the name of the application yeah and
some credentials though when I now press
the back yes some pro hours in the
project which doesn't matter I want to
connect the browser's in our cloud and
we see it's not working great
oh no yes this is in Baldauf Germany so
um here we can see that I got a
connection to our process running in the
cloud and I also have prepared the URL
in the file because it's so long here we
have the application name running on
neon de Montcalm and yeah here we have
our you a complete URL to the service
and now I just go to a burner - that one
- other one and
come on and hopefully we will see that
we get an information from the de Baca
that we get a hit off the breakpoint yes
here we are this is a breakpoint we
hidden our application running in maybe
you're probably walled off and yes it's
blocked here and if I now continue that
process
hey isn't this deep up
where's my continue button profile no no
no no no sorry I'm a little bit confused
this is continue no no no where am I
debug sorry maybe it helps if I reset
the perspective again
but first line of a stack trace ah look
who else a hell is a continue button and
all my debugging buttons we are in a
debug view that has the state 9 but I
hate unbelievable so it's nothing 8 and
no no it was my fault here this nonsense
I think I just
ahahaha resume and here we are in a
world that was not blend really okay
then coming back to the slides I think
we are the very end just let us
summarize it yes cool with our debugger
is that we are now able to debug
applications really in the cloud and
what is important using the local
sources of our development for debugging
on that remote beast it's fully
integrated into eclipse standard eclipse
functionality is available partially we
are better maybe except this continued
important and it's also possible to do
the on-demand debugging and we are also
able to profile that application running
into the cloud over exactly the same
infrastructure
okay yeah you can these are the the
links where you can find our tools I
think it's possible to if you create an
account and just want to try it it's
possible to download the virtual machine
you cannot use it productively yes but
and you also see where we found the pet
clinic sources and we had two other
sessions but we don't need to make
advertisement for them anymore because I
guess the conference is over in two
minutes
so thank you very much for your
attention and if there are any questions
we are happy to help thank you
suddenly
you are asking how the only multi
packing is working so I think this is a
cheat question yes I will be wish'd up
is that the debugging subsystem of the
process waiting for a connection and
then the already compiled code gets
decompiled some strange things happens
in the cheek area that I pointed to you
so please overtake I think the question
is the you have to start the demon in
the behind the firewall so you can
connect to it and that's running I think
always in our Hana cloud now you don't
have to do that on a subdomain you can
always enable it
yep
I'm not sure about that I will coach hot
dogs replacement is actually done I'm
not sure about I guess we we just do the
very same as the Oracle we invert do if
it was started with given parameters yes
you and we are we are an Oracle client
we have the source code license and the
ACP JVM is a ASAP product it's not sold
but it's a product by us you cannot get
the code of this
and
you said
but that depends on the traces or on the
collection you um collect we can do full
instrumentation of the compiled cheat
code which will first impact you when
you switch it on because you start
recompilation of the cheat code and then
the cheat code will run slower than
before but if you only do some GC traces
it doesn't affect the system that much
and although the profiling if you do a
normal time by sampling allocation
between ten and twenty percent but if
you do a complete education trace so you
are in the game at ease
each and every allocation and that costs
you no time okay for guys taking the
micro but one cool thing we just think
wasn't came out so clearly is that our
our profiling is much more accurate than
that of other VMs because because we
especially experts told we recombine the
code with much more safe points and the
problem is other VMs is that usually
you'll get just 20 milliseconds safe
points so you have your you know
profiling is not more accurate than 20
milliseconds so we can do this much more
accurate so you can see things which you
cannot see with other profiles as well
I consider this a real cool feature
the SI p jbm they all have the same
functionality they all run on the same
virtual machine basically with different
JD case on top and so if you get a new
version of the virtual machine then
yours can do the latest profiling and
tracing and debugging in fact you can do
all that stuff also with the 1.4 virtual
machine with our 1.4 virtual machine
exact the same stuff I showed you
I'm not sure if I get you you should
now not in our garbage collection itself
I do not know of that functionally but I
think is isn't it part of the memory
analyzer which you can get out that
information
now the open source memory analyzer
which was
I think we have that functionality but
I'm not sure about that at least if you
draw a heap dump with a memory analyzer
the information should be in there you
need still need to search around whose
keeps your object of life if you can
find it in there so I don't know where
the rest are any further help to do that
and not that familiar with the tools
hmm
no about sorry unfortunately we just did
that to start out with the berry em with
the bear virtual machine and show you
how it looks in the beverage machine no
you saw that you can draw the stick the
thread thump with the JVM on tool and
you can dump it to a file and and you
can access the information more directly
to you can get it from our temp temp
share
we've finished the powerpc part and then
they'll talk with our manager it would
make sense but at least it's political
issue and we are on developers
no no we we started parting we started
with hot spot seven years ago or
something and with parting it to the
platforms and that was Java five then we
did Java 6 then we did Java 4 and then
we did Java 7 and now we're doing
tolerate and we started they work on the
profiler right when we started to work
on porting um hot spot and putting that
below our netweaver server making bugs
she don't make boxes everything is fine
it's it's fun you learn everything ok
then thank you and have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
