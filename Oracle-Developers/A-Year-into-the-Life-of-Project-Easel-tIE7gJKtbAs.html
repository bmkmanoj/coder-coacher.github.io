days and my everybody calls me JB on bad
days we won't discuss what they call me
so and this is John check or Ellie over
here John's the director of engineering
on netbeans as a whole I'm the product
manager for this little tiny piece
called Project easel which is all the
html5 fun things and JavaScript and
things like that that we added last year
there's the obligatory a legal statement
read quick there you go thank you we're
going to go quick through slides there's
only like three slides and then we're
going to code so don't worry about
having to read or be bored by slides
show of hands how many of familiar with
netbeans how many of actually like use
the IDE you know what it is and so forth
okay if I can't answer your questions
the people that wrote the books on it or
write down here you can talk to them
afterwards too and that means itself is
is a one of the ides that Oracle owns
it's really the the official IDE for
Java itself and the Java platform we
kind of consider it the big tent IDE in
a way because everybody's welcome we
handle a lot of different things besides
Java you know we've got Ruby and rails
we've got C and C++ PHP and a few others
is all big plugging community that
allows you to deal with different things
it's also free it's open source and we
try to release it at least twice a year
as best we can netbeans org is where you
go to get it what we're going to show
tonight is a little bit about project
easel or this afternoon rather not night
yet when we create a project easel or
started to think about project diesel
about two years ago we were following on
this this idea or this concept of trend
on the hybrid developer and we started
to see it when we were talking to
analysts and and different customers and
so forth and it's this whole concept of
Java developers are now being asked to
not do just Java they're also being
asked to take on some more of the client
side or different languages in some of
the key notes and things like that they
call it a polygon or whatever I had to
look up what the heck that meant to be
honest with you but as for what we
really see
you're seeing more and more the java
backend the rest services things like
that and then you're seeing the html5
and JavaScript and CSS and how you have
to deal with that on the client side so
we created project easel and released it
last year we actually released it at
javaone in a beta last year and
announced it and and then we continued
to work on it and release the actual GA
in February of this year and there were
quite a few things that that we built
into this as a normal philosophy so we
created its own project type called an
html5 project we didn't want to go with
the old WYSIWYG drag-and-drop type of
environment we wanted to be more down in
the code and so we built in a very very
tight integration with chrome and we
created a chrome plugin that uses the
remote web KPIs and and WebKit in
general to allow you to work in in kind
of a dual screen mode now we're on a
single screen here is but we're going to
have the IDE and a monitor it up and
we'll show in the code exactly how that
how that works and then again the the
live in code editing so you're going to
see a little bit about what you're doing
in the browser and how you bring it back
over into the IDE think of the concept
of your working in your browser tools
right either in chrome developer tools
or fire bug or something like that we've
all done this and you're trying to
figure out your CSS your Union so you
bring up that tool you're changing some
values you great little arrow keys and
watch text grow and shrink and different
sizes so like that you get it all
perfect and then you go oh now what do I
do right so now you start taking notes
somewhere to figure out what all you
changed so you can go back to your
source code and try and get all that in
there and correct that up so easily was
created to try and avoid or eliminate
that capability that issue that you were
running into so once we put 7 dot 3 out
we started to come across a little bit
more you know people wanted different
things and we'll that's what we're going
to demonstrate this afternoon is what
we've done in 74 so this whole a year
into the life of easel and what we've
brought back and brought forward the the
back ends that we all deal with and what
we
I had to deal with is this is the java
ee 7 backends in this HTML front-end
that's the concept of what we're trying
to do and why we've done all this
JavaScript you saw John if how many of
you were at the technical keynote
yesterday okay so you saw John duet song
and dance up there on his mac and and
did a beautiful job of showing how this
whole thing works between court with
cordova and over into the ipads and
things of that nature and how you can
debug not only JavaScript you can also
debug into the end of the Java eating
source and that kind of thing we'll show
a little bit of that today but that's
where we wanted to go also with the
mobile in this feeling this release when
we started to move forward with it yeah
one of the things that we were really
thinking here was right now the the
mobile on on on smartphone play right
now is really you know you have to be
back end you you organized and expose
that through your rest services and your
web sockets and then you compose the you
consume it on the clients right now so
either as a native app in android or iOS
or as a JavaScript app that that you
wrap either show in the browser or wrap
inside of it with something like Cordova
and distribute as a hybrid mobile app
and we're really what we were going for
here was let's make it really easy for
EE folks to mobilize their existing IT
assets back MIT assets right and we
focused we focus exclusively on on HTML
and JavaScript as the client-side
generation for that so that's really the
way e7 has been going and that follows
kind of a trend we have where this
separation between service server
service developers on the one hand
client developers on the other and they
kind of meet in the middle and they say
they agree on what the payload of the
JSON is going to be right okay I need
this information so then the server guys
go off and in Java figure out how to you
know get that service out get that J
song with it with that information in it
and then once they say here it is then
the client guys go they grab that they
go jump into their client code and do
all their client code with with
with usually with JavaScript and so
forth and but like you said a lot of
times these days java developers are
being asked to play all those rules and
we wanted to have one tool we're both
you know whether it was one person doing
both roles or whether it was two teams
right the Java guys on the back end and
the client guys on the front and we
wanted to have one tool where they could
all meet in the middle and kind of go
through the whole lifecycle together at
in one tool so having said that so yes
one when we first we put out 73 we
started getting all the feedback and you
know going through the forums and the
net being communities and the different
community days or developer days that
we've done and so forth one of the
biggest things that everybody wanted was
all of this HTML CSS manipulation in
live code data editing and so earth they
wanted that in a java web app instead of
in a separate html5 project it was like
it was great if it was there but we
really need to stay in our job a web app
he also wanted it in PHP and a few
others so what we did is we went ahead
and added it directly into Java Web also
into PHP I'm going to show you a java
web and maven oh and maven sorry yes
maven works just as well so in this
particular case I've got a JSF page and
I'm just going to run this and let's see
what we get I'm running it in chrome
with the NetBeans plug-in attached to it
so it launches over in chrome over here
and I'm going to see that as I bring up
this table this is pulling from a rest
service behind also running in here and
I get my my long my live Dom browser
over on the side and if I start moving
through the Dom browser in the IDE you
see the browser over on the right
highlighting the different areas that
are coming up I can do that from the IDE
into the browser or I can also come over
into the browser and select different
things and notice back over on the on
the left you're still seeing things
highlighting in the IDE if I select them
and brings up our CSS window and the CSS
styling I'll show a little bit more
later about what we've done in the CSS
side of things but for this it's
basically showing what we were doing in
in the HTML project alone last time so
this is all live and interactive so if I
want to change this particular color say
over to let's just go with crimson as
soon as I click on it it changes it and
you see it changing in the browser the
difference between your browser tools
and what we're doing here is this
actually changed live in your source
code right down into the CSS file so
it's happening right away the
integration is also even a little bit
deeper let's say I want to with the java
web project let's say i wanted to change
the title up here of list well that
happens to be done in a bundle in a
properties file and if i go into that
properties file and i change this value
and just do a ctrl s to save it it's
automatically going to redeploy to the
server which you would expect but it's
also going to go ahead and refresh the
browser over on the right hand side as
soon as it's done you don't I don't have
to go over there and click or anything
else it's just automatically
synchronized into that level of depth so
again this is pretty much what we've
done already in the html5 project a year
ago but now we're bringing it over into
these web projects and PHP and may even
work exactly the same way and with that
I'm going to pass it over to John and
he's going to give you a little bit of
an idea more of what's going on that
we've done inside of the JavaScript
engines and a few other things on that
side so we're going to do the crude way
instead of clicking our little a little
button here there we go click the button
all right so let's say big money no
golems no golems all right you're right
there appears to be a vm problem with
7u40 and external monitors I've heard
reports in the field so we'll see only
on Mac of course okay so let's take a
look at some of the JavaScript support
that we put in for netbeans 7 dot 4 so
NetBeans already had not be 73 already
had great support for JavaScript include
code completion indenting refactoring
and so forth and this release was really
all about JavaScript frameworks so let's
have a show of hands up so how many
people write JavaScript on a regular
basis okay and how many people use a
framework okay so jQuery yeah all right
how about angular JS and a couple people
all right knock out Jess nobody out
great y'all going to learn something
today requirejs anybody use required yes
yeah yeah couple folks in the back right
okay other frameworks are using right
now let me use an extension Jas no
backbone and Sammy J is for the fur for
handling and so forth anyways it seems
like you blink and there's a new
JavaScript framework popping up I mean
these JavaScript frameworks are just all
over the place right and so the first
thing we wanted to do was create a
pluggable infrastructure so that
framework developers could write their
own plugins in to NetBeans or it's
easier for us to write plugins and to
NetBeans that handle that handle
JavaScript and and so what is that what
are the challenges around doing
JavaScript support for frameworks well
sometimes they have different coding
styles that they want to enforce a lot
of times they have special metadata that
you inject into the HTML that need to be
hooked up to very specific things in
your JavaScript and and so forth
sometimes the global you know sometimes
some of their their prefixes aren't
registered as global objects and so so
we put all that in functionality in
we're going to look at knock out today
for those of you who have used an
angularjs it's pretty similar knock out
it just allows you to build a model in
JavaScript right you bind that model to
an HTML view and then within the HTML
view you can go you can use a data bind
attribute to bind the UI to
piece of the model and this is different
from jQuery where I like with jquery you
have to like set up an event and then
you say okay and then listen for this
event and then when this event happens
i'm going to traverse the entire Dom
looking for something that matches this
this one thing and then when i find it
i'm going to make that change of that
thing right that's very expensive on
your on your javascript browser and it's
it's kind of you know it's not the most
efficient way to do it right so Java its
own angularjs knockout.js these guys
they just say look this thing is bound
to that thing anything that any time
that changes this changes and that's it
you're done right so coming in here
let's uh let's start so this is the game
that we're going to we're going to build
up this game it's just on the server
which he showed we have a database
connection there's a database with a
bunch of names of stars it's exposed as
a restful service this app is going to
consume that it's going to grab for
names pick one at random as the answer
and then go out and get an image for
that from a custom google search image
that we set up that we hopefully haven't
hit our limit of daily free usages or
else this is going to be a really short
demo okay and right now as you can see
this is all just hard coded up here so
let's start adding some dynamic behavior
first thing we're going to do is bring
in the JavaScript bring in the
JavaScript files we need here so if we
go down to properties we have a
javascript files panel where I can pull
up let's say I need knockout and I'm
gonna need jquery well John's bringing
those in one of the things that we
changed up a bit from 73 to 74 is the
javascript library manager is now we
were taking snapshots and populating it
before now it has the ability for you to
actually click on it and go out and
refresh it and it pulls from cdnas and
so at any given time you can just click
on it it will go out to CD njs and grab
whatever the latest and greatest
is I happen to be working on a project
internally and I needed crossroads
available and I was going out and
getting it and it wasn't available on CD
njs so I contacted the core developer
for it and said hey make your make your
library available on here on CD njs so I
can get it right out of NetBeans and he
was like wow that yeah I'd love to so he
added up there within two or three days
I hit refresh and film it was right
there available for me so it's pretty
cool that you can do that and just
update whenever you need to so as you'll
see here so the the the source attribute
in the script tag knows knows about the
layout of the files on my file system so
that I can just get code completion
there oops and i also created my empty
quiz dot java script right which is
going to hold my application logic okay
so let's start building up our model so
one of the things i'm going to show you
is extensive use of live templates so i
can go in and under the editor i can go
in and set up templates for any type of
for you know anything really and so I've
set up a bunch of life templates in here
specifically for dealing with jquery and
knock out so the first one I'm going to
use is the KO mod right which puts in
the code for setting up my my model and
let's call this what are we going to
call this I forget star data model there
we go star data model notice as I enter
in the name here for for the model it
automatically gets changed down here
when that when
the object name is invoked so there we
go that's our that's declared the model
and bound it to our app I've used the
the self variable here to avoid scope
confusion which is a major problem in
JavaScript and so now we can start
setting up properties knockout uses what
it calls observable properties there's
observables observable arrays computed
observables this is just a regular Java
JavaScript property that the framework
knows that it can be bound to a piece of
you I and knows how to treat it that way
so I have my coat template for that and
we'll call this what tag line and who is
this really so I'm going to just take
this hard coded text over here and swap
it out with some dynamic text so I got
that and now let's go in here and delete
the hard coded text and say data behind
text equal so as you can see what John's
doing in the code completion this is one
of the big things with the frameworks
that we've implemented so with not we
had jquery before when we first came out
in 73 now we've got knockout and we also
have angular 2 where we we have the code
completion the docs the quick docs all
that kind of stuff available for these
base brain works now so is your type in
a way and you're typing kayo dot it's
going to show you everything that you
need for knockout or if you're in this
case you did a started type data bind it
just knew what to do it through in the
data x equals and then you can start
throwing up the variables for inside of
the data binding yeah and the most
important part here is that is that the
HTML code completion is aware of the
structure of the model in JavaScript all
right that's the most important part was
the part that was frankly the hardest to
get done right so if I save here you go
you see it change this to who is this
really so one-way data binding is kind
of cool but two-way binding is really
where it's at because that's
imagine you're building up a form right
so rather than you know all you have to
do is assign each of those you know
fields a two-way binding to a value in
JavaScript and that will handle a lot of
your your work there so let's say if we
put an input field here we databind the
value to tag line as well and save here
it is and I can go in and say oh really
it'll update and if I want to I can even
go in and let's see we'll put a I always
forget what ya value update
after key down what was that
I'm sorry
oh yeah i know that mean I'm a lot of
what I'm going to show you here I'm when
I show you the rest rest calls this is
definitely like not how you should do
rest in here this is just to illustrate
the
if we've done anything around guiding
people towards better practices
stopping them from doing it in the bed
first
people claim
not well I mean we basically implemented
here support for the platform as a
platform is and and you know the
platform the platform gives people you
know I mean JavaScript famously gives
people a lot of rope to hang themselves
with so but as you see as we as you type
it can update in the UI okay so now
let's take a look at like I said doing
some some grabbing let's let's take a
look at them grabbing here we don't have
any values in here so we're going to
take a look at making a rest call back
to the server grabbing some names and
then populating these these these
buttons so let's go in here and save our
questions
let's create a little a variable called
no called JSON that's going to hold the
JSON from the from the Ajax call now
knockout doesn't provide any any
built-in functionality for doing rest
calls so it just kind of leaves it up to
you so we'll use a jQuery here for that
so here's another another template that
I have now in the realm of this is not
the way you should do things I'm going
to for right now just set this to be a
synchronous call rather than an
asynchronous call and we'll go to local
ho local short about localhost
80 and then
stars rust ok there's my URL and once
I'm inside here I just want to say JSON
equals data all right I want to return
JSON and I want to make my little call
back loop here and I did that in the
wrong place of course to return JSON all
right and you're my callback loop here
okay okay so before i run this so what
this is doing is it's just a it's
initialized variable called it's it it's
created a variable called JSON then it
goes out and grabs the the information
from json and then from from this rest
call phil's json with it and passes it
back let us also do one more knockout
observable called star list and it's
gonna just be questions
alright so that's just going to get the
the group of four names for the first
question and that in that array that
comes back from the rest service call so
before I run this one thing I want to
show you is just let's say that here i
had another variable called beta right i
just wanted to show you that the
refactoring in javascript is
context-aware so if i go in and refactor
this to my data you'll notice that it
knows to do it within this this scope
but not to refactor this one because
it's out of scope so just release just
remove that and so now i have my server
setup now i can go in and delete these
delete these hard-coded buttons and i
can use the for each data binding which
is good for iterating through an array
and basically if you say for each pass
it in an array and then tell it what to
do afterwards it will create one of
those things for each things that it
finds in the array so like I said for
each
and for each star list create a button
right now while he's doing that I don't
know if you just noticed but all he did
was when he did the four each in that
and hit s he just hit a control space
and it actually went out and grabbed the
knockout or the knockout observable
array or that that array of star list
which is over in the javascript file so
it actually you're in the HTML editor
but it's aware of the different objects
that are available for you over in the
JavaScript within the scope of your
project and it went ahead and edit that
in forum yeah so now when I save you can
see that the names here are indeed being
pulled and if i go to my network monitor
i can see in my restful web service i
can see the response see that the
response is coming back with all of the
JSON and then that's correctly being put
let me quickly just you guys saw this
yesterday but I just show it to you
again is I have the server going in
debug mode so if I come in here here's
my rest service here's the method that
actually serves up that that JSON so if
I come back out here and hit reload
you'll see here i am inside my java my
break point it hit my break point right
there you can see all my variable is
inside the inside this right and if i
hit continue hopefully it won't blow up
on me like it did yesterday good um so
if I hit continue it will stop in JSON
right and you can see you can evaluate
either down in the variables window or
right inside here now we're not to find
yet huh interesting let's go yeah here
we go there's there's a JSON right so
and I can see the values right inside my
source editor so there we go that's all
will do on actually building the app
because we want have a lot of other
stuff to go through but at this point
I'm going to pass it to jb to show us
some of the
work done on styling click that button
alright so just like a cooking show
we're going to take what he did throw it
in the oven and we're going to come back
out and walk over the other oven and
pull out a little bit more finished
product i'm going to go ahead and run
this and let's see what we get come on
got the server room that's usually what
that means Sherman what did I lose I'll
there's I'm on the wireless network in
case you haven't figured it out the one
they said not to you yeah the one they
said not do yes Wow okay let's see what
this is going to do
connecting connecting anyway so one of
the other things that that when we
started having feedback into the and
actually we went through a user's focus
group when we first started to create
easel one of the things that people
wanted us to do was to be able to
support not only just CSS and
interacting with javascript and HTML
they wanted us to go a step further and
start to deal with sass and so either
SAS or less and more of a pre-processing
of CSS files so how many of you have
actually heard of SAS or less scss the
CSS folks in the whole design side of
the world seemed to get a little crazy
with their naming but you know SAS
actually stands for syntactically
awesome style sheets and then scss which
is a syntax of that is actually stands
for sassy CSS you can't make this stuff
up but so what we did in in working with
this was we we went ahead and we created
the ability to add CSS pre-processing
and we support both sass and less I'm
simply going to show us CSS today but
the idea is that if you install sass wii
u point off the libraries and configure
it and so forth and then you can set up
an input and an output so the idea is I
have dot s CSS files and I can
manipulate those and and change those
and use the variables in this end the
the scopes inside of SCSS and when I
save that file it'll automatically
compile inside the IDE and generate my
CSS that my app is actually running
against the in a small demo app like
this it doesn't make a lot of sense i
mean if you've got less than you know
two or three hundred lines of CSS you
don't really need to break it up into
into sass environments but when you're
in a corporate environment you've got
thousands of lines of CSS and when it's
all in one file it's really difficult to
deal with so what I did for this demo to
try and break things up and have them at
least make some sense was I'm going to
deal with a little bit of thing called
responsive design
so the idea that when your app is
sitting at a certain device size things
will change within the viewports so if I
stretch this thing all the way out here
you're going to see that this leaves
this menu system over here is now down
my left hand side and I have certain
sizes and this has rounded corners and
and so forth if I drop this down now to
a smaller size say a tablet in a
portrait mode which by the way this was
in 73 but if you're not aware of it it's
the little NetBeans icon up here you can
click on it and it gives you a bunch of
predefined sizes for dealing with
responsive design you can also go in and
click on custom and set up any size that
you want so if you're dealing you know
new tablets and form factors and phone
form factors come out all the time but
we've got some pretty common ones in
here but you can set what you need to so
let's say I go to tablet and I bring
that down to a little bit smaller it's
going to shrink down my browser and
you'll notice that menu system now moved
up to the top up here and I also dropped
the grounded corners on my on my menu
and I shrunk it down a little bit now if
I make it go down even a little bit
further now we get down into something
where I don't need that menu at all I
dropped it up into into kind of a fake
little three lines thing that doesn't do
anything it's just an image and I Shrunk
a few more things down well all of this
is done it could be done in one CSS file
but it's using media queries so I
decided to take those media queries and
break them out into individual files and
I have my my 1 responsive CSS CSS that
just imports all of the other ones in a
specific order so I'm not going to teach
you how to do SCSS or anything like that
but the idea is that once you learn and
you can use mix-ins you can use your
variables you can use all these
different things that are normally used
in SAS you can do them within the
NetBeans IDE and work with those and
they'll compile through if you notice in
my original index.html my CSS is only
represent referencing the one CSS file
called responsive CSS I do have my
jquery UI CSS up there as well which I'm
not messing
but that responsive CSS is actually
being generated when i run the process
as it runs this and it actually takes
all of these other ones so and had to
work a little bit more tightly with that
so you had to know where you were when
you were dealing with all that that
interactivity so again when we talked
about the live dom and we started to
look at you know highlighting something
showing what it's looking like in the
browser and then in the CSS we had to
show where things were well we've
actually implemented it down to the
point where if i'm sitting on my applied
styles i'm currently sitting in a
require or a media query that says the
screen size is a max with the 480 pixels
and this face property is actually being
set in handheld SCSS so I know that
that's coming out of a sass file and
just to make sure that you know that it
is if you if I were to come down here
and start changing properties in this
little part down here it's telling me
hey these are generated you're gonna
you're going to try and make changes
back to your CSS file they're going to
get overwritten if you're not careful so
you want to do them in the s CSS and we
can actually click on this and it'll
take us over to the file that's already
opened over here with handheld so I
broke out the different media queries
into individual files just to show how
they would all be generated and and
compiled as I made the changes in this
case with the handheld I actually shrunk
down this face value I dropped it down
to you know 100 pixels wide and 10
pixels in a padding or margin if I set
that out too so not 210 to set it out to
20 and I do a save on it we're going to
see down here in the output in a second
that it's actually going to compile
recompile that s CSS and redo into the
into the CSS there's a SAS compile going
on and it will compile the file and as
soon as it's done it'll actually drop
things over here and just the browser
will just pick them up on the fly so you
can still do your changes and they'll
show up across this in the back yell
loud
minifying yes simply for the fact that
on the project you have you have the
ability to set up your mappings but then
you also have all you the ability to set
all the compiler options down at the
bottom so you can do a lot of crazy
things with that again I'm working on an
internal project and we use this quite
extensively in some really complex
scenarios and it's been working really
great for us yeah as far as using others
I mean right now we only support SCSS or
and unless so if you're using some other
thing that's out there we're probably
not going to work with it mm-hmm so i
guess that's what i wanted to point out
was simply that you can now do all this
pre-processing for the large large
environments and you can still continue
to use it just live going back and forth
as these things move and change if i can
get this back yeah I did you'll notice
that it just automatically updates live
in the IDE now I'm using a different
media query I'm in a you know max width
of 1024 it just automatically updates
and changes you'll also see that now
face is being pulled from tablet instead
of from handheld set so it tells you
where you're going and where your CSS is
at so you can easily get to what you
need to be at in order to edit it so
that's it on the CSS side I'm going to
go back to John again and we're going to
deal a little bit more in the mobile
space now yep so like I said no realms
good like I said one of the big focus
areas of focus for nepean 74 was mobile
mobile web and hybrid mobile so and one
of the things we wanted to do was really
to enable people to use their handheld
device as their development platform not
meaning that you like code on it but
just means if you're doing if you do
tablet first design right it makes sense
to actually be previewing your your app
in the tablet all right if you're doing
a Cordova wrapped app it's very
difficult you know to shim the you know
chrome to pretend like it's a mobile
phone especially if you want to access
them on device features like geolocation
and so forth there are some things out
there that that help you do that but gee
wouldn't it be nice if we could just do
all this actually on the phone instead
of trying to get our chrome browser or a
Firefox to pretend like it was a phone
so I'm going to do everything in the
emulator here just because I don't have
that wolf vision and it didn't really
work that well anyways yesterday so and
because we are a network challenged I've
switched over to a different app that's
just all completely local so that we
don't have to worry about waiting ten
seconds to get a picture about or
waiting two minutes to get a picture of
Alec Baldwin okay so here's the app and
I've gone ahead and set it to the iOS
emulator as the deployment platform so
let's go ahead and just run that and
here it is and again we have everything
is as it was I can go in and grab any
part of the Dom open up my open these
both up here alright so i can grab any
part of the dom i can put on my select
mode and grab a particular thing right
let's see where's my font size to
go right um here let me it's a little
bit interesting because you have to
remember to keep turning on and off
select mode otherwise when you click on
it it doesn't actually do anything but I
have the h1 right now and so I can go in
and let's make it really super
incredibly large now let's go back to
2am but I can do all of my manipulation
this is a responsive app so if I come
back over here and I bring this out to
an ipad right here it is in the ipad
whoops right and I'm it actually broke
the connection the connection when I
switched it but yeah so here it isn't
the ipad and i can do the same thing
here so i can preview it on various form
factors i could switch it you know the
rotation and see how it looked on the
other rotation my javascript debugging
all works and so forth so so that all
works now we've also integrated yes
yeah how does that work right so all the
communication is happening via it was
that good of an answer you missed it
told them that's the Golem semester I'm
back next year and that's all I have to
say about that all of the communication
is happening via the web kit remote
debugging API which is a part of WebKit
itself so it's not that in chrome we
were talking to the chrome plugin all
the chrome plugin was doing was
facilitating the handshake between
NetBeans and WebKit and from there it
was all web kit itself that was talking
to NetBeans know if yeah that's why we
don't have you know we don't have
internet explorer support I'm sorry guys
I know everybody loves I know everybody
loves developing in that but we don't
have Firefox before exactly but the
browser on both Android and iOS being
being webkit-based and those platforms
actually expose exposed ways to
programmatically you know facilitate
that handshake so we didn't have to even
write a plug-in for for the mobile
browsers yes
yeah I it's best for local I think you
know just just for you know when you
when you're styling and you hit that up
button you know on a style you kind of
want to see it going you know you don't
want to like hit okay there and there it
is right so it's better to run this
booklet yeah
so can I inspect an element on Chrome
and have the source code outline so now
this depends if it's a static element or
if it's dynamically generated element
right so so for example here we let's
just it's we can do it in either one
right so I dropped did I drop no i
didn't i got it why did that all right
so if I you know let's say I go in here
and I decide to pick all right this P
right I can come over here and i can
double click it and it'll drop me to the
location of that because i know where it
is now if i'm in a dynamically generated
div that's being generated by some
javascript so it's for say that for each
loop that he did it with the binding for
the buttons right right so it it's not
smart enough to like inspect the
javascript and figure out what piece of
JavaScript code generated this and drop
you into that javascript but what it
will do is it'll drop you into the
enclosing div of whatever that
dynamically generated tag is sometimes
that helps like when you have data bind
attributes that helps right because then
you can say odata bound to this and then
you can just control click that and go
to the JavaScript sometimes it doesn't
help like with jquery for example right
you know right I don't you know I just
have a did that's got an ID on it I have
no idea what which javascript is going
through and actually making
modifications on it all right yeah and
then the last thing i want to show you
before we take some more some more
questions is we integrated iowa iOS be
integrated cordova cordova three cordova
three they changed everything with
cordova three they made it a node plugin
and everything is done via node and get
now which is which was interesting but
we updated our support for it so I've
set this now as a target to be a Cordova
app on the iOS simulator let's rerun it
and there we go it looks exactly the
same but this is actually a native app
which anyway this is actually a native
app let me to go back to home alright
and
well my emulator is getting a little bit
overtaxed here but wouldn't be a live
demo if there wasn't a hiccup somewhere
that's right trust him
so they're good there we go yeah i think
the emulators are pretty pretty freaky
as well so you notice we're using Mac
Mac for all of the emulation because
lord help us if we try to do an android
emulator exactly yes in the back no pray
it's great I love it that's actually all
i wanted to show so the rest of the time
is question time
so when what it does on the back end is
that you have to have to build the iOS
you have to be on on Mac you have to
have an iOS you have to have xcode
installed but xcode does expose some
command-line interfaces so you don't
actually have to like open up xcode and
build the project from xcode it'll build
it the one thing that Apple absolutely
will not let anybody do is direct deploy
to a device right so what you have to do
is in a bit of a pain you you know is
you you open up iTunes you pull it into
itunes and then you drag it into the
into the device from itunes and that
will put it on on the device so when
with cordova that's what you have to do
yeah yeah it's a pain or you can but we
do also create the Xcode project right
so I mean that's just how Cordova works
right it creates creates an Xcode
project dumps and dumps in the it's
templates dumps in your code right and
then just triggers the build and deploy
from that so um just bide zipping it up
or whatever yeah I think it's in helping
out here visiting config no platforms
there it is iOS right and that's your
that's your Xcode project right there
and then the build you're not right
hello I'm not he's not showing sorry I
wanted to show you one last thing as
well babies inside inside of the project
directory there's a directory called
platforms and then if you do rio s it
goes there if it does if you do you know
your android will go there that that iOS
platform actually contains an X html5
application three Xcode proj you can
just open that up in Xcode and then you
can do all your coding in here and what
if you want to direct deploy the the to
know about each other so you can do all
your coding inside of NetBeans and then
you just alt tab over to Xcode and and
hit-run androids great Android you can
do director play it as a matter of fact
the emulators are for android sucks so
bad right that really you would not
never want to do anything other although
you have some nice tips for an emulator
for android that doesn't the Jenny
motion is beautiful yeah yeah it's GE NY
motion genymotion GE NY motion is a is a
fast emulations for for phones actually
uses virtue or achill virtual machine
and creates a virtual machine and it
looks like a real device instead of an
emulator yeah what's the question
everyone no no we don't we don't
interface with phonegap build although
we've had some talks with the adobe guys
they really like what we're doing with
cordova but but we don't interface with
phonegap build and nor do des oracle
provide a cloud-based build system for
for for the apps yep yep one less thing
I wanted to show just really quick and
then we'll keep taking questions John
very briefly covered this network
monitor this is also something that's
new in 7 dot for the network monitor
allows you to show all of the
interactions so that one where it wasn't
this thing wasn't loading you'll
actually see down here it was in red and
we can see that you know it was a stat
it was a status 0 and it just wasn't it
was hung basically once we click on the
again when we got it to refresh it
pulled the questions down again that's
what John was showing you earlier with
the array the JSON array that was coming
back and then these are the results of
the actual rest call that we're making
out to IMDB in this case so you can see
where the customer search or the custom
search and and here's Alec Baldwin in
the name that we did and so forth one of
the things that's really cool that one
of the engineers just kind of stuck in
here and and it kind of surprised me at
one point this is all great when you're
just using the response in a request and
response of capabilities but I had this
little project that I was working on and
this is you're looking at solid code
don't look
this this is just my playtime in a
little thing a little game that I was
trying to work on for web sockets and so
it's very much like a battleship game so
we also if there's lawyers in here don't
look at that name but a typical
WebSocket game I've got it running in
chrome in one side I got it running in
battle in firefox on the other side I've
got my little ocean and I can lay out my
my ships on my side and my whoever I'm
playing against can lay out their ships
on their side in their ocean and then we
can start taking shots at each other on
here on my targeting board you know I
can take a shot and it shows up over on
their board and I could take a shot over
here and and so forth and if I hit it
shows up red although i don't have my
targeting information finished yet
anything said it's in the works but the
reason I show you this is because it's
all done in WebSockets so let's go back
to the network monitor so the network
monitor shows one connection it's that
WebSocket connection so all that back
and forth that we were doing is done on
one connection and then we actually have
the frames and so you can actually see
all of the sent and received frames
going back and forth on that one
WebSocket connection which is pretty
slick to be able to see what's going on
inside that so as you see all the
WebSocket stuff that's going on today
and they will teach you how to write
real code this is a great tool to be
able to see how things are interacting
from the UI side of that yes in the back
again yeah yeah not yet not yet you
believe it or not when I was in the
military back in the 1980s a buddy of
mine that I'd grown up with we actually
created a battleship game where we
created these we they were grids that we
had drawn out and I happen to work in
computer-aided drafting at the time for
the military and so I drawn up these
grids on a CAD system and I mailed him
his grid and I mailed him all these
little images these little squares and
we would through snail mail we would
send each other our shots in the mail
and so once a week or twice a week I'd
get it and you know a letter in them in
the mailbox from him and it would say
I'm taking a shot at this coordinate and
he won't he'd send me a couple of things
and we go back
for so battleship has been in my life a
long time and any other questions I saw
one over here do you have a question
nope okay yes
no no you can you can run it on any we
can't we don't support running in on
Jody Kate now but um but yeah you can
run it on jdk jdk 7 we try to we usually
try to we ended up having to drop jdk
six support in netbeans 7 dot 4 because
the Java Sea for JDK 8 required jdk 7 so
so nothing 7 dot for actually drops jdk
six support but we usually try to
support this and the last major versions
of the jdk but that's just for running
it on i mean if you want to write jdk
you know one dot 3 code you're welcome
to do that you have your your jdk you
know their you register it as a target
platform and off you go yeah
mm-hmm
yeah javascript debugging live styling
all that works on JSF apps as well yep
man any other questions all right all
right well everybody please go to
NetBeans org download the release
candidate for netbeans 7 dot 4 we should
have FCS as soon as we iron out a few of
these last couple of golems and thanks a
lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
