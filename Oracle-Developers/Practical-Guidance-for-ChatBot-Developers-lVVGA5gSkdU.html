downtown Los Angeles here at Oracle code
2018 I'm Bob rue Bart with the Oracle
developer community and my guests are
Joe long and Marcelo Jabalia guys tell
the folks at home what you do and what
kind of trouble you get into doing it I
go first I'll go first I am a problem
manager here at Oracle for BOTS and
mobile okay yep same here product
manager for BOTS in mobile platform
looking after what we call go to market
so work with customers and partners so
forth okay you know Joe you and I spoke
just shy of a year ago I think I was in
Washington DC and at that event you were
actually presenting on chat BOTS as well
what has changed in the ensuing year
yeah a lot has changed because what we
see is this rapid maturity and adoption
of chat bot technology so packed last
year you know everyone's getting started
with chat pod and just learning the
basic terminology now we have the
platform the market and now we have a
number of production customer live
they've been using the bot they have
live customer and user using the bot for
a month now and now we're seeing a lot
of best practices emerging like how to
give bought a personality and how to
deal with you know a lot of has to do
with deal with its how user interact
with bots and make them feel comfortable
you know using and conversing in a
comfortable way no you know and so this
is actually one of the session that we
have today at the work of code la is on
those best practices that we have seen
from these live customers Mercola what
have you seen change over the last year
anything to add to Joe's response yeah
quite a lot so in terms of the
functionality that we have implemented
the you
do customers customers demand so we have
seen a lot of you know a lot of things
popping up in terms of know the new
channels that we have been supporting
the new capabilities or if like agent
integration you know handling the
conversation between the bots in the
agent back to the user so we have been
you know we have we have seen no
questions and answers no FAQ kind of you
know modules that we have implemented
into the product there's there's quite a
lot different language different
language support this is especially you
know when we travel down to Latin
America for example we have seen a lot
of those requests coming in to us saying
that you know we also need to support
you know on the same platform we need
with the same bot we can support you
know different languages it can be like
you know Spanish Portuguese and English
and other languages throughout the same
system so can you give me a kind of
elevator pitch version of some of the
more dominant best practices that have
emerged in the past year toughy huh well
I think you know two right off the bat
you know in order to get user to be
engaged you know as I was kind of
alluding earlier get bought a
personality of persona you know a name
or something one of our early customer
is a leading electrical appliance home
appliance vendor they're most reputable
vendor or a company in India it's called
Bajaj electricals okay so they gave
their bought a persona and named patty
and in as a matter of fact when we look
at the their body we helped them to
design a bot a lot of the is a bot
terminology and intent a lot of the
intent that's being handled what user
wants to ask about actually is about
handling greetings
or handling maybe not very good feedback
so and imagine if you someone just
unhappy with something and then type
something negative to the body you want
to be able to devout to be able to
handle that gracefully rather than say
oh I don't know what you're talking yeah
you know what the but to say what's your
problem jerk exactly you want to be able
to reply say oh I'm sorry to hear that
not
what are you talking about I can't
resolve this right so that's one the
very basic thing just to get user to
increase user adoption and and also a
user satisfaction through that in a few
yeah I think you know a lot of things
that we have learned in terms of not the
best practice and how the bots should be
presenting itself to the user and some
of the things that we have learned from
customers implementing that kind of
technology is should we go and just let
you know a free flow free flow
conversation with the user or should we
present a menu to the user saying you
know here are these are the capabilities
are were able to you know to go with the
flow with you so there are a lot of
different things that we have been
discussing with customers and they have
been you know picking up you know a few
here and there depending on their use
cases but you know basically you know we
have seen chat bots is starting from the
free flow conversation you just say hi
to the bots and the bot handles the rest
of the conversation or you see cases
where when the user starts the session
the ball already presents something to
do so here are the things that you're
able to do with my help and you know
they go from there
and the other thing that we're seeing
interesting is conversation you know why
the Bakken do you write and what what
bond needs to do sometimes works very
well with a conversational interface
back and forth sometimes they don't and
especially let's say taking a bath or
banking you know if I need to go ahead
and dispute a transaction typically user
needs to fill out a bunch of questions
even provide signature a simple back and
forth conversation chat UI isn't going
to cut it it's going to be very tiring
for user to ask the question the answer
asking question to answer so what we
have done is we enhance the we added the
feature called instant now that allows
the customer to create a rich UI and
even capture signature in all in the
window and contacts the chat so the user
can comes converse with a chat okay and
then get to a point where okay and need
to dispute of transaction the we can
display a rich user interface for user
to very quickly fill in these
information the very user friendly
efficient way and even use camera for
example
take a picture of certain things and
we're learning all that and in putting
all that into the the platform and
that's one of the big changes that we
had since last year
Marcelo moments ago you mentioned it
that you guys have have been doing doing
this over the last year that certain
frequently asked questions have emerged
right what are some of those questions I
really depends on the use cases you know
each each one of the customers that we
have you know in different industries so
they do see you know fa Q's or they do
see they've questions where you know
they all we need we need to integrate
with this particular system that has all
the answers for the free CLE ask
questions on our on our on our platform
so we gave these customers they ability
to import those those questions and
answers and be part of the chat bot
conversation so if the if the user is
asking a question and then the question
is not respond it is not a part of being
tense that's Jose Joe was describing so
we transition into this module of FAQ so
and then we can provide you know the
answers from whatever you know source
the the the customers provided you okay
and I think the other thing we're seeing
is you know a lot of the early bot
scenarios involved offloading a contact
center so rather than having live agent
answering all of the questions off low
some of the operations to bond now the
interesting thing is feels like there's
a slight earthquake but anyway we're in
LA so you never know or maybe there's
heavy cart rolling across the road but
no but the the interesting thing is now
we're able to get the now and while
you've got an integrative the agent and
handle the conversation because
sometimes the conversation at to a point
where BOTS can handle to a certain point
and then if BOTS can't answer it or just
really can't answer and understand the
users then the bot can now hand off the
the conversation to the Asian not only
that but also the Asian horse needs to
know see the entire conversation history
right because agent may want to know
while this this user may be already very
upset because they're not able to you
know maybe for whatever reason the that
the previous answer didn't please the
the user so again those are the feedback
that we're hearing from the customer and
we're integrating that into into this
overall platform or maybe the user is a
pain in the butt and the bot just got
frustrated yeah there we go
but then you know but then this is where
would train the intent for a handling
okay you just use the word intent before
we started this interview we had a brief
conversation about some of the
terminology it's emerging in the chat
bot world what is intent I'll give it a
shot yeah so so the their meaning of
those many of those terminologies that
we use in boss development so intent is
what the user is looking for so there
are more point tense that your bot could
cover and you you know in the financial
bank that joe joe was alluding to so
that you could use like what's my intent
for you know checking my balance what's
my intention
what's the intention of the user to
transfer money was the intention of the
user to pay bills so those are you know
the the major use cases that your bot
could pretty much respond to yeah
basically what do you want your bar to
be able to understand and then the part
of the training is okay how do you make
it understand the user intent is by
providing a set of examples that how
user may ask the question now as you can
imagine there's is impossible for
someone to enter all the combinations of
permutation how someone may ask a
question so this is where the AI and
natural language processing engine comes
and is able to leverage a limited set of
these examples again I'm going to use a
terminology by specific terminology
called utterances okay okay these are
examples limit to certain examples and
use those example to guess what user
intent is and that's the kind of core of
our natural language processing engine
the AI that
that's in the chat bot platform okay
intense uh Turin says let's go for three
give me a third chat bot term entity
entity yeah that's link that's fine
entity so you have your your major use
cases covered by the intent but you know
at the same time that I'm gonna say
what's my balance
so the bot needs to understand what
account you're looking for your balance
and those variables in terms of you know
what how the how the bot is operating
how the bot is responding you could you
know pretty much add information for the
bar to capture and say what's my balance
on my savings account which is different
from what's my balance on my checking
account so and then you know if you set
up a account type as your entity so you
could the bot could pretty much capture
that you have the intent resolution
which goes into your balances intent and
then your entity is gonna be what kind
of account you're looking for yeah
so that's pretty much me that's the
variation that you can add on on top of
you know intents and entities yeah
another way to think of it is just
taking the sense of the part right and
then say okay this part of the sentence
addresses this particular attribute this
far and and that's what entity will help
you to do is basically take the Essenza
part it occurs to me talking to you
gentlemen that developing chatbots is
very much a language thing much more so
than it is a coding thing I think it's a
combination of both
because you know at the same point that
we have been talking about like intents
and entities which is part of you know
the natural language understanding
module that we have you know on the
other end you also need backend
integration for example you also need
you know the front and integration with
channels so which basically opens up for
you know where I'm gonna get this the
value of my balance from so that's a
back-end system that's gonna return that
data for me on the other end so we have
the front-end integration which applies
to all the channels that we have been
integrating more and more on our
platforms so we started with like a
generic HTTP web hook and facebook
Messenger and now you open up for you
know some other channels like you can go
into web messenger widget
you can go and deploy on your iOS
application on your Android application
and you know you have right away you
have like five different channels
available for the user to contact your
your chat bot well gentlemen thanks so
much for stopping by
it's I have a lot of fun talking about
chat bots because it's such a
fascinating subject if you're looking
