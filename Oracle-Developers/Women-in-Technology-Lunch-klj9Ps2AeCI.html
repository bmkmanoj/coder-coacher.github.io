women of technology lunch and my name is
Laura Ramsey and I am with the Oracle
developer community and today we're real
excited to have three outstanding
panelists to discuss some of the issues
in women in technology today so first
I'd like to introduce Monika Kumar
Monica has been with Oracle for quite a
while she is our vice president of many
of the Oracle Technologies marketing and
global sales mostly focusing in database
and big data so come on up Monica and
next we have Heather banker heaven and
crud is chair of the JCP program also
working at Oracle and she has been with
the technology community for 15 plus
years in the Java world so come on
Heather and finally very pleased to
introduce Lisa may Brunson she is the
founder of wonder women in tech and she
also hosts hacks for humanity the wonder
women tech conference as well as many
other programs aimed at girls and
technology so thank you and come on up
Lisa will be passing microphones
fabulous sorry so first thank you ladies
for joining us it's it's always great to
have such a group and I'm actually a
very eclectic group because we have one
person who up while they're all very
integrated and interactive in corporate
careers they also have got a great story
and outreach and participation in their
communities so I'm going to start with
Monica Monica I'm
to give us a little bit background about
yourself sure can you guys hear me okay
before I do that though I'm so happy to
see so many of our male counterparts
here thank you so much for coming it
this means a lot to us and I'm gonna
talk about that I know you will talk
about that so thank you so I've been
with Oracle 21 years I know I grew up at
Oracle I feel like primarily in the
database space but also open source I
for many years I actually ran the
marketing and product management for
Linux virtualization and the open source
acquisitions that Oracle did with MySQL
now I'm back in the database team for
the last six years and I run the product
marketing for database data management
and big dinner on the other side of my
life I'm a mother of two kids my son is
almost 22 and my daughter is 18 so it
definitely feels very passionate about
how women and girls I encouraged in stem
and I'm going to talk about that as we
go through some of the questions and
last but not least I love what I do on
most days and I want to learn from
everybody that I interact with including
on my male counterparts and I know some
of you in here like Siddharth he knows
we've had very passionate conversations
about how to encourage diversity and so
on together so it's ready to be here
thank you
Thank You Monica all right Heather hi
I'm Heather Bankura and I have been
involved with the Java developer
community since 2000 I worked at Sun
Microsystems starting on Java 1.2 relief
so I've been involved with every Java
release since that time so like you said
over 15 years at this point I started
out pretty young I guess so my role is
I'm chairperson of the Java community
process which is the standardization
organization overseeing the evolution of
Java and how it evolves and adds new
features and functionality for Java
developers so as part of that role
essentially I'm interacting with the
Java developer community all around the
world acting as a speaker interacting
with Java user groups that we have
everywhere and organizing hack days
participating in hacker Gardens
participating events like this and then
I guess you could say the other part of
my job which is naturally flowed out of
that is obviously I'm a woman and being
that I attend Java developer conferences
around the world most of the time there
aren't that many other women which this
is a unique experience because there are
quite a few women here and so I'd say
over the last five years more and more
often in addition to getting questions
about how they can get how developers
can get their favorite feature and
functionality into Java and how they can
be on an expert group for a jsr them the
second most common question I get is why
are there more women here and how can we
get more women at our conferences
working on our teams getting involved
with the community and so as a result of
that in addition to speaking on the Java
developer community technical topics and
events I started to talk about what man
can do because that is something that
men have come to me with what can I do
so I put together a talk called top 10
ways to ally for women in technology and
that talk is really designed for men so
as Monica said it's great to see some
men in the audience but I think women of
course can help each other as well and
I'll talk about that more later Thank
You Heather
and now Lisa may tell us a little bit
about yourself famous Lisa made words
and I am the founder of Wonder Woman
Tech which is a conference and ecosystem
that supports highlights celebrates and
educates women at the under represented
across technology as well as steam
science technology engineering the arts
and math I'm also the founder of wonder
women hacks which is a hackathon focused
on creating solutions and apps for women
and girls challenges facing women and
girls as well as hacks for Humanity
which is a hackathon focused on social
that we did with Arizona State
University so I work with developer
communities to think differently about
how they build products and apps mainly
focused on social innovation
my background is definitely in social
innovation working on creating
opportunities for women to be recognized
in the buildin have tools and resources
as well as educational opportunities to
level up in their careers whether women
tech as a conference platform has expand
and expanded in the last four years to
go global we just recently did our first
global summit in Washington DC last
month and we will be in London during
lended tech week this June for our
second year and our national conferences
health is at the Bob Beach Convention
Center this will be our third year there
so we're really excited I get to work
with fortune 500 companies and
governments as well as startup founders
and nonprofit organizations to tackle
these kinds of issues that we faces as
women and people of color in the
industry so it's really an honor to be
here and be amongst the Oracle developer
community and as a side note Heather
husband one of our speakers for two
years in a row and now 30 years this
year so ability excited so she's
definitely representing all of you
within the wonder women tech ecosystem
thank you well thank you it's really
nice to meet you and all three of our
panelists are really have some very
strong passionate opinions on a couple
of topics when we got together on the
phone last week and talking through what
we would like to talk about one of the
biggest topics was about unconscious
bias and how do you recognize
unconscious bias so how many of us may
be working in a project or maybe in an
interview you feel like maybe you were
subject to a little bit of bias that
occurred in in the project see but the
interesting thing is for a long time
many of us probably didn't realize
that we were being subjected to some
some form of bias bias is a natural
state and human interactions but Monica
you know you've got an interesting
perspective on how you recognize it and
turn unconscious bias into more of a
constructive thing absolutely so first
of all let me say that I have some
lovely men in my life I love them my
father my brother my partner my son and
my friends and what I realized is that
when we talk about unconscious bias it's
more conditioning people don't even
realize that they have a bias so it's
not that we are being subjected as women
to bias on purpose
in most cases that's not the case or as
diverse as minorities that we are being
subjected to bias on purpose in most
cases that that's not the case however
the reason the term unconscious bias
whis point is because there is
conditioning in society in how people
perceive other people there's been
conditioning over the centuries of in
how women are perceived now I know I've
had passionate conversations about with
my male colleagues who say no wait hell
I'm the biggest promoter and proponent
of women I get it but I've also been
with the same people in meetings where I
had an idea somehow my voice drowned and
I'm not the person whose voice drowns by
any means in a meeting cidade can vouch
for that
somehow my voice drowned nobody heard my
idea too much later one of my good
friends occurs the same idea the throat
divers that was a fantastic idea and I
said and I literally looked at my head
and said oh my god I just said that
literally 30 seconds ago what just
happened maybe it was my voice maybe the
way I said it maybe I was too squeaky I
don't know what happened so I believe
those are examples that's a very small
example of how there's this unconscious
bias towards sometimes women having
ideas versus male and again I'm not
saying it's not purpose remember that
it's not on purpose so what did I do for
that right I obviously didn't call them
out in the meeting but I
go to my friend after the meeting and
said hey can I talk to you and he's like
sure we sat down and I explained to you
what this happened in the meeting and he
said no it didn't happen I said no it
did so after a while I think he realized
it did happen I also talked to the other
person who did not listen to my idea but
listen to this other person's idea so
over the next few weeks we actually
worked on it the meetings they actually
were very conscious and very sensitive
when I spoke something that didn't talk
over me or dismissed my ideas but they
actually listened to me so that's one
example what I'm saying is that in that
occasion I didn't call people out saying
excuse me that was my idea you don't
listen to me
I actually over the years I've learned
with experience that you know sometimes
bullying or sometimes getting angry and
agitated doesn't work in these
situations I think what works is
understanding the other point of view
which is they can do it on purpose
didn't even know that they did it so why
not have a decent conversation and
figure out the cause and understand your
point of view and in most cases they
would come around and say you know what
I had no idea I was doing it thank you
for letting me know
because that's no I want my daughter in
this world to be treated the same way as
I expect or that as you expect me to
treat you as a woman so that's one
example I had more but I don't know if
you guys want to share other ideas I'm
happy to pass it on to you well you know
my team and I are launching a new
initiative called hiring humans which we
just quit beta tester with Amazon last
week so we haven't actually formally
announced it yet publicly we will assume
but it's really tackling one of the
things we talked about with their teams
were unconscious bias because you're
right it's actually something that we're
not rich unconscious right so we don't
know that we're actually making
determinations about a person or
singling a personnel or leaving somebody
out of a conversation or out of an
opportunity and I think a lot of times
people don't know what they don't know
until they know so we have to speak up
for ourselves we have to advocate and
then also one of the things that we're
teaching people is to kind of be mindful
of who you are as a person and really
understand your own truth are you
creating judgments about a person are
you only hiring or wanting to work with
people that look like you those are some
very uncomfortable conversations but it
really starts here first before you can
really implement change and address and
create something new for the clear
organization now Heather in your
interactions on projects on the JCP
there's probably a lot of bias but
you've learned to turn that into
building allies how does it how does
that work how do you go from you know
being subjected to some bias to actually
turning that into an alliance well I
think as we talked about here you know
you don't realize that there is
unconscious bias but I think just
recognizing the fact that everyone does
have unconscious bias is important as a
first step secondly when you talk about
allies what I like to encourage the
people I work with to think of men or
women is the fact that think you can use
ally as a noun or you can use it as a
verb but what I think is much more
effective is rather than say oh yes I'm
an ally I support what having women in
technology think of it more as a verb
something that you actually do not
something that you are and it's
something that you do sometimes not all
of the time and so if you're actually
consciously thinking of ways that maybe
you're being biased in a situation you
can actually be more active in that and
so that's one of the things that I
encourage people to do is to actually go
out and talk to people who are different
from you so oftentimes your mentoring
comes up in terms of Ally actions and
oftentimes men or women tend to think
that they need to mentor someone who's
like them and again that's human nature
you want to find people who are similar
to you you have that natural affinity or
whatever characteristics you're looking
for but you can actually learn a
tremendous amount by being mentored or
mentoring somewhat different from you so
men or women I encourage them always to
go seek out some
the different perspectives so you're
gonna learn a lot more that way and also
in terms of mentoring mentoring often
times will turn into I think you need to
change these certain behaviors but I
like to think of mentoring more in the
terms of sponsorship so in terms of that
relationship you're actually champion
and and sponsoring the person that
you're mentoring and that mentor is
doing that for you rather than telling
you go take these classes oh you should
change the way you're doing this or that
to be more like the mentor he or she is
so more being that champion of the
person advocating for them on their
behalf so if it's a situation like
Monika talked about where someone's
being interrupted which happens for
women three times more often
scientifically than it happens for men
speaking up in that situation right so
if it happens at in a meeting someone
can speak up and say I don't think she
was finished yet of course you can
always say that on your own behalf I
don't think I was finished yet
personally I chaired the JCP Executive
Committee which is made up of 25 members
and yes they are mostly men and being
the chairperson of these meetings I get
interrupted which to me seems ridiculous
but I do take it upon myself to say I'm
not finished yet that also can be done
you know in a gracious way but stepping
up and speaking up in those situations
and again the thing that happens in with
Monica at someone taking your idea again
scientifically proven that certain tones
of voice aren't actually hurt by men so
of course there's no blame here but what
people who can do are in the situation
is speak up and say things like amplify
that thought so if you feel like the
idea is coming not being heard or
falling on ears that aren't responding
say oh that was really a great idea that
Monica just had him what if we did this
also or ask a clarifying question so
sometimes if you're aware of this
happening and again it's just being
aware that this is happening you can
actually step in and take some actions
and I just wanted to add to what you
said and also because we are about equal
opportunity opportunity right that's
what we are here
unconscious bias can also happen with
women too and I'll give you an example I
was talking to Alexis about that I've
been in multiple situations where I go
to a meeting with my male colleagues
a person who reports to me I am the
manager and this is having both men and
women who are meeting when they end up
starting to talk to the guy assuming
that he is the boss okay half and I who
I said back and I really kind of look at
this
iii-i'm use what's going on recently in
happened with a woman who was visiting
us and she thought one of the guys who
works for me is actually the boss and
halfway through the meeting she turns to
me and says so what are you doing these
days Monica so my guys woke up and said
she's my boss realize that so I have to
say this story because it goes both ways
so it's not just men who have
unconscious bias I think women have it
to some extent to me up here which one
it as well and that was just an example
I wanted to share same thing you know
that we have about equal opportunity
here yeah I agree I say I think all
people unconscious bias including myself
and I actually have the reverse thing so
my boss took my team out to lunch in
December and I have a little bit of a
forceful personality you might know that
about me if you know me but basically
the server decided that I was the boss
another than him and so he brought me
the bill at the end and uncomfortable
your comments Heather you talked about
mentorship and I really think that you
know it's changing the stories but also
having somebody to guide you into the
next right thing is really important how
many of us have a mentor in our careers
a mentoring relationship fantastic how
many of us are actually mentoring others
good good because that just seems to be
central to keeping the things rolling so
Lisa May when in your experience with
your programs how I mean mentorship is a
key part of our success but what are
some of the other success
factors and how do women experience
success do you think it's different yeah
so it's it's very interesting because um
you know I think as women we have
operated with our the male definition of
what success is you know that's to get
ahead to work hard to prove ourselves to
reach you know these goals that I think
sometimes feel very unrealistic and I
know for myself and my team many members
of my team if not all members who are
all women we are very driven and we are
naturally born multitaskers as women
we're doing a lot of things some of us
are mothers some of us are others you
know mentoring doing a lot of different
kinds of activities in addition to our
regular jobs we're working around the
clock I'm certainly no exception and
I've had to redefine what success is for
me recently being an overachiever I
worked around the clock and last year
suffered a head injury from exhaustion
and what it's done for me is really
really what is success and how we can
redefine what those metrics look like
and so for myself what I've had to do is
redesign the way that I create goals for
myself so everything becomes a win and I
think to having mentorship was one of
them I actually started reaching out and
saying I need help because I as an
a-type person I tend to first do and
then ask later because I can do it and I
think a lot of women that I've talked to
in building my conferences they're the
same way we all relate to illnesses
stress things that we don't talk about
we maintain a status quo and so what
I've really understood is that success
is every day that I get up and I go make
things happen every whether it's a
conference or whether it's a product
just really celebrating every time you
make something happen and you achieve a
goal whether it's hey I just added
somebody to my team today or hey I
solved a challenge that that I wanted to
solve you know with regard to our
hackathon
those things are successes for me and
I've started teaching that in our in my
own mentorship with my mentees is
letting them know that everything that
they do is success and it's really
changed the way that I've personally
related with my team and how some of our
organizations are redesigning the way
that they operate with their team's
thoughts on success factors I totally
agree with what he's just said I think
everybody should define success for
themselves the one thing I would say you
know as being in the tech industry for
25 years I mean before Klein worked at
another company personally to me I think
there's two things because I have a girl
I want to see her succeed in life and
have equal opportunity but equal
opportunity not just an education and
career I want to see more women in
leadership positions that is my personal
goal
I know leadership position doesn't have
to be the title by the way that's not
what I call a leadership position but
you have to become a senior director of
VP or C or you know not everybody can be
a founder but everyone can have a
founding moment in their career so what
I wanna see women do is to take more
charge be more confident with the help
of a male counterparts with the help of
mentors with the help of evangelists
with the help of champions and I'll tell
you for me personally my biggest
champion was one of the guys my boss's
boss who actually propelled me further
further in my career because he believed
in me because we had a human connection
because there was positivity in our
interaction it wasn't like I wanted
something from him and I you know he
could see through all she just wants me
to be her mentor that wasn't the
relationship the relationship was built
on his belief in me and the fact that I
deliver
and over time we built a relationship it
wasn't like I didn't go to seek a mentor
you know what I mean it happened over
time because we work together so for me
my biggest message to everybody here
including the man who have maybe
daughters and sisters and other women in
their life that the support please
introduce them into leadership positions
in whatever role in life they have
because it'll mean a lot to them for you
to believe in them that they can do it I
think in a heart of hard we all
in it but we need a support system
around us to do that and so that is my
biggest ask of this room and when
infertile the mentoring part but that's
what I'm asking all of you here thank
you success factor well I guess I would
say that uh success I think it is
different for everyone but what kind of
comes to me to my mind what I think
about it is thinking about in my career
all of my sponsors mentors and allies
that have pushed me forward in my career
that I've really taken an interest in me
happen men and I think that one of the
other differences I've noticed between
the men and women that I work with and
it's actually read some research about
is the fact that men are promoted and
apply for positions based on potential
and women are hired and promoted based
on proof and I think in a lot of ways
that's a self propelled self-fulfilling
prophecy in terms of success right and I
agree that not everyone wants to
continue to achieve at the highest
levels and there may be different
moments in the person's career where
they success means something different
at that point but I think it's important
for us as humans to think about this
this fact that happens in life which is
often times men will apply for positions
if they have only one or two of the
things on the list for the job
responsibilities and a woman would think
maybe that it wouldn't even need be
necessary to apply if you don't have
everything on that list so what we can
do for each other is encourage each
other and be aware of these facts so
encourage women that we work with to go
ahead and apply for that job
ask for that promotion ask for that
raise submit to talk at that conference
one of the things that I talked with a
bunch of women earlier last or last week
in Atlanta about was the fact that we
look at conference speakers there just
aren't that many speaking at conferences
you see them attending we see lots of
attendees here who are women which is
awesome but the next step would be let's
see some of the women here submitting a
talk and let's hear what the women have
to teach us and again I hear from women
that same resistance I'm
an expert and have the communication
skills I don't know enough yet but yet
when I invite men to come and speak with
me in the talk
the answer is unknown I would say
unanimously yes and even if I can't do
it that day please invite me in the
future I want to do that I can do this
so I think we need to give that extra
invitation support encouragement too if
we really want to see that balance start
to shift you know me I want to say that
she said that if anybody wants to submit
to speak any of our conferences please
reach out because we definitely
highlight women or if you want to lead a
workshop we will provide that
opportunity I was just gonna share a
story about a friend of ours
her name is Healy from Finland she is an
Oracle a sector and she gave a session
next door about machine learning and
this is this was an entirely new topic
area to her seven months ago but she
drilled in and she decided that she was
going to learn this space and in this in
just seven short months she brought
herself up to a level of expertise where
she had 200 people sitting next door
listening to her presentation on machine
learning and there was a decision and I
really I feel like success factors for
women really do revolve around our
decisions we make a decision to to go
after something or to win so yeah I was
again I'm gonna say a change takes
action so I know you all are here
because you believe in supporting
minorities and women so really
appreciate it but needing to go back and
make take some action both men and women
right in any small form or shape whether
it's supporting your colleagues at work
like these ladies gave examples whether
it's supporting your colleagues in a
meeting and making sure the voices are
heard whether it's is talking to them
and mentoring them or whether it's
giving them speaking opportunity or
saying hey did you know that that
conference call for papers of became
available have you thought about
applying for that so small steps but I
think these are really important steps
because if you don't take action we can
just keep talking about jail and it's
never
happen we're talking about centuries of
bias here I know some people will laugh
at that and move with that but their
research studies that should prove that
this is based on centuries of bias this
is gonna take a long time to actually
change and really become equal so we
need every small step I think can help
towards that the one other thing I would
add is you know for women specifically
because this is again a question that I
get asked very often as women leaders as
women you know developers and engineers
are they supposed to behave a certain
way and I'd say no don't worry about it
be authentic be who you are because the
moment you're pretending to be somebody
else
you're shortchanging your potential
because your passion and energy will
never come through to its fullest
potential you keep behaving like
somebody else sets in never do it
we authentic even if an engineer you're
who you are
your work is gonna speak for itself
right if your leader you don't have to
be a button-up stoic exactly no need to
do that you can be who you are it can be
emotional believe me I do that and and
it's okay and people actually enjoy it
my advice is be authentic and please
everybody help each other out
well so now for my favorite question
I've asked each of the panelists what do
you know now that you wished that you've
known back then if you could travel
through time besides buying Google stock
everybody answers that one what do you
what do you wish that you had known back
then you know um some very helpful
things I wish I'd known back then that I
know now is one the naysayers really
don't matter their opinions really just
do not matter and number two would be I
practice something now that I call the
art of fearless asking I asked for
whatever I want whether it's $100,000
venue or a you know senator Kamala
Harris to come speak in our conference
or whatever it is like I do that now and
I wish I had done that then because you
never know who's going to actually say
yes even when you're convinced
that you said that's gonna be now and I
think the third thing is um stick with
the seeds that you plant because you
never know those seeds might not lost
them in five years but you never know
when they might blossom and so if I had
watered a couple of these things then I
think I would be a lot further in this
work that I've been doing around
diversity and inclusion next all right
so there are so many more than three but
I'll take three all right so first so
the idea that Tech is a meritocracy that
really isn't true so I when I started
working in tech I thought that putting
my head down and doing my work really
hard and fast and as quickly as I could
was all that it took and you do need to
do that to succeed in technology but
that's really just the bare minimum to
keep your job if you want to thrive you
need to be looking up from your work and
growing your network and thinking about
ways that you can increase your
visibility and expand your influence so
if I would have part of that sooner that
would've been a good thing to know and
that applies for any one man or woman
secondly I think when I first started in
tech I hardly recognized that I was a
woman so again one of those I guess
human things as you mimic people who are
around you so especially when I first
started out working in technology it
literally was all men and I was
mimicking them again that's human
behavior and I wish I would have known
that my when you when I behave a certain
way even it's exactly the same way as a
man is behaving it's going to be
perceived differently so if I just would
have been aware of that it took me a
while to see that that I might be
perceived as abrasive where if I was a
man behaving the same way I might be
perceived as a strong leader and thirdly
gosh I guess they would say I guess it
comes to authenticity so whatever it is
that is unique about you that is what
makes you special what differentiates
you should be more of that rather than
trying to change and be more like the
people that are around you because the
diversity in the teams is what makes a
team more successful more creative
smarter even more profitable um for me I
know this is gonna sound very directed
my daughter told me mom this is crazy
because it's my Instagram anything I am
Who I am
your approval is not needed I realized
that now I'm done I mean I you know I've
got three years and now I've come to a
place where I feel empowered and I'm
responsible for my decisions and I'll
take the fall for it or I'll take the
glory for it
so that's one second is humor goes a
long way I realize you know what you can
really cut the is a lot with a little
laughter and and joke it's okay to do
that and my last one which also I
learned over the years is that it's
better to be kind than to be right and
I've been in situations where I went
with guns blazing and then they died I
felt so horrible and so bad and then I
realize you know what I should have
handled the situation differently so
that's my third model those are my three
things thank you it's really wonderful
very very encouraging do we have any
questions from the group or comments
about any of our topics that we talked
about today please go ahead
well I would say that I think that's
essential so I think some of my best
mentorship relationships came through a
program where I was matched with someone
so it didn't it took out that
awkwardness of will you be my mentor or
can i mentor you right that it
especially these days it seems really
awkward especially for people that are
different from you so in that regard I
think that is an essential thing to have
and it really just takes makes that
matchmaking part of it that kind of
weird uncomfortable part go away I also
add to that quickly I think that's
important also what's important is like
as managers we can work with the HR
teams to actually create more diversity
and inclusion in how we recruit and how
we mentor and how we promote people so
that's something I'm really passionate
about in my team and I worked closely
with my HR counterparts to do that as
well other questions from the tables and
we'll have a few minutes after we break
up so if you'd like to approach and
introduce yourself to our panelists you
should certainly do that as well so I
would also like to introduce one other
person in our women in technology
program melissa Thorne is dedicated to
our woman in technology outreach and
program so we're really proud of our
managing team for letting us dedicate
someone to this and super excited about
Melissa coming on board to do the right
thing when I kind of start with the
technology activities so any final
thoughts coming from the panelists I
just say that I'm really excited to be
here I'm really thankful that we're
doing this as Oracle as a company is
getting behind really supporting and
encouraging women in technology so thank
you to Oracle and thank you Laura for
making this happen in the team here okay
well my closing thought I guess would be
call to action so I talked about
thinking of a life for women in tech as
a verb so think about any small action
that you can take so man or woman all of
us and
taking small actions rather than using
kind of those passive verbs like support
or empower I'm really a fan of words
like hey invite promote sponsor those
kind of words so think about something
that you can do today at this conference
whether it's even as simple as follow
someone on Twitter right so someone that
you meet today a woman follow follow her
on Twitter it could be that simple yeah
you know it's very exciting for me and
my team because we get to talk to
companies practically every single day
all over the world and I'm starting to
see a lot of companies come to the table
and say we're just getting started in
the DNI conversation and you'd be
surprised how big these companies are so
being part of what's happening here at
Oracle is an honor and just it's it's it
provides hope you know I'm an advocate
for this kind of work I've been doing it
all my life
even before I understood that there
wasn't such thing called diversity and
inclusion before it was a trend but one
day it will be policy and so I just feel
really honored to stand here with all of
you who are just leading the change for
the next generation so thank you well
thank you very much for joining us today
and one closing thought is that you can
approach your life as a race or you can
approach your life as a parade either
way just make sure that you dress
accordingly yeah thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
