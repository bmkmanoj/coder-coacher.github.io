developing with Java on iOS and Android
introduction to Oracle ADF - longer FAQ
title for a session session I'm a
director of product management at Oracle
for the Java development tools and the
Java development framework which is
called Oracle ADF and and in this
session we were specifically going to
talk about total area for mobile and how
it can allow you as a Java developer to
actually become a mobile developer and
basically transitioning your knowledge
into developing native applications on
iOS and Android right so it used to be
that we would start this session with a
lot of graphs and charts that show how
pervasive mobile devices are like I used
to go on stage and ask how many people
here have a smartphone this we don't
need to do this anymore right how many
people here will only have one
smartphone that might be so the
situation is basically analysts are
right now saying that the number of
tablets and smartphones that are being
sold is bigger than the number of
devices like desktops and laptops right
you go to various locations in the world
you go for example to China people use
their the wireless network more than
they use cable network because it's
small stable they're the estimated 90%
of the traffic that is basically done on
mobile networks rather than regular
Wi-Fi or cable network and this trend is
only going okay and you're going to need
to develop to those devices whether you
like it or not because this is where
everyone is now accessing their
applications yeah you can carry a laptop
but it's heavy right and most people now
access information from those devices
I should perfect what I say by this
session is not about how
build games for this platform what we
are focusing on is how do we build
enterprise applications that's kind of
what Java EE does in the code okay
our focus is on building enterprise
applications for mobile devices and so
your as a Java developer you might say I
already know like I know Java I can
build for Android because Android uses
Java made a big lawsuit about it but
that's another story and but then you'll
be missing about half of the market
right because if you look at what the
market statistics depending on where you
are in the world and what type of device
you look at whether it's a tablet or
smartphone the market is kind of split
between Android and iOS there are some
third-party players or third players
like Windows Mobile and really I don't
know maybe but most of the audience out
there is using one of the two operating
system and there is no clear winner okay
so tablets there are mobile iOS devices
smartphones there are mobile Android you
go to other parts of the world there are
more Android in iOS you go to the
Silicon Valley everyone has an iOS
device nobody uses and so it's very it's
unclear and what you need to basically
understand is that in a world where it's
bring your own device to work type of
environment you need to target both
environments which for a lot of people
means I need to develop my application
twice and that's if you are doing native
development and there are basically
three types of mobile development being
done today and the first one is what is
referred to as native development where
you go and you pick up the SDK and the
development tool of the environment and
you build to the specific operating
system right so if you're using iOS you
take Xcode ok mmm objective-c and you
write your application with the iOS API
if you're doing it in Android you pick
up the eclipse Android plugins and maybe
NetBeans and Android plugins you write
your Java on to the specific device
the nice thing about it is that the
native environment gives you the full
access to the device capabilities give
you great performance go to the
interface you can access every little
bitten piece of the device the problem
is you're developing for a specific
platform okay most enterprise IT shops
can't afford to duplicate their effort
and build one application for Android
one for iOS because remember when you
build an application it's not just okay
I built it in its Dell it's then
maintaining it and updating it and
matching new versions of their systems
that come out and every feature that
you're building you need to duplicate it
into two places so it's not very
appealing to a lot of IT organizations
so a lot of IT organizations actually go
with what is referred to as the web type
of application where you basically build
a web application and then on the device
you open the browser and you access the
web application from the device okay and
then you can build a web application
with responsive design and those type of
capabilities and you have one
application that can be accessed both
from the Safari or on the iOS and the
Chrome on the Android and that's good
for some cases but what you're losing
there is the whole integration with the
device capabilities you're running
inside a browser which is kind of a box
where you can't get out of and you can't
access things like the camera on the
device or the storage on the device or
the contacts on the device or send an
SMS and stuff like that so and you also
lose screen area because there's the
balfour the URL and there's the back and
forward navigation buttons and stuff
like that so again this is good for some
situations and because of the
disadvantages of the native and the web
situations and the third option that
Rose was highly development highway
development relies on you having a
container that runs on the device and
your application runs in the container
and UID application once the container
is available for multiple platforms
and then your application runs in the
container on all the platforms so you
build the application once turns on
multiple platforms the container gives
you the api's to actually access the
device services device capabilities
local storage things like that and if
you talk to analysts today
things like Gartner and the other type
of guys like that they would tell you
that for IT organization IT shops
hybrid is the way to go because it
basically gives you the benefit of both
approaches in terms of having one
application served multiple platforms
and having access to the device
capabilities and actually leveraging the
fact that you have a device okay yeah if
you're building a game if you're
building Angry Birds yeah you probably
want to go native because you want
immediately spawns and stuff like that
but if you're building an application
that is what we call an ITIN application
let's say something like I want to
browse my enterprise application
employees and give them salary raises
and stuff like that
the performance of hybrid is pretty
close to native now so and the benefit
of being able to run a multiple platform
basically outweigh the other
considerations so you need to basically
think about what type of user is
accessing your application what is his
requirements what type of user interface
is expecting to get and based on those
type of decision and questions you'll be
able to pick the right architecture for
your application okay for the Java
developer this brings in kind of a
dilemma of whether am I going to be
basically become extinct now because
Java is very good at all the server-side
stuff and we can build a web based
mobile application with Java without a
problem but building native is a little
tricky yeah I can maybe build for
Android although I need to again learn
like a variant of Java and a bunch of
specific api's but then I'm missing half
the market
okay hybrid is basically most of the
hybrid solutions out there it's
basically a unit to layer on HTML and
JavaScript you don't talk in Java do ya
and then you're asking okay do I need to
learn new tools do I need to learn new
language basically am my skills
basically becoming extinct in the new
world of mobile and we didn't like the
answer yes so we said no okay and this
is why we say basically we have idea for
mobile so at idea Mobile allows us to do
is basically take our developer skills
in Java and allow them to continue use
in Java and build in a hybrid platform
okay
so build a hybrid application so the way
that say DF mobile works is you build an
application once and it deploys as a
native in a native container either to
iOS o to Android with the possibility in
the future of adapting other platforms
so I know like what usually when I do
the Q&amp;amp;A people ask me okay are you going
to support Windows Mobile when and the
question is maybe it depends on how
popular this is whether it's justifying
our effort but in theory it's something
that is totally possible for us to do
okay and when you're working with a DF
mobile you're basically developing with
Java and possibly writing html5 although
it's not mandatory okay but the
rendering is done in html5 so the html5
gives you the native look and feel on
the device so how is the idea of mobile
actually working and we have a container
like any hybrid solution and inside the
container will run your application the
container allows you to access the
device services device features storage
things like that and the container also
supports push push notifications so you
can actually get push events from the
server into your application the user
interface is being rendered using html5
and JavaScript technology again I'll
show you later on when we'll develop
you don't actually have to code html5
okay we give you a different we give you
a component based approach to
development of UI okay but at the end of
the day the rendering is done in html5
using the webview technology of the
device business logic is written in Java
so part of the container is basically a
lightweight JVM that allows us to run
Java on both iOS and Android in the
container another thing that is inside
the container if you want to use it is
sequel ID for local data storage and
it's an encrypted sequel ID so you get
all the libraries for doing encryption
of your data so you have secure local
data storage so the main thing for Java
one confluence is the fact that when
you're writing code in ADF mobile you're
writing it in Java whether it's the code
to access your database then you're
watching JDBC if you if you want to
access the local database okay whether
it's the code behind a button in your
page okay when you click a button and
you want to do something it's going to
be Java if it's a just throwing objects
and data on the device and manipulating
those you write simple pojos and you use
them okay we have a lightweight JVM
basically a JVM without all the things
that are not needed when you're running
on this device so no UI libraries or
stuff like that okay the JVM itself is
compiled into a native library which
gives you very good performance okay
compare this to other hybrid solutions
so again most of the hybrid solutions
out there using the Java Script
- I told a logic now first of all
javascript wasn't meant to do massive
data manipulation and complex logic
JavaScript was meant to do Dom
manipulation in the JavaScript lands
inside the browser which needs to
interpret it and it's clicked for Mitton
and this is one of the complaints about
hybrid solution days that when you get
into serious systems that involve lot of
logic javascript is actually
slowing you down in our solution you
basically have a native library
basically running Java on the device
another thing that is important to note
is that in mobile application a lot of
field data is not actually on the device
you're getting it from remote servers
and we support you accessing remote
server both so soap and rest services
okay so you can choose how to expose
your data or services on servers and
just access them declaratively actually
from inside ADF mobile in terms of user
interface development we gave you a
device native user experience using
html5 so the components can basically if
you look over there that's the date
component on a on in iOS you'll
basically get the date controller for my
OS right and we give you things like
spring boards and navigation bar
navigation bar is the little bell here
that allows you to navigate between
features okay
the html5 support things like gestures
so you can do the swipe and associate
actions with it and again the logic for
the action of swipe would be written in
Java okay so when you swipe do this
right am just your support animation
things like that okay and we give you a
set of components to build your user
interface and beyond the regular button
and check box type of components we also
give you a lot of data visualization
components ready again you're building
applications for mobile generation
people like to who see things visually
will give you a bunch of data
visualization component so maybe I
should talk about components there are
three ways to build UI is in a DF mobile
the way that is kind of unique to us is
what we call a MX which stands for a DF
mobile XML and that's basically a set of
over 60 components now that you can use
to construct your page so you get like a
button and a checkbox and a boolean
selector in a tail or not at a list and
you also get layout components and
functioning components and these visual
components stuff like that and you
arrange them on a page kind of like what
you would do in a JSF
Oh in a swing environment or in a visual
basic environment right you take
components put them on the page get your
UI the components at runtime render in
html5 and JavaScript give you all the
capabilities you need so that's one
option
it's very declarative very easy that's
the way that's what I'm probably going
to show you today however if you feel
more comfortable writing html5 you can
also do that inside the area of mobile
we can basically like html5 JavaScript
bring in any library you want create
your user interface with html5 still get
access to the device services things
like that and we can also incorporate it
to the same application remote URL so
basically web sites or web URLs that you
can just bring into your application and
they can be part of your application in
fact inside the single application you
can have all three of those integrated
into a single application each one is a
different feature so if you look at the
phone on the right here you can think
about each one of the buttons at the at
the bottom can invoke a different type
of UI all of them inside the same menu
orientation same environment same
container right so and the thing that is
unique for us is the AMX component so
again the slide is a little outdated we
have now over 60 oh no it actually says
six two components so that's right and
what you build is you basically the
final page using the components in an
XML and structure again very similar to
how you would do it in JSF in terms of
concept and what we keep like an
emphasis on is basically giving you not
just source based development you can
also do visual developments actually see
how your UI looks like and make it
easier for you to build a user interface
we also make it very easy to take those
components and bind them into data okay
and into services from remote locations
another thing that is involved in the UI
is a controller layer ok so again if you
look at what a lot of the highbreed
developers out there that work with
javascript and html5
they're repeating the same mistake that
the Java ball did about ten years ago
where we did servlets and then jsps and
created spaghetti code which involved
both the UI and the logic in the same
file mixed up together okay but then the
ten eight years ago then suddenly there
was threats and then there was Jeff and
everyone basically realized you need to
move to an MVC architecture in order for
your code to be maintainable okay and
readable and more flexible also in terms
of making changes so we're not repeating
the same mistake we're basically saying
yeah there is a design pattern there is
the best practice out there called MVC
why not use it and we're using MVC
basically in our UI layout so you're
creating the page using components
that's your view layer and then we have
a controller behind it and the
controller is basically just like any
controller you're familiar with again
very similar to JSF in concept allowing
you to navigate from page to another
page but it's not just page navigation
it also allows you to invoke methods
it's also allowing you to invoke
decision point so it's not just a page
flow it's actually becoming the process
flow where you can say one page calls a
function and then based on the results
of the function I'll either go there or
another place all of this in a nice
diagram which actually translate into
XML code again very similar to JSF and
when you write code in those events Java
okay if you need a function there all
you need to invoke some logic you write
it in Java and another thing that was
challenging for the Java world you know
like until basically Java EE 6 was the
whole issue of yeah you create the UI
and you create the business services how
do you connect the two until CDI
basically appeared so we are the
solution that predates CDI by about 10
years called binding in ADF and we also
took it over to the world of radius
mobile and the situation is basically
you can take a simple Java class in an
ad of mobile say
created at a control out of it and then
you can drag it into a page and you
automatically get all the components
that bind to this Java class okay and
they automatically synchronize getting
the data updating the data all of this
is done for you and this is based on
metadata that we generate for each of
your Java objects when you want to and
then when you just drag it into a page
you get a bunch of things that you can
lock them as and it can drag a complete
collection or you can drag specific
items and it's kind of how to explain it
in slides so I prefer to show you that
part in a demo later okay
so just so you know I'm going to talk
about half an hour through slides and
then half an hour will actually show you
how to build an application and we have
data controls for simple Java classes
for web services okay
whether it's less tall soap and so you
can basically take your sources of data
and drag them into a page to represent
them visually another thing you want to
do in a mobile environment is actually
leverage the device right so you are
running on a device you might as well
take advantage of it so we expose a
bunch of functionality to the device for
you to leverage now underneath
everything will basically underneath the
this part of the architecture we're
using Apache Cordova to allow us to
access the device services but instead
of you having to write to the Apache
Cordova api's we packaged it in a nice
easy to you way to use fashion basically
the same concept of data control
exposing the functions that you need and
allowing you to drag and drop it into
the page so you need to send an SMS they
can drop it into the page you get a
button that sends SMS with two
parameters that you can pass to it you
take a picture needs to weigh the
contact things like that and it's
important to mention that I like the
visual development aspect I know some
developers kind of don't like it because
it's not real development doesn't matter
if the application at the end works but
so we also give you Java and JavaScript
API photos so if you want to actually
code this you can also
and in some cases you might need to code
it for example maybe you have a button
on your page and when you click on it
you need to do some calculation and all
sorts of validation and stuff like that
and then add the contact to your local
contacts storage so there's a Java API
that allows you to access the device
features from Java they all from
JavaScript if you're inside an html5
page that you're manually coding so
again it's very flexible in that sense
and we also introduced support for push
notifications so that's basically the
ability for a server to send events to
your mobile application on the device we
integrate there with both the Apple and
Google Android push servers allowing you
to push things directly into your
application on iOS we also have the
support for Beijing those the little
icons that I peel on your application
telling you okay you have a new
notification there things like that
security is kind of important in the
world of mobile simply because the fact
that a lot of people tend to lose their
mobile device or someone takes the
mobile device and if you're building an
enterprise application it means that you
have enterprise data possibly on your
device and you don't want unauthorized
people to have access to this
information so security is integrated
into ADF mobile basically once you get
it you can define application basically
a login into your application
authentication and we integrate with the
Oracle into a Identity Management but
you can basically just use any identity
management solution although all we need
is a web URL that prompts you for a
username and password and you can
authenticate against that one and and
that allows us to control who access the
application now in a mobile scenario one
thing that you might want to plan for is
scenarios where people want to use your
application even when they are
disconnected okay there's no mobile
reception they can't connect so how can
they actually
look in if they are not connected
because their repository a few cells and
password is on the server so we are able
it basically you are able to turn a flag
on your application that tells it
support also offline authentication okay
and this is time limited so you can say
for this long and then the first time
you connect you have to be on the
network so you connect validate against
the repository few cells ok and once you
have validated we stole your user
credentials on the device and then the
next time that you invoke the
application even if you are not
connected to the network
we can validate your username password
against the encrypted local credential
storage so this is offline
authentication again built-in in there
we also have support for single sign-on
across features again like features can
be accessing multiple URLs multiple
servers and we can do single sign-on
across them we have access control so
basically based on users and worlds we
can limit who sees what features in your
application what fields in your
application things like that and we also
support encryption so everything that
you communicate from the device to the
servers is encrypted your local data
storage in sequel it is encrypted your
local credential storage your user name
password combinations are also encrypted
so everything is basically secured out
of the box one focus that we have is
only usability so again in an enterprise
organization it's not a single developer
working on an application it's basically
extend developers working on the same
application and they need to cooperate
and what we support is a concept called
feature development so you can basically
develop a feature and then you can
collect multiple features and put them
inside a single application and this
allows you to break the work between
team members in your IT shop each one
working on what they want to do and then
you can basically bring all these
features into a nice springboard like
this and click on each one and invoke it
we also support a usability at the
application level so if you're an Ivy
you want to develop in a
vacation and then resell it for people
to then go and further customize it we
also allow you to do that basically you
create the application package it
encrypted they don't have access to the
extra source code but they can further
customize it later on so this is kind of
the last slide that I have for today
before we go into the demo and this is a
review of all the things we talked about
this is the actual architecture of a DFA
mobile so there are two sides to this
slide there's the server on this side
and there's the mobile device on that
side on the mobile device you have the
red box which is the container that runs
your application okay inside the
container there's at the top there
actually I can probably do it from here
at the top you have the view layer okay
using the web view technology on the
device and inside here you can show
local html5 that you have written or you
can show pages that are based on our
components and then you have a
controller for those pages okay
oh you can show remote server generated
HTML coming from some servers out there
nobody network you also have in the
container a Java Virtual Machine that
allows you to run your business logic
okay it also allows you to run jdbc the
taxes a encrypted sequel ID that comes
up out of your application also stored
on the device itself you also have
support for push notifications so we
have a push Handler get the push event
write logic in Java to in basically
understand what you got and then
influence the wife you need to if you
want to access device services there's
the code overlay inhale again with an
API that allows you to access it either
directly from the UI or from your
business logic in Java there's also a
configuration server as part of the
solution so and you create an
application but then based on the user
or the department that you sell it to
they need some specific configuration in
terms of which servers they are
accessing where is the authentication
being held
so this is our configuration server
there's the whole security aspect here
in
want and I think we basically covered
all the boxes in this diagram so that's
basically the idea of architecture mmm
and then having a framework is it's nice
but one thing that is also important for
us is that it would be easy to use the
framework because Java developers you
know there are a lot of frameworks out
there but in a lot of cases in the Java
world tooling for the framework comes as
the second citizen and good scenarios
they first build a framework and then
sometimes they build some tooling around
it now so we actually build a framework
with tooling immediately forward so I
will tooling right now is inside
JDeveloper which is Oracle's Java
development environment and and we use
JD puppet to do everything like Java
coding and SOA process modeling and
database development and database
modeling and web services in html5 and
whatever you and now we also use it to
do mobile and basically JDeveloper
itself integrates with the SDKs for the
platforms so inside JDeveloper now you
have a place where you say here is where
my android sdk is on my machine
oh here's where my iOS sdk all xcode is
and then from inside JDeveloper you can
click and use those as the case to
package your application for example you
can create an APK or IPA file that you
can then deploy sample form inside a
developer you can actually deploy
directly to an emulator or directly to a
device you can also do remote debugging
so run the application on the device
debug it inside JDeveloper you get the
visual development you get all them
known ways that development is done in
jail developer for people who are
already familiar with it terms of task
flows and component based and data
controls it's very similar again if
you're familiar with the rest of ADF not
the idea of mobile the development is
very similar in that sense which is good
because ADF is very easy to develop with
now one thing that we are also
considering right now and we have a
prototype if you're interested you can
go to the
Java one demo pod for this we have a
prototype of this development walking
inside the clips how many people here
would actually be interested in having
this in Eclipse I saw that yeah okay
Hey yeah so we have a prototype of this
basically walking also in Eclipse it's
something that is currently being
considered for do we want to make it
production or not so it's good to have
this feedback and it would basically be
the same type of experience maybe a
little less visual but all the rest of
the stuff would basically be the same
okay so let me show you how the
development actually works all right so
this is JDeveloper let's close the
previous application that I had here and
we'll start from scratch okay and let me
do something for the people in the chip
sit at the back
all right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a new application again
in JDeveloper you can create everything
from a desktop to a web applications you
have a application one option maven
application one option now is mobile
application okay so I'm going to say
create a mobile application give it a
name application one one two is the good
name give it a package name a is a good
name and then you click finish and
JDeveloper goes off and actually creates
two projects for you yeah do the zoom in
okay now to projects Hill one project is
the application controller this
basically is things you might want to
have at your application level so those
might contain things like initializing a
local storage okay so you write some
Java code to maybe read some web service
take the data store it in a local
database okay and the other project is
basically where you develop features
those are the UI specific features that
you want to use in your application so
I'm going to start from the view
controller and then you have one file
one XML file that is called ad FMF
feature which as the name might suggest
this is the repository for the features
that you define so let's define a new
feature first feature can be called help
okay and this is just a help page that I
want to have so each feature can have
things like a description life cycle
event listener so this is a piece of
Java code that will be invoked when at
the beginning of the life of this
feature and then of course images if you
want your application to look nice right
so like the image that will represent it
on the menu stuff like that you can also
have constraints so you can say a
specific feature is only available for
specific operating system specific
version specific does it have
accelerator does it have a camera based
on those constraint you can say this
feature is available one common thing
that you might want to do is there is a
difference between developing an
application for this right versus this
the size of the screen is not the same
right so you can actually build the same
you can build an application for both
devices the same application
but have specific features that are
designed for a loud screen versus other
features that are designed for a small
screen but then shall all the rest of
the logic between the two okay
so inside here you can for example
constraint specific feature based on the
resolution that you have for your screen
anyway there and then there are
preferences so you can actually define
your preferences that then go into the
preference box for your application and
security if you want to add security but
will do the simple thing we want to
define the content of this feature and
then you have three types of content
that you can have you remember what I
told you there are three types of you
eyes I del AMX pages local HTML remote
URL so the help system I can actually
just be a local HTML file let's create a
file we'll call it help dot HTML and
then it can go over and write your HTML
this is the help system I can't go
developer I'm not actually going to
develop a help system that's not my
responsibility and what you get there is
it this is just a visual representation
of the HTML so always in JDeveloper just
so you know there's a view which is
graphical and the source and they are
basically the same okay so if you change
something in the code it will be
reflected in there anyway so this is an
HTML feature again you can bring into
here a JavaScript liability do anything
you want this HTML can access device
features if you want to through
JavaScript API so that's fine that's not
very interesting for us we're more
interested in building another feature
we'll call it the EM preacher okay which
will be based on the AMX technology so
we're going to use our components to
build the page and you can decide
whether you want to have a single page
or whether you have if you want to have
a task flow basically a page flow so
let's do a page flow we will call this
flow the amp flow okay then you go
taking into the diagram where you can
basically design you
take pages and you connect them with
lines call this navigation graph this is
very similar again if anyone who did
just there for stats or stuff like
that's the same thing this will give you
a go navigation and then again by the
way you can also put here a method call
so you can call a method or you can put
in a doubter so basically based on a
value you decide where to go right we'll
keep it simple without those two and
when you define this navigation by the
way you're just defining things in XML
again very similar to JSF you can also
see this in a nice overview type of
navigation so things between those or if
you prefer show it in the diagram and
then you can name each page so we'll
call this page amp called this page and
what we call it here camera and call
this page right and then you double
click on a page to actually create it
and when you click to create it you can
control the default template for the
page you can have header footer stuff
like that and then click OK and then you
get the code for the page again if
you're more like me and you understand
things better when you see it visually
you can also have it visually and it's
basically it's connected so if I go to
this command button over here I have
properties over here that I can set so
this button can say graph ok and then I
can define the navigation it would go
and do the graph navigation based on my
page flow ok and the second button ok
for those of you more text inclined okay
you get code inside you say tech stick
well and I know go OK and then you have
the second button which would say go
you'll probably want to also set ad
action for this one go ok so this is how
you design your page again using
components and again in terms of
components we also have layout
components so let's use the panel
splitter ok bring it into the page over
here on the left you have your
structural pain basically showing you
the structure of the page and you can
see the components and access them
the phone here and this stage actually
needs some data in my page so let's
write some code to have some data so I'm
going to create a new Java class call it
amp because the temples that represent
an employee want to go you with actually
writing the code so I have a code
template this is basically just a POJO
defining like few variables ghetto
setters and initialize a constructor
thing okay you can see the metal thing
yeah so this is my object and now let's
create a service class so we'll call it
the empty class again no need to go you
with writing this all this does
basically format this is is create an
array of employees giving them some data
just to show you this is the live demo
give me a number
full right so you'll see the data is so
this is my this is just a class that
basically gets data now instead of
having like how to coded values here I
can write JDBC the tax as a local
database fetches data I can write Java
class that reads information for my rest
service put it into an array you can
imagine all the possibilities that and
then in order for me to actually connect
this to the UI I'm going to do something
which is again unique to ADF that's the
ability to go to a Java class and
right-click on it and say create data
control now the Java class itself didn't
change a bit ok nothing here has been
added what I created was a definition in
a file that says there is this Java
class that I want to use in my user
interface and as a result now in this
area of the page there's the empty data
control Lodge this okay that defines the
structure of the class there is an array
there with those attributes and there
are methods and operations that I can
invoke and now that I have this employee
data source that
and put it in my page okay so I can take
the employee for example and drag and
drop it into this part of the page let's
say is foam okay and it can be a
read-only foam or an updatable foam
let's do an applicable foam I want all
the fields I can remove fields and
fields based on what minute and then I
have those in my UI okay and you can see
over here I've been basically using a
bunch of input text there's the date
there so there's also an input date
component that I'm using to represent
the hire date of the employee or
whatever it is
and by the way the UI that you're seeing
right now this is how it would look on a
low resolution Android you can switch it
to see how it would look on an iPad Mini
okay and then you'll see oh you actually
won't see it now but there is also a
section of the page in the panel
splitter called the navigator so let's
take the same business service the
employee into the navigator this time
we'll drop it as list view so let's view
this is something that you should be
very familiar with it's those multiple
records it's a contact list stuff like
that
so let's get a contact list with
breaking the okay and we'll show the
name of the people and break it by the
first letter of the name and this would
be kind of on the left side so I have a
list here and over here I have the
actual data that I can update so this is
how I design a basic page and then we
said we have a button called graph one
we click on it we go over to the graph
page let's do a graph page how do you
create graphs in mobile devices
basically the same way I just created
this page you split this one into
preview and then you drag the same
employee drop it into the page but this
time you chose to drop it as a child
okay let's do a bar graph and there are
multiple types of graphs here and
combined and babble and stuff like that
an alien will do it because that's
probably the simplest and we put salary
on one axis and put the name on the
other axis and that's my bail and the
graph like any of our components also
has a bunch of properties that you can
set so you can say I want to have
animation on display let's do alpha fade
animation so
goes next version will add sound effects
with which we'll see alright and what
else can you do I can add titles and
stuff like that and there's let's do
selection behave let's do all of our
behavior dim dim the other stuff or
stuff so a bunch of properties that you
can set for which component and then on
this page also have a button that I want
it to navigate back to the previous page
so we'll call it back ok and have a
navigation called back now notice that I
didn't need to define the back
navigation in my page flow because this
is a mobile environment there's always
be ability to go back so we give you
such a navigation by default for which
page to go to where you came from
ok and now let's create the third page
in our application the Camilla page
guess what I'm going to do here
so well here I want to have integration
with the Camelot right how do I do this
same way that I did integration with the
employees if you look up here I also
have device features ok and under the
device features you can see should
probably move my mouse before you do
this this would be clear and the device
feature you can see things like let's
create a local contact in our contact
repository oh let's say remove contact
or send an email or set location monitor
basically getting my GPS location stuff
like that send an email or stuff like
that we want to take a picture so let's
do the get picture method ok and just
drag it into the page and I can
basically drag it as a parameter foam or
just as the button of a link let's do a
button ok and then there's a bunch of
parameters that you pass to it things
like the quality of the picture and
where am I getting it from and do I
allow edit actually let's do - and do I
want to do encoding type the one that's
the type of file size of picture let's
do 200 by 200 those by the way have an
impact on how much storage your
application is going to take right cause
if you are taking
bigpictures with high quality we're
going to need small space on your
diversa
take those into account and then you
just get a button that basically invokes
it and if you like to change the title
of the button you can say take picture
take pick something like that so this is
this button again we want the back
button so we'll have back and we'll do
navigation save everything
let's our application so this is how you
build an application what you saw so far
is designing you eyes building
controller accessing Java code accessing
device features everything so far that's
it so far by the way you didn't care
whether this is going to iOS or Android
the first thing that you're going to
kill is when you're going to say I want
to deploy this application ok and we
have we have a default deployment
profile for iOS and I know you can
create your own new one and then you can
decide basically where are you targeting
this application to be it ok Android or
iOS the other option is idea of mobile
application archive again this is if you
want to create an application that you
give to other people to then enhance ok
so I'm going to deploy to an Android
before cuz oh ok was too cheap to buy me
a Mac alright so um you can define
images so the icons and stuff like that
you can define whether you want to
deploy in debug mode Oh bellissimo debug
mode will allow you to set breakpoints
and debug into your Java code I'm pretty
sure that my code should work so I'm
going to deploy it in release mode and
then all I need to do is right-click and
say deploy the application and then I
have three options either you deploy it
to a device so if you have a device
connected with a USB cable you can
deploy it directly to the device Oh to
an emulator the emulator that comes with
Android or the emulator that comes with
iOS or deploy it as a package basically
create an API APK file or IP a file I'm
going to deploy to the device click Next
and finish and so let's see problem here
ok
yeah so it's basically going and
deploying it while you're deploying it
just so I want to blow you it's kind of
like a cooking show I will show you some
click and quakes that I made all right
now I'll actually show you this
application in a second but I wanted
because of the application I currently
create is not that impressive and I'm
going to show you some applications that
are a little bit more visual let's look
at the summit application mmm and again
what you have here that's basically a DF
mobile you can see the interaction in
terms of schooling with your finger
pretty close to native there's a map on
the left that's one of the component we
provide it's called a thematic map and
on the map you can actually overlay
pieces of information okay so things
like how many deals I head what's the
trend in each region what's the most
popular product I sell in each region
the scenario basically is I'm a supplier
of sports equipment and those are my
customers around the world and this is
what they are buying and then you can
also select areas in the map okay so I
selected Africa and get the customers in
that area right so if I select Asia I
get the customers in Asia now if I
select the North America I get customers
in North America well is most of my yes
on the bottom you can see some gauge
component another component that we
provide as well as a graph component a
child component showing you pies and
stuff like that right and you you can
actually hover with your fingers and see
the pie at the bottom you have those way
icons this is my navigation bar where I
can actually click to go to another
feature I should get an error message
now because I'm not connected to the
network so as expected and here's
another view of my customers again this
is the list where I can actually
collapse letters ok and when I click on
a customer I can get the list of orders
they had on the right side aspect and
then the third feature shows me some of
the information about all those that
people put in pretty much the same em by
the way yeah
see that if I go into this mode the list
on the right automatically collapses so
this is the component we have this is
the splitter it does it automatically
for you so he can expand and collapse it
went adjust to your UI resolution okay
so this is one type of application and
can show you also the this application
dinah to help you do like this too much
so again like let's say expense app or
below like manager tasks you get a list
of those and you can approve something
in terms of expenses and you can see
some analytics of your employee data
showed in various charts and graphs and
you can click on those and highlight
those so this is the type of UI you can
build right so this is just an example
of the types of you is that you can
build let me show you what we just built
so I need to take this hook it up here
okay you can see that my you can see
that my deployment finished so I have an
application now on my device so let me
show can you see everyone yeah I don't
have the VGA connector for this but
there is a nice Java utility that is
called a droid to screen highly
recommend this little thing when it
works
oh yeah so we you see I'm not used to
coding everything is visual for me all
right um tada okay everyone go like this
yeah am i return it around the
orientation okay um now if I look under
my application I created which my
application was 112 okay so I have
application 112 there
okay let's invoke it okay so get a nice
splash screen now the first invocation
of the application we actually do some
file copying so it's going to be a
little slower than the next invocation
but that's basically the application we
just built and there's also a delay
between Hill and what you're single so
let me zoom out so you'll see the full
screen right so this is our the help
system remember the first feature was
static HTML that's the help one you can
see here and if I click on the button
next to it okay I'm going into my actual
AMX page so this is where I'm looking at
details about employees now this is the
view in this mode and there's this list
over here on the right side that I can
expand and collapse if I actually go
into this mode okay and I switch it this
mode
okay now the list is on my right let me
go up this and you can actually scroll
the list over here okay and you get the
data on the right and by the way if
there's the date here and you click on
it you'll get the native date format or
date controller for this involvement
where you can choose a different date
and set it okay and then you can click
on the graph tab and you'll go into the
next page which has the nice graph I
already see it here
and you can actually hover with your
finger on things and get a little pop-up
okay and then you can click back to go
to the first page then you can click on
the Go button which takes you to the
third page which has a button called
take picture and if you click the button
and you tell everyone smile okay
take a picture and that's it you're now
officially part of an Oracle demo right
so that's kind of what ideas Mobile is
all about okay as you can see pretty
easy to develop application access that
show it visually access device features
things like that
to summarize radius mobile basically
gives you the ability to take your java
skills whether it's your language skills
all the skills you already know in terms
of MVC component based design all of
these things debugging and basically
bring it into the world of ios and
android development it obstructs you
from a lot of the complexity of building
a native application of accessing device
features giving you an easier way to
develop if you want to learn more you
can go to a local coms dot mobile at
slash mobile we have tutorials you can
download the JDeveloper and the
extension for free test it out on your
own if you want to see more or ask more
questions we have demo both both here at
JavaOne go to the ADF demo booth over
there any can ask questions or you can
come over to open world we have another
demo booth over there in terms of time
how we doing on time we have five more
minutes any questions yes so this is JT
op 11 one to four which has the mobile
expansion we're working on the extension
for the new LG developer 12c should come
out soon yes
and I'm not sure if there is one right
now it might be something that coming
next yes in terms of JavaScript
abilities yes in terms of Java libraries
yes as long as it did come it compile it
compiles with a dedicated with using
queue which is actually JDK and it comes
with a j2me right now so it's one good
for will planning to go to JDK 8 when it
when it will be released right I see
people are also already living so that's
really this way I let everyone leave get
your coffee if you have any questions
just come by and I'll answer them thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
