by one of our favorite cult films the
original matrix film and in the scene
Keanu Reeves dodges a bullet with this
this amazing the behind-the-scenes shows
the business amazing rig they did with
DSLR cameras and green screens and a
whole cool setup to grab images from 40
different cameras around the actor so
the way we were building this both on
video ring demonstration is we have some
custom parts so it's used a standard
raspberry pie and a raspberry pie camera
to capture the footage but we designed
this to fit on the lighting truck so
it's really easy to mount and then we
have beam sensors attached so they can
tell what water the cameras in weather
communicating the videos and all these
parts there were 3d printed so we did
the designs and then 3d printed the
parts and the simple tone and it's a
it's a cool project for integrating
cloud technologies which are going to do
all the processing of the back end
images with physical devices things that
you can manipulate in touch so we're
gonna have 60 of these on a lighting
ring take each taking one photo in rapid
succession and creating a cool
slow-motion multi angle video footage
which can be shared on social media you
know so hopefully you guys get to see
some of the output video from our matrix
or a full time video ring and you know
to share and enjoy on social media</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
