Atlanta I'm Bob brew Bart with the
Oracle technology Network and I'm here
with Mark cabbage and ched are more you
guys delivered the keynote address this
morning tell me what you talked about
sure uh well we did talk about where we
are with microcircuits where we're going
with serverless a little bit about
docker containers but excitingly we
preface that with a computer archeology
lesson starting in 1995 all right and
where are we with my cursor versus well
where we're at is we kind of
prescriptively described what we think
about build test deploy operate we
talked about docker we talked about
worker foresee ICD we talked about
kubernetes for operations we talked
about service message and we talked
about serverless so kid you can't just
sit there you know looking good you got
to talk I talked about shipping
containers from the 1940s which that was
awesome yeah it was cool I talked about
docker as the container technology I
also talked about kubernetes I got to do
live demos on stage which was pretty
nerve-racking you can't see that on the
camera but it's going like this and I
also talked about serverless computing
which is something I care about very
much I think the real the real thing
we're trying to get across is
everybody's building micro services
what's the micro service the micro
service is a distributed system it turns
out that actually that's hard and I
think we're sort of at the point
wherever he's accepted like you know
sort of like the seven stages of grief
River people went through denial where
no no we're not actually building micro
services we're not actually building
service technologies we're not actually
using docker like we're past all that so
now where we're at I think is almost
everybody out there admits it in some
part of the organization they're going
to build a micro services based
application like across the board so
that's a given I think at this point in
2017 we've decided we are going to use
stalker
so docker is the way that we're going to
standardize on building and deploying
portable software and it does solve
major problems for us that we have had
for a long time which is worked on my
laptop didn't work in production right
so docker is the the
fundamental technology we use to sort of
encapsulate our application and ship it
from laptop through testing to
production as part of you know this
overall message and we are building a
cloud native micro server
I love the wind chime behind us could
could somebody hit the person with the
Tinker Bell's please sweets we live
right so we're so everybody's building
cloud native applications everybody's
building micro services you're going to
probably use containers to do that
you're going to use docker for you have
a sort of problem then which is as you
build micro services you have to break
up your organization into small teams
that kind of mirror your applications
apology and this is what people is we've
all accepted this is what we're doing
you have real problems I think in terms
of how to manage your development
lifecycle how to manage API contract
testing etc of micro services and this
is where we you know sort of prescribed
worker is the right answer an
acquisition we just announced Oracle
worker is the is a fundamental
application you should use to
standardize your build process
standardize your test process
standardize your deployment process
because it takes a very container native
approach to solving the problems that
you have with many teams building
containerized micro services kubernetes
is the right answer that you're going to
deploy to so we are now at the point
where we've sort of all agreed that
kubernetes are the fundamental substrate
we should use to deploy micro services
to that gives us a nice fabric on which
you can sort of reason about building
things that handle failover scalability
auto scaling that kind of stuff and even
prescribing some level of micro service
architecture to you if you dictates a
lot of things so you know to keep
recapping where are we at with micro
services you are building micro services
you're going to use docker to
containerize you should use worker to do
CI CD you should use kubernetes to use
as your operational substrate and then
you sort of end up in this sort of mode
where you know these kind of take care
of some of the non-functional things and
we're now the new challenges have arisen
is well what's my real priority model
and how do I reason about what I should
build an application and we kind of
presented two possible choices one is
sort of taking this service mesh
approach on top of kubernetes which is
something like link or D
and the other is serverless and really
this is where we kind of jumped in you
know are a little bit flippantly a
second ago with what chad was talking
about which is we're we're pretty long
on the server list approach we gave a
quick preview so we're not quite there
yet of what we'll be releasing later
this year but we're we're really quite
excited about what's going to be coming
around to the functions of service life
service environment to really I think
take the complexity of micro services I
guess off the table a little bit such as
people can go back to building you know
sort of business out logic as a core so
I don't you everything bad or well I
brought the talk home by showing demo
where you take three services and it
does facial detection of images that I
pulled live on stage from Flickr running
it through an adult filter to make sure
it is all kosher to show on stage and it
actually takes images and runs them
through this pipeline which is both
tested pushed to an artifact registry
and then deployed all through worker and
so I showed the interface it takes the
services it tests the contract between
them it does unit testing and functional
testing builds the docker image pushes
it and then puts it on topic kubernetes
to run as a service and then we did a
little sneak peek of a server list
solution that we're working on here
which actually is the programming model
that mark was talking about that's an
alternative to sort of don't worry about
all that stuff don't think about servers
don't think about the infrastructure
don't even think about really containers
and kubernetes and just write code and
ship it and it'll automatically scale
and give you all the nice and trinsic
value of having a true scalable cloud
solution by the same now mark you
mentioned a possible announcement coming
in your future could that be coming at
say open world uh you know one would
hypothetically imagine that might be a
convenient time we would add some stuff
so I won't commit to it at this juncture
I can't possibly be on camera saying
you'll absolutely have it on that day
but you know you know what you might
want to stay tuned that that might be a
good idea stay tuned is good advice yeah
so what's next for you gentlemen will
you be presenting something like this at
other events I well I I think it's to be
determined I think our we're sort of I
think going back into bunker mode where
we're probably going to stay a little
bit quiet on a bunch of these things
we're talking about
until open-world I think there are a few
announcements we're looking at lining up
throughout the summer leading up to it
but they won't be at the same scale I
think if either you know kind of the
this sort of preview if you will and
just kind of probably think about
micro-services in AI wanted me to be
flippant and it is hopeful all right
good you know it's just sort of the
preview of like we'll look you're you're
going to build a micro service based
architecture that's that's that's a
foregone conclusion here's sort of our
prescriptive like stance on how we think
about it in the year 2017 then we're
doing a lot in the cloud service space
now to get ready for sort of the end of
the year timeframe there will be some
announcements along the way I think will
be you know dialing up a bit more in the
fall so and where can the millions of
people watching this video get more
information about this certainly you
should go to developers that are calm
that'd be a great place to go look or
you know the general Oracle cloud comm
cloud.oracle.com sorry
yeah all right and that's good advice if
you visit developer that oracle.com
slash code you'll find more information
about the Oracle code series of events
there's several still on the calendar
and you'll also find cool information
for developers about micro services and
other hot topics for the Oracle
technology Network I'm Bob brew Bart
thanks for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
