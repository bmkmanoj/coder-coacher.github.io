fast and easy.
After logging into the My Services Dashboard,
click Create Instance and choose Java.
On the Quick Start page, choose from one of
the available templates.
Need a basic Java EE environment for developing,
testing or prototyping?
Choose the Simple Java Web App template.
You’ll get a new Java Cloud Service instance
that contains a single node running WebLogic
Server and on which you can deploy your applications.
This WebLogic Server will also be connected
to a new Database Cloud Service instance that
contains a single node running Oracle Database.
Keep in mind that you can always use Oracle
Cloud to quickly scale up these nodes, if
your capacity requirements change later.
Want something more robust for business-critical,
production applications?
Then pick the Multi-Tier Java App with High
Availability template.
This template provisions a cluster of two
WebLogic nodes.
Clients access your apps via a load balancer
node, which transparently distributes traffic
across the application tier.
You’ll also get a larger initial database
capacity as well.
Finally, for applications that need maximum
availability and extreme performance, consider
the Highly Available Java EE App with Caching
template.
You’ll get an even larger database to start
with, as well as an Oracle Coherence node.
By using a Coherence in-memory data grid,
your apps will scale more predictably by gaining
fast access to frequently used data.
Java Cloud Service also enables you to easily
scale out this caching tier at a later time.
If none of these templates meets your precise
requirements, or if you already have a database
deployment, you can create a custom instance
instead and have more control over the initial
topology, capacity and configuration.
Let’s use the Simple Web App quick start
template.
Give your new instance a name and click Create.
Download an archive file containing the generated
private key, which is necessary for using
SSH to access any of the created nodes.
This archive also contains the credentials
you’ll need to later administer the database,
WebLogic Server or the load balancer.
Your new database and Java service instances
are being provisioned and you can periodically
check their status.
Now you’re ready to build and deploy Java
EE applications in Oracle Cloud.
Thanks for watching.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
