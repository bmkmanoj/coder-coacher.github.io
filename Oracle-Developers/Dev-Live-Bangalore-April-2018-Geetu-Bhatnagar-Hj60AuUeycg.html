from Oracle code in Bangalore and I'm
here with key to button under from
actually from Oracle absolutely and
thank you very much for coming by
we had a really interesting conversation
last night actually over dinner about
women in technology yes and so I wanted
you to come over here today so we can we
can actually have a conversation with
everybody you're at Oracle you've been
involved with women and Technology
issues for many years now so can you
give us a summary of what the state is
here in India in terms of young women
that grow it into the technology fields
as I look around here and I can actually
see a lot of a lot of young women so if
you look at here today do we have 700
delegates and 60 women so that's the
kind of ratio so 61 60 women so far so
how I see it I've been involved in India
IT tech industry for about two decades
plus and the ratio that I have seen that
you know women the pipeline for female
engineering talent is robust you know
the education system is working towards
it but the vanillin IT leaves the
workforce at an alarming rate so if you
see women in the boardroom it's still
next to nil very few women as managers
is not even 40 percent of the workforce
women as holders of course it it comes
down further down so women in technology
element is definitely a focus that we
need to work upon yes
so you've also mentioned some government
policies that are helping to change this
and he's a very big country you also
mentioned there are distinctions between
south and north yes and so talk a little
bit about the politics and the
government your policies here so we have
a new prime minister who's really
focused on the girl education and rights
so he's in fact launched a program
called beti bachao beti per hour which
is basically promoting the girl child
education and he's even launched
initiatives like making India digital
India startup India and stand up India
and all those elements of initiative's
have a women aspect because the court
believes that he C has his that women
can change and impact the country in a
very big way and the logic for that is
there is Amitabh Khan's who's the CEO of
meaty IO
Media Oak is like the Planning
Commission of India and he feels that 10
to 11 percent would be the economic rise
if women are included in the economic
change so that's why let's say there are
4,400 startups that got registered in
the last one year and one in 10 of those
startups were women start of
enterpreneurs right so that's the
promotion that the government is doing
okay so you were also talking about
there are a couple of markets that are
sort of more welcoming of women in
technology so I want to talk about that
and also this concept of as technology
changes okay the skills needed to
develop the technology changes and women
might be really well suited for that
that's a very good point that you
brought up you know that's my personal
belief if you look at the industrial era
which was the earlier hard core skills
of power and control and authority were
needed which which came more naturally
to men but if you see the product today
is the people and the people element and
the interpersonal skills the culture of
innovation
creativity and productivity and
multitasking comes more naturally to
women so that's where I personally
believe that in this information era
women can be more impactful as
developers as managers as Bodrum
representatives clearly interesting so
some of those skills that you know are
more conducive to women but you also
said this the banking industry and the
these are very conservative industries
they're very you know you you know you
can't make mistakes so you have to be
sort of conservative with your
technology choices why the distinction I
personally feel if you look at banking
and information technology industry I
test artificial intelligence in chat
port and you know the robotic element is
coming very is getting very easily
adaptable in these industries and the
soft skills of values are needed you
know to interpret the data live with the
data and get the value element in which
comes more naturally to women that's why
they're bringing them into leadership
roles in these industries so how early
do young women basically girls and these
are kids in junior high school so how
early are they starting in other words
if if these girls are getting more
involved in technology when is the
earliest the trend that we see in India
if you look at the large metropolitan
cities which have to bandwidth in the
broadband availability as low as grade
six to eight which is kids from 10 to 12
to 13 years getting into programming and
coding because they have the
availability and then if you look at the
large stem schools in India and IITs and
disease if you look at the data point we
have about twenty five to thirty to
forty percent women or getting into yes
I have a data when NASSCOM said that
tech companies had thirty four percent
women so STEM jobs attract women but may
men get to managerial roles in six years
women
get to managerial roles in eight years
and after eight years 50% of the women
quits the tech job 50% of the women
quits the job and they quit it for
societal and cultural reasons so but in
terms of girls education and in stem I
see metropolitan cities getting to 10 to
12 years but raw leads
18 to 21 years when you see the women
really getting involved in engineering
and dollar so but still 50% I mean so
how how recent has some of these changes
actually taking place but I'd earlier if
you look at two to three decades earlier
the representation of women even in
engineering colleges and of course then
to the workforce was less than 10% so
Bangalore seems to be the center of this
trend here the South Indian government's
I would call it so state of Karnataka
state of Kerala state of Andhra Pradesh
and Tamil Nadu these states have taken a
concerted focus to develop the girl
talent in technology now you read Oracle
now but you have actually been involved
in this issue for many years before you
got to Oracle as well right yes I've
worked with Microsoft before this and HP
before that and have been very
passionate about the DNI initiative
because if you look at the sea suit even
in the IT companies in India it's barely
seven percent women representation it's
growing and that's good
I have a daughter right now I want her
involved nice things as well so that's
growing do you have any other
interesting statistics that we need to
talk about no I think I was looking at
one of the hacker earth data which talks
about women encode especially and as for
them the powerhouse of programmers is 3
million with three million coders out of
which 25 percent are women okay I think
which is the fabulous data base actually
Wow if we can promote the women coders
promote the culture and you know the
policies in organized
relations to retain women talent and
grow women talent and bring them to the
boardrooms
I think they the impact on society is
gonna be very very large because as I
said women are wired to be creative and
innovative and that's what we need in
the business today right super now you
are the director of marketing for all of
a Mia yes so you have other functions as
well as not just this issue right yes
absolutely okay I handle the entire
marketing across segments and across all
product portfolios okay great okay thank
you very much for coming by
appreciate it and enjoy the conference
thank you thank you for having me Ola
appreciate it
yeah okay thank you very much everybody
and we believe we talking to you very
soon thank you bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
