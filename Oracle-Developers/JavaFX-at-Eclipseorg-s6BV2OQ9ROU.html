lead of the ethics clips project it does
all the tooling integration for java of
X at the clips and additionally we don't
only provide tooling we also provide
around 10 platform I gave tutorial
yesterday morning how you can make use
of the Eclipse for and template for
these are both I'm Eclipse committer at
various Eclipse project eclipse for the
platform as you know it as the IDE as
the Eclipse platform project has been
the first non IBM employee getting
commit rights to the clips petrol
approximately ten years ago around that
I'm a committed at EMF they close
modeling framework and I'm project
leader ethics clubs you want to follow
what I'm doing in my my job then just
subscribe to my twitter handle or to my
blog where i publish all information
about what I'm up to with JavaFX and
eclipse development in general so Java
backs up eclipse the first and biggest
thing that you're looking at is ethics
clubs which is the project I'm bleeding
so when we look at that excludes is
already sad it has two faces the first
one is tooling which provides you
tooling to develop javafx applications
and the second and very important part
for me as well is the ranch on platform
which provides you a platform that you
can write business-critical applications
on top of industrial proven platform
like eclipse for which is used million
times a day by many developers on the
river because they running the Eclipse
IDE and the foundation of our runtime
platform is exactly eclipse for the same
that empowers your Eclipse IDE let's
first look at the tooling coin or
tooling side of the coin so if these
clips of the tooling platform has
specialized editors for all child of X
artifacts that you have you normally
build up a chav effects application
using CS
s so you need an intelligent tss
literature and I think we have the most
intelligent one because it has notion
about the context file the completion so
it will not present you all the time all
charm of X properties it knows you're
feeling a button so it will only show
you that the CSS properties that apply
to a button so we will see that in the
demo that I'm doing the second thing
that you need is you need an ethics in
the literature an editor that feels like
a job editor but allows you to add it
this decorative language f XML an F XML
the default XML tooling that they get on
the world cannot help you there because
F XML has no DDT or schema it's endless
because you can construct new controls
and we should not be part of the default
schema that would be provided by Oracle
and last you need it support inside your
java editor you need to board to show
the Javadoc you need to board to browse
to the sources you need to have a wizard
which allows you to generate javafx
property pins so all this is provided by
F is klippstein it might sound silly
that I right here that Java doc but
there is a thing about the ethics clip
that the the job of X people are lazy
they don't put javadoc on any method
it's a special flag that they set to the
javadoc tool which will copy information
from a private property to all the
getters and setters so this is an IDE
has to understand this better as you
cannot provide your Java doc information
unless it goes out to the HTML file okay
so those are the standard tools but they
have some additional non-standard
tooling in our environment the first
thing is a small dsl language which is
named ethics graph which has a
JavaScript object notation like format
and it's a replacement for f xml so
instead of using
xml the decoratively define your you are
you can use this JavaScript object like
format ethics graph there is something
very special we have an F XML to chopper
converter which is very important if
you're targeting something like a
raspberry pi because when you load a
fixed amount of drunk time everything
has to be done using reflection and
reflection is not that fast that we had
the compiled class file so what we have
is we have an X F XML the Java converter
which you can plug into your build
system and its runtime you don't use
reflection to load F XML files but you
simply load the Java class file and
there's a third very important thing
that we have we have a language called
CSS X which is a language we use to
define meta information about CSS and we
make use of this meta information then
we provide your context and out the
completion our CSS editor and the nice
thing is you can ship such a file with
your library and our tooling will detect
it and add out the completion to the CSS
editor for example ok let's look how the
tooling Brooks I cannot make the left
hand side bigger but the editor font is
increased I hope you can all see it so
what we have we have some wizards in
here to create a job of X project my
project can we control through until
last page where it allows you to select
whether you want to have a desk it about
a mobile application and if you want to
use some decorative language to define
the UI you do that oh no sorry
so now have a Java FX project and if i
open the f xml file is that big enough
for you to see it in the back or should
I increase the font still increase the
font parents cars and phones text formed
so 24 ply good enough still yeah okay
good so we now see an F xml file and we
can use the first thing that we notice
is if you hover over border pain we see
the javadoc of the real chalice beyond
it that's the same information that we
get from gdt if you would use a border
pain in your ordinary chava cut natural
if you have out the completion for the
stuff in here so you see here that it
provides you all information I kind of
make the fund in this drop downs bigger
I'm sorry so next fitting it does
provide me with button and naturally we
have out the completion for fields like
hello world now this is pouring in the
end it's not very special the nice thing
is that we have something they call a
live preview of f xml file so when we
open this guy you see on the lower hand
you see the live information that a half
on the top whenever I make a change the
text well I'll be increase the font size
in a minute down here whenever I make a
change we showed this preview to you so
you can immediately see how your
resulting you I would look like and you
use the tooling which is a very nice
feature if you're not using same builder
for what you see what you see is what
they get editing you have an text editor
which shows you a live preview of your
application of your result in you I okay
so let me do job of X development what
we have normally we have in CSS file
attached to
so the ad this year's s file it's
already generates for us and called
applications of CSS and if you now open
the CSS literature recap for example a
DAT button class and if you hover it you
already see the first information we
know that this is a button class which
is styling a button and that's why when
we go here and to a control space we
only show you the CSS properties that
applied your button selector because
there would be hundreds of properties
for javafx and the only select those who
really apply to a button in our case you
want to have a font size font size and
out the complete it knows the font size
is of a double or it percentage OEM
value let's make 20 out of it and I save
it and now watch to the life review down
there 50 itta matically applies to CSS
that i have attached so i can have full
editing support from a CSS editor to the
live preview with matt fixham alpha ok
then let's add a library there's a
special library that we have at the
clips we have some additional layout
pains which are direct deported if you
have a used SWT you probably know the
grid layout and the row layout and form
layout and the fill layout so we have
job of exports of those layouts for
example the grid layout is the one
that's most used most often in stt
applications so edit this guide to my
system then I add it to my bill path
come on Ron click build path and now
what's very interesting if I use the
grid layout pane select you down here
control space it knows about some
special properties
5x oh no I have to reopen it it's not
life so I hope now it's working f x no
it's not working so the stuff that i
want to show you it what to show you is
that now the outer completion put
provide you special support for stuff
let's very special to the layout pane so
did would show who should have shown me
something like ethics columns or ethics
columns equal wife syntax that's not
working I don't know yet why because in
the demo that I prepared it worked so
that's something many do a live demo
things sometimes broken I'm sorry okay
so that's it for the default tooling
let's see Oh what we have what already
set is when you make it javafx pain make
a sample pin and let's say we have a
private boolean property be new simple
boolean property what we have is if it
controlled three we have support to
generate javafx getters and setters of
itself select it and it will generate
the JavaFX beam pattern for you so it
will generate is B method as set beam
effort and an accessor for the B
property for you this is a wizard if
you're writing Java vex pins it really
saves you a lot of time of typing
because it simply generates all those
informations for you now okay so
probably some more features of the XML
editor if you have now this editor and
we want to connect on action to our
controller then we add
hello and now the system already tells
you oh there's a problem it expects
inside my controller and method named
hello but it cannot find this method so
and I go to the controller there is no
method named like this tooling connect
the deck that it provides me out the
correction support so bring it up and it
has entered a hello method inside my
controller class it even allows me to
navigate from there to tear so full
navigation support even into the java
source code of everything so the tooling
is completely integrated it really
integrates completely into the gdt stool
suite from start to end okay the last
thing when you have written your
complete javafx application what you
want to do is you want to package it up
and to package up your java of x
application you can use the Java of X or
Java packaging tool suite and we have a
special editor I once more here I cannot
make the font bigger so best solution d
hello application version is wondered oh
then the main application class is main
and the packaging type is chopped FX and
the packaging format is all that's it
I'm done and now I can't generate not
only generate but you run the java
packager and because i'm running on an
OS 10 system it will create a dmg
package and b ki g package i think so
you sell see it packaged up much other
public application and not only takes it
my java application it creates a
launcher a native launcher it packages
up the GRE which allows me to take and
push my application to someone who has
not installed java on his system it even
allows me to push it
the appstore of apple for example so
this is possible using it's not written
by the ethics klippstein but we provide
you a nice editor front end that allows
you to configure the java packaging tool
suite so out of the end of build is done
and in deploy you now snotting deploy
well it's in deploy you see my dmg
package and my wiki be key cheap package
okay that's it for the standard tooling
side of the story let's get back to the
slides
so now back to the very important part
of run times and the first thing that
you can do at the moment you have ethics
clips in your system you can make use of
it inside your IDE or inside the Eclipse
for example if you are writing a clip
Eclipse plug-in you can embed javafx
into an eclipse view and present
information you saw this you saw me
doing this with the life editor I've
preview so the live preview is nothing
more than embedding javafx inside the
Eclipse IDE and this is something that
you get for free as well if you're using
f it clips or have f it clips installed
on your system so you can make use of
our stuff inside your own bundles and I
did that well how can you make use of it
for example if you want to reuse our
javafx preview all you have to do for
example in lecture make it a dap table
to an if' xml provider and if the editor
is active it will show a preview of the
information in the FX and uh preview so
it's nothing special to our tool you can
make use of it in your own plugins to
visualize information and I use that for
example to visualize a legal duplo
models so I had to create lEGO models
for I wanted to create lEGO models for
the tutorial esterday robbie had some 3d
stuff going on and I need needed some
samples so I came up with a dsl and side
my Eclipse IDE which allowed me to
define Lego bricks in the end and I
wanted to have visualized them while I
was creating them so all I did I used
all our news that FX clips tool and this
is my small but we have to increase the
font size ones more preference general
appearance call SAT phones and basic and
text phone to eat it you use 24 right
fly and he s so this is my small TSL
which allows to define me lego bricks
this is a brick which is two twice to
twice to and is colored in red so i
define those dsl's and because my editor
is automatically or implementing or
adapting do this F xml provider I see a
live preview after Lego bricks for
example let's modify the first one save
it and nothing is happening once more
perfect
oh yeah it's the name I'm editing the
name the units are the most important
thing so I have to modify the unique you
now see the first brick instead of two
tries two tries to is now for twice to
twice to the left see a live preview so
we can define this Lego bricks and then
they create assemblies or can create
assemblies out of those lego bricks so
for example if you assemble the bricks
then you get something like this 3d
model it's a little bit shifted to the
top that's block in the preview but you
get the idea so we have a green prick at
the low the button then we have the
store yellow stuff and the red red
bricks on the top the important thing
for you is you can plug in your own
editor into the system so you have
something that you want to visualize the
only thing you need to do is to
implement or adapt or implement our I f
XML provider interface provide some F
XML and we will render it in our preview
so it's up to you in your blood eclipse
plugins to make use of it interesting
beside that is if you look at the left
hand side the files that you see here
are in a folder called sog gem so while
I'm editing the framework is generating
for me f XML files and JavaScript files
we will see in a moment when we go to
run times eclipse for run times what the
cool things we can make of this
generated FX ml of JavaScript code for
example if you look at the door we have
the door defined which is made of out of
this yellow brick and the door and the
door has some actions attached to it so
whenever I click it it will rotate to
the door for three seconds and play the
sound file squeaking door and be free
this is what JavaScript that's generated
in the background is for and if I click
once more at all is closing it rotates
back to 180 degrees and the duration for
two seconds and plays a sound file
called slam door
so it's simply well it was fun creating
this stuff so well it was hard to get
back to real work when starting to do
that but yeah okay so this is how you
integrate or get your stuff done or can
make use of our stuff inside your own
plugins just implement an if' xml
provider adapter and you can visualize
your editor or your view content okay
but most of you probably are writing
real business applications you're not in
the business of writing eclipse plugin
so you probably write a database
front-end or something like that so
there's what ethics clips in the IDE
tamer the first thing I'd wanna
introduce to you today is SWT on chopped
effects and if you have every of if you
have business you is written in as
stability and you're thinking of moving
over to javafx you have a problem you
have to rewrite the complete you I
testability well it doesn't render in
child of X so we cannot even embed as
the routine a job of X application
because javafx is a lightweight toolkit
whereas st is a heavyweight toolkit so
this is not possible so what we have now
is what we created as a research project
was to create an experimental port of
esther ET which instead of using the
native controls like a cocoa button or a
Binford to button it uses a job of X
button and now you immediately can
integrate or bring over all your old st
BTU eyes into the role of javafx make
use of CSS styling everything is there
for you to use of java effects and you
don't have to rewrite your you is the
main target for this is business you
eyes so this is where we are fairly good
at already so we have most business
controls label text table tree
list drop-down layouts of course tab
folders what's not done yet is a tree
table control but for business you guys
we are in a very good state already so i
will show you in a few seconds a
application which is using the business
application which shows the capabilities
of a stability on javafx the current
state is that we stop the research
project because we have not the
resources to go on father we now have
into invested have a menu i guess to
have it ready for to get ninety percent
of the business application to run
without any change another half a menu
is needed but this is something our
company is not investing anymore all
that they created is open sourced it's
under EPL it's part of the git repo at
eclipse.org so everything is free and
everybody can use it but we are not
driving it further it was a research
project we now know it's doable for
business your eyes they cannot have an
STD port that's 100% comfortable there
is some problem in the estimate EAP is
the most prominent problem that we have
activity exposes the so-called event
loop they do a read and dispatch this is
something you don't get access to in
javafx as much as you want to it's
impossible to implement so there are
some problems that it can never solve so
it would have need some different API on
stt level and probably some additions to
javafx to make them 100 combat 100%
compatible let's do tea would have for
example deprecated read in this patch
and provide a higher level API on top
instead of it but that's the current
state but nevertheless I want to show
you what the current state can already
do so this is my initial application
that we have
this is now medium complex activity
application so it's for application so
you have some data binding going on some
master detail stuff you have some
dialogues popping up that's now the
native activity application the original
application that we had and without
motive of changing any line of code I
can start this one on our experimental
javafx port now i have already some some
CSS going on that's why it's in grey but
you see here i can add a new can't i
could have had any conflict the data to
dump demo gods are not with me so you
can when you flip between perspective
you can do some nice animation something
that you get for free from javafx ok so
but the really question is can you
render the Eclipse IDE and
this is now the Eclipse saw space it's
sometime in between Kepler and and lunar
from the coke point of view you see some
exceptions going on that's okay because
we are having a research project many
things are implemented still the you i
will get up after some time so you
notice this is looking like the Eclipse
IDE you have an editor in the center the
trees even with decorations are working
so the most important things of Eclipse
already read the revived any change so
there is a new Java project which is the
cello project wizard I have some CSS
somewhere in the system that oh and I
know what what's going on it's this guy
i set a dark background on no doc
background here this that's that's the
one that makes it all look so bad but
you see i can now use java FX use as
styling to style my SW dui's which is
really a great thing to do because
chelovek CSS is extremely powerful
another ID will look hopefully a lot
better yeah now it's not looking half
grey and have something else so you see
this is the current state it will really
help you to bring over testability
applications to the job of X world but
there is a pre-alpha release it is a
research project well if you contribute
we are going to get you in as a
committer you get committee rides and
work on the code base I have no problem
with that so if you want to make it use
use it if it works for you it's fine but
we are
not investing any money into it unless
you come up to us and say okay here's
half a man year implement the rest for
us that's a solution as well okay so
what else can we deal with this stuff
so a drunk time what we have well we
have some as i said already we have some
additional layout paints the one most
most important ones Porter's master
beauty like a grid layout they're
rolling out in the field layout we have
some additional controls for you we have
dragged able tab folders something you
don't get full for from javafx for open
G of X it was even pulled out of update
40 so we will not get that probably in
the eighth time frame but only with
javafx 9 you can use ours so what we
will be doing BB be doing 30 hacks we
simply use reflection to get into the
job of xcode base so if jonathan is
modifying the code of the tab full of
them they'll our solution is not working
anymore but that's the only that was the
only possibility to get into this tab
dragging the way we wanted it to have
then you have a style text editor which
is a rich text editor which allows you
to write code editors inside clips you
saw this editor when the Eclipse IDE
came up it showed an editor which really
look like an editor looked like an
editor it showed a Java file with about
10,000 lines of code without any problem
to render it we have a generic 3d viewer
you see that in a second when i launched
my sample applications and a lot more so
we have a lot of runtime components for
you to reuse now well the controls that
we have they don't depend on a stability
you can use it in any job FX application
in a pure java vax application but
naturally at eclipse we deal a lot about
with osgi and in our case it's javafx in
equinox which is just special or is one
OHI implementation the one that's done
at eclipse.org so the next thing that we
do is we provide integration of java of
x inter clips
Phoenix osgi environments and this is
not that easy that you might think it is
the first problem is job of X and the
classpath javafx too I don't know if you
know that has been on no class puff at
all it was part of your GD k or GRE
installed but it was on low class puff
so there had to be some special
bootstrapping going on when you package
up your child I've x2 application that
it found out war where the job of X char
is located for java 6 they even went out
to the windows registry to find out
where is freaking javafx fing is so not
that easy to integrate it though is
child because it was on the classpath
okay situation changed with javafx 8
javafx eight is on the classpath but it
is on the extension class path which is
okay which is correct because javafx is
not cheese art it's an implementation
detail of the open open GDK and oracle
GDK it's not standardized he won't get
it on an IBM the a pot would step v8
both of the native out there the m I
don't know you won't get job of X it's
not part there because not it's not
cheese aren't so and most important for
us is the stt integration that allows
you to integrate charm effects internets
the beauty world it's called ethics
canvas is part of your GD k but is not
part of any class path this which is ok
as well you cannot put something on the
extension class path which has a
dependency to esta bility that cannot
work so it's okay that there is no class
buffer still it is a problem to us
because we won't find it by default and
the other problem is created by equinox
itself because equinox historically does
something very odd it skips the
extension class
of equinox will not load body for
classes from the extension class buff it
strips it up if directed goes to the put
class loader no extension class loader
so equinox we'll never find javafx
because it's on the extension class buff
which is completely insane but it is the
way it is and it cannot be changed
because there are eclipsed plugins who
rely on that that it's not searching the
extension classpath so we have to find
solutions to all those problems you are
happy you don't have to think about how
this stuff is solved this is dumb boss
already so it took us many hours and
many many days to find out how we can
solve all those problems for you and I'm
happy to say the integration looks
really really great it's now stable
since about three years so you don't
have to worry about that still I want to
point out how we did that because it
might be interesting to you as well if
you're doing always join acrylics
development we used a clinic specific
API called adaptive hook API and this
adapter hukill API allows us to step
into the classloader creation of equinox
osgi bundles and take over this class
loader creation so when equinox request
a class loader for its bundle then this
step in and create a new world class
loader which works on javafx too for
example if you are java 7 it points to
the extension class loader if you are
java 8 it detects that you're running in
an estimate II environment and magically
adds Esther the activity integration
into your classpath so something that
we're doing for you you don't have to
worry about that and stunned by default
it's a little bit magic but it works
exceptionally well the main problem that
we have there was us about it's an
equinox specific API and this is an SPI
so it got broken between X
43 and 44 so that's why I fix clips is
currently only compatible with the
latest release of equinox so you cannot
use our one of the release together with
and all the clinics install that's not
possible at the moment well now that we
have integrated all the stuff into
equinox the next logical step is the
baller make use of eclipse for eclipse
for has been designed from day one to
beat toolkit UI toolkit agnostic it
doesn't depend on a 30 at all I know
that because I've written the first
prototype I've made the initial design
of that all thats a ninety-five percent
of the clips for code base does not
depend on s ready at all there is a
clean separation between the internals
of the application platform which is to
kill agnostic and tester ET rendering
eclipse 4 is centered around a very few
patterns and it's hard we use the
service pattern everything in eclipse
for service translation is a service
rendering is a service selection is a
service I don't know everything that you
have an eclipse for application is a
service and the important thing is you
can exchange this service for your own
blonde so by default eclipse for ships
with an s to t rendering service you can
exchange didn't a no no no activity we
doing job FX I exchange to service just
before using as to receive through
javafx then they're using a lot of
inversion of control pattern the
inversion of control patent better known
as dependency injection which decouples
all the stuff and you get all the
services from the framework and checked
it into your UI so you write code that
is not covered to the clips framework at
all so you can read code that would run
as an ordinary chawla epic application
as well
and you have something we call a life
application model to give you an
understanding what the life application
model is let me show you how that works
live model editor so you now see on the
lower hand you see the currently running
eclipse instance and once more its watch
out to the package Explorer on the on
the right hand side so this label so
what we see here is the life
representation of this label you can put
chemport color can compare it to a
browser drum and then I make
modifications to this model down here
you see the label up up here reflect
these modifications so in an eclipse for
application you interact with this
application model and the rendering
service picks up your changes and
reflect them in the UI this case it is
an estimate eui if javafx is at
rendering the rendering service it is a
child of x UI component so you program
against this application model make
modifications there and the UI reflect
your modifications that's the main idea
behind eclipse for back to the slides so
as already said eclipse for as you
download it from eclipse as an IDE but
if all ships are render it that's doing
SWT and what we doing with F is clips we
ship a chav effects renderer which does
the same thing I'd say it even does the
most things better than the estimate
aversion to render this life application
model as a pure Java vex application
important thing about this is our render
is once more split in two parts one is a
generic part and one is a javafx
specific part and the nice thing about
this is it would allow us to write
renders for as well as html5 swing cutie
you name it in the air
so it's not well even our renderer is
structured in a way that it is very easy
it's a task of one to two weeks to write
a swing renderer for example you render
the complete you iron swing instead of
s2 beauty or chop effects so what can
you build with such a renderer so in our
demonstration he'll be seeing the lego
model that we had in our Eclipse IDE
loaded in the job of X application it's
a 3d model so i can start rotating this
guy i can flip it around i consume and i
can zoom out and because we added those
actions now if I click on the door it
opens but it animates and if I click it
once more it closes and place the sound
that don't nobody heard the sound in the
back but this is something that you can
easily do with this other things
everything is a service so all the
labels that we have here are provided
per service a translation service so
what I've done in this in this demo is
instead of doing the translations myself
I kill out the google translate get back
all translations and translate my UI in
let's say Arabian Arabian flips the
orientation it's right to left instead
left to right so now flip application
the Arabian everything is flipped so if
I hover here the tooltips are in Arabian
everything is in arabian well you would
not do it in a real world application
but probably want to go out to a
translation database where you have all
the translations store instead of always
going to this dump property files but if
all the clips uses property files for
translation but everything is a service
replace it to something that suits your
application better so we can flip to any
language we want so let's go to chinese
chinese well i don't translate those
labels because that i will never find
back to to english
so here we go to English everything gets
translated then the naturally can flip
things so flip the drain a light frame
and the dog frame this is default job of
X stuff but something that we have built
into the framework if you switch this is
a switch of perspective so I switched
between two perspectives and now i can
define how it should split a switch
between perspectives this guy is running
in the background and taking the focus
away that's what the wrong application I
killed come on
so once more I flip between two
perspectives and the system allows me
for example to define when I flip
instead of doing a simple faith
animation it allows me to define
animation which is looking a little bit
nicer so this is all built into the
platform but it makes sense for you it's
up to you but that form is able to do it
it's simply a matter of exchanging a
service but if all you have a heart
switch if you don't like that you want
to fade effect put in a service into the
platform and the platform will do the
switch differently same goes for stuff
like when the window gets up you can
make the window fade in instead of
simply showing up everything is a
service replace it for your own service
and it will do what you want the
framework to do everything can be
exchanged everything okay so probably
wants more an example for I have a lot
of Clips stuff open here now let's close
some of them don't know which one speech
mall anymore so I want to go to an
application i call compensator no not
this application is doing it shows our
editor our style text control so this is
now a star text control showing a chava
file with syntax highlighting about
10,000 lines and it screws without
problems no lag at all this is written
using the South text control from
eclipse and the really cool thing about
this is all the stuff that we use for
example for highlighting so when we look
at our Duke the duper language so this
language has a keyboard brick and we
have a special file format
which allows us to define what keywords
are there what styling should it use and
the important thing is when we say with
styling does it use we can flip the
theme none of the dark theme and editor
at the center adjusts its colors because
everything is defined in CSS they simply
load the top CSS team which now say it's
okay all keywords have to be in orange
instead of this purple that is default
from eclipse for example and the really
important thing is all the pausing
infrastructure that we use here is
coming directly from eclipse I didn't
have to write any code parcels can run
thing something like that nothing
everything is there for free from
eclipse all the text frameworks that you
have for the clips don't depend on sut
don't depend on osgi you can use it in
any application you want well I used it
here in an application which is an
eclipse for application but you could
have used it in any ordinary job
application something this is the
message that I want to transport to you
most stuff or the clips has no
dependency adult Authority no dependency
most of the code that we have is core
code which is text parsing which does
compilation nothing depends on the
stability you can make use of this stuff
for free it's EPL you can embed it into
your commercial applications without
making the source available and all the
stuff that I've shown here is also
available through github or for the
Eclipse git repository so everything is
EPL well the demos that I wrote for the
for the for the for the tutorial are GPL
but everything else is EPL code so you
can make use of it in for your own
applications okay so that's it that's
what i want to show you well i had some
problems with
live demonstrations I'm sorry that
something that happens if you do live
demos but and normally things really
work very smooth the complete tooling is
really heavily used and we get not that
many but reports on it I think it's
really one of the most advanced java
vectoring that you can get at least at
CSS editor that we have is very smart
what we have this metal language is
called which is called see this text and
we can not only generate out of that is
out the completion stuff let me see
where I can find the CSS stuff here it
is but if all this is the child of X CSS
reference guide which is well I would
say yeah well it has all the
informations but it's hard to to use it
in a daily work for our CSS editor makes
it go away because you get out the
completion all this information into
your IDE still what we can get irate out
of our meta information is a much nicer
representation of the javafx
informations so we have the description
we have the properties with all the
information we have to absorb site or
classes and for parent for example you
don't have to go to node to find out
which properties are there it shows you
here or parent inherits from node and it
inherited those properties for example
so all those informations are on the
right place this is something that we
simply generated such a generation
process it is coming from let me see
whether we can drill into that so when
we look here we have for the pains you
have this pain this is the definition
this is as x definition that tells us a
fill layer pain has those properties
then well thank this references the
length property that we have predefined
we can navigate in here once more to the
pain class and this is information for
word that we use inside our IDE to do
all the outer completion to do the
validation everything is in there well
it's even that clever that let me show
you this
the last thing if we have for example F
X background color control space it
knows this is a background color and it
gives me two visitors like for color and
paint this is a new addition that we
have in field X so this allows me to
define our ninja already are graded I
can never remember how to define a
graded inch elav x users it's too
complex but this is a wizard which
allows me to do that so hit OK and it
generated the great information insert a
disc region into my CSS file at the
moment we are not validating many
informations but in future we plan to
validate everything in here so you would
even get out the completion inside wanna
go here and do a contour space you will
get out the completion telling you what
it expects in this function call all
this is future work ok packet of slides
so we have two demos so Barry most
important what's next not yet decided we
just shipped bon dodo six weeks ago or
five weeks ago I don't know but we have
some ideas so we want to integrate in
the B&amp;amp;D tools this has the advantage
that there are projects who try to get P
and D tools which is a voice chide
tooling working IntelliJ so you can now
write eclipse for chatter of X
applications not using the Eclipse IDE
but you could use IntelliJ if there will
be people who do that for netbeans you
can use yet NetBeans to use our run 10
platform to write applications you are
not bound anymore to the clips IDE
currently we only support the clips IDE
but the rent I'm platform does not
really dependent and the IDE of eclipse
currently there is the best OHI tooling
is part of eclipse but if Allah idea is
ketchup and P and D tools is a good way
to do that if we manage to integrate
integrate ourselves and the pdpa P&amp;amp;D
tools then you can use any ID in the
world to write e for travel effects
applications that would be great
simple integration of masks I'm not that
a fan of what this is what the cat
editors that's why you did not get yet
simple integration really into the clips
ID by prevail about it was closed source
until this March I think that every sit
on the BSD license so now it's at least
from a licensed point of view it would
be doable well I want to have a smarter
gdt editor which allows me to define
gradient definitions using the wizard
that ish that you saw in my in my CSS
editor I'd like to have out the
completion if you do set style in the
india chocolate or i want to have out
the completion for this CSS all it would
be all doable the information is there I
simply have to grab it from the ast and
send it up to our how the completion
proposal research then it works support
for job of exports to defer to write
Java of X mobile applications and
improved packaging support for example
that you can sign your applications
using your chava fax packager so that
you can directly send your job of X
application to the App Store outside
from inside your IDE at the runtime fix
gaps that we still have compared to
eclipse on ester EG min max support if a
double click something that it opens as
a big center screen I'd like to do some
effects there's like / making it Broder
detaching while we currently don't
support detaching tabs using
drag-and-drop then support for dialogues
and research as part of the Eclipse
application model then update and
install inside the Eclipse application
there's a framework at eclipse called p2
which does support updating always joy
applications on the fly I'd like to
integrate some I add some some some UI
for that some simple you either they can
make use error reporting reusable
components like to come and navigate the
framework support or something like that
ok just as the last thing and then an
open for
questions are approaches that eclipse
that use of ethics clips or charm
effects it's you water project to do
functional you're testing which supports
job of X there is gap for graphical
editor framework which is written from
scratch in eclipse Mars which supports
job of X there's ethics diagram which is
a dsl diagram visualization tool kit let
but one of the guys from X text neon
Kern line and a user of ethics clips for
example is the spring tool suite you
probably don't notice that but the
spring tools food if you open it the
browser in the center that's a chav
effects webview that's not as too deep
rouser component anymore if you are
running on Java 7 or Java if you're
running with java 6 it's low poster
browser ok and now I'm open for
questions we have about four minutes for
questions yes yeah the question is how
did we get to the job of X packager what
we're doing at the moment we simply
generate an ant file and launch aren't
to do the JavaFX packager it will
generate if you looked at my at the
system but it but it did generate for me
where are we we are in the build it
generated and build.xml file for me and
this is what it launched when it did all
the build stuff so it generates simpler
build.xml anat file that you can use on
your hudson instance as well it
generates it whenever you click in the f
in this editor when Ike menu click aunt
Carolyn aren't xml file or uncle fancy
yeah so it was on the right hand side
here is a link that you can click and
then we generated building some alpha
sorry this is this one that's a special
file that we put into your application
is called build ethics build
it will generate create this file for
you up by default yes no they cannot
javafx packager can only generate the
dmg package mac and setup access or MSI
package if you run on windows so that's
a limitation of the Java Java packaging
tool well there was a buff yesterday and
they are looking into solutions to that
but haven't come up with one yet Paula
questions yeah okay here the question is
how does bird integral in there well
Bert has has an extension for rendering
framework so that is an HTML five
hundred as an estimate e renderer so in
davis has been a guy who used our
estimate eeport blocked it in and it
generates bert reports so what the real
solution if you ask me is that one right
one is writing a real javafx renderer
for Bert so it's an extension framework
so it could be done that would be the
correct solution the other one is well
it is the simple solution but not
necessarily all the best one so we have
a very good GC implementation so all
that's done with the graphics contacts
in the clips we simply translate that to
on canvas in javafx so they simply do
the stroking and the clipping and all
the stuff on the cheetah on Mike on that
tab of X canvas control ok have our
questions
so thanks for coming and hope you
