i'm here today with Stephen chin with
the java programming co-chair among
other things hello Stephen how are you
today good thanks a lot for um agreeing
to do the interview or these thanks for
being you today maybe so could you uh
tell us a bit about yourself and your
role in this year's a Java one
conference sure so I'm the java
community manager for otn and also the
Java one content co-chair together with
charts gender and we put together all of
the conference for the upcoming job one
San Francisco conference that's going to
be taking place in October of this year
we have a bunch of different tracks for
the conference so there's a core java
platform track and that has to do like
to do with the core Java Virtual Machine
upcoming features in Java 9 in Java 10
some stuff about the implementation of
lambda as an ass or in a different stuff
for java 8 job and security track and
the job insecurity track is all about
how you can make your java web
applications more secure what we're
doing to improve the security the Java
platform in general kind of security
breaches security topics by noteworthy
security experts in the industry merging
languages so emerging languages is all
about different languages which run on
the JVM so you know Scala groovy Colin
sale on JRuby any number of even a sort
our own JavaScript interpreter or
compiler runs on the JVM as well so
those are all good examples of different
languages and technologies will see in
the emerging languages track we have a
new java dev ops on the cloud track
which focuses on how you can run java in
the cloud on infrastructure service
platform as a service doing microservice
architectures integrating more devops
with your development process using
docker and other containerized stuff
then job on the Internet of Things so
that's all about how you can program for
embedded
platforms and devices use Java to build
the future Internet of Things devices
java mobile edition then job and
server-side development so this is our
EE track which is probably the biggest
use case or Java currently Java clients
and user interfaces so you doing javafx
java swing java ee other rich client
applications on the JVM and the last one
is a merged track so this year we merge
the java development tools and agile
techniques track and this is the best
way to find out about how to use java in
your company with different processes
like scrum conv XP and also different
development tools like ides or
performance profiling tools or different
things for working with large-scale java
applications great so as you know the
acceptances have just gone out with
content catalog is live could you tell
us a bit about sort of how they go about
selecting the individual abstracts that
will be presented at the conference sure
so we we have program committees which
are composed of noteworthy community
members for each of the tracks we also
have program chairs which kind of
Shepherd and make sure that we get the
proper number and variety of voting on
the different sessions and topics and
they also solicit speakers to do
additional submissions so we had a huge
number of submissions this year over a
thousand submissions to the Java one
call for papers and from this each of
the track leads kind of suggests
different talks which they like to the
tracks and then sharra that is the
content shares go through and make the
final recommendations and push things
out for the content catalogue which is
now live so just last friday we sent out
speaker acceptances so you can actually
find all the conference sessions hands
on conference sessions birds of feather
sessions and tutorials are all online
now if you want to take a look at what
the java one content is
cool and I know you will be presenting
yourself so could you give us a little
bit of what you'll be presenting on sure
so yeah besides being content chair and
doing interviews and various other stuff
actually I I still I still have some
interesting technical stuff which I care
about to talk about so last year I did a
talk on agile it was confessions of an
agile methodology swear I went over some
of my experience being a agile
practitioner for the past well over a
decade and I'm following it up this year
with a a talk which I'm Co speaking with
peter van der voort on for 14 years of
agile the good the bad and the ugly and
of course well we'll sensationalize the
bad and the ugly but hopefully some good
things will come out of it as well elan
and I are going to be doing a java
community insider secrets session so
you'll on is my co java community
manager who helps me the java twitter
handle facebook and all the social
channels and we're going to be talking a
little about how you can get involved in
job user groups be a JCP participants
attend conferences for free whenever you
want to anywhere in the world all the
all the sort of you know fun little
insider tricks on ways to engage and
interact with the java community and in
general do cool stuff without paying a
lot i'm also going to do a video risk
but respect retrospective about the past
20 years of java to celebrate the fact
this is the 20th year of java see I have
my 20 years of Java t-shirt on as well
with the commemorative Lego and the goal
is to get some of the luminaries and
folks who built Java to talk a little
bit about their experience especially
from a technical standpoint about like
the earlier version 1 version 0 Java
compilers a little bit about the the
projects like the green project which
actually kicked off Java and then early
implementations of technologies which we
used today
the actual technology implementers all
the way up to present job a little bit
about the future let's see bubu bubu oh
and I also have an IOT session as well
so shama shama and I are going to talk a
little bit about IOT and what's in it
for Java professionals to kind of give
an overview of for people who are
interested in pursuing IOT as a as a
career how they can get involved and
actually do more interesting things in
that space coming from a Java
development background so that's the
sort of stuff I'm doing but you know
also i'll be doing interviews like this
at javaone and other fun stuff so so
you're very busy guy that um some days
yeah apparently not today today I'm just
hanging out with my with my friends now
he's gonna he's going to visit the ASEAN
Kids Day coming up this this weekend so
he's a busy guy that's good well we're
happy to have you so could you tell us a
little bit about Java juanas and what's
your favorite part about Java one um my
my favorite part of Java one is you know
while we have a lot of good technical
content over 400 sessions box hands-on
labs and tutorials I actually think the
best the best part of Java one is the
networking so it's what a lot of people
call the hallway track where you just
walk around and bump into interesting
people have conversations with different
folks who you would never meet in a
casual setting like um JVM language
author's book authors people writing
open source frameworks people who are
like JCP spec leads and they're just
kind of most of those folks are besides
presenting they're just kind of hanging
out walking around in the in the Java
hub or roaming the hallways at javaone
so it's a really good chance to kind of
casually meet and greet with folks who
are building some of the technologies
which all of us use on a daily basis
great and who knows if you go to Java
one you might even
and deceiving himself yes so before we
go what are you looking forward to at
this year's javaone any sessions that
really caught your eye um Wow sits since
I've been looking at lots of sessions
there's quite a few some noteworthy
speakers who I think always deliver
really good talks and are are going to
be back at a job one this year so we of
course have been CAD subramanian that
looks like the internet just froze there
for a sec so he's going to be chatting
about lamb doesn't a bunch of other
topics a job one his talks are all he
was really interesting because he does
live coding so no slides he's just kind
of you know coding and talking and
explaining topics on the fly enemy n
does a similar style of presentation and
his talks are really cool so he
submitted a bunch of talks for java was
John I'm really excited about as well we
have some really good jsf talks as well
um lots of good IOT content came in four
different people building devices quite
a lot of good agile talks as well so is
the second year we have a big agile
focus of the conference so I mean
there's pretty much content for
everybody at javaone it's just a matter
of finding what your your passion or
your niches and there'll be something
interesting there too to watch your talk
about great so any final thoughts before
we let you go no I mean I'm hoping that
folks who watch the are watching the
live stream or watch the recording are
interested to attend javaone while I
should know this I don't really know but
I'm sure there's some really good early
bird discounts going on right now yes
there are sure you could save a lot of
money by by signing up early and given
san francisco hotel availability that's
that's probably prudent to sign up early
and take advantage of discounted hotels
or Airbnb or whatever your favorite fair
is and then for folks who are members of
Java user groups i believe we also have
jug discounts as well so reach out to
your
Kochavi user group and see if you can't
get an even bigger discount great will
Steven you've been very helpful thanks
for joining us today okay thanks a lot
David have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
