architect in the mobile application
framework product and my colleague here
Shalini in law is a product manager so
hope you already had lunch so you can
sit through this one hour without
starving no before we talk anything so I
have to show this thing safe harbor
statement I guess you already side maybe
150 times by now in every session so
I'll just a few seconds what you can
read it it's mainly saying this is only
for information purposes whatever we are
going to discuss and no commitment or
Nothing sort of liked it so just few
seconds
okay so today so what we are going to
discuss here is so there is a jdk 8
release recently before and it came with
lot of new features and lot of changes
in terms of languages as well as some
kind of architectural changes call deck
profiles and all this thing and there is
a java embedded product also available
for download it's been there he since
jay riecke's seven also but we G decayed
it got a different shape now and that
embedded we took it and put it in iOS
and Android thing we build a product
called mobile application framework so
we are going to cover all those things
in this session with a demo at the end
of this this the end of the slides so
here is a program as in the first I'll
go through the major changes that are
relevant to this session I'm not going
to talk about everything in GD k 8 just
relevant whatever is relevant for mobile
application framework and then what is
Joe I see embedded is for there's a
difference between in SC vs SC embedded
and then we go into what is mobile
application framework and the
architecture of that and how it works on
iOS and Android everything's and then
we'll then conclude with a demo followed
by Q and E
so Java it so the major changes in Java
8 world at the language level I mean he
probably noticed it the lambda was
making big these days in Java 8 that
lambdas are giving a lot of flexibility
and lot of easy to guide the programs
without writing like 10 lines of code
probably we can just do it in two lines
thing with these lambdas and with
lambdas it comes there's a language
engine interfaces now we can write some
default methods and static methods
within interfaces which was not there
prior to jdk so though the two changes
in two big changes in the language
itself and then the profiles they're
called compact profiles in jdk 8 which
is targeted towards the embedded world
if you guys aware of this CLD CCDC all
these things jtm me it's mainly
targeting towards this CDC kind of
developers or customers so with profiles
the CDC is no longer their app but with
this profiles CDC customers can still
get this VM and then they can do
whatever they want with this province so
lambdas just an example so we usually
just write the thread with a runnable
interface and then we implement new
runnable with run method in it and then
do all the logic within the run method
but with lambdas if there is interface
with only one method it's called a
functional interface then you don't have
to write that complete new runnable open
brackets and closed brackets and all the
things run method you can simply write
this kind of syntax sorry
so it's a this whole thing with just the
brackets on arrow and the method body it
is equivalent to new runnable with run
method public white run method and then
implementing the logic there so that if
it is a functional interface then you
can do it not with interface which has
more than one method and the
specification changed to include some
implementation within the interface
itself this is totally new in jdk 8 so
earlier like pre jdk 8 so if interface
is just all the methods are a must be
abstract and all you can do is may just
define some constants but nothing else
but in jdk 8 you can have an
implementation within their faces and
there are two kinds of implementations
you can do within interface you can do
static methods and just use just like
any other starting methods are for the
interface name and then the method
directly and it will do just like
whatever we are doing today so as like
similar to the static methods in classes
when implement this interface that
static methods are not over rideable
know that right so you it's not like
overriding or anything so you have to
refer the interface name and our class
name and then the method name that's all
it is if you have another method with
the same name in the subclass it's not
like overriding or anything but there is
a new thing called default this is brand
new modifier in the interfaces and it is
applicable for only interfaces you can
write default methods which are if you
don't implement in interface you will
inherit that implementation
automatically but if we implement that
method then you will get whatever your
implement so the inheritance works with
the default methods in interfaces so
that is the difference and as in the
regular rule in interfaces everything is
always public so we don't have to
specifically say anything
public or anything it's always public an
interface that still stays intact so the
default methods are a major change in
this one and these are in connection
with lambdas these default methods are
implemented because if you look at the
collection API in jdk 8 a lot of new
methods got added for the collections
that list for each method but if we add
that into the list interface then all
the implemented classes will fail anyway
the regular Java rule so that is why
this default method for interviews so
that it will inherit that default
implementation from the interface itself
so those are the some major language
hinges and coming to the relevant topic
that is a profiles so JDK 8 a Java it
say it came with a new concept called
profiles if you remember the project
jigsaw earlier which was trying to do
the modularity so it was taking a long
time so the JDK kind of came up with
this new thing called profiles so what
this profiles is if you remember earlier
days of CDC and cldc there was a
specification subsetting of what a peer
can be used in CDC devices or what a PA
can be used in cldc aps so just to align
with but not exactly the same instead of
having one huge API for example if you
want to run Joe are like some small
raspberry pi like device or some
hardware which doesn't have any screen
or anything you just want to do some I
go then getting the full Java is not
good so what this profiles it was they
split all the API into four categories
it's more like a big one big jar file
which is and you're already familiar
with rptr it is split into like four
java's think it is but it's not exactly
like that but I think it as it is split
into four parts and they call it it's
called profiles
and the names of profiles are compact
one compact to compact 3 and the compact
for is not a name compact for is nothing
but you get everything whatever we are
getting today so underneath the hot
squat vm it is still the same hot spot
not changes nothing and the compact one
profile actually includes the core
classes the the classes that are in the
language if you look at the Java
language and Java Virtual Machine
specifications they require some classes
to be present mainly the java dot
packages and all the stuff compact to
brings xml api and jdbc api and RMA api
on top of compact one so this is in
conjunction with earlier with cdc there
used to be the series of the defining
base class but to get some kind of
additional API there is to bjs ours java
specification request for each
functionality there was one jsr and then
people who are grabbing the jar files
and using it in the CDC for files for
example Jace or 280 is XML API so
earlier CDC seriously developers were
grabbing the GS or 28 implementation for
XML but these were all the kind of
subset head and it was not same as the
java SE API but now it is exactly the
same java cata whatever their java dot X
and Java X dot XML API but they're kind
of strip taken out and then put it in
one jar and we call it compact you
prefer and compact 3 brings additional
management classes naming and the
compiler API a little bit more advanced
so if you want to run sort of full java
SE but without any UI like no swing noah
debility nothing like that but kind of
univ on care like full java SE
capabilities server capabilities and
everything you'll get that in compactly
and there is no name for compact for or
anything it is like the full Java for
GRE which includes
was everything whatever we are getting
today so on top of it so it comes or it
gives us optional components like for
example the JavaScript engine and all
his additional stuff as an optional
components but if you download today Joe
it you'll get everything there is no
difference you'll get everything but
inside this Joe ate itself this kind of
separation is there and I'll come to
that point how you can get and how you
can create a GRE with only compact or a
compact line just to give you more
details about what the API is included
this slide shows what other packages
that are included in each profile if you
look at this one not sure you mean
everything but no worries said compact
to has XML and jdbc aps and compact
rejas naming and management aps and
everything so Java dot beans is moved to
full JRE incense if you want the ordered
beans classes you have to get the full
GRE I'll I am highlighting it because in
the next slides it will I will talk
about that why it is little bit
important in connection with these
profiles and all these changes even if
you look at the Java doc if you just go
to java top page of the c8 for every
class it will show what profile it
belongs to so so notice that every class
will tell whether it is part of compact
went two or three and if you click on
the compact one or compact or compact it
is a hyperlink again it gives you the
list of the API in that particular
profiles so there is a change in the
Javadoc also so they can get the more
information about what is included in
what is not included
so a little bit more details and why
this is important and all this stuff
because earlier when in Sunday's when
they were subsetting CDC and cldc it was
more like not only just API it was some
kind of vm subsetting and language
subsetting it happened like that for
example if you look at the cldc we
cannot have class loaders in CL DC so
some some kind of language and virtual
machine specifications also subset it
but with crow files it's purely API
subsetting when I say APA subsetting it
is not even removing methods or anything
everything is intact just like the
classes are moved in profiles one two
three levels there is no removing of
methods or nothing it's no subsetting
like that but earlier when when it was
said like CDC or CLE see it was even
though the class name is saying we were
missing some methods there was some kind
of inconsistency but this time it's
purely just the API division like just
move around the classes itself only one
problem I was the java dot beans that's
why i mentioned that the java red beans
is more to the full profile due to lot
of dependencies but the logging api is
in compact one so to deal with it these
methods are duplicated in java 8 if you
use the login think it's a lot manager
I'd property and rimming property
changelessness these are all the I know
if anybody uses Packer at 280 a but
those methods are deprecated and looks
like they are going to remove it in jdk
9 for sure otherwise this dependency
will stay forever I don't know exactly
but that's that's the issue here but if
you are using the full java SE no
problem you can use these methods but if
you specifically get compact to JRE or
compact one GRE these methods are gone
from the runt
itself so there is a special bill which
is removing these methods from the
runtime also so that's one thing to
notice so with all this how do I make
sure that my application will work with
what profiles so Java Sea the compiler
to changed and added a new option that
you can specify dash profile and again
as twitch profile you are compelling so
this is a new option in Java 8 so you
can compile your code with the dash
profile and whatever their profile you
want to compile it will validate
everything again is that profile and
gives the errors also so for example
like if you are trying to use thread MX
bean it is not available in compactive
because you are giving the we are
compiling agonist compactive so this is
the change in with Java Sea tool also
and how this works a little internal
detail but I know how many of you notice
the compiler uses a file called the CT
dirt sing it doesn't use RT dodge are
anymore to compile the classes it uses
another file called city that same it
now contains a metadata information
about what are what profiles and what
symbols each profile contains so your
code when you do Java Sea it is creating
a symbol stable out of the city same and
then trying to compile it it is to make
the compare foster I guess because RT
dejar is huge and it pulls a lot of
dependences but the city that same is
more like it pose whatever it needs
doesn't go into the deep level of some
private packages or anything like me so
and another tool in se8 that is relevant
is there's a car to recall jdubs it's
more like Java dependency checker so it
this is mainly for your existing jar
files if you want to see whether what
profile is compatible
with your jar file or not you can use
this tool to figure out which profile is
needed to run this to run your
application so jdubs takes a jarful as
input and then displays a result what
are the dependence is it goes through
every class image i given java and it
goes through and tries to get the
transitive closure and displays the
information about that which class
belongs to which profiles and you'll get
a summary of okay this is what I need so
here is an example so I took Jesse
Komondor job and this is a partial
output it gives a full complete list but
here if you look at it Jesse c'mon dodge
or depends on compact one and compact
two and some files are not found because
my command line doesn't include those
jar files in the classpath but it gives
an information by looking at it you can
tell that ok I minimum need competitive
and I'm missing these packages and I
integrate this so it's very helpful to
figure out when you're building
applications for embedded this is real
this really helps what API it is
dependent on
and the downloads so there's openjdk you
can always build your own so there's if
you are member of open jdk you can get
it but what you can find in the public
downloads is a standard java SE
distribution which is a typical one we
have been doing and there is a reference
implementation for profiles probably not
many of our even i am not aware of this
until few days ago so there's this page
where it gives for each profile there is
a JRE which you can download direct its
kind of pre-canned compact one compact
to compact three profiles you re in
addition to this full jdk &amp;amp; Jerry's and
there is another link gold the java
download page you will see a site like
java embedded you go there you will find
embedded java SE embedded downloads for
armed Ross certs soft float and hard
floor different varieties the PowerPC is
supporting and everything so this is the
main topic of this session so java SE
eight embedded so how it is she plays
it's mainly for as it says emirate
devices and people mostly people are
playing with it using raspberry pi
devices to do a lot of small projects
robotics and all things probably have
seen in the democrats you go to java
embedded booth where has it's probably
using this embedding thing so how it is
delivered is please note that it is not
for everything means there are lots of
hardware's lots of cross sets they have
so it's not possible to give JRE for JV
and for every every cpu and every class
are out there so we selectively do few
things we go there you'll see that there
six or seven downloads were different
each different process it comes as a
bundle which is not JRE it comes with a
big zip file
it's called a jdk embedded JDK I don't
get too much with the name it's a bunch
of files in that zip file and you'll run
it to recall Z re-create which will
create a final Z early so why you need
to run that GRE creator I'll explain in
a bit so it tells you it gives you
options to choose starting with what vm
you want to use and here when I say what
via means the hot spot comes in three
flavors minimal vm client vm and server
vm and each is targeted for different
purposes server vm as it says it's
probably used on the server big server
systems and the client usually we use on
the desktop systems and minimal is
actually the vm itself is stripped down
so that it doesn't contain lot of like
for example garbage collectors it will
have only one garbage collector and it
will do only some some amount of sitting
not everything that client and server
can do so what it makes is it makes the
vm itself is small in stopping so you
will get very minimal footprint with vm
so you will get options to choose vm and
the profiles and what kind of extensions
you need so that you can tune depending
upon your requirements if you are just
doing hello world application probably
you just need compact one with minimal
vm you don't need anything but if you
are doing a little bit more Jarius and
everything probably you need compact too
so you can tune whatever you want for
your target plant so this tool lets you
do all that stuff so here is an example
how it works so it's it the total GRU
will come with 12 ND that's the minimal
i guess we're using the minimal vm with
compact one profile currently we support
only these things linux x86 and lenox
for pc it's mainly the reference device
that everybody using is raspberry pi to
try it out
and Jerry create comes with the option
called extensions so the easy dka
contains some optional components for
example you probably don't need to have
all the locals in the whole world
probably you just need English so by
default it includes only English viewers
but if you want to add more you can tune
your GRE using this extension flag and
add those locales to your target Jerry
it it increases unlike that there are
encryption algorithms and JavaScript
engine comes as an optional components
in each IDK what happened this is just a
reference table like how much it is it
coming to it's like no with compact one
it's around 11 mb and on other platforms
have full GRE will be around 50 mb
compared to the 50 like level mb is way
too small so a little picture that shows
so you'll download the easy IDK then you
run jerry create depending upon your
requirements and then you will get the
target GRE and you move that JRE folder
into whatever the target platform is and
then just run Java there and this Jerry
create can run on any host machine over
it is Windows or Linux or Mac it doesn't
matter it's a it's just a command-line
tool which is creating shuffling the
files and creating a target Jerry but to
run that theory you move that thing to
the target device
so just to recap everything so a jdk
will contain the whole compact one
compact to come back three and optional
components on everything by creating by
using this GRE create you will get a
small version of GRE that you can put on
the target JVM so here is interesting
thing so JVM you can always use JVM as a
library so it's been there since Java
was born so you can use these dll's on
Windows or data source on Linux to start
JVM in another application so it's been
there that interface is there the jni
interfaces so what we are doing here is
embedding this the one at that the
smallest vm that i can create i can make
it as a library and then put it into
some native application and then just
like you're calling printf like as a c
standard function you can call this
create a sh underscore create jovian
there's a bunch of sequence to start the
vm within your application just like
printer if you can do this and it starts
javab within your application so it's
nothing new but now because of this GRE
create Andy JDK you have like about 15
mb of JVM or JRE which you can take it
and put inside some other application
that application can be anything
anything else in supported application
because right now we support only the
public clay download at embedded jdk is
Linux and Power PC but assuming you have
that if you download the reference
implementation of compact you for Mac
you can embed that vm within your mark
obligation itself so similarly this
small JVM we can embed inside some other
application that native application can
be an iOS application
application or anything that supports
the target GRE that you have note that
in the API told the compact is just like
some basic API plus XML line jdbc there
is no UI but your native application can
provide you I for example high voice
applications it can still be using
you're aiways native interface but talk
to java to do some business logic then
get the results from the business logic
and displayed on the screen or it could
be another example is it can be a hybrid
application with Coto as the primary
interface well HTML CSS and JavaScript
and all these things so that is platform
independent UI and platform independent
business logic it can combine these two
and put it in my voice or wherever it is
so that is what the product we are doing
mobile application framework so for iOS
and Android so we am we take this small
JVM and then embed inside the iOS and
Android applications and UI is cordova
and young and shreena here will explain
the whole lot picture and how it works
and how we embed in iOS and Android so
thanks something I'm going to talk about
a specific use case of Java 8 embedded a
Zonk you mentioned before at Oracle we
are building a mobile application
framework which uses the same techniques
that aunty explained before to create a
custom embedded JDK emitted GRE that we
are using to build a mobile application
development platform that is that can
run on multiple devices both iOS and
Android before we get into the details I
want to just give a quick overview this
framework already exists in production
today but it is based on Java ME CDC
profile which is limited to Java 1 dot 4
we all know it's very old but we are
transitioning it to use Java 8 embedded
radius targeted for iOS and Android
devices and going forward will be
supporting windows as well so I existed
a mobile application framework allows
you to build a mobile application once
and maintain a single code base that you
can deploy to multiple platforms namely
iOS and Android today and going forward
you'll be able to deploy to windows
windows forms as well as Windows tablets
it also comes with multiple support for
multiple IDEs you can use either
jdeveloper or eclipse both are available
today I'm going to do a quick demo at
the end of the session using Eclipse and
Java 8 embedded it also has number of
useful capabilities for developers it
has both online and disconnected modes
where you can build enterprise
applicable applications that can run
completely disconnected and then when
you you're back online you can
synchronize the backend system it also
comes with an embedded security
framework that allows you to securely
authenticate and authorize mobile
application users with your back-end
identity management systems other key
aspect of this is we provide a large set
of components as part of the component
library that render using javascript and
CSS which allow you to build rich and
interactive you ice in your mobile
applications while implementing all your
business logic in Java let's get into
the details of art of the architecture
of this framework and how we built it so
let's start with the basics on the
left-hand side of your screen is a
mobile device with a bunch of a bunch of
device services it could be an iOS
device an R and R and Android device on
the sudden on the right hand side you
have a server which is generating a
bunch of HTML pages or expose
a bunch of web services we have this
device native container this is the
native application that honky was
talking about that wraps the mobile
application and this is the container
that is written in the native platform
using objective-c on iOS and using
Android SDK and Android that is what
this is the application that is going to
trigger or launch the JVM inside the
container we have two key components one
is a web view which is a native
component component which is responsible
for rendering all aspects of you I used
in the application web view uses HTML
and CSS to render the UI and it
interacts with Apache Cordova for
accessing device services there a set of
JavaScript API that our platform
independent that you can use to access
device services through the code over
layer it also supports multiple content
types you can either use HTML content
type where you will be you can use your
favorite HTML third-party library and
Kumble the UI or you can embed the more
content using remote URLs in addition to
that the framework also provides new
content type called AMX which comes with
a component library that allows you to
quickly put together sophisticated you
is without having to write a lot of java
java script or HTML code it also comes
with a declarative controller where you
can define the page navigation
navigation between various pages in your
application without writing any code
the device container also comes packaged
it's a Java Virtual Machine it is based
on Java embedded contact to profile and
all the interaction between the webview
and java virtual machine is done through
a special channel built as a Cordova
component which allows exchange of
messages between the UI and model layer
so when you are building an application
with this framework all the business
logic you will be writing will be in
Java and the UI will be rendered in
html5 and CSS I mentioned the vm channel
before which is implemented as a
priority queue which is responsible for
exchanging the messages between the UI
and model layer the framework also comes
packaged with a sequel light database
that you can use for offline access
offline storage of data it comes with an
encryption engine so you can securely
store all data on the device and at the
primary access to the database is
through standard JDBC interface the
framework comes packaged with the mobile
security SDK this SDK is responsible for
intercepting all network communication
from the device to the server it is
responsible for authenticating and
authorizing the request as well as
persisting all sensitive data in a
secure manner the framework also
provides a special feature called
configuration service which allows you
to download configuration from the
server dynamically without having to
repeatedly update your app in the App
Store for small configuration changes
anything related two endpoints any
metadata changes you can down directly
download from the configuration changes
without having to go through the long
update cycle through public app stores
let's get into a quick demo I'm going to
use eclipse with July temperate to
demonstrate how easy it is to build a
application targeted for iOS and Android
using this platform I have a test
application created here it's a shell
application I have not created anything
here at this point I just have a bunch
of javabeans let me show you the beans
here I have one java class called people
service it is exposing a collection of
workers and I'm going to build an iOS
application that is going to display the
list of workers that you can quickly
filter upon as I mentioned earlier the
current production version of this paper
is using CDC Java ME profile Java ME CDC
profile which is based on Java 1 dot 4
so here in this particular version i am
using java 8 so I'm showing the search
function here which is utilizing the
latest lambda expressions as well as
streaming API on collections so this
method they see this java class simply
has a collection of workers these are
all hard-coded of course and I have a
simple search method which is filtering
the work lives based on the criteria
that is passed so I'm going to use this
Java Bean to build a simple application
for iOS and Android let me get started
on that i'm going to create a feature
i'm going to call it workers because i
am displaying a list of workers and i'm
going to add a page to this workers
feature i'm using this MX content type
that we talked about earlier because it
comes with a set of pre-built components
that I can simply drag and drop onto the
UI without having to write java script
or HTML code but if you are an expert in
HTML and JavaScript you can build the UI
by writing your writing by you
javascript not HTML I'm going to create
a new page and call it Orchestra MX and
there is a predefined template provided
to you where you can pick what are the
major Lee what is the basic layout of
the page that you want to go with I'm
going to just pick a header and a
secondary facet to render a button that
we can use for searching for the search
button so here we have the worker stage
as you can see the page is represented
in XML it uses a bunch of high-level
tags that correspond to various aspects
of your of the UI in your application
and we also have the concept of data
controls where the beam is wrapped in
the form of a data adapter that you can
use to easily bind the UI to the model
using simple L expressions the people
service object exposes a method do
search and it has a result which is a
collection of workers so I'm going to
take this workers and drop it into under
the panel page as a list for your
component and leather list view there
are a bunch of pre-canned templates that
you can choose from to define the layout
of your page I'm going to pick a simple
layout with an image and a couple of
lines of text as you can see the
template editor is allowing you to pick
to bind attributes to specific items
that you are displaying in the page I'm
going to pick the main text as the name
is the first thing I want to display for
my voice I'm going to pick the job title
as the subordinate text and I'm going to
take the picture of the employee to be
displayed
mall down with the layout as you can see
it generated a bunch of XML which
essentially is laying out a listview
component let's view component is a
prebuilt component that comes in the
component library that you can use to
create to display a collection of
objects I didn't do the drag-and-drop
correctly so I guess I put it in that it
put it in the wrong place I'm just going
to move it under the panel page so now
we have a page that shows a list of
workers I want to build a simple search
paid search field with a button to
filter the filter the list let's do that
so I have the search method I'm going to
drop the search method in the secondary
facet which is where I want to put a
button as a button here as you can see
we automatically set up the bindings
this is a simple expression which is
executing the method whenever the button
is clicked it is bound to the action
listener attribute of the button so upon
clicking the button the metadata method
is executed and the results are
displayed in the page I think again I
moved it drop it in the wrong location
I'm going to move it to the facet
secondary facet so it shows up nicely in
the UI and the only remaining piece now
is an input field where I can enter the
search criteria so I have a criteria
remember variable here in my bean I'm
going to drag it and drop it into the
header as an input text
as again as you can see for the input
text there is a simple y el expression
set up which where which pushes the
value into the criteria feeling in the
beam so I have my page ready and just to
summarize I have a list view to display
the list of employees I have an input
field to enter the criteria and I have a
button here which is bound to the do
search method on the beam to execute the
query of all the pieces ready to go let
me save everything and I'm ready to go
my application is ready and I can deploy
to other iOS Android as you can see up
until up until this point I have not
done anything specific to iOS or Android
it's all platform independent now when I
go to run configurations this is where
you can configure the target platform as
you can see here I have the target
platform set as iOS and you can also
pick Android i'm going to show that
after i deploy to iOS you can pick the
target platform and you can also specify
the target deployment it could be a
simulator or to the itunes or to a
package IPA file that you can put in on
the app store all of that is available
and when you pick deployment your device
you also have the facility to provide
the provisioning profile and the
certificate you want to sign with which
is what Apple requires all of that is
integrated with to the IDE so it's very
easy for you to build mobile
applications so I'm going to target to
the simulator now and hit run all the
build and packaging is integrated into
the IDE as you can see it is executing
Xcode commands in this case because i'm
targeting the iOS simulator and
packaging the application the java
application as a native application and
then deploying to the simulator
it takes a few seconds to deploy and
should bring up the simulator there you
go I think good application should be
early now this is the application we
just applied ok let me add just the
scale a little bit ok you guys can see
now I'm going to launch the application
this is a native application at this
point as you can see I have the list of
employees this is the full list of
employees have an input text field here
I'm going to just enter a simple query
and he do search button little cousin
the same application I can deploy
Android without any changes and the only
thing I need to do is pick a different
target I'm going to go to run
configuration again and target to iOS i
have a samsung android device connected
to the machine to my machine it
automatically detected that there is a
device connected and it is this is only
device connected right now so it
automatically picked that as the target
now when i hit run it should deploy it
should generate an APK file for android
sign it and deploy to the device once
the deployment is connect to complete
i'm going to switch to droid it screen
show the application running on the
device
I
yes that's lutely yeah it's the reason
I'm putting it on the device and android
is android emulator is notoriously slow
it takes forever to bring it up so I'm
it's much more convenient to deploy
potato device but I can deploy it on iOS
device as well as you can see it is
building the APK file it will take a few
seconds to get this done there you go
build a successful let me see you guys
can see the i'm using bright LED screen
to reflect my phone we have the java 8
test application that we just deployed i
think it is at the bottom of the screen
i'm going to launch that it is the first
time i'm running the application here so
it's going to go through the initial
installation process
it's taking longer than usual
oops
nope not coming up
maybe see this okay as you can see it's
the same exact same page to rebuild
earlier and what's the same
it is there seems to be some delay but
as you can see the exact same
application no changes I could deploy to
an AI Android application as well so
that concludes my demo just to recap
alchy talked about jyc java 8se embedded
and how you can create your own
applications and your own GRE
configurations using the custom d
re-create to be at oracle are using the
same techniques to build a mobile
application development platform for
building mobile applications targeted
for iOS and Android that concludes my
demo and let me go back to the screen to
my presentation will be here for any
questions I just wanted to share some
slides about additional information oops
I think we missed the slide if you have
any questions will be here stomach so
this framework is available today you
can download it and it's free for
development and testing but it is based
on the current production version is
based on Java ME CDC profile the one
that I just am over it is based on Java
8 it is targeted for early next year yes
yes quite
there are multiple options available I
can share with you separately they are
available in the price list and there
are a lot of different options per user
per device license enterprise license
all-you-can-eat type of the only two
things i can show you actually the only
two things you need to configure is if
you are deploying to iOS you need to
configure where xcode is install if you
go to eclipse preferences or a co you
need to I mean Apple require for all iOS
applications to be built using Xcode so
you need to have xcode installed on your
machine so you have to do it on Mac and
you need to point Eclipse to the
location of the path to Xcode
installation directory that's all you
need to do we pick up everything from
there for Android same thing you need to
download android sdk and point eclipse
to install directory for android sdk and
we pick it up from them
not right now it's not available under
these no not religious we have primarily
targeting eclipse and jay deliver yes
yeah so we do handle that we support
native Android back button the back
button click is interpreted as a
navigation room if you have at that
navigation defined in the navigation
rule that navigation rule will get
executed and when you are at the top of
the application then the application
will minimize and take you back to the
screen and on iOS you have to build in
the nav built-in then I build the
navigation into the application itself
so I mean you get two ways of navigating
with android on Android but on iOS you
use the application navigation features
yes
um I can't take this Java ME embedded
still is kind of cldc close to cldc it
still has the language subsetting and
virtual machines subsetting so you still
can't use for example class loaders and
there's no like serialization cloning
and all these there is language levels
of it's still the cldc so yes
just
an i was there is no cheating so we
don't see anything yeah Charlie
yeah so that we cannot do anything
see
yep there's a jit an Android yeah
there's a difference for sure
can you speak a little off
not that much I can give just a few key
things like for example encryption if we
use a lot of encryption which is pure
Java and if it is not Jeter it's
significantly slow but remaining things
again we have to consider the processor
speed and everything right so it's not
that notice where it's not in the
factors of Phi or anything probably
maybe ten percent slower or something
but if you're using like encryption for
example yeah we'll see like we are
noticing it it's pretty slow this yeah a
jitter versus non seated and pure Java
encryption you know like so with the
Java any version that we have in
production there is literally any
difference between Android and iOS and
we have a number of applications in
production as well that you can download
from apple app store yes
it said come in before the newer runtime
hmm for android is all art does not know
the remember we are embedding the vm
right the GT is compelling to whatever
the processor instruction is it has
nothing to do with the android so it's
it's compelling to the arm whatever arm
six or seven code
Oh
yeah so we are not using Android for you
I at all so if you're not using code
over for you I these are our own
component library it's a MX we call it
as a MX component library there are on
70 plus components available that you
can use to the road yeah it's our car co
specific component libreria so cordova
we use for gluing the HTML to the native
where we can use java so you're getting
platform independent and both and UI as
well as the backend code the business
logic code yes
and major difference between the
first
a big area yeah there is actually I mean
uglier this product was called as ADF
mobile but it has very little
similarities to area so we rebranded it
as mobile application framework and it
has a few similarities in terms of
developer experience but this has been
built ground up for mobile and it is
significantly different from IDF so we
have been you even change the name to be
mobile application framework ADF is
targeted for supper side applications
which you build on the server they do
render on mobile devices as well but the
application itself is running on as Java
EE server right whereas this the
applications built with this framework
are native applications that you deploy
on to mobile devices iOS or Android and
they run on the device
three
actually you can download the one that
is in production now we have a number of
samples videos to get you good
understanding of the framework that
target developers we are going off the
developers for enterprise application
developers who have expertise in Java
very little experience in HTML and
JavaScript so the minimum requirement is
Java and that's what that you don't need
to know no javascript and HTML it is not
a Java 8 yet squeeze this CVM which is
one dot for it's it's a fun yeah it's
everything that you can do yes except
that Java code is it has to be one
knowledge on making its wondered for him
yes
the plastic
sorry can you come again I'm not for
development for both but for production
there is a license cost I can share the
details with you guys after the session
yes
there's obviously
what is
on iOS we have not seen the big
performance you happen within Oracle we
are building fairly sophisticated and
complex applications of CRM human
capital management these are fairly big
gaps and Android with older versions of
Android like 2 dot 3 and below we have
problems especially in the UI layer
because of the limited capabilities of
the browser are the webview component V
rely on however with the latest iPhone 5
or iPhone 5s you barely see any
difference between native apps versus
these hybrid apps and on Android also
for dot onwards we don't see much
difference and especially with KitKat
for dot 4 with the chrome rendering
engine Android is significantly faster
and there is barely any difference
between native apps and there's
