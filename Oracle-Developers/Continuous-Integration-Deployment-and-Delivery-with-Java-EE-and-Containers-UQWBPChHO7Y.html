cloud evangelist at Oracle and today I'm
going to talk to you about continuous
integration deliver and deployment with
Java and containers but before we go
ahead let me explain to you what those
words really means in our situation here
for instance continuous integration is
when your code is always ready for
building ok is much more like a habit
when you are used to to have your code
always being committed to the main
branch and you always ready to be
building and generate your artifacts
okay so this one is continuous
integration for continuous delivery is
when you are artifact always ready for
deployment it's not automatically
someone you just you need to go and push
a button but your artifact is always
there we're ready to be tested on the
test environment or to be tried on the
the QA environment or even go to
production you're at fact is ready and
for continuous deployment is when your
deployment in any environment happens
without any human interaction so you
have a pipeline to my automatic
automated pipeline when your don't need
you to press buttons anymore you're just
going through the the flowing of your
pipeline ok so let's show you how it
will work in our context here using a
java application and also using Jenkins
ok so you have here a jank is already
set that we are using docker to run our
Jenkins here so our whole environment
here is using containers so first we are
using Jenkins for building our our
application when you want to use our IDE
anymore so let's call here beauty of the
application it's a maven project so we
are creating here a new job
but jenkees its base it on jobs so you
create the jobs for doing your your
activities your your expect your your
routines and so on
so here the obligation we are going to
get our URL from the project just copy
here and put here and then as it is a
mailing project we will have a pong file
there is inside this in this folder
let's copy put here okay it's fine
so if everything is working we can now
build our project and you can just
follow this log here and we will show
you the output from maven and from
everything that is is doing now with
this maven process of building our Java
project well these outputs quite like it
was in NetBeans so just change anything
so Jenkins has just built our our
application here okay so we have
automated this step for our popular in
the continuous integration help you are
already done it you are already
committing your source code to
depository we have done it here ok the
repositories on github so now we need a
step for really after we have built our
application we have a step to created
our containers and run our
run on containers okay so we just need
here one more step on our build for
building our container we build the
application we need to build the image
for our container so we just go into the
code show and we do that part and we use
a pseudo as we are
drinking's environment and we just need
to change the rectory here and go to
studio and do a doctor boot and let's
check it and view it again so it will
again download the source code and build
application and once it is done it will
build a new image for the Jenkins for
the application that we are ready under
Jenkins so that's it it's running our
application is good okay so we have
built our application and we have also
built the the image for the container
that's great so we are almost there
so what we just need now it's a new job
for running our container so let's
create another one it's a freestyle
project
and we just need a shout to be executed
and we can go come here and copy those
comments that will remove the container
and then we will create another one I
just may be a co here so let's click
boot and wait it is that okay there is a
railroad is not a rarer really because
there's no container that's why I
decided no container to to remove that's
okay
so it running and finish success so now
we are almost ready for for continuous
deployment we are also already ready for
continuous delivery here as we have
automated our building in our deployment
but we still need to do it by clicking
buttons okay so what we are going to do
now is to take off the take out this
needy of your clicking buttons okay so
what we are going to do here is going to
the build project Beauty job and we are
going to tell the Jenkins that once we
are done here
we have a possibility action that is a
trigger that will run our another
another job here let me check the name
I'm Peter brand and we are okay
range of a container and then we just
pretty here trigger without parameters
just when I need to to round so we try
there debuted again
and we follow the output we do the same
process again we download we'll build
and then we'll build the the image and
once the meals I built it will call the
another job true will run the containers
so it is doing right now you can check
it here so here we have the other job
that is already already running and so
as you say as you saw we have here this
those both jobs just when you you try a
beaut and it's done successfully you
just moved to the run and build the
containers so there is just one piece
that is missing for a real real real
automated pipeline a real deployment we
just need to make the build step also
automated so there are some some options
one of those that we can do it it's for
example as key the the Jenkins to do it
like on each five minutes okay
so we are okay we just done it here and
Jenkins will run on each five minutes
and we'll build we were generated a new
image and we run containers and our
whole pipeline is really automated any
we are ready for continuous delivery
continuous integration before in
delivery and then deployment okay so
thanks for watching see you next time
bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
