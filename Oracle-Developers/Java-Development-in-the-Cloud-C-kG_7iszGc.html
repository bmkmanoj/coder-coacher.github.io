first off welcome glad you're here
nice looking audience my name is Dana
Singletary and this is Shrikant salaka
here we're both product managers at
Oracle in the developer cloud group and
what we're here to talk to you about is
applicant our application lifecycle
management in the cloud and why you
should be thinking about this so we'll
start off with what the challenges are
that's facing development organizations
such as some of yours then what the
Oracle cloud ecosystem is some of the
use cases for a developer cloud
environment and then we'll have a
demonstration which will provide us an
interactive demonstration but between
Shrikant of myself we'll hold questions
to the end I'm sure we'll have plenty of
time for questions if you have any so
why should you be thinking about moving
to the cloud where there's a number of
reasons and I'm sure we don't cover all
of them here in this slide but you know
that the obvious things are cost you
know both from intellectual property
from an infrastructure from the the
bodies that you have to get to to
install this stuff configure this stuff
to provide you with the tooling to
manage your applications and to provide
for continuous integration and
continuous delivery of your applications
so acquiring hardware and software
that's without a doubt one of the key
aspects that you should be thinking
about and why you should be looking at
this this technology set up an
installation of components well that's
no triple trivial matter especially when
you're talking about things such as you
know task management your continuous
integration tooling your collaborative
tooling you know being able to build and
deploy applications things of this
nature
so it's a lot to wrap your head around
when it comes to installing configuring
the hardware but even more so probably
when it comes to the software itself and
then connecting all these components
together to get the
to work together creating associations
between you know files that you're
checking in and building and then if you
have a failure how you track back to
what actually caused that failure then
to carry it a step further configuring
your IDs and connecting to various
environments and maintaining and
upgrading versions and connecting to a
deployment platform or multiple
deployment platforms which is the case
with a lot of you you know you you don't
have just one app server that you're
trying to deploy to you may have a qaf
server you may have a production or
multiple production environments for
different types of applications well how
do you handle that and then what are
some of the organizational process
challenges and and what does an
application lifecycle management cloud
tolling provide you with well one of the
key things is the ability to achieve
process agility ok building these
applications on the fly you can
configure it to build an application on
on every check-in if that's what you
decide to do so things like this
producing better applications that's key
streamlining your deployment managing
your teams and your developers and being
able to track back to a developer that
checks something in that may have broken
something and find out what went on so
this is what this type of totally
provides you with team communication
it's it's a true collaborative
environment that we're talking about
well what is the ideal solution the
ideal solution is an integrated arm
solution integrated ALM components
configured coupled together working for
you without you having to maintain or or
upgrade or do things of that nature
quick startup time and easy per bit
provisioning across the board from
creating a project pushing your source
into that project creating a wiki to to
track documents and track you know
communications between other developers
creating configurations for deployment
creating
repositories for storing your code
things of this nature minimal
maintenance costs that's one of the keys
here you don't have to pay for the
infrastructure you don't have to pay for
the people to maintain the
infrastructure and maintain your
software you also get informative
tracking across the board of all
development activities I've alluded to
this already and we'll see how this
works in the demonstration here in a
moment
seamless deployment either in the cloud
or on-premise it's up to you
it's your choice and then flexible
flexibility of cloud solution so ok so
that's that's something else that you
want to think about well what is
Oracle's developer cloud solution and
and what does it provide this is
certainly not all of it that I'm showing
you right here but it's a development
platform that's provided as a service
pass platform as a service that's what
this is for application lifecycle
management and team management so what
we provide you with is source control
management issue tracking Hudson
continuous integration and we'll take it
a step further and call it continuous
delivery we'll talk about that another
slide here in a moment and then wiki
collaboration well Oracle cloud is built
on four there's there's four pieces to
Oracle cloud what we offer
there's the platform services your
application services social services and
then underlying all of this is the
common infrastructure services ok this
is definitely unmatched breadth depth
and choice for you guys ok you pick what
you want to work with here
so talking about a transformation of the
development experience with Oracle cloud
and really what we're going to focus on
is the developer services here but this
is integrate enterprise-grade hardware
software and management infrastructure
from database services Java services
developer services messaging on and on
and on so this is what we're talking
about now what we're going to do is
actually start drilling into the various
aspects of developer cloud services and
what some of the use cases are for this
so there's there's three use cases that
we see you could probably come up with
another one or possibly a couple more so
extending and integrating your oracle
SAS applications that you guys are Java
developers you may not be using any of
the existing Oracle SAS applications you
may not care about that you may just be
interested in this from okay I want to
build the Java applications I want to
employ deploy it to the cloud or
on-premise well that's that's great and
that's our second option here our second
use case but for the first one what
we're talking about is pre integrated
deployment setting up correctly for your
java and if you're familiar with ADF I'm
going to mention that a couple of times
ADF deployment within fusion
applications okay and then templates for
fusion applications those are going to
be coming available in the near future
to allow for quick and rapid integration
with fusion apps customer relationship
management human capital management
things like that but what I'm sure
you're most interested in since you're
here at Java one is Java EE Java EE
development so here automated deployment
through continuous integration with
Hudson familiar infrastructure that
you're working with and monitoring and
management managing your Java cloud
instance and your deployments and and
seeing what's going on there with your
deployments then another use case here
is integrated arm standalone developer
cloud service and this is a hosted no
setup type of experience with team
collaboration and management so that's
the three use cases as we see it that's
not necessarily what we're providing
with developer cloud service some of it
some of it we are and you'll see this
bigger picture as we drill into the
the rest of these slides here so what's
the target audience for developer cloud
service across the board whether it's
Oracle solution or some other solution
well the audience here is without a
doubt small IT shops that you know that
are developing these one-off
applications that they may develop
rapidly and five to ten weeks and then
shutting down that project shipping that
source to their customer you know that's
that's one possible scenario second one
which I already mentioned Oracle Fusion
apps customers and partners a much much
bigger scale environment and then the
last one service integrators of a much
larger scale than the first one that I
minute mentioned here benefits once
again I don't really need to go through
all of these I've already talked about
them in the previous slide you get the
idea elimination of costs setup cost and
management cost that's that's really the
idea here so what does Oracle's
developer cloud service provide you with
well simplification of development with
an automatically provisioned environment
at a number of other options here you
have both your web-based administration
tools with your web dashboard we'll see
that here in a moment you also have your
integration with your IDE s and the IDE
s that we use at Oracle are threefold
JDeveloper heavier-weight it's the
fusion middleware IDE of choice
especially if you're doing fusion
applicate fusion applications
integration Eclipse our Oracle
Enterprise for PAC pro clips which
without a doubt has the greatest
integration with Oracle cloud today
JDeveloper and NetBeans will be catching
up in future releases and then of course
NetBeans now what you get with
JDeveloper and NetBeans is get
integration at this point and deployment
to the Java cloud service with eclipse
as we'll see you get a very very rich
integration just about everything that
you see in the web dashboard you can
actually do within eclipse so I skipped
one little thing here collaboration and
management so integrating your team
source repository
newest integration with breakage
notifications if your build breaks you
immediately get feedback you can drill
into that and you can find out what is
the root cause of that breakage and then
also task and defect tracking tracking
with activity streams and notifications
on your dashboards and we'll see that as
well
then last but not least is deployment
automatic deployment to your Java cloud
service or on-premise application server
so this is kind of the day in the life
of a developer and the scenario for
using an arm solution whether it be in
the cloud or on-premise the idea here is
a project is created a developer
actually commits something to their
local repo they push that up to the the
repo in the cloud then that application
builds they may do do something like
configure a build for that application
if it's not already configured they may
create some tasks check in some or do
some work on those tasks check in code
commit that once again push that up
ultimately the idea is once all of this
is done any branching that takes place
merge back into the master that
application could be built and then
deployed to your Java cloud service and
then of course going all the way back to
your developers the ability to track and
monitor what is actually happening with
all aspects of this process from tasks
to deployment to building and so forth
well why does uh should you be thinking
about continuous delivery you know
continuous integration is being here
while the neck and continuous
integration you want to look at
balancing developer needs but when you
start talking about continuous delivery
we start talking about balancing
management needs of what matters here
manageability security performance and
scalability visibility legalities and
intellectual property things like this
so continuous integration has been here
for a while right
now the bigger picture is looking at
setting up automated tasks with
continuous testing automated deployment
with continuous delivery deploying to
your QA environment to your production
environment and so on with performance
enhancements all on the fly possibly
every time a piece of code is checked in
right
not necessarily deploying the production
but anytime a piece of code is checked
in you could be running a build job and
rewriting a deploy job to your QA
environment for example that's kind of
the idea well one other piece here that
we have that we should definitely talk
about is our Oracle Java cloud service
well there's a couple of things to keep
in mind here once again you can deploy
to our Java cloud service or you can
deploy on premise and Shrikant is going
to talk about the pricing model for all
this after the demonstration but
developer cloud service is a free
entitlement and I'll just leave it at
that
but with JCS you have fast self service
application building testing deploying
and scaling as needed if you need to
scale your environment up beyond what
you have you can actually pay a little
bit more and scale that environment up
as needed standards-based Java EE
support it's no brainer there and then
enterprise-grade with superior security
and so forth so what are the interfaces
for this well I've already talked about
quite a few of these you have your
interfaces within JDeveloper within
NetBeans within Eclipse we're going to
demonstrate Eclipse to you today you
have your web dashboard interface you
also have the ability to leverage rest
interfaces SSH to get &amp;amp; my linh is the
tooling within opie that does the
integration for you for with the
developer cloud service and then some
partner integration functionality as
well so with that I kind of went through
these rather quickly so we're definitely
going to be saving some time for QA at
the end or maybe extending our
demonstration so with that I want to
turn it over to Shrikant here and we're
going to walk through a collaborative
demonstration for you guys
thank you okay so I think you got the
basic idea of what we are trying to do
here is a collaborative development
activities to figure out how easy it is
to set up a developer service instance
and the regular tools that you will be
using the IDS you're familiar with will
be using Eclipse and all the other
source code repository and all the other
interesting systems are all
standards-based like git repository and
Hudson again is the standard space so
all these are all familiar tools that
are well made available so there is no
major learning curve to move to
developer cloud service so to start with
as dana was mentioning earlier when we
initially started with the whole Oracle
cloud the first thing he told about all
the services that are available in the
multiple layers that are part of Oracle
cloud so I would like to quickly so this
is the dashboard when you log into
Oracle's my services page where you will
see all the services that have been
provisioned so in this case we are
seeing the developer service the Java
cloud service and the database cloud
service so today we are going to mainly
concentrate on developer cloud service
but the remaining two are also as part
of the platform as services that Oracle
cloud provides and the good part about
all these three that all three are
working together so you don't have to do
any major set up for your application
container the Java cloud service
automatically works with the database if
you have any persistent objects that
need to be stored in database and
similarly I will show how developer
cloud service integrates with
the app server container and how it is
easy for a developer or a manager to
start working with Oracle past services
so here I'll launch the developer cloud
service URL so this is the main landing
page of a developer cloud service so in
the earlier slide that denna has showed
we talked about what are all the
services that we are providing in a
project so each project consists of all
the key element is that you need to
perform here is a list of all the
projects that you can you as a developer
or you as a manager will be part of this
is the listing of that page and you can
control who will be participating in a
project whether that project is a
private project where you want to
restrict the number of users in your
organization or it's an organization
public project where everybody will be
able to see the details about the
project but not contribute to the source
code so we have authorization security
levels defined at the project level as
well so let me show you quickly how to
create a project and how to get started
so this is where you will be providing a
details about what the project would be
about which is published in the home
page which I'm for everybody to see the
details and this is the privacy or the
authorization rules that I was
mentioning earlier where you will say
whether it is a private project or
organization private in the sense it is
available for everybody in the
organization but still there are
restrictions there who can push the
source code who can view the source code
who can create tasks so there are more
restrictions based on these two options
that you select so for now I am just
selecting a private project and the next
interesting concept is the templates
that we have so we saw like Dana
mentioned that you can create a fusion
application-specific template which will
give you a head start in creating your
project so what we do is pre populate
your repositories for sample code sample
documentation on how to extend a fusion
application similarly there are multiple
templates that we are shipping like if
you want to build a soup services
project we create some sample soap
project and we you can use it as a
starting point so the get code the git
repository gets populated with that code
for your project to get started so
similarly we are planning to have
multiple templates here which you can
use to kickstart your project so in this
case I will just choose a simple soap
service project and the next part is to
set up project level properties like we
support a couple of wiki markup
languages textile and confluence so you
can choose what your this property will
set the wiki language for all the wiki
pages that are getting created in the
project so right now this is one of the
properties but as we go along we plan to
add more properties like app server
container if your project it needs to be
tied to only certain app container like
a development environment where you are
trying to allocate certain app
containers to certain projects
you can set set up that level of
properties here so as we go along we'll
be adding more properties and more
security details into this when you are
creating the project so once you created
the project what we are trying to do
here is we are enabling all the services
behind the scenes so as each service
gets provisioned we just will turn the
gray bar to active so all the hardware
has already been set up all we are doing
is just creating the template for you to
make it ready to start working so once
this is as simple as that now all the
services are ready so instead of you
setting up the hardware for your git
repository when you started the project
it's as simple as clicking the button of
creating a project and all the services
are ready to use so Hudson is ready the
source code system is ready for you and
the deployment continuous deployment all
the interesting pieces are already ready
here so this is the home page of a
project since this is a fresh project we
have created there is not a lot of
activity here what I would do is go to a
project that we have already created and
we'll show more interesting details
there so in the home page you
essentially see what are other
repositories we also provide a maven
repository which you can use to store
your artifacts that got built in Hudson
and we have provided the URLs on how to
connect to the git repository and using
SSH or HTTP and similarly the maven
repository URLs and the right side is
the most interesting thing that is very
helpful for both project managers or
even developers to see who has done what
activity in this project lately right so
if somebody has checked in a code or if
something has broken a build has broken
you would immediately see it in the
activity stream here so it enhances the
collaborative nature of the work that
Dana was mentioning
here and you will also see all kind of
review activities build broken
activities and deployment activities
here going into the dashboard it drills
down into more details of from what we
have in the home page it shows like who
has committed most in the recent past
what were the tasks open
what were the tasks closed and how many
comets have happened so all these
interactive tools which will help a
manager to know or to see the progress
of the project and keep a tab on what's
happening every day and here you will
see more details on the Activity Stream
the home page has a limited set in the
sense it has only last two days here you
will have more detailed activity stream
in the dashboard page similar we will go
into the demo with all of the tasks all
of the tabs but at a very quick glance
what I want to tell is the tasks is a
issue tracking system that we have it is
based on primarily on bugzilla but it's
mostly a homegrown solution and browsing
is the code browsing capability we have
developed a code browsing where you can
go into each file system and see there
were number of commits on that file
comments about that file and similarly
the most interesting and the most
helpful thing as a developer is the
review tab here we'll go and talk about
it more later and simply provide a team
management capability here so you can
invite people into the project and make
them either a participant of the project
or just a viewer of the project here if
you if you want to restrict the usage of
the project and now the main thing
coming back to the collaborative nature
I'd like to show how a developer's
activity gets kicked off I would like to
ask dinner to create a task a ratio and
assign it to me so that I can go into
IDE and show you guys how easy it is to
collaborate and work
okay I don't know if you can hear me
well how about now you turn this mic on
yes
hello hello hello
is that better okay I'll do I'll try and
speak loud so I just created one code
review task and assign that to us
Shrikant and now I'm going to create
another one so on the tasks tab here of
the dashboard it's as simple as creating
a new task you can also do this within
OB if you choose to and I will say that
this is something as simple as maybe
code review number two and I'll set the
status of this to new you can set the
priority of this however you choose to
severity so forth and then the main
thing here is assigning people to this
particular task so I'm assigning a
Shrikant to this and then give it some
type of description
so the interval he types there are many
interesting aspects even to the task
system here you can customize you can
add more fields if you have a company's
specific item here you can do it in the
admin tab we'll go to the demo there you
can add like if yours is if you are
following a iterative model you can add
iterations you can add various other
tags based on the releases so all the
tasks UI is also customizable here and
that that is a very interesting feature
that we provide so as you say this task
is created if I wanted to edit it I
could but then I'll turn it back over to
street cars to show you how he could
start working with these tasks so back
to the IDE
this is a standard familiar idea of
Eclipse and this is I have pre created
the connection to the Oracle cloud but
just to give you a overview we have a
Oracle cloud connection from where you
will be choosing your data center where
the developer cloud service is running
you will provide the credentials here
and once that is done your ID is now
connected to cloud and all the good
functionality that you want to do like
accessing the tasks or accessing the
source code repository from cloud
pushing back to it is all available now
to the IDE so I have already created all
the artifacts and now I will try to pull
the new artifact notice that Dana has
assigned to me and when I do go
synchronize we are hitting to cloud and
we are getting back all that new tasks
that have been assigned to me so as you
can see the collaboration now the book
item that he has created the tasks that
he has created is now available for me
in IDE all I have to do is open it
activate it activate the task and start
working and start working about the task
so in this case he assigned there it has
to make a code review I'll go ahead and
do the code review and also make some
changes to the
Java file that I want to push and the
interesting thing about our project
services we have associations between
all of the services by that what I mean
is from a task you can see all the
commits that have gone into that task
and from that commits you can go and
browse and see the file diff that has
happened from the previous version to
the new version and from there you can
go to the build and see what were all
the files that were part of the build if
something has been broken so what it
gives you is the ability to track down
to figure out like if a build has broken
if you want to see what may cause that
problem you can drill down from the web
interface I will quickly walk through
that web interface to see how we can use
that
oops I think I created some
do you see anything wrong here then
so if you have any local touch that you
want to run and finish the local testing
you can do that and because we want to
keep it short I don't want to run into
all those issues I just want to show how
you can push the code from here to the
cloud and how that ticks of a build
those are more interesting so I just
want to commit and I will provide a code
here updated and once I make the comment
I say commit and push so we are
connecting back to the cloud pushing the
code back to the cloud and as part of
that now we can also go ahead and close
the task saying the task has been
updated you can go ahead and say fixed
and you can add your comments
so what I'm trying to show here is the
ease of use for the developer the
developers are still in the their IDs
they don't have to leave that and
everything else is in the cloud so as a
manager or a product manager project
manager you don't have to come to IDs or
go to multiple places to figure out what
is happening you will see everything in
the web interface and as a developer you
will be seeing it in the IDE s
so if we now go back to the web
interface and if i refresh
so now we'll see in the activity now you
can see that I have made the comments
push the code and I have submitted to
the git repository all the details are
so I committed and you can see from here
what is a file that got committed or
what is the file and what are the
differences between the previous version
to the new version and the interesting
thing now I will be doing is going back
and creating a code review so I can go
ahead and create a code review and
assign it to my manager or my architect
to go for them and they will get a
notification from here and they will
come back and they will be able to see
the changes that have been made they can
either approve it make more comments and
it's interactive like you can see that
there are comments going on between the
developer and the architect here the
whole collaborative work can be observed
here and once the code review and
everything is complete the build job
would be kicked off and right now the
build has not been provisioned yet let's
give a couple of minutes per
you want to talk about anything about
the build dinner while the build
provisioning yeah so so basically what's
going on is and it's it's taking a
little time here for some reason but
during the provisioning process it will
create a build configuration for you
that you can you can further modify if
necessary if you're creating something
from a template is going to create that
build configuration for you from the
build configuration that was in the
template it's just a cloning process
right looks like it finally came back on
my side here oh yeah okay let me switch
into him alright so looking at this this
right here so if I select the build tab
you can see that the job here has built
successfully the last successful build
was two hours seven minutes ago what I
can do is if I wanted to kick off
another build I could easily do that
right here and schedule that so I'll
just select this real quick what this
does is actually add this job to the
build queue once a Hudson executor is
available it will actually start
building this application so while
you're waiting for it to do that you can
go ahead and do other things you know
maybe do some more development in your
IDE or create a deployment configuration
or look at a prior configuration and
start working with that and so now real
quick before you switch back you'll see
that it has found an executor it's
connecting to it it may take a couple of
minutes it may take five minutes to
actually build this but it's pretty cool
it's actually got it you can see that it
it actually is same connecting but it's
saying offline so it probably still be a
little bit longer before it before it
actually built this but we do have
existing bills that we can work with and
we can deploy so oh and it is building
now so it's only got it sorted oh yeah
so of the continuous delivery aspect
that then I was talking about earlier
where you want the bill to be
automatically picked the deploy
target to a particular environment
whether it's a development environment
or a QA environment where you want to
run the sanity test you would go ahead
and create a deployment option so by
that I'll quickly so what we provide is
a configuration option where you can
choose pick and choose what build needs
to go into which environment so the Java
server is here you can't edit once you
created - we are not saying a list here
I'll show in a create profile you can
pick a environment which you will be
targeting to deploy a particular build
if it is a daily nightly build that you
are doing and needs to be pushed into a
sanity test environment you can do it
here you can configure it here and you
will be automatically pick up once the
build is done and you are choosing which
artifact you want to push we will push
that artifact and get the deployment
working and you can set up a job in
Hudson again to run your sanity tests
again the again as that environment and
make sure then you can promote it to a
next environment where QA would be doing
functional tests so you can set up all
kinds of workflow and interesting rules
around using Hudson and the deployment
profile here and that way you are able
to continuously build continuously
deploy validate it and push and that
reduces the time it takes for you to
deliver your product and other thing
like we were talking about earlier
before we kicked off the build the
browse capability this is one of the
most interesting things that we have
built into developer service where you
can walk through all the code in the git
repository without going into the IDE so
you can just choose the git repository
you can pick the branch if you see that
there is a build issue in the building
you can figure out what file broke you
can come back to the browser see what
were the changes that were made and you
can
if if it is something you want to figure
out which task caused the issue you can
pinpoint to that issue
it's for some reason system has slowed
down a bit but yeah
so it looks like that job that I just
kicked off actually did just finish two
minutes and 47 seconds ago so we do have
a new successful build-out yeah
once that build is there you can go back
to deploy and use it the Lord you could
have set up a rule to take pick up that
build and automatically deploy to the
Java service container
well the pitch to Lourdes maybe we can
talk about the admin capabilities yeah
so looking at the build here so this is
the the bill that just it just occurred
you can see the the series of builds
here but wanted to delete this job
create a different job I could do that I
can easily get in here and further
configure this job so let's see if this
will come back here it is definitely a
little bit slower I'm not sure if it's
just our internet connection in here
which I wouldn't be surprised but um so
looking at this this is what a typical
job configuration looks like you know
you give it a name set up a description
for this let's see here you can set your
default JDK different things like that
select the repository that you're
actually going to be building down to
the branch level you can also set your
mating goals here as well so you can see
the goals that we have our clean ended
install which is basically just going
through the complete build process and
then also set what your your target is
going to be the Falls to archive and
what the name of that that war file or
your file is going to be in in this
instance so coming back to the source
browsing capabilities I was talking
about you can we have the full file view
and the blame view where you can see
what all the comments that were made
what were the commits that got it in so
that way you can come back and pinpoint
who actually caused the issue when the
build broke and then you can also see
what were all the commits that involves
this file so the association between
each of the service is the very
interesting capability that we provide
here so these were all the commits that
that particular file was involved in and
lastly but not leastly
one interesting thing is you don't have
to move your source code if you already
have like a github account and if you
you want to use developer cloud service
only for its continuous build and
continuous integration and deployment we
have a capability to configure
additional external repositories on
github so you will be providing the URL
here and you will be pushing your SSH
keys from which developer service will
be using that connecting to the external
repository and pulling the source code
so that way the capital you are getting
the capability of using an existing
repository but still utilizing all the
other interesting features that
developer service is providing so those
are the main items and the key takeaway
here is the ease of access the ease of
continuous integration continuous
delivery and the collaborative work that
promotes an Oracle cloud it if I could
real quick because a couple more things
so we're talking about the collaborative
aspects so further you can configure
your team so there's a team tab here as
well if you're switch over so you can
actually add new team members where you
would do this is back on your services
dashboard but what you've added yours
your your team to your particular
identity domain you could then go in
here and add team members to this
particular project promote them as
administrators or maybe just members of
a team you know maybe you're the only
one that's going to be the administrator
so different things like that we do have
a deployment out there so you can easily
drill into your JCS instance we'll see
how responsive this is right now but by
selecting on this particular deployment
it's it's very slow so we might not get
to that but the idea is is this would
take me to my enterprise JCS instance
and I could see what the if the
application has successfully deployed
there how long it's been up and running
do some further monitoring and
maintenance of this application and
actually launch this application from
that JCS instance and test it out so
this could actually be deploying to a QA
environment or development environment
or production environment it depends on
what services or how many different
instances of the Java cloud service you
have been provisioned for or whether
you're deploying it to an on-premise
environment things like that so yeah I
just wanted to touch up some of the the
team aspects and in the deployment as
well so coming back to how to subscribe
for this service as then I was
mentioning this is a free service it's
an entitlement as part of other path
offerings so if you buy Java cloud
service or messaging through cloud
services which are other path services
in Oracle cloud you would get this as a
entitlement and you there are
restrictions on the storage space and
number of concurrent executors based on
the provisioning that you buy and future
direction so what we have done today is
mainly in IDE right so we are also
working on a code editor in the browser
and other ALM activities for mobile
applications will also be made available
as we go along and integration right now
as more pass services from Oracle come
along our integrations with other cloud
services in Oracle will also be part of
this and right now the number of or the
software on a executor is constrained to
what we are putting on the executor from
Oracle side but as we go along there
we will give the flexibility of you
choosing picking and choosing custom
executors so you can put your own
software on the executor and you can
define your own build jobs so that is
the direction we are going towards
having said that we I think we have more
resources on the web to get more
information about our service you can
visit us at cloud.oracle.com slash
developer you have white papers
tutorials and documentation to get more
details about it and forums you can have
a post question we actually we're a lab
earlier this week in that lab is
available out on our learn more
tutorials tab so you can just go and
download that the prereqs in that tells
you the point you to where you can get a
trial instance of JCS along with
database cloud service and then the free
entitlement to developer cloud service
which will last for 30 days is that run
six to ten a sixty day okay so a little
bit longer than I thought so gives you
plenty of time to get out there and play
around with their did see you see if
it's something that a teacher
development scenario okay every open up
to you and I guess
so you are asking can we merge the code
from web is that the question
so yeah so the way when you do branching
and merging all that takes place within
the IDE okay it's not taking place
within the - the web dashboard itself so
you create your branches within OB and
then you can merge your branches in
master with Adobe that's right so the
repository itself has been provisioned
for you so when we created the initial
project you will see in the home page if
we go back
right oh I said marginal looking man
like I said to get told right so what
they want is a web-based interface for
merging yes notice yeah we heard about
that requests multiple times so with the
safe harbor statement we know about it
and we are looking into it right now
that's a good question that's a very
yeah
so this is the integration right now we
have with is with the application server
in cloud which is Oracle cloud and when
we hand it off to them we have the IDE
and everything which we keep a track of
and the deployment itself is being done
by the app server container at that time
so they will be figuring out if it is
down david rate and they would deploy it
once it's back up so it's a queue that
it not it normally that's not the case
because once you hand it over to them if
there is no down time it gets deployed
immediately we and it runs starts
running immediately but as you are
saying if for some reason if the app
server is down then it will deploy the
app once it is back up
so she's really talking about high
availability and being able to do hot
deployments without any downtime okay
yes so I think that's not part of the
discussion here but you should yeah we
can get back to you with you having to
adapt Sandler days yeah if you want you
to take a take a business what about
business cards before you leave and I
can follow up and we can find out what's
happening on the JCS side of things and
how they plan on handling that if
they're not already handling that
is it on the same branch or different
branches if it is so if it is on the
same branch the executors who they are
queued up right each build is queued up
so that once the first build is done
then the second build kicks off because
it's a queue and it depending on which
entitlement you get whether it's you
paid for JCS where you get a larger
sizing of DCs you get so many executives
for each one of those entitlements I
forget what the number is do you have
that slide that you can go back to so
you could kick off multiple bills and
okay so you get the two you can kind of
yeah
those yeah so in the page sizing and
when we say paid we're talking about
you're paying for JC s not for DCs you
get three concurrent Hudsonville so you
can have three bills for any
simultaneously yeah you bet if you would
you like to get a business card and just
so you can shoot me that email and I'll
follow up with them that would be great
that's a good question thank you
before we taking
so the normal flow that we experienced
written Oracle is you branch your code
out and it's not that review is the one
which you are asking to merge it into
the main branch the target branch so the
review itself you are doing it on the
branch doubt code so there is no way
unless you branch unless you push it to
the cloud we won't be able to pick the
code from your source code or your IDE
to do the different so the workflow
normally or it's a good practice to
establish is you branch out the code and
then you push it to the branch you ask
the reviewer to do the diff between the
main line that you are targeting and the
branch that you have created and once
they have prove then you push it to them
you can create it
that's one option like if you are if
it's only a point fixed it might not
make sense but if it is a long-running
fix yes
you will create a branch yes
alright there's none any further
questions thank you for your time and
definitely go and give it a try let us
know what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
