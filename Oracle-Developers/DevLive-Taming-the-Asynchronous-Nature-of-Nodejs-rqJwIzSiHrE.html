York City I'm Bob rue Bart with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
yet another interview with one of the
session presenters from today's event
and that session presenter is Dan McCann
thanks for stopping by
thanks all the folks at home what you do
with or I'm an Oracle developer advocate
I work on with a team of advocates
some of us focus on more core Oracle
technology such as sequel and PL sequel
and there's others such as myself that
focus on JavaScript and open source
technologies as well now your session
here the title is taming the
asynchronous nature of nodejs what is it
about the asynchronous nature of nodejs
it needs taming ooh good question
so node.js is often described as this
asynchronous language or framework and
the truth is it's a little bit more
complex than that
basically the JavaScript code that folks
run that actually runs in no jess is in
fact running in a single thread and this
event loop if you will and it's the way
in which the language deals with that
essentially offloading things such as
timers Network and disk i/o as well as
other i/o such as communicating with the
database this cannot be done in that
main thread in the main event loop and
so it has to be offloaded oftentimes to
background or worker threads sometimes
it can just no Jess can pull the
operating system but the talk was around
that and the different tools that
developers have within the language to
to handle those situations and it's
getting better over time
in your experience evangelizing all this
stuff what are some of the most frequent
questions you get about working with
nodejs
who I would say that's that's a big one
at least for new folks learning you know
how the language deals with the
asynchronous nature I would say another
important one is just how to connect to
databases at a talk to databases and
then just doing common things such as
writing web servers and taking the input
doing something with it then to produce
some
kind of output and a response those are
probably the core functions of note I
think most people start by creating web
servers learn to read and write files
connected databases and and then go from
there where necessary what's the one
thing that you hope people who see your
session take home the thing they jot
down
yeah so node version seven point six got
an updated version of v8 which is the
JavaScript runtime that comes from the
Chrome browser that new release or that
version of the eight includes something
called async/await which is a very nice
feature of the language it's really
JavaScript in general but we get it a
node and one of the great things about
it being a node is that we can
immediately leverage it unlike browser
based technology where you may be
writing JavaScript code that runs in
many different browsers many different
versions and you can't use the lady's
and greatest features immediately we can
do that a node so it's a great new
feature and the way that it works is
essentially there's a new keyword async
and you simply put that keyword in front
of a function declaration and then
within that function you now have the
ability to use another keyword called a
weight and a weight is a keyword that
built on top of what are known as
promises and and the node.js
architecture and or really just
JavaScript the language and so with this
ability now you can where you would
normally make a promise call and then
use then the chain you can just say a
weight promise call and on the very next
line await the next promise call and
these are asynchronous executions
they're running the way they've always
run and node which is to say sometimes
being Network IO they're polling other
times they're working on background
threads but the code is starting to read
synchronously again and it's far easier
to use than it's ever been and so even
something as complex is iterating over a
collection asynchronously which can be
done using recursion or some other
techniques other libraries it's just so
easy to do you have a simple standard
for loop and within the for loop you're
saying oh wait this call
it takes care of it for you and it's
essentially doing something quite
complex some black magic behind the
scenes to to make this work it's called
co-routines where it's stopping
execution of your code going somewhere
else and continuing execution and coming
back and and going on that next line and
your code one when the previous async
operation is finished beautiful
technology that I hope everybody's
looking forward to at this point it's
that and then a miracle happens it is it
is perfect time so what's on your
calendar where are you going to be
speaking next well Oracle code I'm not
quite sure if I'll be involved in any of
the others fingers crossed but I am set
up to speak at APEC to connect which of
amberlynn in May May 9th through the
11th okay be talking about JavaScript
there as well
all right good well it's good to see you
again as well and thanks for stopping by
thank you so much if you'd like to
attend an upcoming Oracle code event
visit developer oracle.com slash code
you'll find a complete listing of the 17
remaining Oracle code events around the
world plus information on how you can
submit session proposals for upcoming
code events for the Oracle technology
Network I'm Bob Roberts thanks for
watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
