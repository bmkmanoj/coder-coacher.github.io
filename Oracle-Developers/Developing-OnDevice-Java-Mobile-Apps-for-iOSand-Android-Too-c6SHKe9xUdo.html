of the product management team at Oracle
for what we now now organization is
basically called mobile and development
tools and frameworks and what we do is
we build tools and frameworks for people
to build applications then in the
basically past two years it's also
mobile applications okay em so usually
when we start this presentation for like
managers and stuff like that we start
with a lot of charts and graphs that
show them how important to mobile is and
then I figured out there is no point in
doing it for you guys because you showed
up for this session so which means that
you probably know that Mobile is
important right so em there are more and
more mobile devices being both more
people are basically expecting to access
their applications on mobile devices and
you probably have already customers
saying can I get the same screen that I
now have on my web page or whatever on a
mobile device so the assumption is we
need to do mobile development now one
thing to clarify ahead of time what I'm
talking about is building what we call
enterprise mobile applications which
basically means i'm not going to show
you how to build angry birds or temple
on all those type of things that's not
exactly the area where local is this is
what microsoft does and what will here
is basically to show you how to build
applications that can be used by
enterprises employees customers of
enterprises to access data processes and
manipulate them that's our focus and
that's what we're aiming to do em okay
so if you tell someone you need to build
a mobile application today the first
dilemma is to choose the right
architecture for the application and
probably a lot of you already know this
but I'm just going to set the stage
here in terms of getting all of us on
the same level of understanding of
architectures there's three major ways
to build a mobile application today the
first way and mobile application based
remains an application that you access
form a smartphone tablet something like
that because yeah I'm basically walking
on my laptop and its mobile it's very
lightweight and I can go around with it
but the idea here is to build something
that is targeted at either your
smartphone or tablet so the first way
that people build those application is
using the native s decades which
platform has its own SDKs it's on Tools
its own frameworks it's on AP is that
you can pick up and write your
application with so if you're doing an
iOS native application you're using
Xcode is the ID and you're using
objective-c another than you think
coming up right and you build an
application for that platform and the
nice thing is that because you're using
the SDK from that platform you're able
to leverage every little point and thing
on the device they're not so nice thing
is that you built an application that
only runs on that platform okay and in
reality today in the market there's at
least two platforms you should be
considering iOS and Android potentially
there's a third one windows mobile oh
the various flavors of Windows and
mobile devices that you might also want
to consider so native is good for some
cases when things like accelerometer
response time in milliseconds those type
of things are very important native
might be the right choice for example
probably if you're going to build an
angry birds or temple and you should do
it in native but for enterprises native
is a little bit too expensive because I
need to have to development teams
learning to tools using two different
frameworks to infrastructures two of
everything if I want to do android and
iOS and well enterprises don't like to
pay twice so the other option that a lot
of rental prices started with is go
good what is referred to as web or
mobile web which basically means I'm
just building a web application and I'm
just accessing it from the browser on my
mobile device because you open safari on
the iOS or you open Chrome on the
Android and you have a full feature
browser can access your mobile app or
your web application without any issues
from the mobile device mmm and that's
approach is again it's suitable for some
cases a lot of like dashboard type of
application might be okay in those
scenarios but it has its limitation one
aspect is the whole user experience on
the device if you need your user to go
over open a browser type in a URL that's
a problem if you don't have presence in
the app store that's an image problem
right talk to the bigger organization
having presence in one of the app stores
is very important it's a way to a
promote customer loyalty for example
you're limited in what you can use for
example on device features there's
limitation on what you can access from
inside the browser okay you need to
remember that the mobile device today is
not just a browser it's a full-blown
computer it has offline storage it has a
camera and gps it has contacts it has
SMS capabilities and some of those you
can work your way around with in web
application access and some of those you
can't and the other user experience
usually of a web application is
different than what you get in a native
application so because of the downsides
of both native and web there was
realizing the third approach which is
called hybrid okay and hybrid approach
basically means that your application is
running inside the box a container and
the container runs on the device okay so
your application is running on the
device and not on the server like what
is happening in web application but
because they are uh need inside the box
you can write a single application and
learn it in different boxes on different
operating system as long as you have a
box that fits h one of the operating
syst
yo golden okay and if you talk to
Annalise like Gosnell and the other guys
they would tell you that most of the
enterprise application going forward for
mobile a public going to adopt I blade
because it gives them the best of two
worlds it gives them the best in terms
of portability and writing your code
once and gives you the best in terms of
actually having a good mobile experience
okay it might not be the perfect one but
it's pretty good right in a lot of cases
you want to be able to tell the
difference alright so those are the
three options so the next question is
okay if those are the options and I'm a
Java developer which one do I go with
okay and there's a little trick here
which is if I'm a Java developers I can
go and do android with sort of Java they
have their own flavor of Java there's a
whole legal issue I'm not allowed to
talk about between oh ok then landed on
that but hey that's one option but if
you're doing that you're kind of blocked
for my OS and I always still has a big
chunk of the market so maybe it's not
that great I know Java so i can write a
web application i'm pretty good there
but again we talked about the limitation
of a web application in terms of being
actual mobile experience and when you go
to basically almost any hybrid solution
out there the language that they will
tell you to codeine is JavaScript and
build a UI with html5 and JavaScript has
java in the name but it's not java so
it's not exactly what i'm looking for is
a java developer so then the question
becomes what if there was actually a
solution that will allow me to use the
language that I ordinal java ok encode
an application that actually runs on the
device ok and not only the language that
i know it's also very important to
leverage concepts that i know and we see
the creations of flails right Tojo's a
controller layer binding stuff like that
component base you
why to a poor two-component boss
approach to UI development so not
actually hard coding every little HTML
tag or stuff like that yeah and what if
I could use also the ideas that I'm
already familiar with namely eclipse or
jdeveloper you fill in the Oracle camp
and what if i can still leverage their
features on the device and have a good
experience whether i'm online or offline
the answer is that you can okay this is
what we call the Orkin mobile
application framework so the orkin
mobile application frameworks allows you
to do is develop a single application
that runs on multiple devices the trans
on iOS and Android today okay the same
application and the plan is to add
windows support in 2015 m in terms of
the development language you'll actually
be writing Java that's the language and
you're leveraging other technologies
like html5 and JavaScript but you don't
actually have to code in them and i'll
show you like when i'm building the
application in the demo part of this
session and by the way if everything
goes according to plan half of the
session is going to be an actual demo so
i'm starting with slides and then we'll
do them so you don't actually have to
code in html5 and JavaScript but you
could if you want to so the one slide
family of what is local mobile
application framework so much as we call
it it's a way for you to build a single
application that runs on multiple
devices whether their phones or tablet
whether they are iOS or Android the same
application it focuses on creating rich
you eyes in a simpler way by using
components basically the same concept
that you're familiar with we we feel
using jsf o swing or javafx or visual
basic all of those obviously using
components to lay out your pages and it
allows you to code in Java but if you
want to and you feel comfortable you can
also code in JavaScript and html5 and it
gives you a choice of development tools
allows you to walk online or offline if
you by the way if you work offline part
of the framework is an embedded sequel
I'd database
okay encrypted sequel I database so you
can store information locally on the
device and whether to work offline or
another reason that you might want to
store things locally is to improve
performance if every time that you need
to fetch the list of states in the u.s.
you have to go to the server and do a
rest request that's a lot of network
traffic if you store it locally on your
device it's faster it also focuses on
productive development by employing
concepts like reusable and common
modular approach to development so in
math you can actually do two types of
development then both of them can be
used in the same application and you can
do they what you might call the
traditional hybrid approach with html5
and JavaScript where your code is your
business logic is JavaScript till you
are you code in HTML 5 0 you might be
using the html5 component sets like
essential jquery mobile or whatever you
em you can access device features using
the JavaScript you still get security
aspects and those things but this is
almost every other hybrid solution how
do we do that what makes us unique is
the left side of the table which is the
mo declarative way where you're using
the Java as your language you use
components to build your UI you have
declarative way to access your business
services and data for remote servers
with the Quixote with offline and other
stuff right so the first thing is Java
on the device so as you know we don't
actually have a JVM that you can install
on iOS stand alone because Eppel doesn't
allow this but what they do allow is to
have as part of your application a
native libraries so what we did is we
actually creative a net created the
native library that is a JVM so when
you're creating an Oracle math
application part of your application
oh yeah is your application is basically
including a books like The Container
flow i would and part of these books is
a native library that can run you java
code and it's not any translation
there's other solutions in the market
that would take your java code do some
magic and translate it into another
language and then run it on the device
that's not what we're doing we're
running your java code as is ok so
there's a lightweight JVM it's not the
full JVM it doesn't have a Java affects
someone asked me Oh swing it's not in
there it's just called Java capabilities
ok and you use Java inside the framework
to code any place that you need business
logic so this can be for example all the
data objects the taxes your remote
servers maybe I am that basically
interact with web services less services
a java objects that work with the local
database so just java objects that work
with any other stuff you use java to
code any events in your controller layer
ok you have a controller lil someone
click the button in your UI you want to
do anything else you are they've done
else in java and and you also do java in
the life cycle routes of your
application so for example when you
initiate the application maybe you need
to do some setup things or when you
close the application you need to clear
things you can also call java do and
that's basically it in terms of java at
the end of the day what you get is a JVM
the trans the same jvm on Android and
iOS allowing you to run your Java logic
for user interface you have actually
three options of how to well you eyes
that you can show in the application and
the first one is using our set of
components to play the UI we'll talk
about it later on the second thing that
you can do is you can have html5
basically right local html5 pages that
are part of your application on the
device they render inside the device
inside the container on the device show
you the user interface and again you can
use any set of components for that one
and the third option is remote URL of
what we basically refer to as any
Content any HTML content that is out
there on the web you can bring it into
our container and show it as part of
your application and when it's inside
the container we can actually allow you
to have did this html5 access device
features through JavaScript API ok
because it's running inside our
container lenders in Dell it can
actually communicate with the platform
that you're running on but again the
more interesting aspect is actually the
first one hour set of components so I
can as a quite a lot of history in
creating UI components for stuff we have
probably the richest set of a JSF
components for example out of something
called the idea faces m for this
environment we now have over 80
components that you can use to build
your user interface and what you do is
you basically arrange those components
on the page using XML syntax just like
you're doing jess fo some degree like
you do in swing again and those
components that ever think for my
checkbooks radio button just simple
button input text output text layout
component for complex layout and
components that do gauges and charts and
maps and a bunch of other visualization
we put a lot of focus on visualizing
data and showing you it in meaningful
ways ok we try to do basically to allow
you to build those you is very easily
with a very visual approach to lay out
in your page at runtime those components
when they are using html5 and JavaScript
on the device ok and in some cases they
actually even use native UI widgets for
example the date component would show
you up which show up as a native
component though we did a lot of work on
am performance tuning those components
to make sure that the experience on the
device is as smooth as possible
supporting things like gesture support
with your finger animation type of
things that you would expect from a
mobile interface so that's your UI layer
right that's the view layer
then believes the view layer does the
controller and again with a controller
anyone here who did GSF or struts before
jsf or any other controller would
basically be familiar with the concept
you define your pages flows between them
you define events in the controller in
fact if you are familiar with JSF you'll
recognize concepts like a copse and a
managed means that you define here okay
in a very similar way to jf it's not jf
we're not running jsf on the device ok
but we're running the same concepts
because MVC is a good approach to build
your application and again we are trying
to let you build your page flows in a
visual way to increase productivity in
terms of having the application access
the features on the device ok things
like SMS and contacts and GPS and
Camilla we are using the Apache Cordova
architecture so Cordova basically allows
you to have a cross-platform interface
to access device feature and we
basically embed this into our container
so our container includes Cordova in
addition to things like JVM and other
stuff and what we did is we give you an
API to access this code over form Java
so you can basically write a Java class
that for example says get me on my
current local GPS location hey you can
write a Java class that sends an SMS
using the device feature we even went
one step further and beyond just coding
this you can also do it declaratively
you can just drag and drop in operation
onto your page and you'll have a button
that for example a sends an SMS now as
we take the other framework the
framework can take you that file and
sometimes you need just a little bit
more so we were very
well of the need in some cases to
actually extend and expand the framework
okay so for example we provide as said
about 80 UI components if there's a UI
capability that we don't provide you can
actually just implement it using html5
and JavaScript package it and use it in
your application going forward share it
among here the other developers okay and
if there is a device feature that we
don't support out of the box you can
basically pick up a Cordova plug-in and
add it to the environment okay maybe you
need a barcode scanner maybe you need a
heat sensor interface you can add those
into your application let's do something
called declarative customization so the
concept is that I built an application
for one customer and then I have another
customer that wants the same application
but with a few little changes that can
be anything for my want the logo to be
changed to I need a one mode tab in this
page what this button in this page I
don't need it so what we are actually
allowing you to do is define those level
of customization is a layer on top of
your application and then you can keep
one based application for everyone with
customization builds in layer on top of
that it also allows you to actually do
updates to the application what happens
is at runtime we read those
customization and apply them to your
application okay so this allows you to
actually do an update to the application
without the need to install a new
version we support push notification
that's the ability to basically send a
message to your device and then react to
it on the device so we're working with a
Google and the Apple push notification
servers and when their notification
arrives guess what you like some logic
to pulse it and do something this logic
is going to be in Java so there's
basically a listener event that you can
write and plug into that receives those
event reads the payload and that's
whatever you want it to do
security is very important to us and to
anyone who's building enterprise
applications these mobile devices have a
tendency to get lost much more than
other devices like how many of you
actually lost your phone compared to how
many of you lost your laptop and when
there's again enterprise that on the
device you want it to be secured if
there's an enterprise application that
allows you to access the enterprise data
you want that application to be secured
so what we allow you to do is we allow
you to define authentication so you just
check a box and say okay this
application requires authentication and
then you point it to a URL that does the
authentication it can be any basically
basic authentication or both or other
platform at a plateau calls to do this
and then you have authentication the
other thing that we are able to do is
we're able to do offline authentication
okay so think about this way let's say I
have an application on my mobile device
that does salary up salida vases and
it's okay i need to login in order to do
this I mean the office I can login i can
give raises what happens if i'm on on on
an airplane there's no network and i
still need to work with this application
is it because i can't login does it mean
that i can't access my application know
so what we are able to do is the first
time that you login we stow your
credentials on the device in an
encrypted way and then the second time
that you try to login in you're not
connected we compare the login that you
give us against the local credentials
and again those are the type of things
we can do automatically for you and of
course you can define a timeout of how
long I mean we are we keeping this
information on the device stuff like
that beyond on that occasion we also do
authorization so you can have specific
features in the application enabled or
disabled for specific words of
yourselves so the application when it's
used by managers get some of the
capabilities when employees use it gets
another set of functionality
we take care of encryption so all the
information on the device can be
encrypted all the communication between
the device and the server can be
encrypted and if you want even felder
security we integrate with the Oracle
mobile security SDKs that allow you to
do things like single sign-on across
multiple applications on your device to
do things like containerization of your
application so a manager can actually
decide which application and employee
has on his device things like that and
beyond having a framework we also
realized that it's very important to
have an easy way to use the framework so
we actually have support for local
muffing both jdeveloper which is the
oracle traditional ID or eclipse which
is a very popular ID among java
developers em beyond supporting the
frameworks what we built into those
ideas is also integration with the SDKs
of the platform so from inside
jdeveloper all the clips you can
actually package your application as an
AP KO IPA file and deploy directly to a
device or deploy to a simulator or debug
the application while it's running on
the device and set breakpoints in your
ID and beyond that we did a lot of
capabilities in terms of the development
aspect to make development as seamless
as possible as fast as possible and I'll
show you that in a minute so because
this is Java 1 i'm going to do the demo
with eclipse i just wanted to show you a
schedule of how it looks in jdeveloper
as you can see it's even more visual
than what you'll see in Eclipse like a
visual page editor stuff like that but
I'm going to show the demo in a clip so
we don't need to slide so that so this
is the overall architecture this point
everything should be clear I'll just
repeat it so we're all on the same page
again on the left side is your mobile
device on the right side is what you
might have on remote servers okay under
mobile device there's this box called
the math container that's where your
hybrid application runs when you
basically install the application from
the App Store what you actually in
stalling is the container with the code
inside it inside the container does the
UI layer which runs using webview
technology basically showing you html5
type of you is it can show you content
that comes from with motor oils content
that comes from local HTML files that
are part of the application all pages
that were created using gavel components
if you're using our components you also
get a controller layer that goes along
with it to give you the VC layers of MVC
your view layer can then talk to your
Java VM and invoke logic in the Java VM
it can also do it form HTML 5 pages
using javascript to Java calls inside
the Java VM you write your logic if you
want to access the sequel I database the
encrypted secure database you right JT
bicycles and you access the database if
you want to access the code over plugins
to the to access device features you can
again do it directly from the Java using
Java calls from the Java VM or drag and
drop from the AMX component pages and if
you have we support the Apple and Google
push services that basically when an
event comes in goes to the Java VM and
you write code to react to it
information usually to the devices
delivered under I flow either less those
soap services and again you can pass
them with your jvm and there's a
security layer in front of everything
and at the top there is something called
application configuration and imagine
that you built an application and you
now distribute around the world to
employees all over the world and you
need different locations to access
different servers this is what the
application configuration can do the
first time that you invoke the
application we can ask you okay where
are you okay and based on this we can
then configure aspects of your
application based on what you want it to
do so some customers would access this
level and others would access another
server so overall that's the concepts
now let's actually see it in practice
alright so for that part i'm actually
going to sit down and i have eclipse
here and this is not for me oh that's a
oracle enterprise pack for eclipse it's
basically a bunch of plugins on top of
eclipse that gives me additional
functionality you can also get them
separately and installing your current
eclipse and i'm now using the hotel math
way of development in eclipse which
means that I can't let me just make this
like this which means that I now have an
option to create a new map application
then do some zoo means for people who
are sitting in the chips it's at the
bakery so I'm creating any application I
did a demo earlier today which I call
java one so we'll call this one java to
em it's the computing conference and as
you can see as I go through the wizard
one step here allows me to say okay what
platforms are you targeting and you
don't have to say it up front you can
say it later or but right now I'm saving
it same application going to run on both
iOS and Android and I click finish and
then eclipse goes off and creates the
project structure for my application so
it configures everything and there are
several parts to this one aspect not let
me see if I can make it so you'll
actually be able to see without me
zooming all the time and let's see this
play
that might be a little bit and do it so
um one part of the application is the
high level application layer this is for
example where I will define startup code
and close down code and stuff like that
and a preference is about which device
feature I'm accessing and stuff like
that the other part is where I actually
go and defined my features so each
application can have multiple features
in it and when a feature is you can
think about it as a section of the
application it can be multiple pages for
example so let's create one feature in
my application that will call it the h-l
feature and then each feature can then
appear on my navigation bar on a
springboard things like that and each
feature inside it can have multiple
types of components right so as I
mentioned before it can be a remote URL
a local HTML file a single page of a
complete task flow controller lil which
is what i'm going to use i'm going to
create a task flow and we'll create a
new task flow and we'll call it the amp
flow okay and again for example one
feature might be this type of pages the
other feature might be remote eol so for
example if my online documentation is
hosted on the server I can add this as a
remote URL feature into the same
application so now I'm inside my page
flow edit oh well I can basically take
and start to design my pages so let's
create a list page and create another
page that will call it the glove page
and another page that will call it the
Camilla page okay and then I can go over
and say okay let's navigate from one to
the other so list is going to go to
graph when someone chooses child and it
going to go over to the camera when
someone choose pick and by the way when
I'm clicking on those navigation and I'm
looking at the properties there are all
sorts of things you can set one example
is what type of transition do I have
between pages and again you want it to
look like a mobile thing so one possible
transition is to do a flip where it goes
like this right other things are like
swipe and other capabilities all right M
so now i have the pages and by the way
again this is the visual view does the
sauce view which is basically just xml
defining all my navigation rules very
familiar to anyone who did jsf for
example let's do a list page okay so now
I'm going into the page designer I can
choose which components to have on the
page by default whether i need a footer
or not let's keep the footer in this
case and now I'm being taken into the
page editor now in the page editor I can
basically use all of those components
over here to drag and bring them into my
page right and there's already some
components on my page there's an output
text that has the header so I can go
over here and say the header should be
imp okay there's a bottom here I can go
over and say this button should say
chart okay and then there's another
button here and this button should say
pick pictures and again I can work with
the property inspector oh if you're the
type of guy who likes to code you can
just go and say let's do coding so the
action on this one should be a child
okay and the action on this one okay
should be pick so this is basically just
navigation from one to the other all
right let's take one of our layout
components to create a UI that is a
little bit more complex let's take for
example
the panel split-tail so we'll split the
page into two sections over here and now
we need some data in the page right so
multiple ways of doing it I can access
the web service or stuff like that i'm
going to do a very simple thing i'm
going to create a new Java class so
we'll just do a simple POJO killed
employee yeah I'm not going to bore you
with actually coding this so prickly put
a little bit of code here all it does is
basically just a bunch of properties
then getters and setters right so this
is your poacher and then on top of it
you're going to do an adder Java class
this one would be my service class or i
call it amps and my service class for
example can return a collection of the
employees and right now the collection
is just how to code hill and you can
change things here let's say okay I want
this salary to be 500 30 million 5,000
per ml m but this code can actually go
over and fetches information from the
local database it can go over and
fetches information for me less service
let's hope so this whatever okay and now
I can actually either take this Java
class and turn it into a managed we know
we also have another way which is you
can right click on it and say expose
this is what we call it data control and
in that a control what we do is we
actually introspect the class figure out
the structure of the data okay and once
we did this and we now if you're back in
your page designer inside the data
beyond accessing any managed beans you
can also access the amps object with the
amps collection of the hill right so
this is what i have here and now i can
just drag and drop it into my page so
let's put for example a list of
employees so we'll choose the list
component to represent this on this page
over here with a breakpoint in the list
and will show the name of the employee
and we'll show the salary of the
employee and we'll do a Break by name
based on the first letter and will allow
people to select a single rule and what
you get is basically a list component
with a bunch of output components inside
it if you're looking at the code and the
other thing I can do now is I can take
for example the same employees drag it
into the same page this time I'm going
to put it as a foam and we could be a
read-only form on an updatable form
which is what I'm doing now should I
need the form to be inside the second
part of the splittin like that all right
so that's my first page let's quickly
Kate to other pages graph page is very
easy to create all you need to do is go
back into the page first we need to
remember to add the button that would
navigate back to the first page because
otherwise we can show the third page do
this okay and then I can take the same
data that I had before the employees
this time when I drag it into the page I
can decide to drop it as a child and I
can create a belch out and let's do
salaries on one axis and then let's do
the name of the employee on the other
one so this is a child component in my
page and the third page is the Camilla
page and on this page what I want to do
is I actually want to access device
features so again i can write like a a
bit of java code that would go over in
wood for example access the camera and
do if then else or whatever but if what
i want to do is just a very easy mm
camera integration the same way that i
drag the employees from here i can also
drag device features okay and device
features can be things like creating a
contact or getting a picture or sending
an SMS or an email or whatever you let's
do the picture so we'll get the get
picture and drop it on the page as a
button okay so now we have a button that
will get a picture
to specify the quality and the source of
the thing also the destination the sauce
pick it from the local library of
pictures whether I'm allowing edit what
type of file the size of the picture
negative now because I actually added a
picture to my page i probably need to
turn on the picture access the camera to
access it say about it all right and one
more thing i also want to show the
result of this method which is the
return value from get a picture so we'll
drag this oval here and create an image
right save everything okay and this
stage I'm ready to one so i can actually
go over here and choose the line
configuration and i can also create a
new configuration just to show you that
at this stage this is the first time
that you're actually going to say okay
this application right now i want it to
run on android or iOS because now you're
actually packaging it in a pack in a
platform-specific package so i'm going
to do iOS deployment and click one right
okay what does it want
mmm Eclipse now files up an N script
that actually builds my whole project
compiles it package it into an AP KO IPA
file and deployed to the simulator
everything is done for me okay mmm then
what I want you to think about so far
like the goal he wasn't to teach you how
to build a math application but no off
to give you an understanding of the
experience okay you I construction you
take components like them on a page okay
accessing business logic you get simple
pojos again you can drag and drop them
into the page a device feature
integration you can do drag and drop at
the end of the day it's just a bunch of
code that you can directly manipulate as
well okay so there's no magical we're
not like click a button and generate
something in a bag on all we are doing
is just making your development easier
by eliminating you having to manually
type everything and if you think about
the concepts that i've been using you
should be familiar with most of most of
them right so we used components we used
pojo we use MVC you already know this
stuff you're a Java developer so here's
my emulator and if I slide to the left
here's my java to application now and
when i click on it on the Left I have
this list of employees okay and I can
click on an employee and see the details
on the right in fo I can do another
thing here let's actually rotate the
device and then the list become
something that is fixed on the side okay
you can see the scrolling if I pick and
I want to change the date I get a native
controller to change the date here click
on the chart oops this is how you know
it's a real demo yeah let's click the
picture allow to take a picture pick a
picture choose and it's part of your
application
so this is the experience of developing
an application in about 10 minutes which
is nice and impressive no no this is not
the hello world that you see in other
demos this is a full-blown multi pages
navigation a device integration stuff
like that what I wanted to show you
beyond that and I don't remember which
project Oh a little weight to it they
told me when I put in my password not to
show it on the screen yeah you learn
stuff slowly right okay this is my iPad
I wanted to show you one other
application that we built that looks a
little better than what I created
because I'm not a great UI guy and this
is again kind of an HR system where you
can see various department in various
representation on the top left you have
what we call in n box so this is the
ranking of the department based on
performance on the bottom riders what
they call it limit which represent the
salary based on the size of the salary
for department you see it displayed
there you have the location of various
departments on a map and then you can
click this location your finger is not
as fat as my finger let's click over
here okay and you can actually see who's
working in this department this is kind
of a Boeing Department let's look at
something a little bit more interesting
let's look at the IT department okay you
see the manager you see the employees
how they are linked okay you can see the
schedule of this department and this is
what we call it tagline component again
this is all built-in components that you
get with the framework so I can see
exactly what is my time of plan for the
next several month for this department
you can see my team structure I can pick
a specific employee click on it and see
the ranking of this employee where they
are located and again this is a google
map using our map component inside your
application okay see their performance
rating see their compensation child's
and see if they have any team members
they don't have rent and then you have
like a springboard and you can also see
where are all the department based on a
global
a map and a bunch of photo stuff okay so
which where is every employee on the map
yeah so this is the type of you guys
that you can get with a little bit more
time than what I had few other things to
say some people ask me okay is this
ready for production the answer is we
have about Hamlet applications that says
one dick store right now okay so if we
go to the apple store you'll find a lot
of applications coming from overkill
already from various sections inside
overkill a you'll find applications from
our customers they're already people are
using this in production ability it does
no problem in uploading those to the
itune we like we know how things work
it's important for you to understand
that this is how oracle builds i will
own enterprise application the mobile
aspect of them okay so we know it works
we know it's very important for us that
it would work properly and we believe
that what we have should be very
appealing to you guys as well and one
more thing I wanted to show you go back
you em okay so this was the demo of math
application development in an
application a one more motivation to try
out this thing if you want to win money
here we just announced a math developer
challenge you have the URL their weekly
math challenge first prize is six
thousand dollars but it's okay fearing
for the second part it's just way k but
it still buys you in new iPad so let's
find em so that's one way then the next
question would be okay how do I actually
learn this stuff and again what we're
aiming to do is make it as simple as
possible all our resources the online
free you can download the product and
try it out as much as you want a build
your own little application and try them
out em there's step-by-step tutorials we
have to our online crash course about it
if you have more time with a youtube
channel with about more than 40 videos
right now
that would teach you every little aspect
of the framework we have of course the
full documentation this is a product
this is not open source the
documentation they don't care about this
is an ocupado there's a full
documentation and they are also like a
professional to buy books out there on
the Oracle puesto and if you want to
learn more there's a demo ground both
here at javaone we will showing this and
you can come and ask more questions and
if you have a past that allows you to
get into open world you can also do
hands-on lab on those things doing this
week any questions yes it's just of the
UI aspect yeah yeah so we're not sure
about the previous can now experience
with eclipse guys is that they like to
code okay and so the previous screen is
an option we'll still haven't decided if
we will do this in terms of commitment
to eclipse I give you the best example
we just released last week a new version
of the framework we released it in there
in jdeveloper two days later on it was
in Eclipse we're very committed to the
Eclipse thing yeah yes yeah if not if
not all is good that's basically thing
again what you need to understand is
that our laps are using this if I will
up stop walking on iOS 9 we're not in a
good position so this is already
supported on iOS 8 our applications run
on iOS 8 will part of the better for
which new version we test it make sure
that things work eh if something doesn't
work yeah of the licensing model M this
is not free okay which usually at this
stage half the audience goes away right
hey but I need to feed my kids so that
they'll em okay how does it license em
first of all development is free you can
pick it up develop build everything play
with it as much as you want there is no
technical limitation and no legal
imitation okay you can even go
production with it without paying us
but then you'll actually be breaking a
license technically it's possible right
they Liza just the thing I usually say
here's the talk it has a full flow in
one of our buildings that is full with
lawyers alright so that's the one thing
Tramel the licensing for this is pair up
so you built an application you put it
on the stove and then you pay us then
you can pay us in two modes one mode is
if you say I have a limited number of
users like I know there's let's say 20
people that are going to use my
application inside my department this is
one license you pay per user the other
licenses are limited number of users how
many users you want like you play it on
the put it on the public stall it
becomes the next Facebook we don't care
you paid us once no matter how many
customers are using us you only pay for
the application there is no silver that
you need you don't need to know kill
database you don't need the weblogic you
don't need anything else okay if you
event a software vendor you can also get
a license that includes this as part of
your product so this technology is
embedded in the product that you're
selling and then there's a huge discount
on how much this actually costs okay
nice and thing is still the same but
with a huge discount if you want the
exact place talk to your account manager
at Oracle my recommendation is talk to
him around the end of the quarter they
give where a better discount at that
point of time but yeah yeah there is a
license to this yes hmm not right now
right now the Java that we're learning
is jdk 1 dot 4 it's based on the j2me
spec in 2015 we are going to jump
directly to jdk 8 yeah so that's the
plan yes salvadorian
oh the conference application now they
actually outsource it to another company
they didn't give us a chance to write it
so that's the advance team day that they
basically don't talk to us the events
team they just go over and build
whatever they want them the question is
why would you need Java fixing this
scenario because the user interface that
you're building heel which uses html5
and javascript is perfectly fine it's
the way that most mobile hybrid
applications are built and we're giving
you a set of components just you would
get like you will get in javafx if you
would include javafx inside the JVM it
would make the JVM bigger it's a little
problematic in that sense it's an option
that we can consider we will not show
that there's value in that okay yes yeah
you can actually set the memory size and
stuff like that so there's a folder that
controls it you can tell it ok you're
starting in debug mode and this is the
pod at your debugging in and then you do
remote debugging against this jovian
right I can see that some people are
already going so M that's basically it
if you're interested get it from our
website come to our demography want it
there and if you have any further
questions i'm here just come over and
ask them thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
