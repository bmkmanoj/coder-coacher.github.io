here at Oracle code Los Angeles I'm your
host Javed Muhammad and I have as my
guest today your Asst she'll connect of
you just telling me off-camera you are
from in Belgium was the name of the city
again yet Ghent what's the weather like
out there
it's usually rainy cloudy and like semi
cold okay sounds I grew up in Manchester
England it sounds very very similar so
it's welcome to California thank you so
you have a talk about blockchain and
tell us a little bit about it talk is
about digital documents and distributed
ledger technology uh-huh so a slightly
more generic term than blockchain and
the idea is based on a concept that
we've encountered with customers and
real-life startups where digital
documents and especially signatures and
digital documents are used in a way that
would be much more suited with
blockchain technology so you said it's
something more than that
so isn't like distributed Ledger's just
a part of blockchain is a blockchain is
a part of distributed ledger technology
okay but there are also new technologies
and new endeavors like hash graph which
is a generalization of blockchain
blockchain essentially only builds a
tree like structure and hash graph
allows you to build a fully connected
graph that has several advantages in
terms of speed and distribution over
blockchain okay so so your technology or
the is basically deals with about the
security aspect of putting in signatures
and making sure there's it gives what
the authentication of this we'll dive a
bit into the syntax of PDF documents
uh-huh but essentially if you put a
signature in an electronic document for
instance if you want to sign that you
agree with an invoice you are current
you are calculating a hash value of the
document you can choose the hashing
algorithm and then you sign it using
public/private
key cryptography and then that signature
is added into the document the problem
with that is that in order to verify
that you the physical person corresponds
to the public key that signed it we need
a central certificate authority and we
also need a time stamping server in
order to be sure that you signed it at a
certain date rather than your local
computer time which you could falsify
mm-hmm now in the past especially the
central certificate authority has been
hijacked or they have very loose
security measures that essentially allow
ex-employees for instance to get away
with their private key which means that
suddenly all of these signatures that
are certified by that central central
authority are no longer valid or can't
be trusted anymore and with book chain
you can build a web of trust kind of
approach so that you no longer have to
have a central authority but your
validity as a person tied to this public
key can be certified by a lot of people
and you can assign degrees of
probability that this person corresponds
to this public key so that's already one
big improvement a second like I said
more practical concern that we see a lot
in our support board is that in PDF
signatures have to be sequential like I
said you always calculate a hash value
of the document and that means that if
we both need to sign the document one of
us has to start to calculate the hash
and then send the document to the other
person who then calculates the hash
based on the original document plus your
signature sounds very complex is this
good is there gonna be like very
specific high def in our audience for
this kind of application or we sell a
lot to banks insurance companies local
governments uh-huh like I said the
validity of these signatures is
definitely a European thing but it has
use cases beyond just digital documents
and Beyond signatures as well one of the
more earthly or common use cases at
least is that you can have sort of a
versioning system with blockchain mm-hmm
you could have a plugin for Adobe which
is the most common PDF reader that
automatically checks the blockchain that
the document is linked to and then says
I see that you
longer using the most recent version of
this document I've contacted the
blockchain and it has a record that
proves that this document version is
newer
would you like to download that one or
you could have a plug-in that
automatically checks the signatures and
says the document has now been signed by
these additional people that you can't
see in this version but there are
present on the blockchain mhm
so obviously the a lot of the attention
for blockchain comes from Bitcoin yes
how does this does your technology
factor into that at all at one point we
thought about how are we going to
monetize this and I guess more more than
Bitcoin is just C so at one point like I
said we thought about how are we going
to monetize this because we are after
all still a company it's important that
we don't do things gratuitously
and the idea was indeed to have
transactions validated by miners in the
same way that Bitcoin does that and
offer them a kind of micro payment that
other companies that want their
documents verified have to pay upfront
but then later on we consider that most
companies will use this in a private
context especially the companies that we
interact with don't want their documents
shared on a public kind of way so the
idea of having public miners will not be
feasible or at least will not be doable
for certain companies so we abandoned
that idea and now we are mainly using it
to give people the idea that we are a
leader in terms of thought and
innovation which is certainly the case
and that we are using our expertise in
terms of PDF syntax and all of the
expertise that we have in PDF
specification and a PDF ISO Committee
and that we have thought about how to
integrate this with blockchain so if you
fast forward five maybe say 10 years
from now where do you see you know all
of this from whether it be blockchain or
distributed ledger but what kind of a
world will be living in at that time
that's kind of a visionary thing is hard
to predict but just based upon where you
see the technology going I think Gartner
has a beautiful hype curve for that and
I think we are still very much in the
apex of the curve so a lot of companies
want to do something with blockchain
just
the sake of doing something hip and
innovative with blockchain uh-huh I
think in that sense our text is more
unique because we have actually given
considerable thought about whether or
not this is a good option in terms of
feasibility and cryptography etc I think
we will see a lot of companies start up
that have to do with blockchain and as
always a lot of them will fail and it
might influence public image but I think
certainly the good parts about
blockchain and about distributed ledger
technology will remain well the artists
thank you so much for coming and sharing
no problem and all the best have a great
day thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
