foundry client easy oh by the way about
me on the developer advocate those are
my Twitter coordinates and email if you
walk out of this room or confused and
when you entered please don't hesitate
to reach out to me i'm happy to your
questions and answer questions about any
of this stuff spring cloud foundry etc
architecture slide right basically Cloud
Foundry is the open-source platform as a
service it's formerly from VMware now
part of pivotal sits on top of all these
great other technologies works very well
with spring for example Tomcat rabbitmq
blah blah blah we run it's a platform as
a service so you can run it on premise
obviously in your data center there's
two parts to it there's Bosh which is
the piece that we give to operators who
want to deploy it on their own hardware
in their own data center on premise if
they like we support of course we
support very expensive vSphere
deployment if you like but also amazon
web services and open OpenStack work
just fine right so you can deploy the
stuff privately in rome data center
which is good i don't have to do a lot
of advertising these days the NSA has
done a very good job of advertising for
us you know the value of on-premise
private clouds we don't need i think it
lucid it in further a Bosch is itself
well it's not for the faint of heart I'm
not the kind of guy that would sit down
and do it although I have done it which
is to show that it's possible it takes a
couple hours to get it going if you have
your own private on-premise cloud in
their own data center from the
application development perspective
however it's much quicker right so that
the commands on the writer actually how
to work with the cloud from the command
line there's also Eclipse and IntelliJ
integration as well we build upon a very
rich ecosystem of stuff we you know
what's the right word embraced and
extended in the very microsoft way the
idea of a build pack so any of the build
packs it used for Heroku for example
work just fine on cloud foundry and in
fact we've got a whole bunch more that
work there we also have the ability to
plug in custom service brokers so if you
can't find a configuration that works
with what your application workload
demands already it's very easy to plug
in your own right so a great example of
this is the job of build pack we
borrowed the one from Heroku and rebuilt
it from the ground up extending it to
accommodate different use cases other
people have taken some of this stuff and
done their own thing including some
small mom-and-pop companies like IBM
they have donated the websphere liberty
build pack and so i'll be the first to
say it's a little weird for the spring
guy to be sitting here flatting
websphere but it actually works really
well and it's nice in it you can deploy
it onto under client pending for example
so that's a great example of where the
ecosystem has embraced Cloud Foundry
people are building upon it and built
using it as a platform for their own
things including staccato right the
active State guys um quick demo I was I
went home last night terrified about
Wi-Fi so I recorded everything because I
didn't want this to fail so this is a
very example very quick example of
pushing a websphere based application
I've accelerated it so you don't seem I
think time all that time I said they're
going or you know that stuff so the idea
is have deployed an application it's
asking me which domain I've specified
it's asking me to provision services
here i'm specifying Redis it's asking
which plan I'd like to use I'm going to
use the free tier don't want to create
another service yes I want to create a
post guys instance I'll hit yes
eventually I can choose a the elephant
sequel 14 postgres i'm going to choose
the turtle plan which is cute and
adorable i can bind these to the
application say no I don't have any
other services right but remember this
is all going to WebSphere which is you
know to me it just wow awesome it can't
believe it works it really works so
we're going to start the application
here you can see the build pack in
action it's actually downloading the IBM
JRE and the websphere things and all
that stuff normally what this will do is
download by default if you give her a
job a web application it'll do tomcat
right so that's why this is valuable you
get a default behavior that works for
the eight percent case and for the other
twenty percent where you want to run on
something for you know something
particular you have that ability right
so here we're uploading the application
I've left some of the think time in here
so you can understand that this process
takes actually maybe a few minutes you
know it's actually not as fast as I've
got it here and got one instance running
it's pushed and then now I can actually
go you know bring up my application on
though in the web browser some think
time on the first load of course and
then it brings up the application and I
can it's a simple spring MVC application
right nothing particularly fancy spring
of course works very nicely on tomcat
websphere or websphere running on Cloud
Foundry or tomcat burning in cloud
foundry or whatever it's easy to scale
there's a lot of good stuff there for
monitoring we have a both New Relic for
example and the publicly hosted version
and we have stuff that i'm not sure if
we've announced but we got into we've
got integration for good monitoring
inside the private on-premise package
version that we're talking about talking
to people about because it is open
source you can go get the bits do
everything you like on your own data
center without paying us a penny of
course one minute left ok we have a
pivotal one which we announced by the
end of the year the idea is to be able
to take your application take Cloud
Foundry deploy it in your data center
then handle all the Java workloads all
the kind of work codes you like to run
including PHP note the jsr python peeps
you know cobalt net Scala Grails groovy
etc and Hadoop so pivotal one actually
add to dupe to the cluster right as well
so that's a very useful capability what
i just showed here while it's talking
was the ability to scale out an
application my account is shared with
the rest of my team and they all have
some very meaty demos so I've scaled
mine to five instances but you could
just as easily scale 25 you know 500
right that's the whole point raised you
get the job done there ok questions Oh
save those for afterwards Oh Thank You
Buddha right now so five seconds you
want to say something important not
really important one everyone's got to
it ok John you're up next I guess Rick
leg buddy thank you
see that okay cut and quick well I
appreciate following Josh here it's a
perfect setup thanks um so active state
has been around for a long time we have
been delivering language packs like
active Python active pearl actor tickle
a few other things so if you've used
python and in the past on windows you've
probably used octave states products we
also have an IDE but what I'm here for
is obviously platforms of service and we
have an offering called staccato which
is based directly on the cloud foundry
architecture and I'll get into that a
little bit i do want to just really
emphasize i've talked a lot of
developers here and i've been to this
show a lot and still there's a lot of
people that aren't really i'm getting
they're not really exposed a lot to pass
and really feeling the experience of it
and i really feel it's kind of like this
wave that's forming way off short it's
coming to hit us and and just two weeks
ago at the platform CF conference in
santa clara palmer it's mentioned that
he believes and a lot of people do
otherwise that on the platforms the
service will be as significant and
impact on software development as linux
was 20 years ago and i actually think
it's going to be way more than that
personally palmer to the CEO of vmware
by the way all right yeah it'll oh right
so now you might have a little vested
interest in this but it i really do
believe it so I'm platform service I
think choctaw recover that kind of sits
in the middle between the infrastructure
layer and it allows you to build
software as a service applications it's
targeted at developers this is a
developer tool or product on allows you
to build multi-tenant applications and
host them as Josh mentioned it supports
all the frameworks runtimes languages
you might want to need and fully
polyglot so some of the pioneers here
doc I've used Heroku a fair amount in
the past as well as Google App Engine I
do want to make a point here though this
is important this is why I got really
attracted to pass or private pads i
should say the cloud foundry
architecture with private paths you can
deploy your apps to basically the cloud
running on your laptop or behind the
firewall in your data center
or out an Amazon or basically anywhere
out on our rack space see an openstack
cloud sac cloud platform the VMS vmware
stuff it'll right anywhere so as an
application developer you can take your
application push it out to the cloud you
can do it on your laptop you'll see no
difference when you push it out to AWS
it's exactly the same so it completely
abstracts the cloud layer the
infrastructure layer away and it
provides tremendous power that way I'm
eating the wrong button so so again
we're based on Cloud Foundry here's kind
of the market Dexter slide again do you
want to mention the briefly the
architecture to this thing so everything
in a blue box is the paths and it
bundles a number of things for example
at the top the router it's also a load
balancer so it'll route the traffic to
your various hop instances there's a
controller that sits behind a rest
interface which you can use to control
and monitor and manages saying a stager
is used to gather the bits for your
application push them out to the actual
app instances we provide a number of
services like databases and message
brokers and file system to persistent
shareable filesystem and then on the
those rubik cube looking things on the
left side are represent on what we call
droplet execution agents these are
basically VMs that are dedicated to
writing application instances they're
running inside lxc containers so each
out instance is completely isolated from
every other application running in the
cloud you can manage its resources and
control them and it allow you to achieve
maximum resource utilization you can
maximize your at the usage of all your
memory and your desk and everything so
yeah the other comment I make I kind of
make a hobby of deploying legacy
applications to the cloud to the paths
basically just to see what the pain
points are and one thing I've discovered
with a lot of companies that I'm working
with is that sure there's a lot of Java
applications out there are no question
and there's a lot of people that are
focusing on Java but almost all of these
companies have some amount in other
languages they might use Ruby through
test orchestration or they might you
know all sorts of things I'd like to use
pearls
but there's a lot of different languages
being used in the enterprise they even
if for java shop so it's really nice to
have the choice of languages and wine
ages framework so I'll just buzz to
these basically most of the things
you're likely to be using today are
pretty much supported and what I'll do
is I'll skip through the rest of these
slides because I just like to show the
show it in operation here so yeah we
deliver staccato is a virtual machine VM
appliance you can download the bits from
a website and boot it up in VMware
virtual box and once you've read it up
you'll see a console that looks like
this you could log into this and do
stuff with the command line but you can
also visit that URL that's displayed in
this console and in one minute thank you
I've done so here and I provide you with
a login screen I can I can login here I
should have logged in before because I
have a minute home what's my username
and pass sir pressure I'll just use this
okay try this okay so this is the web
console which allows you to manage this
you can deploy applications directly
from the app store so I could right now
I'll go grab some java applications i
could deploy Jenkins with a click of a
button it'll show me the properties of
the app i hit install and i don't have
enough memory on my system because yeah
okay i'm so what I'll do is I'll deploy
something else made in Python let's grab
this currency converter hopefully I've
got enough for this yes and that's what
this is gathering the bits it's up
gathering dependencies deploying any
services databases whatever just use the
brightest and then it's deploying it to
the cloud and if the networker
cooperates and if I've got another 15
seconds it might even work it doesn't
matter though the point is you get a
unified view of your entire
infrastructure without having to worry
if you want to move from cloud to cloud
move your appt from inside your firewall
from your laptop or the AWS 0 Rackspace
so that's pretty much it thanks for your
time thank you John I applied it I heard
it moving on down I should mention that
cloud foundry also has a very good
continuously you could mention that if
you had time right now but of course you
don't
I'm sorry we're very sticky about the
time here you know hey right on alright
so I do work on openshift openshift is a
true open source project at Red Hat and
open chef creates a powerful environment
to where the two competing teams that
I've seen in my career mainly being a
developer and then my first job as a
manager at Red Hat was to manage
dub-dub-dub redhat com and all the
infrastructure and systems and system
admins the support the company and the
development operations staff always
fought developers wanted machines
quickly and you know sis admins I don't
want say they don't care about
developers but they have other problems
right there they're worried about
keeping production system stable and so
with open shift and the platform as a
service it's a place to where the
sysadmin Xand DevOps teams can still
maintain the control that they need the
security apply the arata updates and
still allow developers to self provision
so open chef it's extremely fast you can
deploy applications we support all
languages except net and that's because
we hate microsoft i'm just kidding but
you can run net but you'd have to use a
mono library which we do have a
cartridge for but we do we do support
that from a community-based endpoint but
you know you're still welcome to use
open shift as a.net developer will just
send you to rehab first or something so
the next question always get asked how
much does open ship cost it's completely
free to use it's open source we even
provide the hosted version for free you
can create up to three servers for free
and that's free for life it's not a
time-based trial or anything like that
okay an open shift is scalable there's
two types of skeletons there's vertical
skeleton horizontal scaling when you
think about passes is traditionally the
ants right it's a lot of little workers
working together to attack a problem and
vertical selling is when you throw more
RAM resources disk space at the problem
so with open if you can manually scale
like you can on Cloud Foundry we also
auto scale and by that i mean we monitor
your traffic your HTTP traffic every 20
seconds if at any point in time you have
more than 10 concurrent HTTP requests
we spin up another open shift gear for
you what we call a gear we front it with
H a proxy load balancer and we begin
balancing traffic we then re-examine
your traffic every couple of minutes and
if it's below a certain threshold we
bleed connections off remove it from the
cluster and and scale back down okay so
that's how auto scaling works on
openshift and Java absolutely rocks on
openshift and I show this slide overseas
and they don't get the rock but this is
the rock if you're not familiar with the
rods you know Red Hat part of our
company is also jboss so we have tied
integration with all the J balls tools
and suites in fact today we just
announced X paths which will be all of
the jboss middleware products and
technologies deployed on the cloud
through open shift so there's actually
three flavors open shifts it's all the
exact same source code open shift origin
is our true open source project it's not
a closed open source project like I like
to think of a lot of companies who
create open source projects but never
accept pull requests everything we do is
out in the public our roadmap is public
our sprint planning is public everyone's
welcome to join our roadmap is public
like people ask me to tell them what's
coming down the road for open shift you
know 20 enterprise and I'm like it's
it's out there it's not private right
and so everyone's welcome to engage with
that that's open shift origin and we do
have quite a few contributors from other
companies already working on that the
biggest one right now is paypal they've
switched their entire development
infrastructure over to open shift
internally we also have open shift
online that's hosted in the Amazon ec2
East region right now it's a and it is
where it's a fully managed system by Red
Hat's we keep the operating system which
is red hat enterprise linux and all the
application run times and database
managed for you so you don't have to
worry about that and then we have
openshift enterprise which you can run
on premise in your own private data
center and you can purchase support for
that if your company needs it and will
help you know develop custom cartridges
and you know troubleshoot application
deployment issues things like that all
right boring let's actually see it work
okay so I'm going to show a clip since
this is a java conference but we also
have a web-based ide and a console so
you can interact with it so i'm just
going to create a
new openshift project inside of Eclipse
and it's going to ask me to authenticate
and then I can create a new application
I'll just call this Java too because job
one was so last year you can select what
container you want to run we support
jboss EAP 661 and yes you can use jboss
EAP for free on openshift we support as7
will support wildfly which is the new
jboss a as 8 tomcat we also support
jenkins for continuous integration one
minute no perl PHP everything else so
let's do tom cat 7 select our gear
profile we're not going to embed a
database click on next create a new
project yep select our location where we
want it on the file system and good
enough job of 12 AP about this you gotta
have a correct directory so what we're
doing right now is we are finding a node
in the open shift infrastructure and if
this was on premise it would be in your
own infrastructure to place this gear is
what we call it it's multi-tenant
environment however the jboss
application server any databases any
processes run inside of user space
they're secured with security enhanced
Linux and control groups links control
groups in the kernel for setting your
CPU limits and all of that is
configurable and all this is talking to
be arrest and you interact with the pa's
via get if you want to push source code
for Java we support maeva builds you can
also do binary deployments with war
files and ear files if you don't want to
use our jenkins integration and i am out
of time great thank you very much grant
we can pass that on down now to sasha i
was trying to leave this on the project
we work yep so just gonna
ok
hi everybody so here is my six minutes
presentation to cloudbees we're going to
first look at what problem we typically
solve with cloudbees what is clad these
what we provide we're going to create a
quick application to see how it works
and then look at how we can solve more
complicated use cases as well so what
problem is typically solve I have to say
first that we are a service so where the
s in impasse we're not a software so we
don't provide software to customers that
they need to install on premise in their
data center rizzoli a service that
developers use to get application push
to production so what we see most of the
time our enterprises can be startups but
we see a lot of those enterprises with
their typical IT on premises and it's a
crown jewels that they have to defend
you know it's an Oracle database and a
websphere is a ps3 whatever they
typically call that core IT that's what
you know is relatively slow to move but
very very needs to be very stable then
that's where they need to go as they
need to go to social they need to go to
mobilize they have tons of new project
to implement and most of the times there
is too much friction in how to get there
whisk or IT so they can't they're not
productive enough to get there and so
cloudbees act as a service that's going
to bridge in a sector faction in a
secure fashion their karate make it
possible to access those resources on
premise and at the same time provide a
next generation from and for those
mobile application for example and hook
some sass as well in the mix if you want
to pull data from third party such as
well so that's a typical use case we see
we call that fast IT and so those
enterprises and decide for each new
project is this a fast IT project it is
a core IT project depending on where
they want to put it so how do they get
there using cloudbees we have a first
set of services that we call dev at
cloud that's how you can develop a new
applications in the cloud so club is not
just about pushing ready to a pre pre
made application to production it's also
everything that comes before so we offer
a Jenkins as a service actually the
founder of Jenkins
Jacob I grew she works for cloudbees we
can do this continuous integration we
provide get subversion and maven
repositories but it's really a la carte
if you want to host that somewhere else
including on-premise and then if you
want to do you can do more than just
test your application you can test the
front end as well so we just announced
this week for example iOS this thing if
you want to you don't want to install
those Mac machine and just want to pay
by the minute for iOS build you can do
that in the cloud you can do your
Android testing on a on a matrix of
different devices that's very easy to
set up no need to install any software
then we have the run at cloud story
that's where you deploy your application
when they've been built and tested I'm
not going to repeat a lot that has been
set today we're focused and specially
stone on the Java Virtual Machine but
you can run node or any other software
stack you you want to do and we provide
the auto elasticity and and so on so
it's a typical pass from a runtime
standpoint then we we are going to have
a set of partners that can extend the
feature set let's say you want to do
some specific monitoring you want to do
static code analysis you don't want to
do that integration yourself so you can
leverage integrated partners that are
going to hook into either Deb at cloud
or run at cloud to extend the feature
set and all of that gives you what we
call continuous deployment so is that
the ability to continuously deploy new
applications to production as you make
changes and that's a radical change from
what we see on the market today where
you don't have long release cycle you
really have very fast iteration and you
want to see in production what it gives
last part is a lot of companies are
using third-party SAS sales for zendesk
whatever and they want to be able to
consume that information within their
environment so we provide a new service
called web at cloud you can do
traditional data synchronization between
any celo could be SAS data base oh you
know it could be Oracle to my sequel for
example such a traditional replication
mechanism but you can also do something
we call app centric integration where
you're going to hook so says into your
application in a very easy fashion and
inject those events to your application
and the other way around as well where
you're going to Emmy
some notification from your application
and send those to SAS so the bottom line
is we're running the public cloud we can
access on-premise data in a secure
fashion you know need to discuss with
IPS there is no friction door
configuration you don't install anything
you just sign up and you're ready to go
so I'm going to pass on this because
time is the essence here I'm going to
start a click start with what we call a
click start it's a quick way to create a
new project on the platform so you have
plenty pre-made you can make your own
for your company if you frequently
create a mobile application of the same
type so I'm on the cloud these here one
minute one minute I'm going to take a
click start here and I'm going to take
for example hibernate GP on tomcat I
just click here I create my application
it's going to create a source repository
it's going to create a Jenkins job
everything I need to get started from
this click start so it's going to clone
a repository the code creates a job
create the application create the
database with some content and wire all
of that together so that when I do a git
push it's going to initiate a Jenkins
job and get started so now everything is
running I can go and see my application
running it's extremely fast and my job
is currently my Jenkins job here is a is
being built as as we speak and one last
thing I wanted to chat about it's this
injection of even so if you have a SAS
let's see sales force you want to hook
say a new lead in your application
that's pretty hard to achieve you
typically need to you typically need to
know the API for Salesforce
authentication and so on here it's
pretty easy you simply create a JSON API
it's all rest-based and graphically
you're going to hook that and say I have
sales force on my left I have my
application wires a wire Zoe's and and
it's just gonna just going to work I
don't have much time so okay well thank
you very much sir now now you've heard
about these different pauses you know
you know a lot more about them than you
did when you walked in probably
so you're armed with questions and now's
your chance I don't know if there's a
mic out there or not but if you it's a
pretty small room you just want to speak
loud enough I can repeat the question
and you can direct your question toward
either one of the panelists or all of
them and they can each answer so your
choice oops sorry we have somebody the
back first yeah sure I so I'll answer
from openshift are our infrastructure is
written in Ruby not for any technical
merits of that particular platform it's
just what we decided to go with when we
first created it correct yeah it's
written in Ruby yep so in a case of
active state we have its there's a lot
of ruby in there there's a fair amount
of go now we're using go extensively
clock we're following Cloud Foundry is
that kind of motivation on that we also
have no J us in there and then there's a
fair amount that's used for staging java
applications it's built in java so we
actually directly access the spring the
spring beans to intersect the app so
does yes go lining up for for cloudbees
a lot of JVM based languages so Java
skala quite a bit and for the state
machine to to make sure the deployment
happens properly we have a pretty solid
foundation in Erlang as well well Cloud
Foundry is all it's mostly Ruby we have
go code in different places including
the including we're working on a new
client because that's also written in go
so you can just download the client yes
target there's a question at the back
there yeah sir yeah you that's you yeah
particular
okay so question is how difficult is it
to add more software to the stocks that
you provide where you have some
customized software I want to run in the
past yeah so for openshift any binary or
source code that can be compiled on the
linux operating system particularly Red
Hat Enterprise Linux you can run on the
open ship platform as a service if you
don't want to use one of the
pre-configured cartridges what we call
it we will allow you to spin up a server
and you can ssh into it and install
whatever you need to get it up and
running and as same pretty much answer
applies to staccato as well we support
there's a lot of things that it
automatically recognizes so a war file
will automatically be deployed the
Tomcat or if you want to customize it
you can use build tax and other
facilities to install anything you want
in the past and it will it'll run there
so there's no no limitation so as it
runs on Ubuntu Linux for our case yeah
clapping clapping a build packs right
same hook it's the Heroku build pack
model so any of the Heroku build packs
that you want to use work with us and we
have a even more that work as well in
visa versa right it what's on Heroku it
yeah we run on a boon to by default but
we have for example a couple ecosystem
partners that have built that net
versions of this so for example they
actually use the system educated agents
which is a little bit trickier so they
actually run in windows and you get a
full net experience but it communicates
to this intermediary thing that's a
little more exotic you're running on
Windows right but basically it's bill
packs is a hook and where there's a will
it away right yeah we can do that as
well I think one of the things we always
try to make people cautious about is we
run a service so what that means is that
people don't want to become responsible
for maintaining that the day you bring
your own stack you becomes a guy who is
going to be patching Linux for the next
five years right so typically that's not
what our audience wants so the way we
did it is the same type of stack but but
the slight difference is that when you
typically take a you want to create
something new you're typically going to
take something that's as close as
possible from what you want to achieve
say you want to install your own
security module in tomcat or whatever
strange thing you want to do you're
going to take an existing Tomcats tag
that we manage is then inject the
behavior you want just the difference
you want
do that way you become responsible just
for this part and we remain responsible
for maintaining the stack for the other
stuff so I think it's our service bias
that is leading us there yet to answer
your part about easiness and I think
this is the same for everyone if I mean
misrepresent correct me but how easy is
it to do for some someone like us who's
in and out of it every day we could you
know get Tomcat 8 8 up and running in
like 20 minutes for someone who's not
familiar with the platform but if I take
three to eight hours I would think to
develop a custom-built backer cartridge
good point question of front so my
questions tractors dude what is the
differentiation active state offers
working for me what I'm saying that we
are better same as go for you but better
what is what is what is the strongest
right so i will say that Claire farm is
evolving rapidly now with they've got v2
coming out and that's going to be the
certificate advances there we are
actively following that we will be fully
supporting it so I'll speak to the
current version that we support the
honest out now and we will be very soon
yeah we're actively its it'll be right
away we're actively developing it so
we're a little bit behind these guys
because they are driving it but we're
little behind ourselves too so it's okay
yeah just came out so so a number of
things for v1 one example would be the
ability to support the direct traffic
from to and from any port any protocol
UDP or TCP so that'll work even if it's
no protocol just binary data ldap
integration so for the users you can
integrate with an external LDAP or
Active Directory service the the
deliveries of a as a appliance so you
just boot it up and it works the web
console we did a lot of work on the web
console as well and there's a handful of
features like that so what we found was
a ssh ssl support i mean everything's
talking ssl what we found is there's a
number of enterprise type features that
we were being requested and so we just
rolled most of those into our product so
that's kind of the nutshell version and
you have so much better
at the moment our command line interface
is Ruby based and such a real pain in
the butt to install the right version
Ruby you're all right all right yeah
it's tickle and it's just self-contained
so just things like that song I'm going
to go which still lets way there right
now we have a question over on the side
and Java was like once but it's not the
past performance diverging like they
have their own way of building that
Apple continuum of services are you guys
working on any kind of stand back to
stand on it at least you know there
doesn't need to be standards right
because it's the platform as a service
companies fault for going a proprietary
route right you should never use a
proprietary system because you're going
to get locked in right and so that's the
key design tenant we had with open shift
is you can take your java source code as
it is today and deploy it on openshift
and I think that's similar for other
platforms but there's some out there
that you can't do that they have
proprietary api's and you should never
ever consider using one of those because
they'll I had a friend who use google
app engine for a long time and use their
proprietary api's they raised the price
overnight his company went from being
profitable to losing lots of money so I
doubt a little bit to this to I'm you
it's a very good point and we spent a
lot of effort making sure that
applications are easily migrated from
pastor paths there is an initiative and
I believe you guys are driving it called
Camp cloud application management
protocol or something and I've looked at
it a bit and I've very much shied away
from it because it's going to introduce
another layer to me it's just adding
complexity that doesn't need to be at it
so I don't know probably at Releford no
camp is actually a management standards
not so much a programming or development
standards he's talking about the
development model okay all right so
apologies sir doctor and
other units containers of water too yes
so that's a different it's a different
question right if you talk about the
internals of the past versus just the
code now the code should be talking
about the application taking
applications written exactly but yeah
but so so i think is the reason i hear a
lot of people equating pass with locking
and if it's a pass it's locked in i
think there is a good reason for that
let's remember that one of the first
pass out there was force calm from
salesforce and it had its own language
its own api its own database so you were
completely locked in today if you're
going to take a java application you can
deploy it on all of those paths with no
problem where the locking is going to be
is in the management API right what
common do you use to go left or right is
this a huge Larkin frankly it's it's
it's a sub detail what we do at that
club is for example we are devid cloud
services for development we make them
work with cloud foundry with Google App
Engine so you can pick your target and
we really did on purpose just to to show
the world that is it should be about the
customer you should have the choice if
we suck at running application please go
and use somebody else and then the last
comment on on services and API for
example we talked about Google App
Engine I think it's really purely a
discussion on on good architecture we
had a proprietary api's forever and the
question is is your architecture
shielding you from a bit of that you can
you know you can create your own
abstraction but but then are you not
going to use a CDN because it might lock
you in in some API are you not going to
use some great services because they
might lock you in think it's more a
matter of using the right architecture
when you create your software then
really what services you should be
consuming or not which is for me more of
a business discussion yeah to answer
that I completely agree that's yeah
Sasha plus plus but also building
applications for the past is necessarily
something we shouldn't try and
standardize the programming model
because there are so many different
programming models from the Java
perspective dependency injection happens
to be an
way to insulate your code from the
infrastructure depends on right and
that's possible w/e and spring and
whatever its ways to do that at the
lowest level for clarity for example we
use environment variables which all
languages can access inconsistent way
and because it's completely open source
if we do a bad job if we you know up the
price on on everything one day like some
other cloud platform who rhymes with
Google App Engine if we did such a thing
and you really hated us then that's okay
we there's other people that have the
same API had the same even the same
command interface for working with the
cloud so you have portability in the
ecosystem of Cloud Foundry right if
nothing else the one is there's
portability there's easy-to-use
environment variables are very
accessible in all languages 20 use
dependency injection a higher level like
my kid he's talking about where you
create an abstraction you can do that to
shield you from the api's or you're out
of order one thing we learn from this
panels of Google is going to say yes to
this panel next time aren't they we had
a question actually a guy in the black
shirt behind you we've been open shift
online has been GA since june of this
year we've had over a million
applications deployed on the online
service since we've been available our
largest production customer is paypal
like i mentioned earlier the largest one
I can talk about how's that cloud fire
itself has been around in some form
another since two thousand seven eight
we're now on the what I would call the
third generation of the architecture
it's a little bit different for people
this has only been available since
earlier this year and more recently you
know as things have been things are like
finally starting to mesh so it's it's
open source code we deployed the code
when it's stable so we've had stable
versions out there for a while our
largest customer that I can talk about
we've had you know we have lots of
customers who have used it online and
also people who are coming to us for
help in deploying it privately they want
they want to deploy it privately but the
largest customer we have using it right
now is by do probably by do is the
world's largest the third largest search
engine
in the world I think maybe fourth it's
Chinese it's the Chinese search engine
it's 1.2 billion people on the internet
they can't get to Google so where do
they go to its but yeah they're paying
they're talking to us they're working
with us they're paying but not a lot
because it is open source and that's
fine you know we're helping them were
supporting them so we've been I stick I
actually don't know the exact number but
about a year and i love that it was a
march or april 2012 when we came out and
i think the second part of your question
is some of our what we've learned from
some of our larger customers and so we
uh i don't i don't know why this is in
the marketing world but a lot of
customers because companies don't want
names use like we can't use their name
but we're we have some large bank and
tells me promise not to tell anyone
right okay yeah i think banks and telcos
and things these are industries are
utilities where we're private is really
important where they cannot put their
data out on AWS a bank how many banks
are running on e WS today they need to
run behind that flower wall so they're
missing out on a lot of the advantages
of the cloud beyond demands self-service
all that stuff scalability so so the
basically what i learned these companies
that need to retain their data they need
the privacy and the security of it are
wanting all the benefits of the cloud
unable to get there unless they use a
private house like offerings here what
they learned by the way from up for us
is there a lot but the point is they
committed it back so we didn't have to
what they learned we learned and you
guys can also benefit from so the full
fledge david clarinet cloud integration
was GA as of january two thousand eleven
but before that so so stacks companies
that existed before had Jonah cloudbees
so we had some applications coming from
there as well one of our biggest
application or biggest customer it's
hard to answer because biggest could be
the size of the customer as a company or
the deployment in our case is the one
with the more the biggest load we'd be
actively a start-up they have up to
25,000 transaction a minute on the
platform it's a mobile application and
what we learn from that
what I learned at least from that was a
you know I was at a bus red hat before I
think for me it was a change in DNA in
high in what it is to be a software
vendor versus what to be what it is to
be a service provider it changes the way
we produce software we support software
we we do maintenance and so on so it's
to me it's a different job any other
questions
okay so so how well does your pass cater
to large development teams with the
multiple different roles and the
development cycle so I'll start with
that with so we support the concept of
users and groups you can group your your
anybody using the paths into different
groups so you can have a QA group and
with that you assign resource limits to
that group so you can say well QA is
there probably to use 8 gigs they need a
case to deploy where it's maybe the UI
team they only need a gig so you can
support multiple users and multiple
groups and we're currently we just
acquired a company from New Zealand
called apps the key and they are
offering they have a kind of a time
waste time based collaboration tool and
we're going to incorporating that right
now with our product so collaboration
between these teams etc I'm integration
with your source code management from
the cloud very perspective and swing
called a space this is a way of
delineating different grouping of
googling of people so for example during
development I want to have a space where
I can thrash around create and delete
stuff rapidly etc I can move it to
testing in that state you know they'll
stay there and be independent of the
thrashing having developments all right
and I can go to production we don't have
a great continuous integration story for
example from our side so we just
delegate to the best which is why we
have a great story with cloudbees for
that you know you know it's just we it's
very good for developed because we can
receive lots of people can share the
same space it can access the same
resources and there's a pool which is
why I wasn't able to go to 100 because
other people might pool if monopolize my
huge amount of allocations yeah it's
important to say that at least for us
some of our customers use the entire
platform others only do development and
my you know two deployments on-premise
or at people thought or at Google App
Engine and some would just use run at
cloudbees so it's really a la carte we
have some customers for example doing
gaming companies with more than 100
developers doing all of their
development on cloudbees but not
deploying on cloud-based for example so
it's really hard okay well I think we're
going to close it off there I just want
to you guys to give a round of applause
to our fantastic panelists
did a great job and thanks to you guys
for answering and asking great questions
rather and don't forget to fill out your
evaluations and say how much you like to
listen to these guys talk enjoy the rest
of the conference thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
