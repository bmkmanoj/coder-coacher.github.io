circuits for parent sessions I'm Daniele
De Luca the world wad manager of the
d'box for kids we have arun gupta here
responsible for the device for kids us a
chapter and stephanie on sense who
actually initiated the divorce for kids
initiative in belgium to in 2012 then i
joined immediately after so today we're
going to talk about how the reebok
circuit for parents so we're going to
show you a few workshops that we are
providing tour to the children's before
starting all those workshop for
explanation would like to give you
actually not me more at little boy over
there give you some explanation about
what is the box for kids I hope that
everybody will be able to see him so now
are you still willing to give the talk
about the presentation about the box for
kids of course Daniel okay with great
pleasure hello everyone it is nice to be
here with you today I have been asked to
talk to you about devoxx for kids
because some people that I know are too
lazy to do that by themselves okay
thanks anyway let me think where should
I start from yes I remember everything
started in 2012 in Belgium we hosted 70
children in few sessions that was really
fun we started it because my human
friends and myself wanted to show you
children how funny it is to program
computers you know learning programming
and how computers work and be useful for
their future in 2013 other people
started to join the devoxx for kids
family they organized events in their
own country creating additional
workshops that can be used by everybody
today we have more than 40 devoxx for
kids came worldwide in North Central and
South America Europe and Asia I'm so
proud of them for what they do for the
children
we use different workshops during the
divorce for kids event we propose three
categories computer game programming
introduction to robotics and finally
introduction to electronics under the
name Internet of Things our workshops
can be used by children aged from eight
to fourteen years old and are
internationalized in the category of
computer game programming we use the
following specialized for education
snatch Alice green foot and also we
propose to do modding of the famous game
Minecraft in the category of robotics we
use the following robots my best friend
lego mindstorms and of course children
and program me and my twin brother by
the way I forgot to present myself my
name is now I'm a few nanos robot
imagined and manufacture my LD bar on
robotics and European company based in
France in the category of Internet of
Things we show children how electronic
devices are built for the suite is
Arduinos and raspberry pi devices don't
worry children can also enjoy learning
electronics such as ohms and peer
voltage in a very fun and safe way we
also invite you to join the devoxx for
kids family this is so inspiring and
rewarding I would like to finish by
telling your our goals and missions
first teach children computer
programming while having fun and
introduce them to concepts of robotics
electronics I'm generally being created
with these kind of devices secondly
inspire not only children but also the
classical education system so they can
start interpreting computer science in
their curriculum and finally be
mystified programming for girls and
introduced them to computer science
order to improve gender equality in the
field do not hesitate to visit our
website ee-ee-ee-ee box for kids org
well I guess that's enough for the
moment thank you for listening to me ok
thank you now thanks ok good so also I
would like to continue with the
manifesto that now was started also we
have no discriminations boys girls which
poor with disabilities we all just know
everybody can can create its own events
can use or tutorials we just need to be
notified so we can broadcast the events
worldwide and two and also try to give
give some help if necessary make sure so
for the events that you stick to the
local legislation that's what also every
group is independent because every group
knows locally or 20 to deal with those
registrations and insurance and of
course make sure that if you take
pictures that you need the parent
approval for for having pictures of
their own children so as I said already
the materials are we have assured you
have here or links to the github
repository must be to attribute to the
devoxx for kids we just have it
shareable non-commercial and share alike
kind of who say that again the comment
recommend yeah common creation licenses
sorry but of course they'll do to owns
the copyrights ok if you can you can
reuse the auto can reuse its own
materials of course for publication if
necessary so a good thing to remember is
if you go to the github URL the box for
kids there are not only English versions
of the documents so presentations
workshops detail steps that you can look
at and run at your local chapter or at
your local meetup
but the lot of the documents are
actually translated in different
languages because this is truly a global
effort it's not just like a one country
or on one part of the world so it's
truly global and the cool part is if you
see say English translation let's say
how many people are outside us from here
there you go a lots of you are from
outside US so we would love to see more
translations over there you know by all
means this is completely in the spirit
of sharing take the material translate
it contribute it back so that others can
learn more about it yeah just so we have
like two hours so we want to make it
also a very interactive session so if
you have any questions don't wait till
the ends just you know raise your hand
or yell and we can have it a bit more
interactive regarding young moe name we
just ask to have a receive just to give
receives only for casual materials and
nations we don't want to have speakers
or 20 volunteers to get paid for this
it's all volunteer efforts for everybody
what we eventually recommend also
depending on the location is to charge
for registration event just to make sure
that the children will show up doing
event not to be let's say it's a sunday
saturday or sunday event then it sun
shining and all the sudden they decided
okay we won't go to the event we just go
to the park to have some fun on the park
and then you end up with i'd say instead
of 50 children you have just to 10
children which is of course not funny so
just charge make sure that you can say
you own title them to to to our to come
to the event and then you can reuse
those there's amount of money to let
them enough money to buy goods food and
snacks for the children's t-shirts
whatever yeah Regina
okay that's another yeah repeat the gold
label is to show up so what they did in
the voxel kids netherlands is that they
asked for ten euros at the registration
and then when they show up at the
registration desk they were given back
the the ten euros they were paying for
the registration time so just to make
sure that the children are all they're
attending the event good point so in
general you know that is absolutely
wrong I think as a requirement you know
for they need a box for kids workshop
because the first couple of workshops
that we did in the bay area we charge
nothing so there were about 250 kids
that signed up and literally a sixty
seventy percent drop off right because
it was late in the Christmas I
understand but we have done other
workshops during peak holiday times as
well but the moment you charge ten
dollars small money ten dollars but
there is at least a commitment from the
parents my parents will push the kids
not you got to go attend the workshop
and as Regina was saying you know we do
that all the time like listen give out a
t-shirt for them so parents don't mind
that no and kids love it and that also
creates create more awareness and if
Daniel can turn around it says your kid
play games mine kid make games parents
love that t-shirt by the way when we
give their out and talking about
t-shirts I'm not sure if it's in the
best practices but we saw in the Deaf
ox4 kissed war show within the Poland's
they actually had treat colored t-shirts
so like red green blue and by giving a
red colored t-shirt to a specific group
you're already grouping the children
into like following this specific
schedule so then you can go okay the
green group now goes through that
session in the red group goes there and
visually you can already see okay hey
you're you're wandering around so those
are like really practical things that
you can play with
yes yes yeah yes yeah so the question
was for the design the images here we
share those images to so everybody can
use them and print them out stickers
t-shirts whatever and there are even
local versions for example like there's
a divorce records worldwide logo there
is a divorce for kids USA logo there's
the developer Chris Bay Area logo so
let's say if we start atlanta chapter so
by all means we can customize the logo
for you and then give you a local logo
okay guidelines all you want to start a
chapter local chapter if you want to do
that why is simple as 123 so you just
have to get it to get a group of
passionate guys like these ones you have
on the pictures okay some up somehow
some of them are quite crazy guys and
girls right yeah guys and good of course
sorry so it could be user groups or
ecology group jokes Java user groups
stem peoples of a group that are using
stem or so local in school re our
neighbors whatever just notify us so we
can help you in setup give you some
feedback based on our experience give
you contacts local contacts eventually
from big corporations like Oracle you
know to oracle Academy to help you out
all we ask is at least organized one
event a year but you can schedule
schedule those events are to your own
convenience not necessary in the first
year you need to have one event but
because sometimes it's difficult to
organize things with an installation
part etc so but at least we want to have
at one event a year and then you select
the workshop you that you want to do in
the list of all the workshop that we
have now of course you can create new
ones too and you can translate the one
that you are going to to give to the
children and give it back to us so we
can put it on our github repository and
website so we can share it's a common
effort everybody shares the information
that the tutorial that they do
that me yep yeah so from another
practical point of view it's the
location is really important of course
you need to make sure that you have
enough computers now what we tend to do
is like if you have a small group
everybody brings their own computers
along and you use it in a pair
development type of you like here in the
US every child had his own computer I
actually didn't like that because I
prefer that the children work in pairs
that way they're also working on their
social skills and they can start with
their friends but then actually after a
while they will actually start mingling
the pairs and they will actually have
new friends on Facebook afterwards and
so on so it's also a social experience
for point of view but like for the
computers if you don't have enough
steering members just ask the parents
bring your own computer that's also fine
right and of course depending on where
you organize it to schools like we had
an event last week and Amsterdam at the
University University of Amsterdam and
they they just provide all the computers
so it's a bit depending on the location
make sure you do pre install all the
software I mean you really don't want to
waste time installing you know scratch
or certain plugins like for the leap
motion and that type of stuff so make
sure you pre install it got a question
yeah so you can just say like these are
the prerequisites these are the links
it's all of the the software using is
free so it's it's not really rocket
science to install you know scratch or
whatever you need so that's often doable
now one of the things that we do at in
WS is we have a meetup page so whenever
an event is ready we list the event on
the meetup page so we know which parents
have signed up like two days before the
event will send an email here is the
software that you need to install now no
matter how clear how straightforward the
instructions are expect a lot of parents
to show up oh I didn't see the email or
I didn't install it so plan for like a
help desk and I'll have more volunteers
who are ready to sit on the side so that
your main workshop flow is not disrupted
you know there are a couple of people
are sitting on the side oh you didn't
install the software comes it with me
I'll help you install the software
typically that ends up being a lot of
time if you keep it as part of the main
workshop and have a USB handy so you can
just give the USB and say well install
these apps which are on there another
thing from a location point of view is a
check definitely if it's like isolated
or separated location we had some
experiences the first time in Belgium
where we had a building of our own with
it was like a high school and it had
different levels and so we had to go
from one level to the other level for
the workshops and at the end of the day
you make sure you count the children
when you start so you know like okay we
got 50 right but it was such a big
building that the end of the day we only
had 49 children then we missed one and
we were like we were freaking out we
could like here's that boy where's that
boy and the parents came to collect
their son and we went like we don't know
where your son is who like shaking and
then we like oh no he does that all the
time don't worry so they were like
relaxing us and so we found it he was
just wondering in the building and he
was like do sightseeing so having a good
location does help that is like the
picture above there that's in God's Lake
in Belgium it's really and you only have
one entrance and mine exits so you can
put somebody there and that person can
really be the guards to make sure that
the children don't wander about so but
that does have an impact on the hole in
our organization easy parking I mean if
you have the possibility to because the
parents you know there's a little me
like 150 children they were like the
black girls coding came at bus and so on
so it is good to have at least a bit of
space for for parking signing I learned
actually on Saturday I learned very
interesting is that Oracle helped us
organize this and at the end of the day
they actually put tables in the corridor
and you had to pass those tables and
that was their signing off type of
approach so there was no other way of
just going out there and then they were
just ticking off okay that child left
that child left because you know it is a
big responsibility not only
intellectually because we need to make
sure they learn a lot but also we know
that the children are our returns in a
safe way as you have received them
and yeah definitely make sure you visit
the location in advance so that you do a
bit of a scouting of you know what are
the dynamics etc all right just out of
other interest is that from a location
just contact your local high school but
if you start small like I know Justin
would like to do something for his
daughter just start at home I mean
that's no I that's where I run started
he's just you know used his home invited
some friends of his son and that's
that's perfectly fine to start right but
you will notice they will be so
enthusiastic that they will invite their
friends and other friends and for your
Facebook that the next events your house
will already be too small right so just
go to the local schools and they will be
more than happy to help actually on that
point itself in the u.s. devoxx for kids
is a registered nonprofit and we have
already done the paperwork for 501 C 3
so what that also gives you is the
ability to reach out to your local
library so you can reach out to your
Public Library you know they have the
community rooms which they are happy to
kind of lend it to you so libraries
community colleges high schools middle
schools you know my son is running a
Minecraft modding club in school and
we're talking about let's do it during
the lunch break after the school so a
lot of options are there if you are
within the US and where you want to run
these clubs all right in terms of best
practices food and drinks it depends
really you know how your workshops are
structured if it's a day-long event then
depending upon the sponsors you know how
much you are charging you may provide
food but if it's a three-hour workshop
or if like it's a day long and 23 our
workshops then we even ask the kids to
bring their own lunch you know that
keeps our costs low if you tell them
ahead of time they don't mind we
fortunately got an excellent space here
in the Bay Area which is a hacker dojo
in mountain view it's a go sharing
workspace they actually have water
coffee and lots of good facilities over
their kids bring their own lunch works
out really well we have a standard slide
show where we talk about the events that
have gone you know where do you sign up
our Facebook page social media all of
those which is so as the kids
and parents are walking in then that
slideshow is constantly running so that
parents at least get to know about it
what we've noticed as well is doing the
Welcome it's really perfect to do that
with the children and the parents right
so you can really show the parents as
well what you're going to be doing and
I've noticed you guys have actually and
also in the Netherlands they even did
like like in Belgium you wave the
parents goodbye and say like ok they
just need to go because otherwise the
children are like intimidated by their
parents and they're not let loose
basically but it depends on the culture
and then a bit of dynamic but what we've
also noticed that some devoxx for kids
they actually take the parents in a
separate room for a few hours and
actually explain all the workshops which
are being given and thoughts that way
you actually have you know an eddicated
parents who knows that when the child
comes at home and they're really excited
what they need to do next to continue
the stimulation intellectually etc right
everything should be yeah everything
that is we are using for our workshops
and all on the github and in the u.s.
what we do is fortunately our room is
about as big as this so there are about
50 kids sitting in the front and about
50 / and sitting in the back and that's
actually very important because the way
we see it is whatever the kids are
learning we really ask parents to be
hands-off because otherwise the parents
are on their head all the time like a
helicopter mom so we ask the parents to
stay back once they are at the back then
at least they are watching what their
kids are learning then on the drive back
home or at home then they can at least
figure out in okay what really happened
and how can I help you in terms of
goodies you know depending upon sponsors
and location by all means you can see
there are bags over there now you can
get schwag reach out to your local tech
companies you know wherever you are
located reach out to your local tech
company talk to your local jug leader
and I'll see if they have any contacts
with the local tech community who are
willing to sponsor and we are in the Bay
Area fortunately so there are a lot of
tech companies and we generally get
somebody to sponsor the events so that
way you can give goodies even if you
don't have a goody now as Regina of a
saying and we do it $10 a t-shirt that
works out really well and there's a lot
of conferences like even Java one they
have
like lots of merchandising left so they
might as well give it to the children so
that's what they did on Saturday they
already actually gave a row a very nice
backpack and some t-shirts so just work
and then play with those type of local
conferences and comes off when we are
doing the workshop itself typically
instructor has a pace now that they're
going with their own pace I'm gonna do
this and step one and step 2 and step
three as much as we would like to stay
green for kids we recommend that you
give them a paper copy you know give a
paper copy right next to it so that in
case the instructor has moved on they
know exactly I can look at this I have
the instructions with me or you can keep
it green as well the way we do it is we
share the slides beforehand all the
instructions so the very first thing
pretty much in the workshop is download
all the slides that I'm talking about at
this URL so then the kids have the
slides on their local machine of course
Wi-Fi access or some sort of network
connectivity is required but once they
have the slides then they know they can
follow along in terms of pictures and
videos we love taking pictures you know
who doesn't like the pictures of kids is
smiling and parents you're not having
fun as well so but the important part
for that is make sure you take approval
there's a media vapor again we have a
standard media waiver that we encourage
you to take a look at it it's on our
website get it signed and then share the
picture now use your Facebook page share
on your personal Facebook pages if you
like to because a lot of it is about
word of mouth you know once you start
sharing it it's like you know you go
tell your friends are your friends or
your family or you know your school
community or your neighborhood community
share it because end of the day this is
all about sharing and allowing more
people to take a look at it yeah for the
website point of view or so we can host
your the local chapters to on our main
website so it's a box for kids the rogue
/ belgium / netherlands / Germany etc
etc so we can create them and then you
are managing that chapter site on the
website on your own to manage those to
post pictures links to others
facebook flickr pictures etc etc and
youtube videos yeah that's me it's so
continuing on the logistic parts ok
there was either have stickers for with
you you group the children that's
important so ahead of the ad
registration side either by giving them
specific color t-shirts like they did in
Poland or with stickers Group 1 group 2
etcetera etcetera so and then you have
an agenda for the day with the groups
groups one goes from da tours from eight
nine to ten or nine to 1030 to that
workshops etc etc then you scheduled the
whole day like this all the whole
afternoon or morning then of course you
need to give a copy of the agenda to the
trainer so they know which groups there
are supposed to to have doing that
specific period of time in the day so
one thing that we may not have explained
is there are different formats to the
day itself the day off you could say i'm
going to have one workshop in the
morning one workshop in the afternoon
different set of kids or another format
is you could say i'm going to have one
long day i'm going to have four parallel
running workshops scratch running in
room one green foot running in room two
minecraft modding running in room three
and then kids are going to move from
room 12 room to to room three that way
all the kids get to do all the workshops
and that's where you know this rotation
agenda would come in handy so you define
you know here is group one you go moving
from room 321 and then you're doing 132
so that well all the different formats
are welcome feel free to devise your own
so in sorry Cindy Fox UK in London we
actually had it organized chaos we just
did the workshops and the children could
just choose where they went but that was
also enabled because of the building it
was like an open space environment so
that actually worked there so it depends
also a bit on the location how you can
do it what we did notice is that there
were a lot of children they just stuck
or stayed in the Minecraft modding so
make sure you anticipate that even if
Microsoft has bought them the children
don't care about that
right they will still like to do a lot
of Minecraft modding so that's a hot one
which we will talk about later you had a
question yeah find out if you already is
a developing chaplain in our skater like
I can find that you have the countries
listed on d on the website let me let me
show you shoot a meal to the info oh
yeah we talked to any one of us you see
how the list of countries are ready and
then or you can just contact us in order
to to to get to ask any questions that
you guys have and then there is also a
map if you go to write the team knew who
you can zoom let's say inside it's a
google map so you can zoom it and then
you can see basically for example in
Spain we have some discussion already
yeah alright so this is ling from the
main site if you're looking for anything
in the u.s. right now we have a san
francisco bay area chapter that i run
there's a bit of a denver chapter
there's a bit of a Denver chapter
anywhere else I'm happy to run work with
you on that now yeah if you can't find
your way just send us an email or
treaters and then we'll have will be
more than happy to help you so the
trainers during the workshop need some
help because dealing with let's say
sometimes 50 children to up to 10 to 50
children's in a workshop it's kind of
difficult for just one person so we
generally have one assistant / 5
children's in order to help the children
that if they have questions so they have
issues to have the trainer in those in
those kind of situations of course they
need to be trained but okay it's not
that complex and of course you need to
be to make sure that those people are
there on time what we also do is like
some people want to volunteer at the day
itself like a parents and they didn't
have time to prepare so you just asked
about just follow the first workshop as
you are like a kid and then the next
workshop they already up to speed and
actually can help so that's also a very
organic way
getting people involved or even the
parents so that's a no brain yeah not
just for the workshop but also for the
logistic parts means you need to have
some help also the support on on that
side too which is also important yeah
that's what I just say so for the
registration the lunch snacks do you
have to noon breaks etc need to have
some help first aid kit is always useful
to have just in case insurance we
already talked about that marketing part
it's Flyers emailing schools
communication Facebook's Twitter etc you
used all the social media yet do you
have in your hands in order to propagate
the announcement of your event and of
course contact us so we can also
broadcast that information to do the
rest of the world and so insurance is
really dependent on the city and the
country you're organizing it like in
Belgium even like we have a Flemish and
a french-speaking part like in the
Flemish part they don't care so we
didn't have to have an insurance in the
French part we had and it took literally
it took a couple of weeks to actually
get that sorted so double-check that
because it will take a bit of time to
get that in order and double check with
the venue where you're organizing it
this week okay so yeah def Fox for kids
t-shirts I mean even for us as big
developers write the t-shirt is really
like the trophy it's the best you can
get right and it's the same for children
as well so definitely you know getting
some local printed t-shirts with the
colors and so on they really appreciate
that and you know they go to the school
bit of tee shirt even I know what I did
last weekends and you know those
bragging rights basically so I think
that's always good to hoot to do another
one which is really I've got an
interesting anecdotes we had a Java user
group Bowie birds of a feather session
in France which is an annual thing and
the Java user group leaders were
complaining they were saying like men
I've been organizing drug events for 15
years and the best we got out of it was
like one small article in the newspaper
and then with the dev ops for kids last
weekend's and we came on national
television I said that's not fair come
on you know so you you'd seriously you
there's a lot of attention in these type
of initiatives we've been on national
television in France in Belgium and you
be surprised
of course you need to inform them but
they're very always excited to actually
see what we're doing for children and
then keep in mind we're not just doing
basic problems you see the regular
workshops later on but we are doing
workshops which are even fun for big
kids right so you have to watch out for
that as well because parents they go
like they move their son away so now
I'll play with it's all play with it
right so um but yeah the question
so how do you deal with it yeah well
it's in the weekend so if we're all
doing this an only voluntary basis I can
tell you you you organized this in one
day you'll be tired like hell right but
you'll be laying in your pets at six
o'clock in the evening with a big smile
on your face and no money in the world's
can pay that right so that should be the
motivation and if it's too much work
don't do it I mean it needs to be fun
for both of you and the kids so you know
try to find that balance yeah of course
the man sorry was the more you are the
bell you can share the work the work
load okay I spent a lot of time in
managing all these organizations with
the help of different people I really
spend a lot of time or so this here in
the US to do that so it takes takes a
lot of time okay but I Stefan said it's
worth doing this it's very very
rewarding yeah but this another
important part that we focus on is
scalability as that's why you're talking
about I agree we all have day jobs you
know that's what we are paid for this is
completely non paid for voluntary work
but that's where we do train the trainer
sessions so for example we are having a
big event on October twelfth in the bay
area with about 300 kids we can scale to
that level without doing training other
trainers so for example we're working
with some other high school kids there's
a kid who came to my home about two
weeks ago I want to do a iOS
fundamentals workshop I said I'm good so
all I'm doing is I'm working with him
behind the scenes and no coaching him
how to be a good instructor so you
recruit those high school kids who are
looking for a public speaking
opportunity talk to your local jog once
again you know share the interest hey
we're doing the divorce for kids event
we need more people to work with us most
of the time the hitch I have seen is oh
you know what material I don't have the
material I don't know what to do that's
where we train you you train them so
it's like think global act local but
we're also seeing like it definitely
with the run sun is that having a kids
to the workshop that's that's the
ultimate prize the ultimate price we
have like we did a scratch workshop on
saturday
and there was a boy came back to us
afterwards and said like oh yeah I've
been playing with scratch let me show
you what I've done I've done some
physics engine programming in scratch I
mean like she okay this is way too smart
for us so you got really some very smart
children and if you motivate them
rightly they can actually be the
instructor because the children will
really really know that works that
dynamic because otherwise it's more like
that the big adult saying what you need
to do so you can even get the children
involved and you know that's that's
perfect their launch for their career
right i mean so that's that's good on a
logistics best practices so we do online
registration in belgium we use
eventbrite you know you do have to give
a small percentage because online
payments to Costa do cost a small fee
but that works for nice i mean you can
get their names their emails and then
you know that that works fine I don't
know what you do you meet up meet up so
in the bay area we have a meet up and
that's again very local so on the meetup
page we go to meetup com / devoxx for
kids dash Bay Area we literally started
at the first workshop like last year
December and now in about 9 to 10 months
we have about 800 parents already signed
up over there so any time we announce
the workshop it automatically goes out
to all the parents and our workshop sell
out really quick and and I say sell out
I really mean that no registration is
gone pretty quickly so from a statistics
point of view in your online
registration if it's possible try to
actually also capture the gender so that
you know if it's a boy or a girl because
that's really interesting from a
statistic point of view because you'll
be amazed so we've what we've noticed is
that actually over thirty five percent
of the children are girls which is
really great use it to see I mean I
organized a fox for big kids which is
the normal devoxx and we only have like
five percent our girls in Europe so you
know this is like this disconnect like
35 girls and then only five girls five
percent girls ten years later so that is
also very nice extra motivation for the
gender equality that yeah if you can
inspire those children at a young age
where they haven't yet decided what
career they gonna do you know this is
making a difference f question no so in
our manifest so the question is are you
could you also do what FX for kids for
only girls so yeah yeah yeah so let me
repeat because this is recorded so your
your concern is that girls are
intimidated by boys if they're in this
group together and they might not show
up but well in our manifesto we say we
don't discriminate not not on gender or
color or what race or whatever yeah i
mean we're flexible i mean we did it as
long as you do something i mean i'm
already very happy but my personal view
is that you know we had some girls like
there was a girl which she felt a bit
sick on saturday and it will be called
them the the parents and they said no
it's just stress and so on so what we
did immediately because she was
separated from her friends so we
immediately put her back next to her
friend I mean told her like hey you can
just work together all day and then she
like okay that was fine now we've had
and so what you can also do we had like
the black girls coding group and these
were all girls coming in group and they
just stick together and I was fine so
you know if you can create some kind of
environment for them then that works as
well and even if the boys are there you
know they just push them away and then
they have fun so but yeah
posted out there take he grossed about
and check this out I before and one of
the things they have in NASA they have
it's called space it's space-boat coast
it's the girls and sciences and this
number
yeah so just let me interrupt you there
if that's your motivation to do it go
for it I mean do a girls only thing I
really know the more initiatives there
are the better something yeah now one of
the things that we did earlier this year
for example we work with Intel in the
bay area and they got some
underprivileged girls to a purely girls
35 girls from middle school we did a
workshop for them internal Ranger 835
girls we did a scratch workshop for them
so we have done workshops like that and
we are already reached out to black
girls code they want us to do a workshop
for them we reached out to women who
code you know they want to do a workshop
for a young women for them so by all
means as a matter of fact as part of day
works for kids board one of the things
we are talking about is reaching out to
the I wouldn't say under privileged but
less serve the community so you know
girls definitely is one of our big
target we really want to improve the
gender equality
so if you are local to barrier I know
reach out to me I'm happy to run a
workshop at no with your daughter and
her friends at their school at their
community in your neighborhood we're
happy to come out and talk to you and we
use technologies like Google hangout and
I've talked to several people all over
the US doing train the trainer sessions
or even saying you know hey this is the
material do this do this do this so I
can train you then you can run it for
your daughter's environment I think
Regina had a point as well yeah
the you know we we we just try to adapt
to the situations okay also from from
the from it doesn't need to be branded
devoxx for kids also means as long as we
reach our goal is to reach a maximum of
children okay branded under the name the
box for kids we have a good partnership
with Jedi they made the Jedi for kids in
the Philippines fine we don't care means
as long as they reach a maximum of
children we are happy it really depends
on the locations of course in the valley
you have more say children that have
access already two computers do to the
parents and have already playing no
using a computer's doing real
programming with them we have tried from
seven to fourteen 14 years old of course
the younger do you are you have
children's the more mode guide instead
they need to have of course we had the
first the first indium Saddam they were
a girl from she was six at that time six
or seven shibori was able to use a mouse
so we had a dedicated person following
her all the day long to really
concentrate on her and make sure that
she also enjoy the day so one of the
things that we do in that case is what
we tend to be flexible so even though we
say scratch workshop is 48 year plus but
if some girl or some boy wanna be is
seven year old and the parents say my
kid can handle this we say bring it on
but then stay stay with your kid because
we don't want that could you know I
don't want the instructor or a volunteer
to sit with them all the time because
when the parents can help the kid follow
along so I think that generally works
for us and a lot of it is / workshop as
well so for
example if is a Minecraft modding
workshop although a six year old male of
Minecraft but I would not include them
in a modern workshop because it requires
typing clicking on the editor and I'm
moving around windows so that may be a
little too overwhelming for them so a
lot of it is workshop driven no yeah
let's move all of it because we're yeah
okay let's move also for the parents of
course a children's love showing their
results what they've done to the parents
we notice that several times so take
time in the agenda to make sure that
children are able to show the result to
the parents it's very rewarding for them
and the parents are very happy to see
that okay they learned something today
also take also as we are ruined said it
already before try to embrace some
parents to okay please join the team so
next time you can help as a volunteer so
so always useful may continue all you
okay so one of the things that we
encourage in our workshop is no provide
a simple to use URL that all the
instructions all the slides are at this
URL don't expect them to type you know
meetup.com / dev works for credit /
files nothing of that so we just give a
simple bit ly URL say bit ly and out
date and that's it that is something
that they connect with so keep it really
really simple then once they have the
instructions then avoid too much typing
so for example when we do the TNT
explosion works off workshop we talk
about that a little bit later we just
say just change to 24 or 48 so very
simple very clearly changes you know one
of my classic examples is I was giving a
workshop and I said ok enter this
command so she's already been entered so
type the command ok she typed the
command and then she's waiting so what
happened who I type the command so I
mean press Enter so the instructions
have to be very very explicit very very
clear you know that way I love the kids
honesty because they exactly listen to
what you say so you are not clear
instructions make sure you are clear
fine analogies with daily life you know
when we started talking about Java for
example we started correlating you know
how there is a car and multiple kinds of
cards you know how there is a fruit
multiple kinds of food we can I showed
inheritance abstraction with that way we
said if you eat a fruit fruit is not
good you chuck it that's exception
handling so fine analogies Robin that
really worked because you are really
creating analogies from their daily life
oh yeah one of the kids for the workshop
showed up late I said you know what I
let you into the workshop because I did
exception handling because everybody
came in on time you came late I did
exception handling and now I'm saying
okay now you're part of the normal flow
so create those analogies from their
daily life which they will understand
and they'll remember that our focus is
not really education even though that's
what we do a lot of it most of it
actually I focus really on having them
fun if this is their first experience
absolutely make sure they have fun you
know I mean create funny workshops you
know where they enjoy it add sound at
jazz at color at glitter make sure this
is dramatized yeah add some robots make
sure they have fun because if they have
fun they can I stay connected with
technology okay so we moved to the
scratch parts going to few we're going
to see a few few workshop that we do so
scratch well known not my da my team is
who doesn't know scratch each other just
out of interest so don't off using our
campus ok so it's visual programming
what it is don't know what it is ok so
it's visual programming you drag some
blocks on the program doing sequential
order of blocks you cannot link blocks
if they are not entitled to be linked it
together you have an online and offline
mode of scratch and of course you can
publish the project or online on the
website of scratch so P the children
Canyon
you work on there were on the project at
home with other friends so here we
introduce them to basic concept of
programming like sequences integrations
logics sequential order of execution
parallel order of executions event
handling etc etc you have a plenty of
different possibilities easy to use
multilingual which is also important so
you can switch the scratch to be
displayed in French English Dutch
whatever language they have translated
the interface in different languages
which is useful for for the children so
this was developed by MIT and they just
recently also published in an iOS
version for on the iPads and it's really
great I mean you can really just like
you install it it's free and just drag
these components onto the dashboard
basically and play with it so this is
one of the the hots workshops that we
give a deputy Devils for kids yeah for
the attendees really depending on the
attendees but it can go from five to
fifteen using a standard computer
there's no real specific requirements as
a computer point of view and no
absolutely no experience is required for
the children down all the parents in
order to to play with it instructors say
fourteen Prisk years old it's capable of
the preparation is 30 minutes as a
knowledge if you practice to see how to
scratch works the editor works and may
and have fun basically practicing the
same workshop before it so you basically
install it on your tablets and every
time you go to the toilets you test it a
bit and you're prepared basically that's
it so it's it's minimum effort yeah
clean the clean the tablet after on it
so the the workshop is as all the others
is step-by-step instructions and the
goal is also to make sure that after a
few steps the children can already see
the results ok because immediate result
is also important for the truth don't
spend hours encoding whatever in
whatever workshops make quick result is
important so they can really enjoy it
and
see behavior change space of what they
have done but as a modification on the
code so one thing in general that we
encourage is even though your workshops
are a little bit of structure where you
say do step one step two step three then
let's step 4 5 be their own give them
that free time where they can explore
that their creativity actually come out
that is very very important but but
instant gratification is key if you
don't like if they don't see a result
within 10 minutes you might lose their
attention so that's really a pound and
by doing this you can stay they can stay
focus a long time on the exercises and
undoing your day of course so what we
have done also that you have the normal
scratch version that you can use and
recently few months ago they release
crushed version 2 and we decided also
let's try to make something fun out of
it because a lot of children knows
already scratch we want to add something
new to do to their attention and we envy
use the leap motion devices so i have
here kind of replacement for the most
basically the just wave on top of this
device which can detect the two
different hands even more and use
interact with that device use the events
provided by that device to make the
scratch moving the scratch cat for
example moving around in an easy way
it's kind of Minority Report you know
together the movie kind of interaction
with the the software in the game and
some parents were really amazed when
they saw that children doing this with
just their hands waiting on top of this
it's very easy just add additional few
blocks dedicated for the leap motion
events like hands hands is open left
hand or right hand is open fingers is
selected texture of a soap is pointing
to to the screen except raksha bandhan
it's easily and really fun just to give
you an idea what has been done by a
child in the Box in France in Paris
see the goal okay he's manipulating the
hands the blue hands you see on the
screen we sit on hand so grabbing the
cat like opening the hand and grabbing
the cat and moving the cat around the
maze they're doing this in less than
like 30 minutes yeah this is not a full
day this is like 30 minutes yeah
actually with that child we just show
how to use the leap motion having their
hands grabbing the cat on the white
screen desktop and then he immediately
start because in you scratch immediately
you had an idea okay we create a maze
and I will move the cat around the maze
by handing it through virtual hands and
then you create that game in 30 minutes
showing of course to to the others to
the other children's the the game you
just did and we all were blaze mer by by
this belly skin next one all right how
many of your kids play Minecraft you
keep your hand high okay how many of
them are addicted isn't it so I think
this is a beautiful workshop for kids
like that now my son I've been playing
Minecraft for about three years addicted
as all yours are and that's what we try
to leverage in this workshop this
workshop where we teach them some of the
mods that we are showing over here is
for example how you can make a bigger
TNT explosion you know how you can by
default the TMT explosion is about to
block or four blocks we make it 40
blocks that's the first mod that we
start with and I've seen parents and
kids with the moment they get control of
the game you see their eyes and mouth
leg and they're staring at the screen
for a few seconds like I did that
because the moment you are in control
you are in power they're excited so some
of the mods that we do for example is
Azam
is by default I've learned the game
somewhat from my son now zombies by
default drop rotten flesh now they can
drop diamonds you know there are lots of
different furnaces and crafting recipes
that you can make by default for example
furnace takes 10 seconds to smell
something you can make it smelt in like
two seconds or a second so the loss of
different ways by which we can mod the
game we don't tell them by the way you
are doing java programming they don't
need to know that you know we start with
a simple yeah it's a sneak programming
it's a sneak programming so we really
require like 80 or plus or nine year
plus overkill really flexible some kids
are smart they can actually do it at
eight year also seven year also so we
cannot judge it by the kid that way all
we need is just a computer because we
have a market which allow me to ask you
to download prior hand so you download
the market we do require that you have
previous minecraft playing experience
sometimes we have had kids that show up
to the workshop they say oh I I thought
this is the Java workshops this is not
really a Java workshop per se we are
really leveraging your minecraft
excitement passion and converting that
into the domain knowledge so for example
the way we introduce packages in this
workshop is we say tell me example of
different entities so they start saying
big sheep and they list down all the
names so you know what all of these are
bundled together as a java class in a
package that's how we introduce the
concept of a package so now and the
moment we say we are changing a TNT
explosion from four to twenty blocks by
the way that for was a float variable we
talk about float variables that way and
that f is required because we're default
is double so you start kind of
introduced in those concepts gently
which they croak right away because now
you're leveraging their domain knowledge
which they are already good at no
programming experience required at all
in terms of instructors it is always
nice to have some java experience
because most of the time we have seen
when kids are kind of modifying the code
over there they don't understand oh this
curly braces need to stay there or they
move the
all over around they don't understand
where to add the code as much clearer as
you are but probably you're not clear
kids are not able to follow the
instructions sometimes you have to
repeat it once twice thrice just make
sure that the follow along and then
that's where the instructors Java
experience would help say let's say they
added some code that was supposed to be
added inside a method they are it
outside the method after the braces then
you kind of guide them out of this needs
to go inside the method and take that
opportunity to teach them how many of
your kids would get excited if you tell
them come sit with me I'm going to teach
you trip no metric not really however if
you tell them you know think my son came
to me Dad my arrow goes in a trajectory
I wanted to go straight I got you logged
in come sit with me I'm going to teach
you about sine cosine and we were going
to make your arrow go straight because
ultimately you got to learn those
concepts and apply them programmatically
so for attendee for instructors really
minecraft playing experience is not
necessary most of my workshops are done
with my son but if he is not there then
I know how to do the mod and Regina and
myself we had a fun experience at last
year devoxx Belgium we were giving a
minecraft modding workshop session we
knew exactly how to mod we didn't know
how to play the game so we had to send
our SOS you know somebody in the dev ox
knows how to play minecraft because oh
this was just to space tabs we don't
know the myspace taps work to go up so
then what I do in that case is if I'm
giving a Minecraft morning workshop I
teach the kids that this is how you do
the mod and then hey you know what
you're you good at minecraft you show
the mod so then I let them show the mod
so for the instructor or for the
volunteer minecraft modding is playing
experience is not required but
encouraged you to read and practice the
instructions but two hours which is not
bad workshop style very simple it's a
mod kit which is ready to go you
download the market it is bundled with
eclipse it's a win 32 64 Mac 32 64 and
eclipse on a Linux version all the
different operating system versions are
there because that's all eclipse varies
our it comes with a four is a force base
modding so
it comes with the food source code and
everything we will diffuse simple mods
expand on the Java concepts one of the
magical keys we teach them is ctrl Z and
seriously it works like a magic now hey
you messed up to money do keep control Z
hold it on it just cleans up everything
that they have done and then you start
all over again so things like simple
tricks really work we have done
minecraft modding workshops for hour and
a half and we have gone up to four hours
we have done kids like the first
workshop that I did in my living room
was 12 kids and we have given these
workshops for up to 70 kids at a given
point of time so all different ranges
work in that sense of course the
material is available on github so you
can walk through the tree there are even
video instructions for instructor
specifically or for kids who want to try
it out themselves so you go to this bit
ly URL again convenient bit ly minecraft
tutorial so you go to that URL there are
instructions and how do you download the
market how do you try it out so
encourage your kids to try it out I
don't see how they feel about it shoot
us a mail that any hey we liked it and
we would like to run it in our local
school local community local drug I
don't see a reason why each jug should
not run add a box for kids chapter
locally as well control-z paired with
another attendee that works very well
because it's teaches them pair
programming worst case we tell them you
know delete your directory if your files
are all messed up delete your directory
unzip the market again and start all
over again okay so since since loss here
at FX four kids Netherlands actually
started with also electronics and so
they actually pioneered an arduino
arduino workshop and then I know Stefan
Ching was also very enthusiastic to
actually get Raspberry Pi in there now
the Raspberry Pi is an interesting one
because if you're in an area where you
really are lacking computers then you
can actually use this device to actually
set up the development environment I
mean the Raspberry Pi actually comes
pre-installed with scratch so if you can
hook up with HDMI screen and a keyboard
you've actually already have your
development environment there however
for Minecraft morning it's a bit too
complex or it's too demanding and for
green food as well so scratch just
definitely work so that's that's also an
interesting way to actually get some
development devices actually one of my
first exposure to my son with raspberry
pi was when he got the Raspberry Pi book
and he looked at the table of content is
you know what actually can run minecraft
on it so then he played around with it
then no we got him the hdmi cable and
all the accessories required with it he
connected with the TV and he run
minecraft so you can't do modding on it
it's not it's very demanding but at
least you can run minecraft and that way
they at least understand the basic
fundamentals oh it requires the keyboard
it requires the hdmi cable and things
like that so we fly class saturday we
even did a session where the children
were able to actually assemble the
computer so you don't pre assemble them
they give them the parts and they were
able to make their own computer and you
collect wow we made our own computer
right and they're so proud of it and
then they start programming on it as
well so it's like you know you're
opening their eyes the tinkling in their
eyes and you feel like really like yeah
maybe you made a difference so but on
the Arduino one one of the really
ambitions we want to do is play with
let's again that that instant
gratification so what we actually do is
that we we got the arduino kit starter
kits which i'll show you later on and
there's two approaches to this so i
don't know if you know arduino but you
basically need to program in c so
depending on the children's age you need
to approach it and then different or you
need to approach it differently so like
with this children here what we did is
that we pre installed a small c program
which actually runs and blinks a let so
didn't didn't have to see the the
program they only have to actually make
sure that the lads and the cables on the
bread port were put on the right place
so they're basically playing with
electronics but not programming it
however if you have children of like 12
13 years old you can also show the sea
program which is it's not really too
complicated it's only like 10 15 lines
so you know that's doable so that's
that's definitely the two angles over an
arduino workshop so what we do is
like I said in the features assemble the
electronic parts you explain we actually
have the slide so online of course where
we also first explain a bit electronics
what is voltage even the loss Ohm's law
so at least they have a bit of a
contextual idea of what's going on there
but then basically it's like Lego you
know you did you just start to assemble
these things and and Instagram if
occasion you'll be amazed what they do
say okay so i can like blink tits let's
and then they start adding more let's do
the bread sport and and yeah they have
so much creativity that they always
blows your mind what they are able to do
so that's really really interesting so
we also show them like we know what our
resistors we do that in a very
educational type of way and yeah this is
a really fun you know hands-on practical
workshop which children love actually so
from an utter d perspective aged 10 to
14 but like i said if you don't do the c
programming you can actually get
children even younger it's not on this
list but if you really want to push more
electronics there's also something
called Maki Maki which was a Kickstarter
project i believe and mucky mucky allows
you to actually put sensors on to foods
or any objects which is on a table and
by adding sensor enabling these physical
devices like fruits you can actually
turn that into an instrument so by
tapping then the bananas and the fruit
they actually i have created a keyboard
to play music and that works really
great for like five to seven-year-olds
so they only need to like a touch it and
that's it and it's magic if you then
want to do programming you need to watch
out again within the c / c programming
etc but so that there's multiple ways
you don't need any internet connection
so it's offline just a standard computer
will do or if you use the Raspberry Pi
you already have the computer that's
really good and from the instructors
point of view definitely 16 years and
older you do need to revisit the laws
and a bit the voltage and all of that I
mean you just need to refresh that I
mean I'm not an electronic person but
you know I was
able to do that I actually followed the
Arduino workshop two times and then you
write knew what to do so I could
actually run that one as well so that's
that's a really fun one so it does come
with a bit of a price because you do
need to buy the hardware so they have
this arduino starter kit for about 80
euros one hundred one hundred dollars or
so and that box actually has everything
so we like both six of those and it's
great I mean you know it's like it for
me devix for kids is also a great excuse
to buy all of this stuff right because
my wife goes like did you really have to
buy this and but it's for devix for kids
that's what happened so so so that works
out well but like you know we bought
like a six or seven and then we actually
spin it around and Daniel is like
travelling from netherlands and then
giving all the hardware to the dutch
team and they give it back and you can
really share the material as well so
that's a really fun one to do from a
practical point of view these have like
gpio ports and it's basically these
different pinpoints that you can
actually use and put small cables in
there to actually program the in and
outs of these devices and it's pretty
safe because they get powered via USB
it's like five fold so they can't really
get their hair straight if they put
their finger in there so it's pretty
safe from that angle yeah something to
others so on the adrenal part is that
you can combine the Arduino 'he's we
scratch you have a specific editors
scratch that is capable of understanding
event to be connected with our Dino
devices in order to use sensors of the
adrenals to move to be used as blocks
events in the scratch editor the main
the same principle as the leap motion
stuff but with our Dino devices so on
the robotics part of you point of view
we use nows so the little little guy
over there to let the children also play
with robots and to tell them okay
computers or you have you used to use to
know the computers like desktops laptops
but
a robot is also a computer that he can
program okay it has different type of
interfaces sensors that you can use but
also here the rules are the same the
principle of the same a scratch you have
more sensors as I said and we let them
play with the editor the software
programming editors for for called
choreograph for the now you know to move
blocks around in on the on the desktop
on the programming space and links them
together through wires visual Wars and
this makes the program basically the
sequential set of orders and every
blocks correspond to either setting up a
sensor on the robots making the robots
walking making the robots talking etc
etc so we have a set of work a workshop
for that step by step they do a few
exercises in order to at the end create
a one full programs where the robot
really interact with dynamically with
the with the children so talking to the
children asking questions children's
response to the questions and then the
robot acts based on the answers provided
by the shipment it's very it's very
interesting for them they're always
amazed and of course the parents too
yeah in France in Paris we had an hour
workshop as well and there was actually
a family that came over with an autistic
child and so these robots are also used
for autistic children to actually reach
out to them and then get them out of
their world or however you call that but
if that's the case you really need to
then channel that I mean we had the the
company Aldebaran robotics come over and
really do a one-on-one with the children
with the child and the parents to
explain this so you know there's lots of
different dynamics with this robot yeah
the robot is not a toy is really a
professional tool that is used by
universities to teach robotics to
students and indeed Aldebaran has a
specific workshop dedicated for autistic
sky PA children attack and as again and
a voxel kids is no discrimination of
children's we have been asked for in
deed for the day box France okay can we
workshops can we we have a demand for an
autistic child okay no problem but of
course we need to have to have the help
of the parents and they were able to the
child was able also to enjoy programming
with with now so very easy to do same
principle a scratch or flight mode of
course that we need to just install a
software the edit or the ID choreograph
on the on the on the laptop on the
computer and no experience is required
children quickly get used to the blocks
and all to link those blocks together in
order to make a real funny exercise with
the robot and they can try directly with
the robot also instructors nothing
really special here 40 40 14 years old
plus 30 minutes of preparations playing
a little bit with the robot without even
having the robot you have a virtual
robot on the IDE you can use some
practicing and understanding how those
those blocks works together and that's
it what we have noticed I always see
Daniel the Hideo often does this
workshop and the children do think it's
a toy so you have to watch out for it
because it's a very expensive toy so you
really need to make them aware that hey
you know just don't use it as like you
know give it a hug and whatever you need
to make sure that they don't get
overexcited and then just start playing
with it and for this we get full support
from the Aldebaran company so the ones
the company that builds those robots
they are really entitled to help us to
provide robots during events even a
local events being contact with the
local sales representative in order to
have event read to see if there is a
possibility to provide some robots for
the time of the events so also children
everywhere in the world can enjoy it and
by the way they are in the exhibition
booth if you want to have more and more
fun with with that robot too so again
step-by-step instructions children can
play immediately with the robot and see
the results and of course sometimes
there is a bug
something goes wrong of course their
children needs to understand why and try
to correct the issues also for those
that have already experienced the now we
let them express their creativity with
the robot and sometimes it's very funny
to see the result all right now
greenfoot is sort of the first workshop
that we do to introduce java programming
it's a project done by University of
Kent based out of UK and it provides the
IDE so you could green food or download
the IDE and now you can write simple
Java code a lot of the structure is
again focused on when you can use it to
teach object orientation basic
programming so on the right hand side
for example you will see how different
objects are available you can drag it so
if there is a total you drag it onto the
main play board and that automatically
creates an instance of it so that's the
basic concept you teach them so sort of
a drag-and-drop kind of a thing but then
when you click on the turtle on the left
side it shows the actual object class so
you can start digging into the code and
in the code itself for example you can
say there is command completion so you
can say control space and it will show
you all the methods that exist so let's
say it's a snake or a turtle the object
that you created there are lot of images
that are available so you can create
your multiple animals but once you
create those then you can say total
turned left turtle turn right turtle go
straight so you can make very easily for
example the first thing we do over here
is make a snake game you know snake eat
something and every time it eat
something we've all grown up playing
that game epidemic eat something it
grows longer or every time it hits
something it running faster and then let
the kids kind of experiment with it you
know what attribute of the snake speed
or length or size or thickness they want
to change every time the snake eat
something but what that introduces them
to is event-driven programming snake eat
something you know the event is
happening so when that event is
happening you go into that method and
write the code which is increase the
thickness or the length or the speed of
the snake
attend deep lyrics as we said in the
very beginning we do require we do these
are the recommended guidelines like 12
to 16 but depending upon if the kid has
a prior experience then they are we say
if your ten-year-old and if you think
you can a your son or daughter can
handle green foot by all means come over
here it works in an offline mode where
you download the green foot IDE you play
around with it all you require the
standard computer sometimes the kid and
the reason and we say a little bit
higher age range sometimes the kids
don't even know how to do copy paste so
you tell them oh you select with the
mouse then do ctrl C or say edit copy
and then say edit paste so those basic
typing skills so that they can match the
speed of the rest of the class are
important because otherwise if they are
left behind then they get little
disoriented and then they lose interest
completely yeah yeah yeah so yesterday
literally I met Neil Brown where I've
known him for a few years now but I met
Neil brown again Neal Brown is a person
who is responsible for maintaining green
foot he works at University of Kent so
he's maintaining the code base for green
foot he showed me the new version of
green foot so for now I mean if you
download green foot go to green food org
and download the IDE is lot more text
based but they're doing more on a
scratch based version of it so you can
literally drag and drop code blocks and
then it will automatically generate the
boilerplate code for you so for example
if you say I want an if statement you
get an if statement it automatically
create parenthesis curly braces so Java
is known to be verbose but it's war bows
for a reason because it's a readable
language but for kids that doesn't
matter so what they are trying to do is
they're trying to embrace that velocity
and not simplify it for the kids so I
think the new version they are looking
at more like early next year or middle
of next year to release that version is
going to be super cool in terms of the
instructors again and we require because
this is java programming so we do
require a java programmer it is some
basic java fundamentals typically a day
a half a day to a day long preparation
time is useful we
you can at least in pretty much most of
the workshops the requirement is we have
instructions available follow them
yourself at least once so that when you
get into the workshop you know what's
coming and you know that you have tried
it so this is a simple snake game here
so for example you can say this is a
public class Apple Apple extends block
if a collision happens the world grows
by two okay so then you set the location
and the snake keeps moving on and grow
here is same tale counter plus one so
very simple methods not too much code
over here but kids understand a lot of
concepts in it so they talk about they
understand methods here they understand
parameter passing here they understand
how to call a method they understand you
know how to change attribute of a method
a simple concept like you know dot how
do you call a method of dot that means
you're creating an instance so literally
in this one simple code no looks very
simple but you can introduce lot of
concepts to the kid and it's very
visually appealing as teffon was saying
it needs to be you know you should see
the reaction right away so for example
you can drag and drop an apple and it's
showing you on the left hand side how
the game board is going to look like oh
cool I see that if they want they can
click on it and then see the code behind
it and then on the right hand side it
also shows the class hierarchy so you
can start talking about inheritance oh
you know what everything is an actor
then there's a score then there's a
block and these are all the different
blocks it's going to start creating
hierarchy go back to the real world
analogies you know there are lots of
different fruits now then there are a
variety of fruits like sweet fruits sour
fruits and then in the sweet fruits
there are fibrous roots so you start
creating those varieties so if you're
not fortunate enough to get the nao
robots then Lego Mindstorms is a really
good alternative for addition to your
workshop where you know killed children
can play with with real robots it's
again visual programming so so it's
really you know not too difficult and
it's basically like scratch and the next
version of green foods where you
basically dragging and dropping blocks
and linking them together
the the package it's a big package comes
with different elements i mean the the
most important one is the central units
which does eat quite a bit of batteries
so that's also make sure you have enough
batteries that there is a finger the
latest version has like a rechargeable
possibility as well yeah the EV free so
make sure if you get the latest one it
actually has a rechargeable unit so
that's good but educational one as well
okay yeah that's definitely because we
were struggling in the first time it did
this we didn't have enough batteries it
was just really like eating it ok so the
educational kit is the one you need to
go for and in the box you have like
sensors you have servo motors you have
different connection cables you of
course all the Lego blocks and so on and
it's a great robot to give for your
child's Christmas or birthday or
whatever and you know that's the devil
demand it anyway so just anticipate
that's right they will go to that
station like Saturday they go to that
session and then the first thing they
say to when they see their parents I
know what I want to get from my birthday
right so be warned and it does cost
between 200 and 300 dollars so it's not
cheap but you know it's not like the
novel robot which is it's in the
thousands so the teaching concepts there
is again very similar to scratch it it's
really like dragging and dropping and
visual programming but you know play
with robots now how cool is that and
it's really like demystifying that the
whole concept because these children
when we do the robots I mean a lot of
you were like filming it and so on it's
magical and you go wow right it must be
artificial intelligence I know it's a
stupid thing right if you don't program
it it just falls flat right and the
children then all of a sudden you de
mystifying it a bit because they got wow
if I don't tell them what to do it
doesn't know anything and it goes on and
on or whatever right so I think that's
an important message to give them so
you're doing like send vents handling
different compensation processes and so
on it it's it does have quite a bit of
possibilities yeah
one of the things i want to share on the
compensation processes my son
participates in FIRST LEGO League which
is a competition done by first which is
something with robotic science and
technologies but he has done those FLL
competitions for a few years now one of
the programs they were supposed to write
as part of NXT two was a line following
program so it's a black line with a
sensor in there you would think is very
straightforward but that was one of the
most complex algorithms their team wrote
because you're constantly following the
line because the lion could curve and so
you really have to go follow the line
and that's where you learn the
compensation algorithm it was really a
three or four page long algorithm they
have to understand they work with
somebody in Stanford who guided them on
how to write that algorithm so the point
being you can start simple sensor
serving where you say oh there are four
colors over there three of them are red
one of them is green pick the green one
you can start simple with that or you
can go really elaborate very say not I'm
going to get the compensation algorithm
and write fancy stuff yeah if you do
like if you check on youtube there's
even like videos where they show you
programs how to fix a ruby cube so it
actually has a sensor to see the colors
and it will actually use its arms to
actually solve a rubiks oh you can like
really blow your minds and then do
really some very sophisticated exercises
as well so from a prerequisites point of
view you know again between 10 and 15
like a rune and daniel said if you have
smart kids which are eight or nine that
they're definitely can do this as well
it's offline so you don't need an
internet connection standard computer
and they can really start very fast with
that but which is not only slide make
sure you pre assemble the robots so
don't buy the boxes and then come with
the box is at the event because it's
going to take you a couple of hours to
assemble it right I remember that Fox
France we had a dead Fox for kids event
and they were like assembling I don't
know 45 robots two days before the event
took place and like they were almost
their fingers were almost bleeding
because we're like oh no not another
robot so yeah so what you do is that you
by like five and you give it to your
friends and everybody has like that
robot for a couple of weeks before the
event
space so that way they can first of all
assemble it play with it already get
used to it and then you know when the
day comes you're ready to start so from
an instructor point of view because we
have nice workshops which explain step
by step it can already be done by a kid
of 14 years old there's a bit of
preparation but I do definitely
recommend play with it first before you
do the workshop so yeah already
mentioned that step by step you have the
IDE nothing more to out there it is a
very rewarding one I mean the children
really love that and we have like one
where they have to like clap their hands
then the robot moves then it turns takes
the ball it's a very rewarding very
inspiring type of workshops oh yeah
definitely you should try to include
that if you do with their folks for kids
all right so that roughly completes our
overview of workshops we still have like
what's the time half an hour 4 minutes
so if you have any questions now is the
time to shoot and thank you for your
attention
so you wouldn't you would be surprised
the emails we get like parents go like
okay I would like to send my kid for one
week for deaf folks with sleeping so and
they just think it's cheap day care
right so you have to watch out with that
a bit as well I mean personally I mean
I'm more than happy to commit and help
during one day but it really depends on
your you know energy and then how far
and you want to take it but universities
they really starting to embrace that and
my personal goal like I told before we
started my really personal mission is
that once we can get these workshops
injected into the classical educational
system then I think our job is done
because seriously I'm motivated why
because well first of all my boy asked
me like I want to learn to program but I
saw what he's 13 years old now and the
stuff he gets from my tea is Excel and
PowerPoint he's 13 years old and that's
in Belgium but it's a worldwide problem
powerpoint and excel comment you could
be doing all of these workshops instead
from an age of seven and eight so we
need to like kick the teachers and try
to get them on board as well and then
that's really I think they're one of the
bigger pictures of this initiative but
hey if you want to do a summer camp
knock yourself out you know so one of
the things i would say is you know if
you have any contacts with the education
industry here like we are being reached
out by local Santa Clara County that we
would like to have some summer
enrichment program so what we are doing
is we're working with them sharing our
program that we have the material take
it we can train the instructors we can
do the instructions ourselves but at
least share the material with them and
let them know run with it so if you have
you know in the u.s. definitely if you
have any contacts with the education
industry university schools feel free to
share the material and if you have
questions connect them we'll be happy to
help out as much as we can
baby good the question is is there a
debauch circus chapter in charlotte
north carolina I'm not aware of for
Charlotte North Carolina chapter as of
yet so happy to run one just as we
explained maybe we didn't do a good job
of that so let me hey mister mister
first ok ok that's ok so see to us
really the website is the key resource
we try to put everything up there so you
wanna say join us thats basically
explains what we required we expect
offered a box for kiss chapter what are
the requirements to set up a local
chapter they're really straightforward
you know all we ask you is you know look
at the different logistics this session
is recorded so you will have access to
all the material but in the US
specifically we are a registered
nonprofit organization and a 501c3 so
you can actually generate funding with
that I know we do workshops all over the
Bay Area but all you need is a hosting
facility find out you know talk to your
local school library Foothill College so
all that material you know you have
available just go to this website and
this talk has been recorded it will be
placed on parlays as well and we've
already did a similar one which you can
just if you press the play button you
will just rehear what we've just done so
yep
mindstorms kids a lot of money person
yes yes oh yeah so the question is you
know it's a lot of hardware you need to
buy and so on is it acceptable to get
sponsors totally yes so we have a
non-profit in the u.s. we have a
non-profit in Europe and through those
nonprofits we have a legal entity which
actually can accept donations or
sponsoring Red Hat is being a sponsor in
u.s. Oracle has been a sponsor in Europe
and then we use these funds to actually
buy hardware and actually provide it to
the local chapters if we can like even
we received a robot from Aldebaran
robotics and like I said Daniel is like
traveling around with this card though
then giving that robot to the local
chapter so there's ways there but you
can also you know join the nonprofit
organization they already have funds to
help you as well but if you have like if
you work for a big company and they want
to donate it to nonprofit for of course
I mean we will use that money for
t-shirts and hardware that's what we use
it for we don't pay ourselves any salary
at all so that's not part of that
equation so one of the things that we do
also is you know when we did the first
rd know workshop we got those are do
workshops because we work with orale
media closely we got those are maker kit
our Dino work it's for very cheap price
but then we let the kid use the kit in
the workshop at the end of the day we
say no these kids are up for sale so
whatever price we bought them for
parents paid the money and they took the
kids away so that's another way you can
look at it you have some in Quebec I'm
just looking at it on the sides we have
in toronto in quebec it's a run to in
Quebec no no no not yet they are busy
with the administration part
specifically for Toronto yeah just
contact us and I will be in touch with
you I will make you in be in touch with
the persons in in Canada if you want to
discuss further with them the gold also
is to have a local representative in the
country in the region to help out the
people who wants in the region in a
country in the neighbors to set up
something in order to teach a
programming to children it's still three
questions a little lady first
so you guys
yeah so so the question is once they
follow the one-day workshop what's the
follow-up so one of the things we do is
that we do publish all the workshops
online so the children if they didn't
like complete a third workshop or they
didn't follow it because you like
schedule different workshops in parallel
they can go to the website and already
start or continue there that's one thing
one of my dreams is actually to start
actually recording all of these
workshops and put it on parlays for free
so the children can actually even if
they're not fortunate enough to come to
a physical meeting they could actually
watch it online and we will then include
it on the devoxx website so that's a bit
what we're doing I know it's only a
small drop in the ocean but it's a start
and I don't know if you thought about
before since two years we've already
reached 3,000 children and you know it
started with my son basically so who
knows what's going to happen if you all
start a local chapter you know this will
just exponentially grow and hopefully we
can do even more after one day events
sir
but Michael ourselves into the
universities where they're making a bit
quite a bit money during the camera so
I'm not sure how many more negative
these are doing something with
psychologist because I to question yeah
the question is you know in Atlanta
particularly there is id tech camps
which is lot into colleges and they
actually make money out of it would they
be amenable to have something like from
where they can't make money now our
target audience as you recognize is up
to like 16 18 14 that sort of age so
we're really looking at school level
right sure sure yeah yeah well I mean I
think one of the unique advantages that
we provide because we are all in the
high-tech industry is the quality of the
workshops and there are several such
camps here in the bay area as well but
we have seen people coming to our
workshops as I said our workshops sell
out really fast the registration goes
really fast everybody is trying to work
towards that effort I think is a good
cause you know and we are all working
towards it we are working and we really
want to inspire the classical education
system here so instead of saying you
know we want to make money out of it
that's the reason we registered it as an
NPO and the moment people here NPO when
we talk to parents is all about raising
awareness so when we talk to parents and
say by the way in what you're paying 500
dot so when my son went to a i think a
3d printing workshop buying paying 550
bucks for like a three-hour workshop on
for days it's like you know i can buy a
3d printer for five hundred fifty bucks
and said dad this is boring this is
drinker cad i just learned in one hour
unless everything was boring so that's
where we are getting into know providing
a high quality experience
because he's going to propagate right
but I think we're targeting but lower
than than universities the exact exactly
and as I said earlier that one of our
main goals for next year is to reach out
to that underprivileged community as a
matter of fact I was already talking to
Lana drug guys as yeah so I've talked to
them already we're already thinking
about as part of dev Nexus which happens
in Atlanta there's the possibility of
doing a day box for kids event there so
again goes back to like no idea tech
camps have been running for a few years
it's all about doing these events
organically and raising awareness sorry
her question yes so how do you recommend
marketing well first of all if you do
decide to do your own events contact us
I mean we will use our you know website
I mean I ruined he's like twelve
thousand followers on Twitter he will
tweet about that as well and I'll
retweet and so on so the social media we
know how to play that game right so that
from a virtual point of view we can
definitely help you from a physical
point of view you need to contact a
local you know newspaper or even you
know school television station and just
drop them a line and you be amazed you
know on the reactions the best the best
the best thing is we can show the video
if you want the best thing is go to our
website use one of the videos that we
have and you will be and the people will
be amazed sorry let's okay let's restart
and those guys means they will buy
indirectly that we say okay go for it
how much you need let me help you
hey
so if you show that video that's that's
your mark if you go to the press media
you have plenty of pictures other videos
from different event worldwide just
select the one you you you best like and
then show them up and it's a done deal
believe me questions again
okay so do you ask the kids to bring the
standard computer yeah so uh yeah very
standard computer typically for each
workshop and our kids bring their normal
computers and if they are in a middle
school or high school they generally
have their own computer if not we also
know there have been workshops where we
have our skirts no can I bring my imac
that's the only thing I have so yeah
bring it on in or depending upon the
facility or if they don't have it we say
come over we'll pay a few pair you up
with somebody so those are different
options either the location provides you
with the computers or the children comes
with their own computers yes yeah you
can rent also computers if you don't
find it go to the libraries they have
computers schools that have computer
rooms equipped the more than there would
be more than happy to help or use the
Raspberry Pi yeah Raspberry Pi there are
plenty of devices now coming in with it
based on the Raspberry Pi that help you
to have for cheaper chip ammonium amount
of money to get computer CS on the back
yes
yes yes so the question was the question
was if I want to organize this with the
high schools or descendants and schools
yes are you able to will you be able to
attend a conference call eventually yes
absolutely we are there to help you to
convince your interlocutors to be part
of this wonderful experience you know to
reach as much as possible as much as
children as possible yes any type of
school means if you look at the
Philippines for example they started
with even bringing their own chairs the
team bring their own chairs in the
schools in the room because the way no
chair other computers tables and chairs
to do to do the things in very
restricted area poor poor where poor
children's and poor families were
located in school so absolutely i think
one of the good ways that we would love
to promote is reach out to you know your
own kids schools you know find out what
clubs they can run you know talk to
their school just help us get a first
introductory talk about day works for
kids in your schools it could be a
standard 30 minute talk we could do over
a google hangout depending upon the time
zone any one of us can present and then
it should goes from there and I mean if
their school wanna run a regular Club
material workshop would happen to work
with you on that yeah we are even have
my it's not available online file a
thing no it's not available online that
we can provide a reference to a specific
link to it is PowerPoint presentation
that presents the organ in the box for
kids initiative so you can directly use
it and show them to the principles or to
the sponsors for example other questions
yes
arias with something else that maybe you
don't understand sisters can stay with
yes so the question was do you provide
some relaxing areas too for the parents
for example for the younger brothers or
sisters yes we do that we also have some
demo of high-tech kind of new devices
new toy that we can show as a as a demo
during a break points of course we
organize about you need to also have
breaks between between workshops so the
children can relax or play games play
soccer whatever games outside just to
change their mind a little bit that we
didn't mention that but like normally
the durations of the workshops are
between 60 and 90 minutes don't take it
too long because if you don't keep it
interactive enough they might get bored
and if you have like 90 minutes have a
15 minute break so they can like switch
rooms get something to drink etc and
during the lunch that's a great moment
to like invites local partners where
they want to show like a quadcopter or
some drones and so on so have it fun
during the lunch breaks and show some
robots or get some toys or 3d printing
and things that you know it's make like
a maker fest type of environments where
he kids have fun but also the parents
for example with now we use the now
during the breaks to show all the
possibilities of the now so dancing
interacting with the children's being
smart enough so compacting Wikipedia
online to to read the content of a page
so the child can tell ok i want to get
information about san francisco and then
the robots crabby wikipedia and beat the
content of the page about san francisco
and they got and the children say are
wow what a smart robot no we just use
all the services online too and we show
them how it works basically so they
realize huh this is how it works now
they just use Facebook YouTube but they
don't understand what is happening
behind that and that's also one of the
things we want to teach them say you use
those services is fine but do understand
how it works behind what you give to
those those companies in order to get
that information and be able to use them
to your own benefit more than just
watching the videos so now that you gave
you a bit of a taste so how many people
are actually thinking of like starting a
local
chapter just wow great yeah so that
makes it worthwhile for us to you know
do this session so that's that's so just
for the recording now there are about 30
people in the room and I see pretty much
25 hands going up yes so let's see you
know how many chapters we ready see open
I would love we would love to help you
out I got starts yellow socks start
small take your time there is means we
are there again join us click on the
website Jonah's contact us if you have
additional questions if you want help if
you want help to promote what to
initiate the the chapter with you
locally will be we are there for that
okay you can even talk to the other
groups the Vox hockey teams you to see
their reactions you have Regina there is
the yeah yeah both ladies there are
doing an excellent job or so in Holland
in order to raise the awareness of the
box for kids and making events over
there so feel free to get experience
from our other groups if you want
initially your money so did you just
like take a couple of the work so just
work you don't have to worry about it I
Mustang temper no right this is just an
experiment to see how much interest you
can generate through the case right but
last year around March time frame or so
actually the year before that in
December my son said you know my dad I
want to do minecraft modding when that's
not how I started but it's like my jar
is broken okay what do you mean my jar
you mean the java jar is oh you know
java and you know jar so we got into
like little bit of fixing his job
because minecraft is in java so we okay
let's play with some minecraft modding
so we did some minecraft morning and
then right away you know as an
evangelist as an advocate is no one
let's share the stuff so we pulled his
minecraft buddies into my living room
and why his are all his friends we made
a full day work full day workshop only
on minecraft morning it's about for our
thing and i said nobody's you know you
just have to bring your laptop i'll
provide power cable i'll provide food
drink all of that this was the first
time we were doing it so a lot of people
showed up actually you know i mean a lot
of the friends friends showed up about
dozen of them but there was a lot of
support from parents my sister my wife
of course everybody around so i had
about eight people helping those 12 kids
be successful literally in my living
room who is all scattered you'll see
article in java magazine about that you
know how it was all done and that's
where we started the effort in us and
then Stefan and I were talking about it
I said no what there's no point running
effort by itself let's join a global
effort I've been going to dbox
conferences for many years so let's join
a global effort then right away the mind
click know what let's find out NPO that
will make it a formal entity which
anybody can use to raise funds because
then the Charter is clear is a
non-profit so you can't make money out
of it so make it an NPO file a 501 C 3
which allows you to raise funds and
things like that and then we slowly
started talking to the local people so
in talk to Kevin Nelson who is a local
job leader he was very interested in or
less form at devoxx for kids board so
now we have a board most of us are based
in the bay area then we reached out to
hacker dojo which is running in mountain
view they gave us a workspace so again
as Stefan was saying start really slow
no but eight kids 10 kids just get your
feet wet
feel for it what does it mean start with
one simple workshop you know whatever
you could enjoy the most maybe that's
maybe a logical choice and then slowly
start expanding it right yeah perfect
yeah yeah and we can since you are local
here I mean doesn't matter local but you
are in Atlanta we can get on a hang out
and maybe spend like half an hour an
hour while you were doing the workshop
to kind of share some tips as well
a view of you tried no the question is
how do you if you can explain how we
engage our own children on doing this
have you ever try to explain what you're
doing to your own children it's a tough
tough Porter then we assume you're
turning to your own children's sake I'm
working in the cloud say ma'am that is
the does it that has a problem is
telling me that he's working in the
cloud called the doctor away then you
start to explain then you try to find
information on the internet okay and
then we try to give them some my
daughter's actually she's one of my
daughters she's interested in robotics
and the she got so she attended some few
few events already and she liked nows
and she likes robotics in general so one
of the school work she has to do this
year is ok just present something to the
class the first thing she did you say
okay I'm gonna present history of
robotics history of robotics 13 years
old he's real robotics that's great you
know is I chasm of those kind of books
and those things then because she likes
it and then she she got involved just by
attending those getting a touch to the
technology something that they don't use
to touch they know laptops they know
Facebook you know YouTube my daughter's
my daughter's didn't know that they know
that they don't know that they can
program a robot fat no they know so
let's just bring them that technology to
them and show them they can do something
useful something interesting they can
build something with this they can
express their creativity with this you
see children during events that are
doing amazing things that's a good idea
it is this is even better so let's reuse
that information so unfortunately it's
not all success stories like so my son
that's why I started doing this he
wanted to say la I want to learn to
program and so I started this this
delphox for kids for him basically and
he's really not interested he's like
fine I've seen it I know what it is but
not it's not for me so his life so but
fine I mean at least he can make a more
intelligent choice but who knows but he
is addicted to minecraft so he is really
playing with it but he's not yet mulling
it but at least you know he touched it
and and that's that's fine so yeah
showing the post showing the
possibilities and not necessary in being
an IT person later on but at least being
when they will be confronted in the
day-to-day work life to something that
requires some I'd say having been in
touch with technology say I yes I've
been doing this in the past when I was
teenager and then okay I can do this
okay let's try to do it this way because
computers they will always be in touch
with technologies anyway because this
world is a world of technology and if
you don't understand the technology you
lose something that's what we try to
teach to a children's seeker to me
really I take an opportunity from real
life so like for example my son was
saying this silly google is slow okay
let's take a look at it what happened
here so Google is not responding so what
do you think is happening behind the
scene then we explain the DNS concept oh
but let's see was not happening oh maybe
the router is slow what is router so you
know the questions really start from
there and then we say ok let's pull the
plug out of the router see what happens
now you can't go out of the home so take
every opportunity I vergence every
opportunity that could be overwhelming
but take different opportunities where
you can create from their real-life
world so for example posting a status on
facebook it's not going through what's
happening oh let's take a look at
browser cache explain that concept so as
a parent I see our role as more like
planting seeds enabling them and at any
point of time I have never asked my son
that no you must do this no hey this is
minecraft modding you are coming to me
you are asking questions I'm going to
help you out that's it if you want to do
something else by all means go ahead do
it
I'll help you out in that as well
passion and fun to me is very very
important if they are enjoying it
they'll come back
ruin your world your son busy but my son
is 11 and he's been giving minecraft mod
in workshops for about a year now and he
enjoys it he's as all of our skates are
they're addicted to minecraft what they
need though there is sometimes they they
don't recognize that you know the other
guys I know this like so they should
know it as well so that's where you know
you as a parent needs to kind of co
present with them that slow down repeat
the step again can I set some more
context to the kids who are
understanding it over there because as a
presenter or no because they've been
doing it for too long they just move on
fast I'm working with another kid who's
going to be speaking at Silicon Valley
code camp in two weeks he has published
couple of iOS applications already again
a ninth-grade grid but i'm working with
him helping him structure the workshop
so it's a 75-minute workshop in that he
will actually talk about how to create
iOS application he says I'll spend like
first 30 minutes talking about the
history of iOS and what it takes as a no
no no no so you help them kind of
streamline their thoughts because they
have some really brilliant ideas so a
lot of education preparation coaching is
required there are speakers like Shah
dodge you know we've been speaking at
scala days for about three years now so
some are naturally gifted speakers some
you have to work with but one of our
goals definitely is to encourage a lot
of public speaking for kids you know
start slow don't give them a chance to
give a workshop for about ten kids 15
kids and it grows from there and we've
also done like last Saturday we have
this what was it again scratch with
emotion and so what we did is like okay
you make a project and then you're
allowed to come on stage and present it
and they love it really and then some
some love it some are like like shy
because it's pair programming the other
person's like this is not for me but
they're like other children they're like
really like natural and they show their
demo and they really like proud of what
they've done and they're all the big
screen and this is like this the small
first steps in presenting it's very
similar what we do in that box for
bigots we have like could we call it
quickest which is like a 15 minutes
slots where you can do it
presentation a lot of rock star speakers
today started 15 minutes where they got
a bit of confidence they got the first
limelight experience and it's a very
similar approach or pattern that you can
do with the children as well
figure out
so the question is who actually does the
registration is it the parents pushing
the children or is it really the
children asking the parents to go there
it is often the parents I mean they are
aware for the first time so what we've
seen is that a lot of we call it the
voxyn so the adults that do go to do
2day vox Dei a lot of them have teenage
children and so on so they are being
made aware of these initiatives and
softened East Fork folks who are pushing
their children to these events but you
see the enthusiasm I mean like these are
really not boring the workshops they're
really interesting workshop so we really
try to stimulate their interest by
showing some cool stuff which they
normally don't see at all so even if it
if it is the parents I mean we do see
the enthusiasm you know with the
children at these workshops me yeah you
start with eventually jerks children in
fat Jack's members children's and then
with for the first time and then the
world of moth at school I've done these
days I saw that with my own daughters
they started and then they're discussing
we thought what have you done this
weekend you have done these DS DS we are
playing robots and all this and all the
boys where can I join you can you let me
know when is the next session 6 etc so
the world of moss at school and then
it's grow up by family members etc
etcetera it's a pyramidal expansion that
says very embroid up and the Nu
registration goes quite quickly you
don't you have to hurry up for to
register those event because we all try
to but there are limited number of seats
are very places to the register is a
rush like 200 200 children event in
Amsterdam a few weeks ago means it's all
dot in what in a in a week sorry
Virginia free yeah but see you have to
register in order to even with the free
events to to reserve your seats and on
and for their locations last questions
do you
yeah we do so the question is do you
have some documentation to talk about
the initiative to local school parents
or groups yes we do some necessary on
the online on the website but just
contact us and we will provide you a
link to the load for example a
PowerPoint presentation you can use to
explain the concept to see videos or so
that our inside the department
presentation and to to let the parents
be aware of this this how easy to do and
how is wonderful to see the amines stars
in the eyes of the children's so one of
the things I would like to say here is
non depending upon your geography will
be happy to jump on a google hangout as
well so like if he instead of you doing
the presentation like you could do the
presentation we could be in a hangout
with the parents or the school
authorities for answering QA that how
does this work what does this mean what
is the involvement and what is the
computer requirement and things like
that you have been doing that several
times already from Europe to to have a
hangout with team in Mexico in order to
explain the box for kids was late for me
or not remember it was late or early but
it was our start have to wake up earlier
but still or Latos a late but it was
done and yeah easy easiest things okay
it's a wrap up thank you everybody for
attending these sessions hope you learn
a lot of things if you don't hesitate to
contact us back twitter's or email us
everything is on the website feel free
to use the goal is to share all the
materials and to make and to which as
much as children as possible so it's
time to do something for the next
generation thank you for your attention
thank you
