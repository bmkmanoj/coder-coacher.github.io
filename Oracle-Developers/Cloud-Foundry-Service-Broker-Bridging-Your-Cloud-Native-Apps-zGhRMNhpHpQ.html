I'm one of the product management within
our Oracle cloud platform looking at our
application development services and
I'll be talking today about cloud
foundry service broker how it helps
bridge cloud native applications built
on cloud foundry with their backing
services to grow the ecosystem to give
developers the choices of a lot of
back-end services that they can use with
their cloud native apps so talk about
that I'll talk about the general
concepts of service broker and cloud
foundry as well as some very specific
things Oracle has done to bring our
Clicquot system to cloud foundry
developers through this service broker
so let's get started
I'll give you a quick overview of the
cloud foundry system so that people know
what what we are talking about and we
will see the rest how the ecosystem
grows through self-service broken the
rest part in the service so what we
notice is that and you probably have
noticed similar patterns is is that in
2017 this year a lot of different models
of application development containers
are growing people are building a lot of
container native development essentially
that means you know running darker on
kubernetes directly creating your docker
images and and managing them through
some pipeline and then running them on a
true da Christ environment a little bit
more infrastructure centric but that's a
pattern over the years over the last
decade or so we have seen a lot of
enterprise Java pattern development and
in cloud foundry and some of these other
competitors falls into what we call the
cloud natives space which is a little
bit higher level than container of
native and so underneath they use
containers they use
and orchestration and scheduling models
but they are not exposed to the user to
the user it's really an application
centric pass platform you take a nap you
push your app you give a little bit
characteristics about your app in your
descriptor and that's about it the rest
of the setup and configuration and and
and cluster management and security all
of that is taken care of the cloud
native platform there are a lot of those
platforms I'll talk about that in a
minute but they support many different
languages they are polyglot in nature so
that you can deploy develop applications
across the board and that's what we will
focus today the idea here of this
platform is just push your core and the
platform does the rest underneath it
uses the concepts of container native or
the components of container native
platform but that's not exposed to the
to the user therefore it is less
burdensome from administrative point of
view we will talk about that and we also
see a lot of a visual development model
but that's not the focus of this
conversation let's get to the cloud
native has where cloud foundry fits and
then talk about service broker that that
expand is the ecosystem of this cloud
native platform so how many platforms
are there actually there are a lot more
than this this slide suggests but I just
pick the big most common most most
well-known names cloud foundry obviously
that's what we are talking about the
cloud Google cloud platform again this
one has if you remember a service called
Google App Engine that's essentially a
cloud native pass you push your code and
it does the rest OpenShift from Red Hat
as a similar model Oroku is the one who
actually started this essentially this
model a long time back and as a very
successful service Salesforce as as a
quiet hero COO and that provides you
this exact same mechanism push your code
and you know who does the rest Oracle
also has a platform very much similar to
that it's not the focus of this
conversation but
is app container platform within the
Oracle Paz ecosystem so these are the
big ones and there are few others but
this gives you an idea of how vast and
how big the cloud cloud native platforms
are and there are millions of
applications and thousands of customers
and users using these platforms today to
build a child very quick applications
and and in various different languages
this is essentially a bird's-eye view of
what Cloud Foundry is this middle box is
essentially the platform it provides all
these capabilities within the platform
around routing and container
management's all hidden from from the
user the user just has to build your
application in one of the languages it
also supports to bring your own build
back so essentially you can bring your
own language so to speak if you don't
find anything appropriate out of the box
these languages are directly supported
and the only thing that the developer
has to do is essentially push the code
CF push and it the platform does the
rest sets up the container environment
sets of routing sets up all the
configuration and dependencies and
underneath to the administrator it
provides capabilities like zero downtime
failure and recovery
easy scalability security and patching
all of those is just just roided out of
the box so becomes very easy to write
applications but one of the most
important thing and that is the
conversation of this session is how do
you expand the capability of this
platform to talk to other services the
services that cannot run on this
platform and then third 400 provides a
concept of bite you know applications
can bind to these applique back in
application services they could be data
store services or like a database or
object storage or documents they could
be some specialized
vertical SAS solution etc look at many
things that can run outside of these
applications that you want to or the
developer wants to use and how do you
use that well you use it why a concept
of buying and that's where the service
broker comes that allows these services
to be brought into the Cloud Foundry
environment so that developers can then
bind to it and use it that's what we'll
talk about in the next few slides so why
why is this needed well the fact is that
the cloud native platforms not
necessarily can and want to run all
sorts of workloads right you may not
want to run specialized workloads if
you're running special analytics that
can run on a very special hardware well
that's not where your Cloud Foundry
environment will be running so it has to
be treated as an external service if
your cloud native platform is designed
for 12 factor typically these
applications one of the factors about 12
factor is that they are ephemeral style
applications there is no storage in this
platform for workloads like database to
run so they have to run outside as an
external service and if they are running
outside then the application that are
running in Cloud Foundry need to consume
it need to connect to it need to use
these back-end services right the
database object etc only then you can
write a comprehensive set of solution on
this in this environment what to do that
you need the catalog of service or an
easy way for a developer to find out
what services are available an easy way
for an administrator say well let me
register a catalog so that my developers
can search them and use them and then
minister developer can find one they can
very easily bind an application to one
of the services within the catalog and
that essentially improves the velocity
of the developer allows fast market
allows you know developers to use all
sorts of capabilities that are outside
of the platform to build rich
environments that's essentially the need
in the reason why cloud foundry
has extended its model to allow external
services external catalogs to be brought
in in this in this model of my
marketplace so it has a marketplace it's
a catalogue of services these services
all provide their own deployment models
they can easily be integrated or bound
to an application running in Cloud
Foundry by a simple mind command and the
weight all this magic happens everything
comes together is through this concept
of service broker so if you are a
catalog service provider a back-end
service provider you have to implement a
set of
api's called service broker API and make
them available and then the Cloud
Foundry administrator can go in and
register a broker your broker into the
Cloud Foundry environment which is what
I'll show you in this session and once
it's register your developers can
automatically look up the marketplace
and start creating this service and
start binding them etc so all the magic
of Cloud Foundry being able to look up
or bring the marketplace into the
environment is why this service broker
concept and this is at a high level in
how it looks like Cloud Foundry has two
extensions one is for what I was just
talking about the service broker API
that you see on the right side the red
box which is there to enable these
external services a catalog of services
from any number of providers to be
brought in or made available to the
developers on Cloud Foundry so there is
a rich ecosystem for development the
second is of course the Cloud Foundry
environment needs to run on some
infrastructure so the box at the bottom
though the horizontal box which says
cloud orchestration is the other
extension piece Cloud Foundry has to
allow it or Cloud Foundry to be deployed
on different different infrastructures
whether it's OpenStack whether it's
Google Amazon Microsoft as you're
obviously Oracle also is has one
implementation it's a
a CPI a set of API easier to implement
to bridge the canonical model of cloud
form trees infrastructure needs or ask
into the actual api's of the backend
platform or the infrastructure platform
and once you build that and it's there
the the entire Cloud Foundry ecosystem
can be deployed on that particular
infrastructure and then through the
service broker you can talk to the rest
of the service outside in the
marketplace so we'll concentrate on the
service broker for the rest of this
conversation so what is service broker I
have talked already a bit about it but
just to set the foundation right or
context right for the rest of the
session
it enables integration of services
external services or back-end services
however you call it bringing them into
the Cloud Foundry ecosystem what does
that allow you to do well it allows you
to do one do a catalog management
essentially look these up as a
marketplace and as through those api's
you can start provisioning these
services back-end services deep
provisioning them or create or delete
them and once they are there you can
also bind to them from an application so
that now application can actually use
that service connect to it unbind when
it's not needed and finally update those
services now service broker is not just
available for Cloud Foundry it's become
an open source or a separate project
called open service broker API and the
the the key reason for that is the the
model of extending of the ecosystem of
the marketplace applies to other
platforms so forth like kubernetes or
cloud native foundation CN CF if you're
building on a container of native
environment the same concept applies
application build there may need
external services and the best way to
extend them is to use this well-known
model of service broker so service
broker not only just works for Cloud
Foundry now it it also works for
ladies because you can use that within
that container native environment to
talk to back-end services will focus on
Cloud Foundry for the rest here is a
little bit more detail about what broker
does specifically those broker api's so
on the left side the blue side is Cloud
Foundry this is where the AR apps are
running and they need to talk to an
external service on the left side the
yellow side is this the backend service
remember the backend service is running
outside of cloud forming not inside but
the application that is running inside
Cloud Foundry wants to bind to it use it
right but how does that work that that
works so first step the service provider
has to implement the service broker API
there are essentially five api's that
they have to implement a catalog api
that essentially is a browser listing
api a create or a provision api a delete
or addi provision api a bind api so that
is where application says i'm going to
bind to service x y&amp;amp;z because i want to
use it and unbind is the reverse of mind
these are essentially the five api is to
implement once they are implemented now
that api endpoint or or if you have a
broker adapter or offline remote
downloadable piece of software that you
can register with the Cloud Foundry so
you got your Cloud Foundry administrator
would then simply register this service
broker endpoint and once it's registered
Cloud Foundry now can call these api's
at the appropriate time for it to bring
the service in the marketplace and make
it available to the developer so first
it will call the catalog to understand
all the services that are offered by
this broker it could be one or more and
all the deployment plans etc so you can
pull that information and then once the
user calls a CF API to create it will
call the provision API on the broker it
calls if the app calls bind then
called the mind api on the broker so
that's what we'll do is start phone
reacts as the middleman here and and
calls the api's on the broker at the
appropriate time so that it makes that
service and a catalog of service
available to the developers of the Cloud
Foundry well there are as I said there
are a lot of cloud providers that
support or have implemented the CPI so
you can run Cloud Foundry on it and the
virtue of that they have built the
service broker so here is an example
Google Amazon and Microsoft all have
built a service broker for here on a set
of services so if you're running an
application in cloud foundry and you
want to use Google Cloud Storage well
there is a broker for it there's a
broker for Google bigquery so here's an
example of our applications running in
cloud form they can expand can use these
external services to build richer
applications and therefore there is a
rich ecosystem or rich marketplace
within California for developers to use
and their lot many I just gave you a
small example here of the top three one
but pretty much everybody if you go to
Cloud Foundry not org and it's
marketplace on that you will see a ton
of third-party providers that have
service brokers there and provide
services ok
so let's quickly see how this works
right so in this demonstration I'm going
to show you how a local install of cloud
foundry I have one with Bosh to light
running on the laptop creating sorry
first registering the my sequel service
broker from pivotal then creating it and
then binding an application binding to
that and then running that application
we'll see that in the next five minutes
how this whole comes together but in
this one we are using the my sequel
service provider from Cloud Foundry or
pivotal Cloud Foundry they have a
service broker will register that and
then we'll use that to bind to an
application ok so here it is here it
goes so the everything is done by a CLI
essentially here is a
of all the processes that are running on
the borscht of the local environment to
make cloud foundry work first we will
register the API to the CLI so CF API
and we'll give you the API so
essentially the CF CLI now can talk to
the to the Bosch environment that I have
local where the Cloud Foundry is running
so when I put on CF CLI basically that
triggers a call into the CF environment
once the API is registered we would log
in CF login to connect to that
environment give the username and
password and also the org which are we
are so they have concepts of ARP so
there is OPC org so we are now logged in
we are connected to the CF environment
and this CF environment look is running
locally if I look at the marketplace CF
marketplace there is nothing there why
because there is no service broker
registered now we are going to register
a service broker and this service broker
is little weird how it is but there are
many ways to do it this is one way to do
a my sequel service broker registration
just because it's also running on a V
box local environment it's not running
anywhere remote so - DCF my sequel run
errands and essentially now it's
deploying the CF actually is deploying
the CF environment right now so now I
have a CF environment running my sequel
locally along with the actual Cloud
Foundry controller all running on this
environment if I look at marketplace you
saw the my sequel service there
registered but if you look at services
there are non zero services so let's
create one so I'm creating a my sequel
service because you have to create that
first the service needs to be running so
that you can buy into it right so create
my sequel P my sequel is the type the
service name or 20mb is the plan of the
service and CF my sequel one is the name
of the instance that I am creating okay
created let's go and look at services
again we should see our service that we
just created it's running 20 mb plan
creation successful but it does not have
any bound applications
and also if you this creates the service
let's go next to the app apps there are
no apps running in this environment in
the cloud foundry environment so let's
push an app Java app I am in the
directory and it is the CF - Java app it
takes about two minutes and at this
point the application is running let's
clear up and see CF apps at this point
you will see the application running it
started but remember the apps not bound
to the my sequel is just running and if
I were to go to the UI of the app it
says there is an error it can't find the
back-end service and therefore none of
these operations will work so the next
step is to bind this application Java
app to the sequel and if I do any enemy
you will not see any bind information
here you know the app doesn't know about
the my sequel service a couple of things
I have to do about security just make
the two VMs talk to each other so I have
to build this network around it so and
bind it typically this is done once by
the administrator don't have to do it
ever again but you still have to do that
now once this is done the two
environments can talk to each other you
know there is connectivity between the
two Ã§f bind this is a simple bind
command remember one of the API is the
bind api is this is what gets caught
this calls that bind ap on the broker
and will bind Java app to my sequel 1 CF
my sequel 1 well once you bind it you
have to restage or restart your
application to be effective let's see
the env again remember there was nothing
about my sequel in this but now there
should be if I go up you will see that
my sequel endpoint is now available to
this Java app we deployed and it's
endpoint username password everything is
there so the app can start using it so
let's restage bounce the application so
the Java environment app now knows these
new coordinates of the back-end service
it got and can start using it a minute
or so the app gets deployed it's all
running
let's go to the browser and at this
point if I hit the browser the error is
gone it's now using the back end my
sequel service and I can start inserting
records add a record I can add one more
I guess we can do that Jane
add we can we can even update make sure
it works
or delete let's do an update one record
one John becomes James and we'll add a
comment just just in case just to make
sure it all works okay so this this is
essentially now shows how we use the
service broker to bind a java
application that's running in Cloud
Foundry to a my sequel service running
outside of Cloud Foundry why this whole
service broker API model right we
registered the broker to Cloud Foundry
once it was registered we created a
service through Cloud Foundry and then
we had the app mind to it restage the
app or restarted the app and now app has
all the coordinates of the back-end
service and can start using it and Cloud
Foundry does all the magic work behind
to make that service available to the
developer so this is let's that talks
about the entire my sequel environment
and how Cloud Foundry is using that now
the rest few minutes I'll talk about how
Oracle has expanded that ecosystem added
brought in Oracle cloud services to
Cloud Foundry through the exact same
model of service broker why because you
know we see a lot of customers lot of
user asking hey can we use Oracle
database or Oracle back-end services
storage etc with Cloud Foundry
applications and if you can use my
sequel from pivotal you can use database
from Oracle or my sequel from Oracle or
any other no sequel from Oracle or any
other services Oracle has to provide
right you should be
able to use that so the exact same
concept of service broker we have
implemented to bring that ecosystem
within the Cloud Foundry Oracle platform
is rich there's lots and lots of
services and the idea is to bring all of
those backing services on to the cloud
native platform there across DevOps
cloud native and container native
development api's enterprise development
database all of those areas and I don't
want to go through all of them but
here's a huge set of services that we
would that could be brought into this
ecosystem for developers to build
applications rich applications using all
these capabilities from back-end
services so while bringing a lot of
demand we see a lot of customer asking
we have 50 plus services that can enrich
the ecosystem of the cloud for the Cloud
Foundry developer right simplify the
integration with Oracle workloads and
make it flexibly run on-premise
everywhere so remember Oracle has done
both piece of extensions one is service
broker to bring Oracle cloud services to
cloud foundry in which the ecosystem and
second make Cloud Foundry run on Oracle
infrastructure so we have implemented
our the CPI that I was talking the
horizontal red line so that just like
you can deploy Cloud Foundry on Amazon
or VMware or OpenStack or or Google you
can also deploy cloud foundry or pivotal
Cloud Foundry both on Oracle
infrastructure there is a CPI for that
so now you can have an entire ecosystem
running on Oracle cloud if you wanted
okay how does this work very simple
logic just like before you know on the
on the left side is cloud form running
anywhere could be running on premised on
VMware or on OpenStack or on bare metal
and your apps are running there in that
environment now you want to extend and
talk to Exadata or Oracle database or
Oracle no sequel or Oracle my sequel
even Java or WebLogic environment etc
running a inner Oracle cloud whether the
Oracle cloud is in the public cloud or
as on
mice in our Oracle cloud machine doesn't
matter you would want to use that bye to
that environment or those services and
use it so that's essentially what this
integration brings and uses the same
service broker concept that that Cloud
Foundry has because we've built a
service broker for our services it's an
endpoint that you registered with Cloud
Foundry it enables a single endpoint
enables a ton of services so you don't
have to go and register for each service
separately you will see that in the demo
and it brings in both pass and is
services it can run on premise on the
cloud or in a hybrid environment and we
have made it available for both the
services running on a public cloud and
you some of you might know and/or might
not
Oracle have brings all the cloud
services on-premise on what we call
cloud machine part of our program called
cloud customer where all our cloud
services can be run on premise as a
service exactly the same service so both
of them can have broker api's
implemented so no matter where you run
you can enhance the ecosystem of Cloud
Foundry let's do a quick demonstration
of that exactly the same demo only thing
I am going to replace now is pivotal my
sequel with Oracle database cloud
service right nothing else the job I
have now talking to the Oracle database
rather than my sequel ok CF marketplace
we only had one service register
remember now I'm going to register the
Oracle broker now the only thing is this
broker brings in lot more services than
Oracle database just single broker and
you will see that because you don't need
to install multiple brokers to bring
Oracle cloud services within the Cloud
Foundry ecosystem so give a name then
user name and password and the URL where
that broker API is running slightly
different model this is called a remote
broker rather than something
that you deploy locally but this is the
rest endpoint that implements those five
AP ice and it's scoped for space spaces
or or if I now do CF service broker I
have to the pivotal my sequel one and
the Oracle broker right so the two
brokers if I look at marketplace I have
a lot more services my sequel and a
bunch of other services that came along
database Big Data data hub Java by
sequel Oracle's my sequel this is
different than we were told by sequel
caching etc all these services are now
available as extend ecosystem services
so now we are ready to create you know
just like we created pivotal my C sequel
service will create a database service
give it a name a plan which is an early
plan diva's is the type r li is the plan
f DB one is the name of the service and
then our database needs a bunch of
parameters and you can provide that
using a JSON so I just want to point to
a JSON that has instance information
additional and the service is created if
you do see CF services there is the my
sequel one and then there is a new one
that we just created AB db1 no
application bound to the FD be one while
the my sequel one the Java app is bound
right so let if I were to go to the
database cloud service UI or this app
essentially is talking to database cloud
so you see an arrow why because we
didn't bind any right we have to bind
the Java app to this application
database Oracle database otherwise it
doesn't know how to reach so same exact
command CF bind service Java app app DB
one it will bring the coordinates of the
app DB one and make them available as
environment variables to this Cloud
Foundry application you do CF restage to
restart the application in now that
application has selects two CF restart
restage
and Java app and that essentially
bounces the application and now the
application has the coordinates of the
database service the Oracle database
service which we just created
okay CFE and me just to make sure it is
there it render and here are the
coordinates of the database service
where they are what kind again it
supports all kinds rack non rack all of
those kind of support our databases are
supported in this model let's hit the
browser refresh the error should go away
because now the application can actually
buy into the back in Oracle database so
let's just create a record and and maybe
even update one so we pretty sure that
this works 101
James Smith and updated comment maybe
update and it's updated right so this
this shows it works well we'll try to
like to okay so this we just did the
exact same thing twice just to make sure
you understand the concept one was with
my sequel a completely different service
provider from pivotal within the same
environment we register another service
broker from a completely different
provider core Oracle and we brought in
completely different set of services now
the same app running on cloud from these
can use both of these services from two
completely different providers and all
of this magic works because of the
service broker model service broker API
is that providers implement and Cloud
Foundry administer register them and
thus expand marketplace okay with that
I'm going to close out with what's
possible in terms of how these
combinations will work as you can see
everything in or compromise which is the
left side for that to work with Oracle
you would bring in cloud machine to run
Oracle database or past services
on-premise and you can have your Cloud
Foundry on-premise either on OpenStack
VMware and will work everything can be
on the cloud whether on one cloud or
multi cloud doesn't matter
Cloud Foundry in itself can run on
Oracle cloud because we have the CPI
available now and you can talk to Oracle
services in public cloud or you can have
Cloud Foundry running on other clouds
talking to you know services on Oracle
cloud again you have to be careful about
network etc to make sure you bind to
services that are that I'm not chatty or
has the right amount of network latency
between these clouds expanding on that
on premised on returning on OpenStack or
VMware talking to the service broker
running on cloud machine whether it's
Excel data standard database my sequel
no sequel or any other path service this
is what we call clouded customer the in
the entire cloud ecosystem is at the
customer that's why it's clouded
customer and in all services are
available to the Cloud Foundry in this
case Cloud Foundry is running anywhere
it can run anywhere in the on-premise
environment everything in the cloud
cloud foundry
on our cloud with the CPI we have and
talking to all the cloud services that
are available in the public cloud or a
public cloud or combination you know
thoughtfully running anywhere talking to
services on our cloud with that I'll
close out that completes the
conversation about what service broker
is how it expands the ecosystem of Cloud
Foundry makes it much more richer for
applications to be developers to build
applications on Cloud Foundry and how
everybody is adding to that marketplace
many many providers are providing
service brokers in Oracle has one too to
bring Oracle services or to the same
marketplace thank you very much and I
