have kwaku here we're both from
freescale so what I'm going to try and
do over the next 45 minutes is really
talk to you about what we see the
opportunity in the embedded space so
I'll talk about obviously we're a
hardware company but as all
semiconductor companies are evolving
into system companies as we all are
nobody can be a chip company anymore I
just want to talk through how we view
them up how we view the world why we're
partnering with Java some case studies
of companies that have used both
freescale technology and Java to go to
market and I'm assuming you know this
really is aimed at the Java developer
it's kind of saying there's a great
opportunity out there you know the
desktop as we know in x86 is a great
market but let's start looking at the
embedded market because we believe
there's a lot of opportunity out there
so I'll give you a one slide overview of
freescale because I'm assuming not all
of you are intimately know intimately
know about freescale we'll talk about
what is the embedded market the
opportunity some of the trends maybe if
you're not too familiar with the
embedded world what's going on it's
changing very rapidly and then some
examples of how we've worked with Java
in the embedded market both end products
and also reference designs now we're a
small group so you know please chime in
and ask questions as we go along it's as
we all represent always said it's more
fun if you know if I'm standing here for
45 minutes with no feedback that's great
but if it's even better if you can let
me know what you think as we go along in
the presentation so freescale it's
actually been around for a long time you
might have known it more as as part of
Motorola until 2006 it was Motorola
semiconductor they never spun off so
deep long history of embedded processing
a lot of customers as you can see the
revenue is there basically we're an
embedded company all the way from
microcontrollers extremely low-power
migrating to arm from the a used
utilizing our my p from the m0 plus all
the way up to the cortex a9 a
15s and future arm cause we also have
analog in terms of power management and
other analog features we have a census
portfolio radio frequency but also as
all as all semiconductor companies are
now we have a large software group we
deliver a Linux PSP and Android bsp for
our I dynamics Ranger application
processors and then obviously we have to
do a lot of work with partners because
we need to deliver reference designs and
solutions to the market not just sell
chips anymore we're very well known in
the automark automotive market we're
number one to two cell MC use into the
automotive space networking number one
have been for a long time we also play
in the industrial and the consumer space
as you can see if you look at the tablet
and ereader market we're number one or
two depending on how you want to cut
that market not so much in the high-end
competing with Qualcomm and NVIDIA but
if you look at where the tablet market
is going both in China and also we're
now seeing a lot of companies taking
that tablet form factor and applying it
for vertical solutions in industrial and
medical spaces we're actually seeing a
lot of traction for in the tablet market
both based on our processor and based on
potentially for opportunities with Java
with SE 7 and Java effects that we have
ported and have partners that have
ported to the tablet form factor so
that's a brief overview of freescale so
what are we here to talk about well you
know the there's lots of terms that have
been thrown around that I'm sure you're
familiar with the Internet of Things the
connected world the internet of
everything well basically you know this
is what it's all based upon the fact
that in 2008 we crossed that threshold
of there being more connected devices
than people and then last year really
you know all the analysts started really
talking about where we were heading in
this wonderful connected world now
obviously this has been driven by
smartphones and more recently tablets
but a lot of analysts started saying
well you know we're going to really
exponentially grow the connected
ice is all the way up to 50 billion by
2020 depending on the analyst company
you're talking to it very slightly so
how we going to go from where we are
today which is assuming maybe 10 million
devices to 50 billion devices what's
going to kick bat in is it going to be
smart phones and tablets well no they
will lead the charge in terms of devices
but we're going to see a great
preparation of different markets and if
you look at what's driving this
wonderful Internet of Things well yes
mobile phones and traditional consumer
electronics will continue to grow
extremely fast in a compounded annual
growth rate through the next five to ten
years but really it's all these other
markets from home energy management the
wearables obviously is beginning to get
a lot of hype with smartwatches but also
health and fitness devices are really
already selling in large quantities the
fitness bands accessories which is
basically these devices which are saying
you know I've got a quad core in my
pocket why do I need to develop these
complex devices why don't I utilize that
quad core in my smartphone develop very
simple device is based on
microcontrollers and sensors and I can
utilize collect data on the body send it
to my smartphone that can analyze and
analyze that data either locally or in
the cloud and I can come up with some
very complex devices that bring a lot of
analytics and data to people with a
device this is based on a bomb cost of
ten dollars or less so we're seeing a
big explosion of in this market
appliances within the home refrigerators
toasters microwaves which have always
been the siloed embedded devices running
on our microcontrollers or our
competitors microcontrollers there now
adding a simple wireless protocol be at
sig be z-wave Wi-Fi Bluetooth Bluetooth
low-energy and they're now becoming
connected and they're connecting into
this ecosystem that is still evolving
so this is where the big opportunity is
let me give you an example also
entertainment so as we said freescale is
played in the auto space for a long time
you know if you look up the car you know
the auto into the infotainment system in
your car so let's take my car I own an
aldi 2006 I live in Austin Texas so it's
purchased in that market in 2006 I have
a very simple display in my car but it
tells me when I'm playing the radio what
channel and what song is playing I think
there's a real-time operating system in
there if it is it's a very simplistic it
might even it might be native code i'm
not sure but really it doesn't do much
it's a very simple siloed device it's
running on an MCU which is probably i
don't know what's in there you know but
it's it's probably it's very single core
it's not multi-core there's no
connectivity because our d didn't
actually add bluetooth until 2007 in the
US so I have nothing in my car in terms
of connectivity the user interface is as
I say I cannot interact with it in any
way it displays information to me it
doesn't allow me to interact in any way
and there aren't really any standards
for them to adhere to so it's all
proprietary that was you know also
infotainment a few years ago look at
where we've migrated to so now the title
of this presentation was embedded too
smart so this is what freescale is
viewing as embedded too smart because
this is what our customers are already
doing so if you now by if you now look
at Audi or if you go to buy any car not
just high end but even low in they have
a nice large display most of them are
based on multi-core I can tell you that
a lot of them are using the item X 6
series which is based on ARM Cortex a9
we have a dual core and a quad core a
lot of them are based on that so we've
gone from a very sick proprietary to a
standard multi-core product it's running
a lot of these now are running either
Linux or Andrew
week they could potentially run Java why
do they have to do that well for a start
you've got Bluetooth in your car a lot
of them have Wi-Fi and 4G is coming so
you now need an operating system or a
software platform that can deal with
these many different multifaceted
devices which are inputs which are
happening within it you can't ask an
artist or native code to really handle
that the user interface not only has it
gone from being machine orientated to
user orientated we now know that user
interface has to look like your tablet
or your smartphone that's what the
customers are asking for and that's what
the supply chain is having to develop
and it's all about standards because you
now have some connectivity in there that
standards have to evolve too so we as a
hardware manufacturer to the traditional
embedded market I've already seen seen
this change happened very rapidly what
does it mean from an embedded hardware
supplier well this is what we tell our
customers and what this is what is being
predicted within the embedded market
within two years time eighty percent of
the revenue will go to devices which are
smart ie connected so this traditional
view of the embedded world being simple
silo devices which run on a simple
microprocessor collect data may be from
a few sensors do a motor control that
will continue to exist but that is not
where the revenue will be the revenue
will be as companies want to migrate to
smart devices that can achieve a lot
more and a lot more attractive to their
end customers so this is happening
extremely quickly as they migrate from
embedded too smart something they have
to ask themself a question which they've
never asked before which is basically
okay now I've added connectivity what am
I going to connect to how am I going to
connect to it do I want data to simply
run from my device to the hub device or
do i want that hub device to communicate
back to my device if it's bi-directional
what software or what protocol am I
going to use to communicate
and if I'm communicating with the hub
device or even back to a cloud what
a-what ecosystem and I part of that is
the question that the traditional
embedded consume customer is now dealing
with and what we're saying is initially
they limit their choices to Linux
because they've traditionally been using
Linux native code or Android it's
amazing how many customers of ours when
they go from being an embedded
traditional customer too smart they
assume they have to use Android simply
because of the brand name or somebody in
the IT department says well let's use
Android because I think we can use it
for this device really you know if
you're familiar with Android you'll know
there's a lot of challenges in using
Android for a fixed functional device
more you're stripping out the api's and
the functionality than adding in so
really we're dealing with customers that
traditionally have not had to deal with
these questions and that's why we
believe Java and the reason freescale
has formed a partnership with Oracle and
jerrys we believe Java being the
software platform the scalar scalable
that's modular that can be upgraded
remotely is as well suited as any other
other software platforms that are out
there and that's why we're here to tell
talk to the Java developers to say
there's a big opportunity out there and
you need to be aware of it and we're
trying to work with Java to make most of
that opportunity but before we dive into
some case studies I just want to talk a
little bit about the trends that we're
seeing so what is happening in this
embedded wall I said that it's it's
changing rapidly you know a lot of
people think of the embedded world has
been a market that's defined by
development time in terms of years and
product life cycles in terms of 15 years
because a lot of traditional devices
that have been using embedded technology
they don't change much and they have
very long life cycles washing machines
motor control devices these are things
that run for a long time need a lot of
reliability and don't change much well
that's not true anymore
what we've seen let's take some extreme
examples and you're probably wondering
why is he put up a slide talking about
the kindle ipad and connect they're all
consumer devices this really has nothing
to do with the embedded world well i'd
like to disagree with you when the
kindle launched it was the fastest
selling device in in the in history
three million in 18 months in 2007 i
believe if i remember rightly that at
the time was believed to be the fastest
selling device the ipad came along in
2010 15 million in nine months and then
could the connect in 2011 eight million
in two months was thought of as the
fastest selling device in the market now
the new iphone that just launched i
think that might have her beaten that
but the whole idea is this idea products
traditionally went through that product
life cycle of you they came into the
market based sold slowly and they've
gained momentum and then they tailed off
what we're seeing now in the consumer
world is that's not true anymore if you
get the right product to the market at
the right time you're going to see out
sell millions of devices within months
you know we work with some people that
are in this supply chain of of the
iphone powered cases and they say that
eighty percent of their business is done
in the first month after the iphone is
launched because that's when everybody
buys the new product they buy the
accessories they got one month window if
they miss that window eighty percent of
their sales are lost so the embedded
world why am i showing you this because
the embedded world is following that
trend everything has now been impacted
by these devices and how quickly they
sell this idea that the embedded world
is slow devices but you can have two
years to develop you have plenty of time
to line up your hardware your software
get everything right because they're
going to sell for 15 years it's not true
anymore the embedded world is moving
just as fast as what we're seeing in
these high-end consumer devices so what
we do at freescale and you know a lot of
our competitors obviously are doing the
same thing as we're reacting to this and
we're saying time
market is critical so we're giving tools
both hardware and software to help you
get up and running as quickly as
possible so we have reference designs so
at the high end for our quad core
application processor which is based on
the cortex a9 we have the Sabre platform
which comes with the display obviously
it's aboard a complete board we put it
in the tablet form factor we have a
linux and android BSP which is ready to
go the BSP meets the the CDD
requirements and the other if you want
to go for Google certification where it
meets all of that so we're trying to
shorten the cycle to get to market if
you go to our MC use with the kinetics
we have the tower system which is a
modular kit which allows you to mix and
match both MC us and our communication
devices bit zigbee or sub gig and so you
buy the board once as we come out with
new products you simply by one module
and slot that into the board and then at
the very low end we had our freedom
development kit which is based on the
very low end process of the klo too
which is really aimed at this market of
extremely low power simple devices this
sells for 13 euros or ten dollars so
it's a it's our equivalent of the
Raspberry Pi but unlike the Raspberry Pi
it's actually based on components that
you can buy in the real world so really
what we've done is we've listened to the
market we've seen this trend coming
that's impacting these our customers
that have been customers for years that
are traditionally have moved slower and
we're seeing this time to market is just
as critical in the embedded space and
we're trying to give you the tools to
get allow you to get to market as quick
as possible the other trend we're seeing
is you know is is a term that's been
around for a few years now called the
consumerization of IT so what what does
that really mean well let me give you an
example that you know tablets which you
know we're in the tablet space a lot of
our competitors are really the way
people use tablets is evolving and
changing so what this chart is showing
is that sixty percent of tablets will
have dual usage by 2015 so just like our
smartphones or our PC our notebooks they
might be a corporate asset but we use
them for our personal usage a lot of the
time what we're finding is or what this
is based on I be a ABI research the same
thing is happening with tablets people
are now saying you know I have my iPad I
have my android tablet I want to be able
to use it to get my corporate email and
access the culprit the corporate assets
just as I can on my smartphone and so IT
departments are having to take these
consumer devices and apply them to the
enterprise world and and this is really
the trend we're seeing that devices
cannot be siloed into being consumer
devices or enterprise devices and this
is impact in the embedded world because
what we're seeing is you now have to
come up with devices which are going to
have different usage models and evolve
over time so what we did is we looked at
our our product our reference design and
we said well look you know we have our
Linux and we have our Android BSP but
what about a company that is faced by
this challenge you know that's called
the BYOD bring your own device
phenomenon which is happening so what we
did is we look to our partners so we
looked at green hills software that have
a hypervisor we integrated that onto our
Savior platform onto our ideal MX we
then worked with one of our OD ends and
the Java team support java SE and java
FX onto a tablet so this tablet can then
can run two operating systems
independently so it can handle it can
have an Android operating system that
will be updated by your your telecommute
your your provider be it sprint AT&amp;amp;T
here in the US and then it can run Java
in a lockdown secure mode in the
enterprise environment where they can
control what apps you download you can
control what applications you can access
so we've already provided the ability to
have
java running on a tablet in the secure
mode but also Android or another OS
running for in a consumer device mode so
really answering that trend we're seeing
of device is not being siloed into one
area so time to market jeweled devices
with with many different usage models
are some of the examples of Hatcher yes
yet so often the conversation goes is
you know in fact I had two calls last
week with customers that want to use
tablet a tablet-like device for a
vertical solution one was in health care
and one was in the education they wanted
they start off by talking about the
hardware features they want which are
all very standard dual core we want this
much flash and so on and then they'd
start talking about the software and
they off as i said the conversation
often starts is they start talking about
android they say well we want android
and we want it to be able to do this
this and this and it has to be jelly
bean it has to be four point three nine
Yin like well why does it have to be
four point three what is the unique
features of 4.3 that you require and
there's usually a little bit of silence
and it's they want 4.3 because they
believe they have to have the latest
version of Android because of the
consumer demand and when you start
asking them how they're going to be
using a tablet for a fixed function
really you know Android is not very
fixed to secure phone android is not
very well suited at all for that device
and as you know if you go with 4.3
you're going to have a lot of API so
they're just going to strip out probably
actually going back a few generations
with it's a lot more stable be a lot
more applicable to their usage model and
then we you know you start talking about
the ability of having what the end user
once which is Android because they're
familiar with it and this ability to
have a much more secure lock down
functional functional environment and
they believe start getting interesting
in Java and what what it can be done now
you know those conversations are just
starting so we'll companies come to
market with dual mode OS is probably not
I believe that a lot of the companies
that we're talking to right now will end
up going with a much more security the
lineal Enix based and then porting java
on top of it with javafx as a potential
solution so what we're seeing is you
know a lot of companies which
traditionally have never played never
got gone into a headed device and now
going in there because they're saying
you know we want a tablet we want it to
do it gives off it gives our users the
flexibility they want but we don't want
to have all the overhead and a headache
of managing and android android release
so we want to have it more secure and
more lockdown and that's why we believe
you know we're you know that's why we
believe we're going to have a
relationship with oracle and java and we
believe we will end up seeing some of
these products come to market and what
we've done is we're simply you know from
a reference design perspective and a
partner perspective putting all that
ecosystem together so that they can test
that and if they decide to go to market
is production ready and they could not
go to market very quickly fic is based
in taiwan they have you know this
product already tooled up and ready to
go if a company wants to go to market
using java SE 7 and FX it's really a
matter of it's a number of months where
they can go into production and and have
it in the market yeah they can and you
can do that today but you're going to
pay for it so unless you have the ins
house experience to take Android and
harden it you're going to have to go to
a third party company and there's a
number of which we could recommend where
you can do it but you're going to pay
and then you're also deep you're always
going to be dealing with the and you
know with the with the insecurities of
Android and as new generation comes out
your end users wanting to migrate to the
latest generation where as Java you have
that modular design that is scalable and
it's much easier to update and evolve to
changing changing usage model
and needs really as a you know as a
there's a semiconductor cut
semiconductor company we are in very
agnostic to all of this we're going to
leave it up to the end user to our
customers what we're trying to do is to
is to guide them and give them choice
and to say your first impression that
you have as you go from the embedded
simplistic device running an artists or
Natan or bare metal or native code to a
more complex device that needs a more
intelligent software platform there is
another choice and that's Java we're not
saying that everybody is going to go
with Java but what we're doing as
assault as a semiconductor companies
giving we believe we can introduce it as
an option and we'll give you some case
studies of where it's worked did that
answer the question or not no no I would
never I would not recommend that I've
never run jar I would never recommend a
Java running on Android from a security
perspective the the example i'm giving
you here is using a multi using a
hypervisor where they're secure where
they're totally separate from a security
standpoint okay so they're running side
by side on top of a hypervisor does that
make sense yeah
linux
alright let's move along here so you
know as I said one of the one of the
companies we were talking to about using
a tablet was for health care and health
care is one of the areas that you know
we believe there's a lot of potential
and growth you know in terms of trends
basically what we're seeing in the
medical market which I think I'm sure
you've all seen as an end user is we've
seen this trend away from the doctor's
office to the home home health is a big
growth area and then from portable to
connected so this ability to get people
out of the hospital into their home and
then monitor them remotely is an
extremely large trend an example of this
as a company we worked with actually
called pom devices which came out with a
product called sanam be' which is shown
here which has been on the market for a
couple of years and really they were
trying to attack this usage model which
you see at the top of the slide which
was a major contributor to people going
when they were released early from the
hospital going back to the emergency
room in the elderly market so what they
did is they came up with a device that
was connected through ethernet and
allowed it was simply trying to remind
elderly people when to take their
medicine so it was an alert an audible
alert take your medicine now when they
took the medicine simple touch screen
interface they said I've taken the medic
medicine that was sent back to the
caregiver either professional caregiver
or family member through an SMS text to
say met medicine has been taken so a
fairly simple usage model and a device a
fairly simplistic device that was a
tablet form factor based on an IM x 28
which is an arm 9 running linux with a
very simple user interface it was
successful but what they found the
feedback was you know this is great but
what about if i fall if could you had a
panic button that can communicate
through a protocol that could send a
message to the professional provider or
caregiver to say I fallen can you come
and you know can you come to my
residence as soon as possible or how
about if they weren't able to even hit
the panic button if you had motion
detectors and there was
no motion detected in an area where
there's normally motion over a number of
hours send a message saying something's
wrong can you come and check so what
they found was they came out with a very
simplistic device and then they were
asked to evolve it to scale it add a lot
of new features they'd base this device
on Linux and as you know going back and
changing Linux they found it wasn't easy
adapting the code adding new features
was something that they struggled with
what we had done while they had come to
market with this is come out with a
reference design which we called the
home health hub what the home health up
did was basically try and allow allow
customers to get to market quicker with
a very similar to vice hub device in the
medical market to what's the number had
done for the elderly market so what we
did is we put together a reference
design based on the idea demux 28 we
originally didn't have Java on this we
originally had another operating system
which people you had to pay a royalty
for and people found very difficult to
use and adapt to their needs I'll let
you work out what it is so we started
working with the Java team we ported se7
to the Gateway we also came up with a
tablet we customer friendly interface
running JavaFX we used soap which is
used in the health care market to
integrate and talk to the health care
back end but most of the work here was
actually done with the interoperability
with the end devices and this is where
we believe we could add the most value
because most of these devices are either
boot bluetooth or zigbee and didn't have
the interoperability with se7 so we
worked with the java team to actually
add the interoperability so these
Bluetooth and zigbee and sub gig devices
could all talk to this gateway device
and this is a reference design which is
now on the market you can buy it through
one of our partners digi international
and again what we're trying to do here
is help companies that are looking at
the telehealth market
to get to market as quick as possible
we're trying to cut down a lot of the
work to say if you want to use free
scale and you're looking at using Java
as a platform we've done a lot of the
work for you in terms of integrating
with end devices and nodes but also an
easy user interface and integration to
talk to the backend what we're trying to
do is allow you to go from end device to
cloud and have a seamless integration
and communication across these different
these different modules and basically
the what we're trying to do the concept
here is go from the end user to the
backend by providing a gateway that
really integrates all the edge nodes all
the different protocols that they talk
through and from the Gateway to the to
the to the cloud as seamlessly as
possible and we believe that Java by
using Java ME on the end devices java SE
on the gateway and then talking through
Java Enterprise Services is the way to
do that seamless integration that no
other platform can really provide yeah
well we're suggesting that in the
reference design from the Gateway to the
tablet the communication is through
Wi-Fi doesn't have to be
no this is just a reference design so
really we're not saying you know we're
giving you an example of how it might be
done we sell you the reference design if
you then want to make changes you can
either work with Ozil you can work with
digital one of our partners to make
those changes so we're giving you an
ability what we're trying to do here is
to say we believe we've done a lot of
the work that you would have to do in
terms of making end devices which are
based on standard protocols
interoperable with with java SE 7 then
if you want to add devices and add
communications is up to you how you do
that we can give you a tablet that can
talk by using Java hd7 javafx transfer
data over Wi-Fi if you want to use a
different wireless protocol you know
that's your choice
hi
robert is seeing is where that bridging
the open standard like this is the idea
to shorten time-to-market using open
standards now as you said maybe open
standards might not work for you or
particular customer and that's where as
you said the Devils in the details and
you have to look at maybe a more secure
method for communication so really you
know this idea of a gateway in the
ability to communicate from the end of
from the end device the cloud we said in
the health care market but also there's
many other areas where we're seeing it
as well so this is the customer actually
based in Japan that has taken that same
idea of a gateway device based on the
idea de mex 28 and then utilizing Java
embedded for a number of a Tway for a
number of different usage models so
we're seeing they're integrating it for
smart cities and by using 3g from on it
to to monitor pollution parking
surveillance and also vending machines
so to communicate back over the cellular
network to let the vendor know when the
machine is empty how much money has been
taken if anything any theft is occurring
so this concept of using a gateway
device based on freescale technology
utilizing the Java platforms we're
already seeing migrate from specific
usage models such as health care into
many different areas which you know
really incorporate the Internet of
Things and then moving to the home just
like we saw in the healthcare space you
know these end devices are communicating
over many different protocols be at
zigbee z-wave Wi-Fi Bluetooth Bluetooth
Low Energy sub gig if you look at the
home and the connected home one of the
reasons that we all don't have this
wonderful connected home that we all
been talking about for 10 10 or plus
years is the proliferation of all these
different protocols and one box that can
communicate with all these different
protocols take all that information
analyze it either locally or connect to
the cloud have the cloud analyze it and
then present it back to the end-user in
a very easy-to-use format as we know the
connect the home has the potential of
integrating smart devices which we
talked about Smart Meters home energy
management very few of us have this
because of the complexity of doing this
with perforation of many protocols and
many different boxes which we have in
our homes today that act as gateways but
are subjected to what only one or two of
these protocols so when we looked at
this we said we know we've had success
with the home health hub in providing a
platform for tele health maybe we can do
something finally for the connected home
so what the concept was was to try and
replace these many gateways or boxes
which we have in our home and replace it
by one box so to do that we really had
to take we're looking at all these end
nodes where freescale is familiar with
them because they're using micro our
micro processors and our sensors in many
cases but there's this preparation of
different wireless protocols which is
not getting any it's not getting any any
any more defined we're not seeing a
migration to one particular protocol
we're seeing zigbee in some areas we're
seeing Bluetooth Low Energy and many
others I personally don't think we're
ever going to have this lists be reduced
to one or two so we're going to have to
live with this we then wanted to come up
with a box that can communicate with all
these different wireless protocols and
then through wide and wireless
communicate to the cloud so really our
challenge was and what we wanted to do
was say one box to replace all the many
different boxes in the connected home we
knew we could do it from hardware
perspective it's a little complex and it
has to be very modular the challenges
always being the software or the
platform that you're going to use that
can handle all these different protocols
both coming
in working similar simultaneously with
all the different antennas and then
being able to connect to the backend in
the cloud and have a seamless
communication from the device to the
cloud it's never been done what we've
done is we've come out with with a box
which is actually in the demo we're in
the Hilton it's at the arm booth and
also the Oracle booth it's called the
one box a lot of creativity went into
that naming I'm really what we've done
is it's based on the idea mx6 which is a
cortex a9 ARM processor it utilizes java
SE 7 as a standard embedded OS it then
uses java embedded services as a
middleware to allow the extendibility
for a gateway device and then more
importantly it's integrated Oracle event
processing to allow real-time analysis
of data and event control the reason
that is so important is because you know
coming up with this in terms of a
gateways not unique a lot of our
competitors are doing it but we wanted
to come up with a gateway that can talk
to the cloud but also n devices as
seamlessly as possible so by using auric
by using java an oracle event processing
we're able to obviously talk to the
Oracle back end but also we've worked at
the front end where we've taken ship
we've poured a Java ME two one of our
microcontrollers the k70 and we've also
partnered with sensor node which is now
part of arm which uses the constrained
application protocol to allow these end
devices which traditionally have always
been one way communication to talk to
the Gateway to the cloud so what we've
tried to do and you can see this demo
live is go from device to cloud so you
can have seamless integration from the
cloud to an end device that this allows
you for example to control simple
devices such as lights such as motion
controllers remotely for the first time
through a gate
we devise talking to the cloud so this
is where devices as we said through the
many different communication protocols
can talk to your device this can talk to
the backend send data all of this can
communicate or be shown through a simple
tablet or smart phone where you can
control send commands that can then
actually go to the very front end these
simple devices running Java ME and you
can turn on lights you can turn on or
control motion sensors or these very
simple devices which run for years and
traditionally have only been you need
only only the communication as only
being from them to the hub and not
bi-directional so this is being demoed
now obviously there's been a lot of work
done between freescale the the Oracle
Java team and sensor node and really
what we're trying to do is to say we
believe this is the first time and using
Java throughout to be able to go from an
end device which is a very simplistic
device to the cloud and to be able to
control it remotely yeah profile
okay so I've got a few minutes left so
I've been talking about you know the
idea of this was to talk about the
opportunity of Java in the embedded
space so we've talked about what we've
done in healthcare gateways you
connected the connected home big
projects you might be saying if we were
a Java developer you know give me
something more tactical of how Java can
be used in some of these traditional
embedded markets so I want to finish off
by talking about something a lot more
down to earth which is the liquid
dispensing management market which we're
all very familiar with unsure
surprisingly even to me this is a 23
billion dollar market what am I talking
about this idea when you go into a bar
in some of the pores a shot or pause any
kind of liquid how is it controlled well
today it's not if you go into most bars
you know there's a lot of guesswork that
goes into stock management there's a lot
of faith that goes on there's a lot of
gifting that goes on and so what the
liquid dispensing system is trying to do
is trying to eradicate to try and reduce
costs control inventory and also have a
system integration today the only ones
that are available on the market I'm not
sure if you can see these pictures too
well they tend to be most of them are
wired not wireless for a star and that's
why you don't see many of them because
they're very expensive they're difficult
to implement their difficult to manage
they use proprietary software so it's
very difficult to act when you actually
implement it to integrate it into your
existing back-end in terms of point of
sale which is a very fragmented market
they're expensive because it's it's
dedicated hardware you have to when you
go to a vendor that you have to buy
service from them because they're the
only ones that know how to repair the
hardware or the software and there's
very limited actual number of limited
companies in this market so what did it
we did we worked with a company that
actually came out with a whole new idea
so cloud flow was the name of the device
and it was really supposed to really
bring this embedded world into the smart
world so what were they trying to do
well firstly you know they wanted to
bring business intelligence into this MA
market they wanted to allow you two to
track the quantity of sales real-time
imagine you know if if you have three
three brands of whiskey and you you know
one was not selling you need you had a
lot of inventory for the last hour you
were open you could you could produce
the price of that and put it on a
special how will you know that today you
don't without going there physically
taking stop this idea was how can you
track real-time sales remotely and
really control your infantry manage
brands pricing and priceless the other
major area was system integration they
wanted to be able to integrate what was
happening at the front end with the back
end integrated with existing
point-of-sale systems provide and also
provide a simple web interface so that
anybody could bring this up remotely
wherever they were if it was a national
or international chain to see what was
going on in any particular environment
and then most importantly cost control
which as I said reduce the over pool
which is the largest cost wastage so if
you go in and you know the bomb and then
he gives you a very generous shot this
would be a way to reduce that eliminate
giveaways and theft and also add
security into the into the inventory
management so that's what this was
trying to achieve how was it done it was
using a proprietary RF protocol that
talks to the box and then the box
utilizes REST API is to get that
information to the backend or a simple
web-based interface or also has
integration that with the nine most used
point-of-sale devices in the market
today how does that look from a product
stack it was based on the idea of MX 28
which is obviously our hardware Linux
and then that the framework was based on
java SE 7 obviously the applications
written on top of that and talks through
a standard rest service so why did they
chose freescale well freescale we had
the you know the right product with the
right combination of features obviously
at the right price scalability in terms
of they believe that as the
eats for this evolved they could go up
our stack of application processes they
could go from an arm nine to a cortex
dual core a9 if they so wished and
obviously support as we said from the
very beginning the embedded world is not
this slow-moving world anymore getting
to mark time to market is critical and
we were able to provide them the
technical support they need it they
chose Java because se7 was production
ready they were familiar with it they
had the tools and they were able to fast
prototype and deploy it in a
multi-platform environment so this was
you know a company that shows freescale
froze chose Java and were able to get to
market I really take a traditional
embedded industry and revolutionize it
in a smart way so to conclude because
I'm almost running out of time really
what I try to do over the last 45
minutes is say you know this the
embedded world if you're a Java info of
a developer it's an endless opportunity
for you as we said you know we provide
reference designs we provide the
hardware we're not forcing customers to
go java we're simply bringing Java into
the equation because we believe it is as
good if not better than a lot of the
other software platforms that they are
currently considering we believe
freescale in our position is that we
have one of the widest portfolios in the
market so as people look to choose their
application we can go from a quad core
a9 cortex application process all the
way down to the extremely low power n 0
plus ARM architecture so we give you
that choice as a developer as a company
to go from extremely low power to
extremely high power and everywhere in
between we know we believe that Java
with its scalability its modularity java
SE Java ME and the connection to the
backend as we've seen with the one box
gives you the ability to talk from the
cloud to the end device which no other
software platform allows you to do and
that's why freescale and Java have been
working together to really bring this
opportunity to market if you're able to
make the keynote tomorrow the our
general manager will be talking about
the bigger
and more announcements about what
freescale and Java hopes do in the near
future so thanks for your time if you
have any questions myself or kwok will
happily take them now and thanks for
attending</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
