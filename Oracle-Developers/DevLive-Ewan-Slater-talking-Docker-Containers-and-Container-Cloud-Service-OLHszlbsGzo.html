another wonderful session of dev life
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and I have
as my guest
even Slater and I hope I got that name
yeah kind of right my Celtic isn't that
good who's a systems cloud architect
which was cloud applications architect
let me like that so even as lovely you
were welcome I know we tried to connect
in London with my work out oh it is too
busy it too busy that one but it's it's
good to get to have you here so first of
all I was Prague it's been absolutely
fantastic
you've been here before I was here
before a few years ago when we're doing
engineered system stuff what do you like
about Prague um I just like the buzz of
it I like the fact that it's a proper
old city it's got loads of history this
is the place for 30 years walls filtered
it was once the capital of a Holy Roman
Empire fantastic city it has a wonderful
pub called the fat cat and so far
statistically any pub I've ever found
called the fat cat it's really good yeah
well thank you for sharing that history
and and word so you've been doing a
hands-on labs in London Berlin Prague
yeah so like what a two-hour session I
saw something there are any give us a
little bit of a little highlight like
what are the things that you touch upon
in your hands-on lab okay so it's very
much a lab for the beginners for people
to take that first step into getting
hands-on with docker I think a lot of
people are talking about docker but not
so many of them are using it actually
with Prague we had a greater number of
people in the class who had either
played with docker before and or
properly installed the prerequisites for
the lab but then we basically go through
the mechanics of using the docker
environment pulling down a container
getting that container to run starting
with a hello world then moving to
running a lightweight web application
and then working on until we actually
compose up a wordpress stack so now
you've got a database in there
you're persisting the data to docker
volumes and you've got the web front-end
as well so we work up of a fairly gentle
learning curve but I think people come
away with the idea of the principles of
how they're going to use docker you just
upon the audience here the in Prague and
just for the folks who are actually
tuning in we actually have the record
number of attendees here at Oracle code
frog and it sounds like just based upon
your interaction with them the technical
level and some of their capability has
been very impressive yeah yeah I mean
it's when we ran I mean I'm very pleased
to say the lab has been sold out every
event that we've done and we've had to
turn people away in Berlin we had people
sitting on the floor with a load coming
at the back and so today we were kind of
quite strict that we only let in people
who had actually pre registered and how
many people are mean I we had about 40
in there 40 in there okay and the you
know as you alluded to the technical
level was very good we had people who
had gone and actually prepared their
environments properly and we had people
in the lab who were kind of stunning to
think outside the box and go a bit
beyond the scope of what was in the labs
so that was very rewarding okay great so
this is a lab which is targeted for
beginners what's kind of like some of
the key kind of takeaways early for the
people who have not been able to attend
you know hopefully they can maybe attend
Brussels or Moscow at the
it's going to be hands-on labs over
there yeah the same labs will be
available in Brussels and Moscow the lab
itself my crab has published it on his
github okay so you can go to to the
github and you can work through the lab
notes provided you set up a docker
environment so and how does somebody
find that on github and I don't have the
URL to help give it week as you can
share it with me I can go post on
YouTube we can show that yeah so you can
you can go to the lab the prerequisites
describe how to set up your starting
docker environment then once you have
that environment you log into it you'll
start by just checking the version of
docker that you have you'll pull down
your first container get that running
then you'll use docker PS so you can see
you know these are the containers that I
have running and then you know as I say
you start off with HelloWorld
then we pull down they're sort of comedy
whale so it'll come up with a silly
quote for you and then we've got a
little web application so you can start
to then look at how you map from the
docker containers port to the host port
and then you can navigate to the URL and
see the application running for some of
the attendees and you won't be able to
do this if you're just following the lab
self-paced offline for some of the
attendees who had problems like we say a
locked-down laptop that they couldn't
install something on or they just hadn't
had time to do the prerequisites we
actually used the Oracle contain a cloud
service to fire up some VMs for them in
the clouds alright I logged into those
and the other thing that hopefully
people will have come away from the lab
is we showed on the screen
how easy it is to and how much quicker
it is to do the things that we're doing
in the lab when you're just typing the
commands do those within the container
cloud service so you can very easily
quickly just get things running from
there great ok so again as this is a
class targeted for beginners I'll ask a
stupid question which is when does it
make a Miano docker containers and
darker all the kind of rage just like
micro-services but just like and to use
the analogy of micro-services you know
not all applique it doesn't make sense
for all applications in some cases if
it's not going to change if it's not
same if you know a monolithic
application may make sense so what about
liking the can under container side
where does that where does it make sense
to you know deployed a darker certainly
a lot of people or the most common place
people have started is test and dev and
lightweight applications with docker
kind of the rule of thumb is your
container should be doing one thing it
should be running one service so to use
a contrast with a VM if you were putting
a wordpress stack onto a VM you would
probably have your database just storage
all the things pieces that you needed
would be in that one VM yeah whereas
with docker you know you have the
databases running in a container in and
of itself the WordPress application is
running it in its own container and if
we had a more complicated stack that the
SE made up of four or five components
again you would probably put each of
those into their own container and thing
you use docker compose as a way of kind
of wrapping those up and bringing them
together and then you say here is my
spec that I can deploy on block so if
you've already to come back to your
question about where does it make sense
to use it if you've already
got an application that is virtualized
if you've built your VM for it your
virtualizing if you're happy with that
then maybe it doesn't make sense to move
that to docker unless you've got a
compelling reason but if you have an
application where you can decompose the
stack into different components say to
make it easier to upgrade one component
without necessarily having to re-roll
the whole thing then docker makes a lot
of sense there at Dokic on a lot of the
emphasis that was took place just last
week and I did wear revoked that was at
Austin in Texas it was I decide I didn't
go obviously because I was doing Oracle
code um but you know reading some of the
stuff that was coming out of there a lot
of the emphasis was on how do we start
to docker eyes legacy applications how
do we move away from this you know the
initial let's create micro services or
lightweight web apps and put them in
docker because I think that's fairly
easy and people understand that I think
from an architectural perspective and
you know the companies that I'm talking
to a lot of them find the idea of having
a single artifact ie the container that
is produced at the end of their
development pipelines
and then stacking those containers up to
make the actual overall assembly that
gets run they find that a very
compelling vision because you're only
working with one kind of container it's
like if yeah if everything could be
packaged up into a jar file it would
have that similar simplicity in terms of
deployment and you know the customers
I've been working with telecoms company
in Central Europe who are looking to
move all of their application
deployments onto docker startups in the
UK who are currently yeah have vm based
monolithic deployments but they want to
be
move towards using docker for precisely
these reasons doc is also very much more
efficient in terms of its utilization
because you're not having to run the
whole guest OS inside the VM you're
sharing the kernel and you just you know
it's just the application and the
dependencies of it that need to be in
the container
and because that can be a lot more
lightweight you get much better
utilization of your resources great so
does their accuracy which which cordovan
are you going to neck I'm probably going
to be going to Brussels I'm gonna go to
Brussels yeah okay forward to that
absolutely Brussels is a great place
okay all right okay there's a lot going
on well you and and I apologize I don't
I don't have the pronunciation quite
right thank you so much for making the
time and folk coming down thank you
thanks a lot Joe bristles I will do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
