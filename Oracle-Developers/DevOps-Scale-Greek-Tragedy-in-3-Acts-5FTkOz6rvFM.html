advocate with jet frog we have a table
in an xbox Hall with cool t-shirts like
that you should grab one cool stickers
raffle off Amazon Alexa and interesting
stuff and demos so come there for a to
learn more about Jeff rock in EDG baruk
on the internet follow me on Twitter
find me in any other social network
let's connect there as well and let's
talk about show notes for a second M by
going to general become slash show notes
you will find a special page dedicated
for V stock it will include the slide is
actually already include slides it will
include the video hopefully by tomorrow
with the help from the AV guys thank you
very much for a doing that for me all
the links I will throw a bunch of terms
and products and what's not all of them
will be found there and am value a
ruffle to thank you for coming there in
also if you come early you can increase
your chances and everything so that's
that for that and another question
before we actually dive into action of
our tragedy is we need to frame the term
Devils and and that's of course kind of
very simple term but also very victim
and there are a couple of ways to look
at it so and we'll take two views on
what delp's is from two different
perspectives one of the both of them of
course Indian diagram just because that
the most sane way to explain things in
Asian Greece apparently as well so this
is the classical way to look at DevOps
right we had developed an organization
we had operations organization and we
kind of blend them together and we call
it devils and somewhere down the road
people discovered that probably QA is a
good idea to put into this mix as well
it was a little bit too late to change
the name and also dev QA op doesn't
sound good so we left with dev ops but
the QA is differently part of it so the
sweet spot here
middle developed an operation QA this is
what we typically typically call Devils
but there is another interesting aspect
to look at that and together and that's
three completely other things technology
process and people that need to change
that need to mature that need to get to
this sweet spot as well right and this
is the perspective that we are going to
look at today and especially those
through the process and the people
because they are the problematic ones
well technology is easy we're all do
that we know it's easy sometimes it's
less easy but it's something manageable
processes are people not so much and
that's what makes it so hard now M the
obstacle of DevOps is not only that we
need to bring two teams of people
together but the problem is that those
two teams of people have the opposite
interests and motivation in mind right
so when we talk about DevOps we say all
right what we try to do here is
eliminate another integration point so
we already done that continuous
integration 15 years ago 20 years ago
was the first time when we tried to
eliminate n/a integration point there
are two developers that work on the same
project and every one of them do their
own thing right and and then a month
later they need to integrate it's hard
because they didn't communicate enough
they got to different things and now
they need to bring them together how we
solve it we'll just for them to
integrate frequently we have our CI
server it takes the code from both of
them and build them together all the
time continuous integration easy it
works we know it works we're all do it
no problems there DevOps looks from the
first glance exactly the same we take
call the developers right and instead of
integrating that into the run
a runtime platform in the end of the
Sprint or once a month or whatever we
will just make them do it all the time
it's exactly the same so what's the
problem
the problem is when we take two
developers and make them integrate all
the time that's fine because they have
the same interest they have the same
mitigation but they're going to take a
developer and an Operations guy and try
to integrate them this is what programs
happen because they have the opposite
motivation what developers do they
change things they develop new features
they change the behavior they make the
product behave differently what
operations do they keep things steady
right the best system admins are those
who don't do anything because that means
that everything works those want to
break things
those don't want any change and here is
the conflict and and that's what's so
hard and and and that's why the process
and the people are the key part of this
therapy process so with that let's talk
about our imaginary company that we will
try to implement Devils through our
scale and that is Pentagon Inc and they
are in you know the credit card
transactions business and we're going to
talk about them the first act we start
in our scale journey in the mode that
it's called reactive ops and also called
as a bucket brigade or fire brigade and
up there was an image they're lost
alright let's start with setting the
stage so people let's start with people
three founders of a very young startup
right all three of them are developers
they came from an on-prem background
there they were working some
three-letter acronym agency and this is
why maybe it's called Pentagon Inc they
are they're smart people they know what
they are doing they have good experience
they have good education they are after
all the friends not only with hipsterish
so their stick kind of expresses it they
use all the cool stuff javascript no GS
reactive programming microservices and
again they are smart they do the right
thing they have the right product the
technology is good process very lean one
very agile one so only three three guys
so we use something like condom to
manage their backlog and to manage their
sprint and to manage their iterations
again based on what I said previously
they'd be smart they know how to test
their software well so they do
test-driven test-driven design they have
unique integration automated tests they
have very good test coverage they know
exactly what they are doing
ops well you know they went to some
conferences they learn that they do need
opt right today's trend is not server
less architectures we don't need
anything we will use the cloud we will
deploy our service to the cloud and it
will just work there who needs ops right
not only jobs and this is their tool
chain again it's very very agile very
very lean they have JIRA that they
manage their back working their issues
and again think about all the
alternatives that can harm here it can
be bitbucket it can be aim you know the
others github for sources again
bitbucket gitlab whatever service they
use their only two out they don't have
any service and Prem they don't do ops
right travesty I heard about traffic CI
cup event so who are them of Jenkins
okay whoever didn't raise their hand
that not paying attention
Jenkins people you know about Jenkins
better all right Jenkins is the
continuous integration server the most
popular two genius integration server in
the world what it does it takes the code
from your source code and builds it
Travis CI is another continuous
integration server the reason why it's
here because I think it's as of today
the most popular continuous integration
server in the cloud you don't need to
install it it
there as a service pretty much large in
hub and it monitors your source wherever
it is on github or bitbucket or whatever
and just build it when there is a change
very simple one there are tons of others
like traffic see I draw Nile shippable
code sheep server CI a lot and and of
course those are all interchangeable
with any other alternatives just to put
a name there right and and in the end of
their build it is JavaScript it's no J's
they have some kind of building test and
everything and eventually this CI server
deploys what they build to their
production server and their production
server server les right so it's a
production service and here
Amazon Beanstalk is one option Oracle a
function that you heard in the keynote
that's another very valid option it's
generally some code that runs in the
cloud and you'll get you know get calls
and works right I mean Google platform
Asia or whatever whatever you choose to
use everything can be low here so this
is their stack and it's a good one so
now let's talk about what happens well
sin number one they wait what they wait
for of course the rate for first
customer they have their service up and
running
it's looking good and they try to get
some customer on board and they actually
found one one internet celebrity you
know like Instagram celebrity decides
that to give a chance to go three guys
and she fell all her apparel and
accessories and everything using their
credit card transaction service that's
of course a huge win and what they do
when they got this customer they drink
they celebrate right so we drink a drink
and whether you're not Friday night by
you know like around I don't know to to
em everybody drunk everything is great
and then
customer calls nothing works now this is
very scary because as I mentioned this
is their only customer and everything
was working fine and now everything is
working they are going to lose their
business they are going to lose their
startup everything is bad but you know
there are small guys it's their startup
they all have access to production
they're all developers they wrote this
thing so this did they just charge and
you know they will give in to their
cloud provider and they start to look
for logs well where are the logs we need
to find them which logs we talked about
microservices so there is a dozen of
different micro service in the system
how they correlate to each other and
hearing the logs we see an exception
that having two a.m. but it correlates
to some event that happened in 4 a.m.
right time zones so they do sometimes on
sacra batiks they try to correlate
between the logs and try to find the
problem eventually if they do find the
problem and one of the founders but as I
mentioned 2 a.m. and he's completely
drunk and he has this great idea so he
caught it and it goes to production and
of course it wasn't that great but but
the future is easy right
all I need to do is take the previous
commit and do it it's not that
complicated so they try to do that and
then it fails they cannot build the
previous commit anymore why well maybe
because the use NPM and they use some
package that was unpublished for from
NPM registry did you hear about NPM gate
unpublish gate a couple of months ago
how many of you heard it okay so I will
refresh the memory of rest of you NPM as
you probably know is the JavaScript
package library right so you can you can
use node.js else and use npm for your
dependencies and packages and npm have a
centralized repository that is called
NPM registry and in the NPM registry
there are millions if not billions
different components
while them called left pad is a
component that helps you to pad your
text with spaces from the left these are
called left pad is 12 lines of
JavaScript code and it's extremely
popular in the JavaScript world it's
like it's crazy popular every package
whatever you use directly or indirectly
through transitive dependencies depends
on this left but as crazy it may sound
it is what it is and that one some day I
think it was like half a year ago the
developer of this left part got except
with that upset with the organization
that runs the NPM registry because the
name issues nevermind he got upset with
them and he said like thank you I'm
going to take all my packages out of NPM
registry and he deleted this super
popular left pad component and the way
the NPM client works not only checks for
new dependencies it also checks for
existing dependencies to check if
they're still available and if they are
not available it will fail the build so
the building works yesterday perfectly
fine we change nothing won't work today
because someone unpublished their module
from the central and P registry how fun
is that so that's what happened in our
example and now the build won't run
anymore what do they do they run in
circles eventually they find this
library this NPM this left pad in some
cash so they install it locally
eventually they manage to solve the
problem but the problem is those kind of
problems happen every time it's always
in the middle of the night it's always
in in most unconvince
it's always a new kind of problem that
they need to solve immediately this is
the reactive ops they react to problem
to solve it this is the fire brigade
then consumed in firefighting mode right
and
and that's the mode that if you work in
such a very you know small startup very
you know dynamic startup then small is
something that you might be familiar
with and that's okay that's that's a
stage right and the problem is that you
need to get out of it and eventually you
outgrow it and you go to the next stage
which we call the reactive improvement
stage or the smoke alarm installers so
let's talk about what changed in this
stage and the changes are you know new
people there is some money they have
round a and now they have thirty
developers one of the developers
actually have an Operations background
Chile came from the operations
background they have the growth so it's
about hundred customers nice number and
now they have sporting not very big
couple of people but it's 24/7 phone can
answer the call and do some kind of you
know problem-solving going on on a
simple level or try ash for going
forward with it so that's that's
definitely an improvement and right so
in their bigger now combine won't cut
any more they have a more I would say
furious process something like you know
scram by the book
an ink you a they have an exploratory
testing who knows what exploratory
testing is anyone never heard this word
well exploratory testing is something
very trendy today and I call it many
oakley it just doesn't sound as sexy as
exploratory testing but it is the same
it's someone that physically clicks
through the buttons in the UI and church
that everything works so now they have
that because they realize that the
automatic testing cannot cover all the
possible scenarios so they have this now
and and opt right
we now suddenly have someone that says
guys there is no such a thing as knobs
there is no such a thing as several s
several it means there is a server
of somewhere it's just not here right
but the wreath so suddenly they need
they start to realize that they need to
take care of it they need to care about
their platform and what's on the other
side was inside this magical cloud that
they throw their code into there is
something that right and they have a
developer and call now they are bigger
now it's not that everybody can now at
night jump on the call and try to solve
a problem there was there is someone on
the pager duty basically right is the
valve Oracle rotating role that it will
help this developer will help the
support to answer the question that the
support cannot no no to cancel you all
know that right and this whole the
problem with dogs they just considered
moving to Greenwich London but then they
so the real estate prices it's actually
almost like in San Francisco so instead
they just decided not to buy a house in
Greenwich but just adjust all the lumps
now all the logs are Greenwich Time UTC
and the problem is solved other option
would be movable the service to
physically to Greenwich but that's
expensive nevermind ill joke that didn't
really work okay that's okay that's okay
let that happen
they're happy moving on news and tools
and they have a knowledge base now so if
they use JIRA they naturally bring
conference on board this is a knowledge
knowledge database for the support guys
they need to know where to find answers
and github say strata test straight okay
now they realize that they don't want
this npm unpublished thing to happen
again they want to cache their
dependencies not only they want to cache
their dependencies they also want to
cache the previous build results right
instead of trying to rebuild what worked
yesterday taking now actually take what
worked yesterday and just deploy it
again and for them
need an artifact repository of course I
used a program if actually for the
obvious reasons there are others that
are definitely can fit in this spot
what's important is that you need to
have an artifact repository there and
then again their cloud service is just
fine they can still use Amazon or Oracle
or Azure or Google cloud platform
whatever whatever they use because the
runtime platform is great what we need
to take care of is that we now know
where the logs are how to use them and
very bunch of great tools that can
gather all those all together from those
micro services and actually provide you
with additional features like event
correlation queries trends and this kind
of stuff again Summa logic is a great
example of one of them but there are
others like log entries like ELQ staff
from elasticsearch and many others right
so what do you need to take care of is
your logs are being correlated and kind
of work together now this guy who
remembers Pingdom anyone
thank you very much I always glad to see
at least one hand because it means that
we're still know someone for some memory
that's I would say the basic site
monitoring that you can find it's a
service that does only one thing it goes
to a URL did you give it did you give it
and it tells you whether it's Apple down
cannot be any easier than that very
primitive but actually works for those
guys because at least they now protect
it from this call from the customer
nothing works again they at least know
that their service is up right so that's
that's a nice improvement let's see
what's going on now and what's going on
now if you remember there is some money
so they obviously drink right and and
and of course it's Friday night and it's
2:00 a.m. and everybody drunk and then
the customer calls
and now it's not that nothing works that
cannot happen again because they have
this monitoring it's something doesn't
work so for example they have this
credit card processing service and then
Visa and MasterCard were just fine but
American Express is saying now the
goodness of first reaction is naturally
panic but the good news they now have
the supporting supporting receives the
call they check the knowledgebase
nothing interesting there but they have
the developer on call so they call the
developer on call and this developer
golf course the only sober guy in the
company him and support him and he's
like you know what I have no idea
I was doing something else I implemented
some other functionality so I don't know
why what's going on with American
Express that was this other call Billy
other developer and and of course Billy
the drunk but eventually they get their
hand on Billy and and benefit yeah well
naturally of course American Express is
failing because you know we have those
queues of transactions with all the
deals inside and an allocated for Visa
and MasterCard marks logic used because
usually Visa MasterCard are way more
popular but the customer has a promotion
if you buy to the American Express you
get something for free so emerging
Express queue or flan well okay this
sounds very familiar because Billy said
I am pretty positive that I expected
that and I actually need fix it and
crease the size of this American Express
skew the other day but now I can't find
this commit well I think I'm not sure
whether this branch was merged whether
it was build I'm not sure because in
JIRA I see this closed as as a result
but not closed I'm mature and so it's
hard for Billy it's 2:00 a.m. and he's
drunk but eventually they find it they
fix it and now it's time for a very very
important process we give you in their
current state and this project is root
cause analysis now root canal
when you do something like that in your
organization is the first step for doing
things right and there are multiple
reasons for doing that one of them is
just understanding what happened and
make sure that if one happened again but
there are more we're going to talk about
it later and I will give you a couple of
examples for root cause analysis reports
so this is a young through and the end
and actual root cause analysis the names
of the work sensor to protect them not
so innocent so there are a couple of
parts first of all getting all the date
and all the time straight get the time
of services affected and all this part
does this is the list of events what
actually happened when the program was
discovered how to will discover to what
where what we actually so happening now
this usually comes there is no easy
there is no like obvious way to get it
there is no one that sits in the corner
of this war room and tides down what's
going on but we all use now in corporate
communication tools like slack or
HipChat or or whatever other tools you
use and logs of those chats can actually
happen it can can help here
when this major accident happens you
will usually get a new dedicated channel
and this can be very much the log of
this channel this is very useful
symptoms what we saw is failing and then
explanation technical information on
what happened from the technical
perspective
so here the event will be the customer
called and complain that American
Express calls the transactions didn't
work and the support team look at these
articles and in their knowledge base and
find nothing and then they call the
developer and call and actually the
events what happened is technical
description right we discovered that the
queue was overflowing because
such-and-such right and the symptoms are
of course American Express transactions
won't get through and then
simple root cause this is what happened
this is why seven in the other because
the size of the cube for American
spirits wasn't big enough next steps
what action can be taken to eliminate
this issue from occurring again this is
all the purpose of this Oracle analysis
this is why we do it now sometimes you
know it was because of the weather you
know the universe fluctuated and and and
there is no obvious or reasonable action
to make in order to prevent it from
happening again but most of the times
including ours the figure is very simple
all we need to do is increase the size
of American Express queue now the only
question is by how much so we are really
and really goes like oh let's double it
oh you know what let's triple it that's
that's good let's triple it yes there's
no idea what ok we'll fix it and here
you come to another very important
aspect of this root cause analysis and
that the public retrospective that we
give to our users and customers now this
is pure psychological game now as
strange as it may sound your users and
customers are extremely forgiving for
accident in any scale if it happens the
first time and I will give you now an
example that will blow your mind but
still for the first time and for one
time only here's an example
how about gitlab accidental incident the
last week who heard about that ok good
yeah components so what happened is
someone delete to the production
database logged into production and
there are two removed a database with
production data
well they'll happen it will probably
bring some kind of downtime like couple
wins
down time until they restore the backup
nothing major and then this is what
happens they try to restore from backup
and then they discover that they have
backups but no one knows where they are
when they eventually find it all the
files on backups are empty never mind
they did a database dump using the PG
dump procedure of PostgreSQL but the
problem is they used wrong version of
binary we're doing this dump
so no dump actually happened no SQL
dumps were made okay that's not bad they
have these snapshots but they never took
snapshots of the observers replication
they probably have more than one
environment up and running not so much
replication procedure is super fragile
prone to error relies on helpful random
shell scripts and it's badly documented
they didn't have any replication as well
but they probably have s3 buckets with
the backups well not so much the bucket
is empty they have five backup
replication techniques in place none of
them were ever checked and they none of
them actually worked so they have a
disaster recovery which will never run
lesson learned
if you have a backup and restore your
backup does not exist until you try the
restore right now we know but what it
shows to us it's like complete
incompetence of the technical team you
go like who hired those morons what the
hell how it's even possible alright
people believe production database
that's that's the fact that that's okay
but this is like it's unbelievable how
we can those people haven't get access
to a computer
and this is public this is on their
website they're almost brag about it
they invite us to come and read it why
not because they think they handle the
accidents
well enough but because they had a I
don't remember like almost 24 hours
downtime and they need to explain what
happened and they need to be very
transparent and very harmless about what
happened because then the magic happens
you look at this and instead of saying
you know what I'm never going to do any
business with those guys they're
complete morons you go like well okay
then learn their lesson and I can trust
them again let me unbelievable this is
how our psychology works and this is
true for every accident happening for a
first time even I am going to screw up
the recovery the second time they will
go out of business but first time even
this magnitude of catastrophe they will
still get by with it yeah this is what I
felt when I read it here is another
example from my personal example who
have who has Google Wi-Fi or Google hub
at home telling me alright that's okay
it's a new device from Google that
actually does Wi-Fi what it says and I'm
in a conference last week we were in
Atlanta for their Nexus and I got a call
from my wife it's evening and she's like
the kids are sitting in the dark and I'm
like what why is this like electric
outage and she's like now that the
electrical outage is finds just the
Wi-Fi and I'm saying like okay so what's
the problem oh they forgot that they can
actually manage you know flip the
switches manually they only do it with
Alexa by voice and electric current work
without Wi-Fi so they are sitting in the
dark and I'm like well hand them to the
Wi-Fi what what lamp does it blink and
she's like it looks like but I checked
and it looks like they were always set
and that's exactly what happened
Google pushed an update to my
Wi-Fi routers at home that we that hard
factory reset at all of them will I buy
another device from Google
I will that's the first time that happen
I will let them go right so first time
we're extremely forgivable I'm sorry
this is where everybody died and I don't
have any time but I'll just run through
it
tragic lumination Burbidge song what
happened more money around beat now they
have a hundred developers five with
herbs background and a whole performance
engineer like in flesh and blood like
the whole guide chip architects the
chief comes in to teach us how to do
stuff customer success team what are
those guys remember developer our code
that said I have no idea it was Billy
that with customer success team
shouldn't happen again
cousins Christine is a developer and
call for each and every subject so they
have development caller wrote every type
of the subsystems of that not only they
are on call but they also work to find
and fix those problems during the day
they are the SWAT team of their
organization the fight problem they find
a problem they fix it they make sure it
won't happen again
by doing their root cause analysis oh
they have this guy now there are big
guys so they have illegal and people
that cares about the money eventually
thousand customers reasonable sides so
this is all good they feel pretty good
about themselves and they have all those
processes in place safe scalable agile
framework for enterprise I think this is
what it stands for hundred developers is
about like seven scrum kings it's hard
to manage there are methodologies that
help you to manage this size of
development team so if it's one of them
it's hard whatever methodology you use
but methodology can make it a little bit
variable so take a look at safe if
that's your size system testing someone
now
we have a whole system that come a lot
of moving parts there is something that
need to check a whole of it opening now
here when you need to send and leave the
room not because the time is up but
because what is the shit you just told
us DevOps
there is no upstream everybody all
together and now you introduce an ops
team what's wrong with you and you'll be
right but the answer is not exactly an
ops team those guys are in charge to lay
the foundation to set up the framework
and to advocate DevOps through all their
organization so they will be those who
will set up all the infrastructure of
the code who will set up the continuous
integration and continuous delivery who
set up all those pieces and then teach
the rest of the organization how to do
DevOps this is what we call the ops team
also we will get to some kind of legal
requirements now that actually won't
allow company of this magnitude
especially in the financial markets to
give route access to production to all
the developers it's just illegal so they
need those guys to take care of this
separation of duties as well right
it's correction path so we already have
some kind of store escalation path we
have the support guys that took it to
the developer and code but now it's
actually proper escalation path that can
go on the way to the CEO and here you
can say like why do I need a CEO on my
escalation path for for an incident for
for something to happen in production
there are two good reasons first is
sometimes the problems are so serious
that they should end up with your field
make some calls right or take people to
dinner or take them to play golf because
there were some serious fuck-ups and
this is the level woman's got mitigated
other ISM is escalation passes the funny
thing it has the exact time on when to
call the next one right if we don't fix
it in 20 minutes
call
we'll burn coal if we don't fix it in
the next two hours called the core
development team the SEL in the end of
this path make sure that it will be
solved before that no one wants to make
this call and escalation paths will
force you if you don't fix it before so
that's another very good motivation to
fix but so this is kind of a regulation
that I mentioned the one for example
that actually forces you to have some
kind of an ops team Seok - and
especially for financial and this is
also there as well
non-functional bad work they have em or
you mentioned the performance engineer
they have the TIC the chief architects
now they care about stuff which are not
in the main bedrock tools evolves so now
they have some kind of configuration
management in place there are tons of
options of how to do it but now it's
about time and and what else is new
proper ITM instead of this funny pink
gum a proper application a performance
management when they can see not only
what is happening what is down but how
it performs what it's slow in what is
pop so this is another very good a tool
to bring in this scale and let's see
what happens so first remember there is
money so what do they do they drink and
then customer one call now this is
something different
uhm yeah so remember the legal guy he
now comes back from a conference for
legal people and there are conferences
for those as well he's like very excited
it was like you know the best conference
ever hard court sessions I went to a
session they spoke about social licenses
like very interesting I was fascinated I
couldn't take my eyes out of the flight
cool stuff and and what I learned is
that we are not allowed to use LGPL
version 2.2 in any of our dependencies
do we have any of those the legal asks
the head of development
and he goes like I'm Nadia how can we
know we can ask the developers to go and
search for them well at least now we
have multi Factory or all dependencies
are in one place but filling it to go
through all of them and figure out the
license and order happens one is found
we might need to end up replacing very
big parts of our software
well it's doable eventually they do it
but it is painful and then another call
comes in and this time is the CFO
calling and he is asking for budget for
next year for your for the servers of
the team how much the our cloud is going
to cost us next to you and of course the
head of development girls like I have no
idea right and then it goes like we'll
take what we spend this year and we'll
multiply it by one point thirteen
because I have no idea why that's the
number that makes sense and you know
what if I am wrong no one is going to
shut down production servers right if I
miss the money so let's again no one
cares but this is a question that we
don't have answer for you know this guy
will blend a blend stuff in here is
blender so this time it's a sales call
and say guys we have a customer that
wants guarantee that our program that
our software will scale to a certain
scale so the question is will it scale
and the head of development goes like I
have no idea let's ask the developer and
the developer of go like well we wrote
it of course it will scale naturally
what the problem was it will scale our
software was great and and then how do
you know
well we guess we don't know but we wrote
it we believe it will scale just great
and then this happens that's from the
movie 300
and they didn't scale that they were all
dead okay so yeah I didn't scale
basically so yeah everything is really
really bad and they
where everybody died but I don't have
the time I guess I'll just a couple of
more minutes to bring the you know the
modern Western civilization happy ending
to this horrible horrible Greek strategy
and very happy ending and it's called
another state on our scale the Smokey
Bear or proactive improvement very rare
to find an organization in this stage we
estimated about 5% of all the
development teams that to this new
Ravana but eventually you can and there
are a couple things that again you need
to change in a process in your tools so
performance and scalability testing is
extremely important and ask you and
helps you to ask to answer the questions
about scale license security management
of course helps you to ask to answer
questions about license and security
process performance and trend review
this is something that performance
engineer with the tech architect build
in to be able to predict how the product
will behave and non-functional
definition of done you remember the
non-functional backlog that we had in
previous one this is much stronger
because definition of done means you
cannot release the product if those
requirements are not implemented not
only they are in backwards we need to do
them sometime you cannot call it a
product before it's done it's much
harder guarantee tools can happen as
well so you can bring a companion for
its factory that it's called Mission
Control it gives you a better control
and predictability of your a binary
repository j-rok x-ray is also here and
that's a tool that allows to make a
recursive impact analysis for licenses
for security so you will know about
lighting security problems before you
need to ask your developers to run and
search for it a cloud testing tools
performance like blades meter and there
are others that allow you to spin up
unlimited amount of machines and do this
extensive performance testing as well
service virtualization etcetera etcetera
so
how do we solve the problem of not
having the information a of licenses in
front having something like x-ray and
that's an example of how x-ray can find
this is a exactly this problem we have a
comment in jar file here with GPL inside
and we can alert on a war file within it
the targeted file it's in it the Debian
package is in it some kind of a daughter
layer that is ended and then a docker
container the transit so we will know
which docker containers are affected by
this GPL license after the first
continuous integration build and not
when the legal comes and ask those
questions and if now there is a new
requirement we can easily scan and do
import analyses on existing tools on
existing artifacts as well how do we
battle this I have no idea how how much
money my R&amp;amp;D costs here's a very
advanced tool it's called Microsoft
Excel right so once you write stuff down
you can do those great charts and you
can say I know that I have 15% to fight
the technical deaths I spent and I spent
you know some a 6% of improving
engineering velocity etc etc so it's
it's that simple as long as you write it
down here is the more advanced tool this
is Mission Control and it can predict
there how many artifacts you will have
in a certain time in future and this of
course storage services etc etc also
very very useful for that how to solve
this problem that we have had no idea
how will it scale at all oh now this is
this is the one I like so we said this
is problems quality right we are not
sure whether a product is good or not
how do you measure quality of a product
number of bucks thank you very much how
do we know about bugs I think that's
kind of yet but then we fix them it's
not like if they are not released they
are not bad
customers complaining thank you very
much customers complaining Arthur is the
only valuable metric for measuring the
quality of the products whether
customers like it or not whether I can
use it or not
this is an example of a product that we
recorded the customer complaints which
are customer defects this is what they
call you can see that they're grouped by
severity right for is the minor three
non-critical this is severe and this is
catastrophic now from this graph you can
learn and 65% of all the tickets were
severity one and two what does it imply
on the quality of the product great
thank you very much this means shitty
product right but is it how if I can
guarantee you that it's a good product
what does it mean that's good but also
well maybe who filed those civilities
who select those someone until the
supporting right might it be that the
supporting does have no idea how to
operate the product so instead of
answering this is how you do it they
file severe bugs can we know that
somehow can reevaluate so now we have a
kept a blame game between the
development team which claim everything
is fine and supporting the claim you
know the customers are complaining all
the time and then the dev team goes like
it's just you have no idea you don't
know how to operate the product it's
your problem how can we solve that how
can we bring facts to this to this
discussion we need to look at the
resolution of those bugs and here is
something interesting most of the bugs
52 percent was information provided one
of the main information provided
it means that the development team told
the support team how to use the product
suddenly the product is not that bad
half of those horrible horrible defects
were actually go and reach the docks
yeah I'm under go go and read the docs
right so darling it's suddenly not that
bad well we have another project at
problem and that's the training of the
support team but now we know what to
fight we won't blame it on the
development team instead we are going to
invest in praying of the support gap
Epimetheus watch the world adinath means
anyone has a major in theater here in
drama no it's the morale of the story
and the morale is very simple first of
all scale is a scale you grow through
this process from three developers that
do heavy root access and do everything
by themselves to those big organizations
with all those processes and tools in
place and very not much you can jump
ahead with when you try to force a team
of three people to do what the Smokey
Bear does it won't work it's just a
skill that you need live through well
you need to know is what your next
target is if you are in a reactive ops
try to get to the proactive ops if you
are in proactive odds try to get to
continuous improvement so into the scale
and it's okay to be in every place on
the scale there is no bad place there is
definitely a wonderful place but overall
s are fun and also you remember that
this is change of process technology and
people is what brings DevOps to shine
and there are two if you need to
remember something from this talk
those are the two most important things
first you force people to own what they
do this is what that was about this is
why we need those processes this is what
we need those tools you build it your
own it and actually there is no good way
to do it
the education is nice but it wants force
people to do it the only way to force
people to do that is pain
waking up and 3:00 a.m. is very
instructional this guy will come
tomorrow to the office and we'll make
sure that this problem won't happen
again so this is my best advice for
implementing devil's plane is
instructional sorry about that
QA another half time I will be at the
jet rope table so come there Jay Barak
on Twitter Oracle code is the hashtag
show notes you remember the slides the
video and all the links and the raffle
and if you come early even more prizes
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
