It's time for another 2 Minute Tech Tip.
Hello, my name is Guido Schmutz. I'm an Enterprise Architect for Trivardis in Europe.
So my tech tip today is why should you care about Apache Kafka.
Apache Kafka, fundamentally, is a message broker.
You might ask,  &quot;I already have a message broker.&quot;
&quot;I have WebLogic or an enterprise service
bus.&quot;
&quot;So why should I care about Apache Kafka?&quot;
As I said, Apache Kafka is a message broker,
and it has the notion of &quot;topics.&quot;
But what is the difference between topics in Kafka and in JMS?
Topics in Apache Kafka are capable of handling thousands if not 100,000 or
even millions of messages per second.
Whereas with JMS you usually end up with 200, 300 messages.
So how is Kafka able to cope with so many messages?
A topic in Kafka is partitioned.
So we have many partitions, and Kafka is usually set up on a cluster.
So it's a scale-out architecture.
You have multiple brokers, and your partitions are spread over
these brokers in the cluster.
So with the partitions you get scalability
Additionally, you have high availability and durability.
Which means you have replication.
So each partition of your topic is replicated, usually three times.
So you can afford losing a broker and you still have your data.
So where can you use Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka can be your central nervous system,
where all the streams in your organization lead to Kafka.
What kind of streams do you have?
Maybe you have an IOT workload.
Maybe you have stream processing.
Maybe you have microservices, and all of these publish events which can be handled through Kafka.
Was that a good tip?
&quot;Sounds to me like a capital idea!&quot;
We want your opinion!
Thanks for watching and stay tuned!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
