in Basel Switzerland and since lately we
have developed something which is called
open dolphin which kind of in one
library captures engineering knowledge
from over ten years more than 10 years
and more than 10 engineers maybe so it's
kind of worth a hundred person here so
it is it has proven to be very
interesting so and I hope I can spark
some more interest today in the audience
whenever you have a question please just
interrupt me please just pause it right
away there's no need to to wait until
the very end I'd like to start with the
video it's it's like the orator keynotes
right if you start with a video sorry
the the applicant wants it start with a
video to show what we have done already
what open dolphin and what we you can do
as well sorry there is no audio I will
do the audio myself okay
so it's it's a two minute video and it's
showing in an application that we have
developed together with Oracle and one
of our customers nervous which is
located here in Auckland and it's
showing a container yard this is the
container yard of Antwerp which is by
size the largest container yard in the
world and what you see is is the
container terminal from above first with
the 2d view and now we have switched
into the 3d view and whether you display
it in 2d or 3d is implement it's it's a
beauty it's a view detail right the the
application logic resides on the server
and is the exact same deal
without regard whether you see the the
view in 2d or 3d while these containers
actually make a very nice 3d models
because it's it's easy to to have these
little cubes well it's it's a little bit
more involved with the cranes and and
rubber tube gantries that you hear that
that move it around the the main thing
to keep a way to keep in mind here is
this application runs on the server
it's a server-side application and still
you have this very rich visualization
which is the core of the story about
open doors but often dolphin you would
like to have an end up in enterprise
application and enterprise by definition
means it runs on the server all your
business logic is on the server also
workflow logic is on the server only
presentation is on the client and if you
have applications like this you would
like your seeking the the best possible
performance the fidelity as we call it
on your client right moving things
around and and having a very good
display and giving giving a sense of of
locality to the to the application user
if you'd like to do applications that
where the user should really have some
kind of immersion into the application
then you need technologies like these
which is now JavaFX 3d and if you think
that's that's beyond what normal Java
Enterprise developer can do no it's not
it is really not and to do the proof is
we have since recently developed at
least some applications along these
lines where you need some kind of 3d
behavior and of course not every
application needs that but there's more
than I would have initially envisioned
and one that I would also like to show
to you is the
I do you take that one this combination
the factory floor application which is
kind of an in condensed down stripped
version of what we have done for
multiple clients now what you see is
something which kind of reflects a
factory floor with lots of engines and
and whatever you can imagine in there
and they typically have some kind of
state you know and the server is
responsible for giving you the state
they may have a temperature they may
have an outage they may call for
attention and this is all information
that resides on the server but you'd
like to show it on the client and here
in this 3d board I can pinch and zoom
say I have I'd like to see the overview
where are the problems and then zoom in
right and see a specific one select a
specific one and you see details over
here
it's a JavaFX 3d with the 2d sub scene
on this in this area and if I pick a
different one you see different entries
over here it's a typical master detail
view and still like I can zoom in and
zoom out or if I'd like to say well it's
difficult to keep track of which I have
selected I can command click on any of
those and they go to the side for for
simpler inspection and and comparing
them so do go like so and then when i
refresh it's it's easier to see how they
change over time that's kind of a
downstream version and this is a hundred
lines of code or so so it's really
pretty easy if you're interested in this
code I I can send it to you please just
contact me dear Cunha catkin you come
all the famous Whittaker companies on
this planet have found my email address
so you will find them as well I guess
ok yep and now a little bit of of how
we've done it what is what is Dauphin
all about all about that was better than
of a teaser here good opened often like
to say what it is in why it may be
important to you as well and certainly
how it works
opened often is not a framework and not
a platform and nothing that locks you in
it's just a library just as you will
have locked for J or I don't know
something like that it's you just put it
on the classpath there you have it so it
is very small it even runs on Raspberry
Pi it's only fifteen hundred lines of
code or so and what it does is it
organizes the the communication between
views and controllers in a very special
way first it is all asynchronous all the
time it you can even it decouples views
and controllers as far as you can
possibly decouple them but they can even
compile on a different class path right
the hey you can put them in different
machines like this this lets maximum
amount of decoupling that you can have
and still performant and reactive and
the the mechanism that we use which
which gives us an a really good
abstraction for this is presentation
models it's presentation model the
presentation model pattern but working
with shared presentation models and
dwarfing keeps keeps than automatically
automatically synchronized the client
presentation model abstraction and the
server side that's what it he is kind of
the definition you'll see on the client
side we have two views on the server
side graph controllers and actions and
their share automatically synchronized a
presentation model you can de have them
running in one virtual machine for a
development time or for debugging
purposes or so if you want to profiling
debugging but typically you have the
view on the client side and the server
and controllers actions on the server
side
and this is normal Java server
everything that runs Java typically
JavaFX but could be swing on is anything
else and the service and Java Enterprise
so the server your control or logic on
the server side says what should be
displayed by creating presentation
models changing them deleting them
reading them and the client size is
responsible for how this information
should be visualized it's a very clear
distinction and makes application
programming easier because it's it's
easier to know where should I put my
code for visualization or for it for
having a clear line between the how and
the what is really important for code
organization for the UI engineering as
we call it it is so small it runs on
raspberry pi just the talk before tadka
Stella hasn't room thank you made in an
excellent introduction to opened often
and in shouted running on the Raspberry
Pi for having that the chicken barn
being managed and here we have Raspberry
Pi down below here runs open dolphin and
on top we see the meeting rooms at canoe
at our company which is this is now
mounted it to the wall where we in the
floor where all the meeting rooms are
and it connects to our corporate
calendar the the server connects to the
corporate calendar it shows who was
booked for which room this has has
proven to be a really good thing people
really are starting now to to book the
rooms correctly so it makes it very
visible you go to the floor you don't
know where you're meeting where you're
meeting is in which meeting from you
look at the at the monitor and have it
and even if you look for a flea free
space like is there a scheduled meeting
in this meeting room for the next few
hours no I can just go in and have a
spontaneous discussion or whatever that
this has really proven to be very useful
it was developed at the infamous canoe
code camp where we go off-site three
days into the
and and Hecla crazy so it was was three
days work to do that why do we care
well there's technical merit in there's
business merit and this why we care is a
little bit about the business merit I
know your technicians like me you're
engineers and he but every now and then
you may need to convince your management
that you go this route and here's some
ammunition for you if you further for
the further discussion you can save
money not too much but a little I would
say whenever you do clean
implementations that helps it it saves
you money in the short term but you've
but in the middle and long term as well
that's maintenance cross it's clearer
where things are and if you change one
piece you do not affect the other ones
you'll see how that why that works with
open coffin tell that Isis it is very
easy to test testing is also important
it saves you lonely in the to some
degree how much difficult to say if they
if you have a budget like so for these
kinds of applications I would say like
ten fifteen to stand or so that's what I
would can't guess hmm it's it's not yet
overly compelling that and this is what
the customers say users say of open
dolphin makes them really productive
anyway from from what is still to be
paid for the effort that you still have
to do the eighty-five percent how much
of that is investment in how much is
cost investment means you build
something that lasts over time and how
much is just you know gone and this is
the main point with open dolphin you are
investing much more of your effort is an
investment in less cost because what you
build
there's over time you I technologies UI
toolkits coming
especially there's new versions all the
time and whenever you need to move
between these whenever you have to
change upgrade whatever if the amount of
work that you have to do there is very
limited if that is confined to a smaller
piece of your code then this is where
the costs go up with the investment is
what you have built before and since we
have this very high degree of decoupling
we just have a higher degree of of
investment if you ever have to migrate
you do it at the lowest possible costs
because you're only touching what needs
to be touched in nothing else and you do
not affect any other thing you do not
affect the business logic because you
it's even on different class paths when
I could be in a different module and the
view even more important you can
distinct he can be better than the Eric
competition you can lead the pack right
if you you can have visualizations that
fully exploit your client fertility you
can fully exploit your effects right for
example what we will see a little bit in
these examples that I'm going to show
you is you have instant updates between
all the various views even though the
views are totally decoupled no view
knows any other view very important
characteristic of an orphan no view
knows any other view not even indirectly
and there is no central intelligence
that knows all the views right like in
model-view-presenter patterns you have
that you have presenters that know all
the all the various views we don't have
that it's very easy to do multi user
applications multi-channel we will see
this in the in a few minutes in the in
the demos have integrate local devices
and do undo redo because we have very
strict management of value changes and
we know all the value changes we can
very easily to implement undo and redo
who has ever done undo redo in one of
its applications a few thank you
who would like to win if you would like
to do it is everybody yeah thank you
yeah this it is not so easy right but if
you have one single point where you can
say here all the value changes go
through here then it's easier to do it's
not only resetting a value it's
including selections and so on going
back in time
validation lazy loading so you can you
can add the same costs that you had
before just provide more to your customs
that's that's the thing so let's start
with a typical example of open coffin a
master teach help you so I go here this
is this is an example that comes with
open dolphin it's there's like I don't
know 25 or so examples in the in the
codebase and this is one of them you can
start them right away after you've
downloaded it called Gretel you start
push demo is that kind of visible from
break so what you see here is we call it
vehicles but you can assign any meaning
to it that you want could be a bacteria
I don't know they have position X Y
position they have a rotation angle and
they have a color and he has to master
views this is a table master view and a
map bus master view and a detail view on
top when I select in the detail view
there's a selection you see the
selection in the asourian the master
view here table view you see the
selection in the detailed view but
there's also a selection in the other
master view I can just as well use a
selection in the air you have to click
on it blue select here and this one
selected in the detail view and also in
the other master view right I can change
the value over here like Y position
would mean that it I'll set it to 0 it
will flow it up to the very top until
the server resets the values
some other value of their random values
that come from the server here so I
could just make it a zero the depth zero
and it floats up zero and it floats up
and the zero is also immediately visible
over here right so all the information
is always kept in sync automatically
without me doing anything it's all
opened often structure it's actually the
structure that does it and the most
important part here is they're all
sharing the same logic of curse yeah and
no view knows any other view
particularly these master this master
view doesn't know anything about that
master view and it doesn't know anything
about the detailed view when I click on
here the server-side logic the action
just sets the selected presentation
model to the blue one and the other
views react on this right but this one
here doesn't know anything not even
indirectly not even through a controller
knows any other view that means I can
evolve any view without affecting the
other ones I can even remove one or add
one without touching any other any other
view that's a particular benefit even in
the short term if not in the long term
that make sense
mustn't you help you okay and this
information is also a side information
line that you have okay that's typical
math and there are so many master detail
views would you wouldn't believe in an
in an enterprise application it's helped
view if you have tap pain is essentially
master detail view the the collection of
taps that you have is the master view
and the one that you select is your
detail its message he told you it's all
it's in many more places that you than
you initially think
so does work we send commands over the
wire and we send them in strict sequence
this is important breaths it it is if
you don't have that if you're sending if
client and server both can sense just
arbitrary data then you cannot have any
guarantees it is about giving guarantees
and how it works so asynchronous works
asynchronously is to be very efficient
but it's always in strict sequence to
give you the reliability we use a
presentation models which are very rich
they have lots of information in it what
was the original value what's the
current value is the dirty what should
be the label for that field if it is a
field is it enabled is it mandatory does
it have a help URL what is it valid
currently what what's the regular
expression that it should be validated
against syntactically now all that right
so that's very rich information and it's
generic you don't have to build a book
presentation model and an address
presentation model in an author
presentation model and so on you just
use presentation model
another important thing so here's some a
typical sequence of events that happens
when you use open dolphin on the left
hand side there is the view on the right
hand side controller then possibly
another server everything that is below
this land that's the water level that's
the sea level everything below is
handled by dolphins dolphins under the
sea level and it jumps out here and
there and and fetches your data so to
speak and what you do as an application
from camera is on top so let's let's go
through a possible lock in dialog right
you have to provide some action how
you'll handle the the login that's
that's logic in your application how do
I know whether with these credentials
he's allowed to come in or not
that's on the server-side actions as you
know it from
Oh struts or well if JSF for rails less
and all the technology is called that
actions and then you have a presentation
model here especially one for the let's
say the current use it gets a unique ID
it has a name and password and whether
it's currently locked in or not this
gets automatically transferred to the
server with the odd without you noticing
anything so it's below sea level here
and then on the client side what you do
you have login dialog with all the fancy
of job ethics or whatever you want to
have has a visualization technology now
when you enter and that's there's a
binding meant that you do you say like
this text field should be bound to this
attribute that we have in the
presentation model and it's actually be
directional binding here so we have the
fields but also things like when it's
locked in which is a boolean we can bind
this to the visibility property of that
dialogue and yep let's enter some some
name it gets automatically reflected
over here and it gets it automatically
transferred to the server asynchronously
without blocking the UI the user doesn't
even see that it has been central the
server has no idea that this has
happened but it's already on the server
now I give it a password same with the
password it gets reflected in the
presentation model and automatically
sent asynchronously to the server now
you have an action you're clicking on
the lock and button this goes to dolphin
dolphin dispatches it through the login
action and the login action now works on
the information right it reads from the
presentation model then does his logic
and may or may not set the locked-in
property to true or false let's say it's
true he is allowed to come in sets it to
true and automatically this is reflected
on the client-side and since this value
hashed has changed and it's bound to the
visibility property of the of the login
dialog
this can now go away that's the sequence
of events that's what happens all the
time there's nothing else what happens
into office yes but this happens all the
time so how is that encode how do I
create a presentation model well let's
say you do it on the client there's a
client presentation model that you can
draw from a factory can instantiate if
you want to bet better to use a factory
you give it a unique name and if you
want you can give it a type well these
are now hard-coded strings but you
typically draw it from a constant spool
when ya constants that you can share
between client and server if you want to
but it would even work without any
dependencies if you want you so just
think not hard-coded strings but it's
constants at this point so the current
user has a name of password and it
locked in property how to bind it here's
a three different ways of binding
binding is pretty rich it has this
fluent API thing and in here's the Java
version of it there's a bind method say
I would like to bind the name attribute
of the user presentation model to the
text property of the name text field
particularly if you have JavaFX that's
very nice and convenient to do you can
even bind things like if it's dirty only
if if any information is new in this in
this form then a certain button should
get enabled so I'm we're binding the
enabled property of a login button to
the dirty information of the user
presentation model only when the user
presentation model is dirty mates it
makes sense to even enable the button
and there's even there's the our options
for having additional if logic like you
would like to invert from true to false
you'd like to change formats you'd like
to validate come
validators is what you can directly put
in the binding this is what many
frameworks get wrong conversion
invalidation does not belong to the
model and this does not belong to the
view like in any many other frameworks
it belongs to the binding it is this
relation between the two that needs to
have conversion and validation I am
pretty proud that we have got this right
okay how do you send the command it's so
you're on the client side you're sending
you check the dolphin so Jim thanks Jim
was asking I should expand a little bit
on the on the conversion and validation
it's pretty obvious it is for the
conversion so you have like a text field
where you entered a date but in your
model it is a date where it is a string
on the UI right so you have kind of
converted from string to date or from
string to an integer or vice versa that
you do this in the binding is kind of
obvious right this is information that
needs to have both the information of
the model and where it should bind to
and different views may need different
conversions so that's kind of what most
people get right anyway in their
frameworks okay okay
but then if there's many frameworks that
try to include validation and where to
put the validation and in in many of the
homegrown frameworks that I've seen they
put the validation on the presentation
model and so they are mixing concerns of
their domain and the presentation in
that thing and they lose the ability of
having different validations depending
on how they display it right because
certain this place do not even allow
having having wrong dates if you have
date picker it cannot be a wrong they'll
always give your correct date right so
Nathan those hence testing for syntactic
things in for that view whereas if you
have a text you bind it against the text
you would like to have certainly lots of
meditation whether it's a correct date
that you can
convert into it so like with typical
modeling on on a database when you do
relational modeling you see that that
most developers get it right with their
entities but not so much with the
relations and this is the relation you
need to put it on the relations
information that that should be on the
relation really let's at least how we
model it and I've recently worked with
with a few other homegrown frameworks
from customers and some of them putting
this on the domain some of them putting
this in the view and both have problems
they never even considered putting it in
the binding because there is no binding
as an abstraction over there but you
have the we have the abstraction
therefore we can put it in thank you no
sending in command a command has a name
nothing else right
there's no parameters surprisingly you
cannot have parameters on the command
huh why that I mean it's very simple
because the server is in total knowledge
of everything that is relevant it just
looks up the presentation models right
there is no need to ever send any
parameter the server is in total
knowledge what's going on with the
client by the time that because we have
sequence guarantees by the time that
this command reaches the server all the
other value changes has already been
proliferated to the server now pretty
cool you wouldn't believe how important
that is good so on the server side how
do you read from the store well we do
have weak we can ask the server dolphin
which is the abstraction the facade that
we are using please give me the current
user and again you can draw this from a
from a constant if need be we typically
do this and once we have a user we can
ask give me the name now we haven't
supported attribute in our hands and we
can ask and for the value that's how I
do it pretty straightforward type safe
and especially if you're using constants
of again pretty easy how do you change
the value now on the server side we use
an extra method change value from the
user we get the attribute give it a new
value that's it
the server-side text automatically care
for for constructing a command and the
commander's is being transferred to the
client and climbed to the actual update
of the value and notifies the server
that he has done it and the reason is
for that that the client is the master
always client is master client is master
for every change that happens in the
system the client knows first and then
the service notified there's no such
thing that in in your sequence of time
that sometimes the server knows better
sometimes the client knows better no no
no no if you would allow this this would
be havoc now it is client is lemaster
and it's very important that this is the
case otherwise we couldn't give the
guarantees that we are giving we do have
nice instant updates now Etsy but all
this communication how's that on the
user interface doesn't that really block
the user interface isn't that kind of
Jacky or so no and here's an just an
example also comes with open dolphin in
the as part of the demos
as actually it's a down strip version
from what we have done for a sari now
that will draw should go to the bright
one right and when and start Kratz demo
demo
please select a portfolio so let's try
select this is master DW right this is
the master this is a detail no matter
how many tips I have over here this is
master and detail master DW same thing
and this over here doesn't know
everything about that on this on this
one right if I change the portfolio name
from balance to say almost balanced now
see what happens almost balanced while
I'm typing this is going to be updated
this is going to be updated and down
below here if you're very observant you
see the value change in the in the lux
going from balanced to almost balanced
hmm even though we issued value changes
for every keystroke not every keystroke
was transferred only when there was a
slight delay this is a special kind of
optimization that we now applied the
so-called blind command better with
folding so you can have commands that
wait that when they have finished have
an asynchronous on finished Handler and
others don't
so where you changes don't they don't
have an have an extra Hendra we call
this the blinds this blind once
fire-and-forget commands we call that
the blinds and if you have blinds you
can fold them up if you have a where you
change from A to B from B to C C to D
you only need the value chain from A to
D being on being sent to the client but
being central to server right so that we
fold them up you can choose whether you
want to have that feature the your
client connector hasn't has a command
better that you can set and this is
using the line command Petra with
folding it comes automatically
yeah okay thank you the question was how
could it possibly then update the with a
single keystroke TT now you see it it
goes back like one by one right all
three this value here and this value
here the title and this value here they
they all listen to two different
presentation models when this there's
different attributes actually these ones
are the same attribute that well it
could be different ones and they do have
a so-called qualifier and we know all
the presentation models and all the
attributes it's managed environment and
all the ones that have the same
qualifier are immediately updated on the
client even before the the command is
sent to the server there and the client
they're immediately updated instantly
and then the server's notified
asynchronously so everything that
happens happens immediately on your
client and some other client looking to
the same information may have a short
delay in seeing it they views have no
notion of each other so you have this
table view over here which binds against
a presentation model which is totally
different from that one right they have
no notion whatsoever that this other
view even exists they have no idea they
compiled separately if you want but this
is binding against the presentation
model which has an attribute and the
attribute has a qualifier of X and this
also has an it's not the same well it's
not the same instance but it has the
same prison and it has a presentation
model but also an attribute which just
happens to have a qualifier which is
also called X so typically you would
have a qualifier like user dot and then
some some unique user thing using unique
user ID also dot his first name and this
everybody who wants to display this
information should display the same
information immediately right that's
what you want to have by that way it's
kind of observer petaa on this model
store I am
that's managed environment I should say
good weight very same thing happens
sorry it's a question was sometimes I
don't want to see the update immediately
thank you we gonna show this in a minute
and it's a question of I answered the
question before and that is the question
of how you bind if you bind the value
change of your text field to the
presentation model then every change
will be proliferated but they'll be
propagated but if you're binding on a
button click on a form or so then you
can read them out and and set the values
so it's totally up it's up to the
application programmer how he just
binding okay and of course we'd like to
since it's almost been ur only almost
Bennis we'd like to add a Plus this plus
button doesn't know anything about the
list right because what the plus button
does is it asks the server please give
me a new presentation model of this type
it adds a new one of this type with name
changed me and the this list is just
displaying all of all of those types
when they come in right it's model store
listener
whenever there's and you want to just
display it observable list behind in
JavaFX right in the back
it's really cool I if I add new controls
like here this is not even touched I do
not have to touch this code if I even
remove this list from the UI I do not
have to touch any of those buttons it's
pretty cool you should think about
whether how that works when you do your
normal UI font
this is s/s much decoupled as you can
possibly be so and of course I could
just change the value here make this
canoe buy some shares and then in this
view of course the the visualization as
a pie chart has nothing to do with the
other one where you already got the
story is this the totally independent
even if I change this value yeah I
should give her should give it a number
really 100 I of course I want to have
lots of canoes yes yeah set it up so
many canoe Shias and the pie chart has
no idea about this presentation model
over here they it's only it just happens
that the ones that he is using is having
attributes that have the same qualifier
totally different ones you can plug and
play at new ones change ones to your
liking coupling is as far as you can
possibly have it and here's another one
the we have we have seen the the total
maybe is the the total down below and he
is the total which is also displayed
over here and the total that was a
customer requirement the total should be
calculated on the server side its
application specific how we sum up
values what's their requirement okay
it's kind of new to me they they have
they owned arithmetic anyway
so that's that it's it's a bank so they
yeah they have that so they made they
made you some 199 and ends and have the
additional one for themselves or some of
the spare one
so that actually goes to the server
right and they just bind against it and
if I do say now it's fixed I'm fixed
with my modeling of my portfolio you
cannot change it anymore and how's that
working this checkbox knows nothing
nothing at all about the other
visualizations they just happen to bind
their enable state against the fixed
attribute of that presentation or that
they are displaying and by the way of
course then fixed is also true over here
well that's structuring your UI with
presentation models right that's the
benefit that you get from there it's not
that that's what we build upon in the
open dolphin they could share the Elks
Aria the question was whether they could
share the presentation modes yes they
can you can bind multiple use against
the same presentation or the same
attribute you can do that even for the
sources if you want to with Susan sauce
there which is not possible with JavaFX
JavaFX we'll throw in the exception if
you try we support that I would say it's
not the best engineering practice to do
that and if you don't need to do that we
should rather be distinct in your in
your presentations we usually say we
have we are using view specific
presentation models if you have
different view most likely you want to
have a slightly different version of you
of that presentation model with only a
subset of what would be available as
properties and so on well thank you for
the question yeah that's that's
important of course there we go
it's very easy to have the exact same
application running with multiple UI
toolkits this is one will swing and with
JavaFX and this makes a very good choice
makes Open Graph a very good choice if
you're intending to migrate from swing
to Java ethics first make a clear
distinction
what is view and what is logic if you
assign controllers put them apart and
then on the exchanges view that's that's
our approach to doing that will seal a
bit more of that in a minute you can
have multiple clients connecting to the
same information I mean it's all on the
sovereign rights easy easy to change but
also over various channels and now I
will go a little bit into our multiple
channel I'll first like to show you a
multi-user setting multi-user setting
requires a server that will the server
runs that let me quickly look into
several this happens to be Grails I'll
start the server it is the standard Java
Enterprise thing this is now spring
really but it could be Java EE whatever
whatever have you is it's a simple soft
let being already what you need is to
surf that engine nothing else if you
want
so server's running now on the client
side I start this yet chapel demo it is
give you and the velocity indicator and
you can change the velocity so here's
one and I'll start a second one to show
you a second client so the same
application to clients and their share
information you can have cross client
updates and loss cross client
information so I'm changing the I'm not
putting my on my on the gas pedal put my
foot on there so I'm starting
and the other one changes as well right
this is in a separate VM this is one
client we M this is one client we M and
then sue server p.m. and it's so fast
right and as if you now look into the
logs nothing happens nothing happens on
the logs
there is no polling at every second or
so over every hundred milliseconds no
but still take this one immediate update
huh that's pretty cool and I can do this
with really many they say what what kind
of protocol is that and that is
high-speed protocol is that's a new
speedy from Google or is that DEP
sockets also HTTP POST
huh how cool is that goes through every
firewall through every proxy works in
every environment whereas the the
transport is really pluggable and you
could easily have WebSockets if you want
to good so that's much multi-client now
we go into multi-channel and what I'd
like to show to you is is an application
that is JavaFX application mm-hmm let's
go over here this one oh here's third
JavaFX application this application runs
in Basel Switzerland
this is Basel Switzerland what you see
here it comes from Basel Switzerland
over the Wi-Fi here right it is showing
some information about people that work
at Canal X power engineers were actually
yep and I can go over here and say well
jerker Nick
is he a contractor is he available no
sorry he's not available save it hmm
that's the kind of the application here
now we're gonna explore a second channel
the web Channel show the very same
information on the weapon just going to
reload it here just just be sure so
there's also a JavaScript version of
this the kunuk is he a contractor he's
the contractor may be making contractor
click on this so we'll make sort of a
first step to selection workload I guess
he has a little bit higher workload if
I'm not mistaken so and then save it now
I'll save this in the web this is
browser this is Safari right and you'll
see it over here in the in the JavaFX
view ways that then workload over here
this one this one will change as soon as
I click the button here but this goes
over basel switzerland goes from here
basel switzerland
back right let's open - over the web and
now I will ask my manager
I'm stigmata from canoe and give him the
iPad you know managers give the iPad an
ayah you see the Android tablet here but
my manager will use the iPad and I will
ask him to promote me right so so please
yeah and then pump up my subway of
course so please you can you can on the
iPad select the one out I will try to
start the to stop the Android version of
it and show you this why are the the
photobooth here's here's a photobooth
and this is a native Android version of
that very same thing mm-hmm okay and
then
and stick are you ready
take some time I paid a super typically
slow please make me architect that would
be nice
architect you grant it okay let's see
now here is architect over here is
architect and if you look here I'm not
quite sure over there you can see that
no it's architect on the not visible and
it's it's not right but I could give it
a round and talk would you like to have
it oh this this is now yeah you you know
see noon come yep so you're good so you
can you can play around with it years on
the web that HTML faces JavaScript lined
right and on the end wide one this is
packaged as I guess they use a phone
kept or so though the wasn't original
they took the html5 blinded pictures it
natively and installed it on the on the
Android can do the very same on on iPad
of course yep so that that's the story
of multi-channel right so we can have
your humane application in JavaFX
on the desktop where people do that work
and they need the highest possible
fidelity on the client right but you
still can have your field engineer with
this Android phone going out and
changing data or get getting directions
but typically much less interaction
heavy what they're doing and you can
still have your manager having the
dashboard on the iPad and they're
sharing not only data they are not
sharing only data they are sharing the
exact same information as exact same
application they're sharing the
application logic thanks a lot
so on the server that's the story right
you write your application once
including workflow and so on right
only the visualization how you displayed
is is different so here we go
so thanks for returning the gadgets that
is good so that that was it for that I
have many many many other demos there
there's my lazy loading and so on if
there's more time so this is this is
really like the life update that you can
have it even worse we had this we had
the questions before when somebody else
is currently updating you wouldn't want
to interfere with him well this is
exactly the story that we have seen in
this application where you have the
extra save button that but this
screenshot shows an application where
this actually happens real time for
every where you change so you have it in
the browser and some other browser is
immediately displaying the same
information so cross application on the
same channel while the kind of made-up
iPad
sorry iPhone version of it also is
displaying every keystroke and works
pretty nice distributed life update so
when to use opened often I I like to say
every time when clean is better if you
don't care if you say well the very
short lived thing and whether it's dirty
or clean I don't care then you may not
think about opened often but if you if
you're committed to good UI engineering
it is it is worth a look you get a very
low coupling I would say the lowest
possible coupling that you can have it
very well fits into this build test
maintain extend cycle application
application life cycle because
everything is so nicely separated it's
that is important especially testing you
can test against your presentation
models you can as one of our customers
as you can test the UI without UI
because your testing against the
presentation models and your threat safe
this is big you cannot possibly get the
threading wrong because you have no say
we do the threading for you we make sure
whenever something happens in this with
a client whorfin everything that you do
every unfinished Handler every action
that you do on the client side happens
on the UI thread guaranteed but
everything that has application logic
happens outside the UI thread guaranteed
and it doesn't interfere with any other
thread right it's sequence guarantee you
cannot do it wrong and if you believe
that you have made up your mind this is
the technology which is winning and
there will be no other UI technology in
the future then go for it and program
directly against it if you would like to
hedge your bets and say well there may
be changes or even the even the version
may change and I have to update my views
and so the futures open if that is your
stance then it's very good to use open
coffin or here if you'll find more
information that is me at the top and my
Twitter handle
then there's open dolphin Twitter handle
opto fan orc it's all open
Pecha to license open source available
on github if you'd like to contribute
please do if you have any questions
remarks whatever there's mailing list
there's they have been the first
postings on stack on Stack Overflow
lately you can also do that and it's
available from maven central you can
just draw it in there's a dependency if
you want to that's that's it
so times almost up we do you are
engineering and we like to do it so if
you have any questions about it that
it's most welcome any more questions
about open door fingers please
yep so question was encrypted
connections you can choose your protocol
actually the the one that we have seen
is a URL protocol you can use any URL
protocol you have there if you use HTTP
it's automatically almost CIA safe or I
guess and yes yep so the that's question
is more about performance on the on the
wire which is a mess question of
throughput and latency so for we have
very low throughput demands on an open
coffin because we are only sending every
now and then when the users can is
concerned with other things we are
behind the scenes we are sending small
packets the end the whole idea is
sending small packets we try to always
get into one tcp/ip packet because
that's the the fastest one that you can
get through every router you are the
first one to be dispatched right so very
low bandwidth demands sometimes when you
have like synchronous actions you would
like to wait for so yeah you have a
button that when you click it you
immediately disable it and you wait for
the response before you re-enable it so
it's kind of an having a synchronous
behavior on it you want to have that as
fast as possible right we try our very
best to be as fast as possible in that
scenario by sending the smallest bit of
information think about the sending the
command sending the command is only
sending the command name really it's
like a ping to your server nothing can
be possibly faster than the pink so
that's what we try to achieve and and
you have seen the effects it looks like
almost no latency and and we have a
number of optimizations one is this
command batching we try to when there's
a number of commands that happen very
quickly on the client side we don't send
one one one one one command we batch
them up and send them at once as long as
they are not overly long so we kind of
cut them when they
gets along that's kind of optimization
which is now in open dolphin ordered 8 I
wanted to wait my plan was to wait with
these optimizations for after 1.0 and
have 1 of 0 earlier but it just happened
that our clients demanded this
production support if you want say we
cannot do without it and please do this
and so the other efforts got a little
bit deferred efforts on the
documentation for example and yeah
that's that's the current state I'd I
would say we have a really good story on
that one it's difficult to think about a
more performant solution on the web I
just as a personal note this month I am
now 25 years in professional business so
I exactly started the professional
software development 25 25 years ago in
September 88 at at IBM and ever since
I'm doing client-server computing
there's a silver anniversary yeah thank
you so you cannot help but learn
something along the way
thanks a lot for coming I'll be
available through the whole week
whenever you're something just just
please approach me and please fill out
the the survey results if you liked this
session otherwise thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
