a very festive live session
I'm your host Javed Muhammad and we're
very pleased to have with us a first
guest for dev life for Vaes say it
Mohammad who is not a relative we just
have the same last name and I'm meeting
him the very first time
so Perez welcome to dev lives yeah nice
meeting you
so first time in Moscow yes yeah I just
love the space uh-huh
what are your impressions over what have
you seen so far so I did visit the Metro
really efficient you know being a I was
just amazed
it's almost blows me away and then I was
inside the Kremlin and right in front of
Putin's office it was very interesting
very interesting is just a walk around
and you didn't leave LA to me right not
yet not yet maybe I'll go make another
visit okay all right yeah so you have a
session today at code Moscow this
afternoon can you share with us a little
bit about what that's about
yeah so let me quickly introduce myself
I'm the principal product manager for
MCS mgss Oracle mobile cloud service so
today is just going to be an
introduction of MCS we are just going to
walk through all the different
interesting features inside MCS I'm just
going to point out a few things that you
can do that makes mobile programming
really efficient and if any touch I mean
you don't go into all the details but
can you give us a few highlights so what
are some of the key features of mobile
cloud service so you know we have a
unique you know feature called the X
plus AP ice since that again Express API
Express API so we are going to talk
about that I'm just going to go do a
quick demo on how you can build an API
using a JSON data packet and basically
using that you can just you know
automate everything and build an API in
a few seconds then I have another demo
which kind of is a connector which goes
Greg grabs data from sales cloud so
those are interesting things and I also
will be talking a little bit about chat
BOTS
the API is on that side great so talk to
us a little bit about chatbots it seems
like there's an older age perhaps just
for the benefit of our viewers what is
the chat but again it seems like it's
conversation with the Machine a
computer's in white text-based voice
place I mean what how do you view it so
it's a new way to go interact with data
so it's always you know we started off
with you know having a console and we
used to type in you know dar slash
whatever right to figure out you know
what's inside the files in a folder now
you went in and then you move to a GUI
interface with Windows and then you move
on to more of a mobile kind of GUI
interfaces which are pretty much you
know the rage right everyone uses mobile
apps now now it's smooth going a little
bit further than that you know people
are going to go and say okay you know do
I really need to install all these apps
how do I kind of you know get the
information that I want really quick you
know so to do things like that you know
you can use something like whatsapp or
messenger and go grab some data from a
data source right so that's the tectonic
shift that's happening with mobile you
know interfaces right so chatbot is a
way of using you know predominantly any
kind of channels we are starting off
with Facebook Messenger and going and
getting data from an intelligence source
which is going to curate the data that
you need and give it to you in the
format that you request so in effect you
can ask you can have a finance bot right
and you can say you can have a a
financial bot a sense robot right and
you can say okay what is the stock price
of Microsoft right and the bot could go
back and give you an idea of give you
some information about the stock price
and then you can even ask it didn't
something very interesting you know do
you think I should short Microsoft right
and then based on the Preferences that
you've already said based on what you do
in your financial accounts you know the
bot might come up with something
interesting you know so that almost
sounds like to me like
with the iPhone it city city a chatbot
city is a conversational way of getting
data but I don't think they have all the
features that makes it really you know
as interesting as the Oracle chat bot
okay so let's talk about Oracle chat bot
what does that offer and is all right so
building chat boxes it's an interest is
a process right but what we've done is
we have kind of you know made it really
simple to build a chat bot you know
there is a there's an instant
recognition engine machine learning in
the backend so the the actual chat bot
builder does not need to worry about all
those things he can just use a GUI
interface to go pick the right you know
the click and train the models right and
he can do that within 5-10 minutes and
make something that's really useful so
people want to learn more about the
mobile cloud service or about building
chat BOTS you have any suggestions of
where people can go to actually yeah
check it out
absolutely so there are tons of videos
on YouTube on mobile cloud service and
you can also visit our website you can
just search for Oracle mobile cloud
service and you'll come into a lot of
documentation and interesting
information about MCs great and they can
probably tried can they try it out in as
a part of the Oracle cloud trial also
yes they can they can yeah so it's part
of the Oracle trial and you can you can
request trial and you sense here okay
well Purvis thank you so much for coming
I know you have your presentation later
this afternoon do you know what time it
is
I think it's 1:30 but that's not too far
away right after lunch I think I think
yeah so you're just trying to keep
myself awake okay all right then well
enjoy lunch and thank you for joining us
thank you thanks thank you and thanks
for tuning in and stay tuned for more
dev live sessions just this afternoon
from Oracle code Moscow thank you thank
you
