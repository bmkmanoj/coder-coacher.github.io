is the Python American Idol I've session
let's welcome to say if you just want to
use room for some their space
I'm gonna make a quick start as you'll
see obviously if have a fair amount of
contact to go through standard Oracle
site harvest I went Python open source
the area I work in is all open source
no no timelines so I don't make any
purchasing decisions based on anything
that I do say so my name is crystal
Jones I spent at home reviews an article
I worked out of our world headquarters
in Silicon Valley for nearly 10 years
I've now now returned back to Australia
so it's about before in body time for me
of month but I've worked a long time
that I've been source I worked on
upstream PHP PHP Oracle database drivers
I worked out of Linux crew they were
doing things like the dtrace support
things like that so I kind of you know
definitely been a source space for a
long time I've moved into the Oracle
database group and I have a broadened
focus I've looked after a lot more
database access than P is sorry for the
Australian aid phase and the eyes I hope
I'm saying that so I look after things
such as Python PHP node.js I'll give me
a note is talk later today I also have
some some sign responsibilities for
things like sequel net layer they are
all net layout and that comes out of my
team as well
and sequel plastic could also capacitor
effect I used to work on super possible
that was back in the past so just a
quick kind of refresher what they divert
does the why different works out those
things on the raid on the blue all the
database access API is from a JDBC in
things I look after mostly is from blue
bits and pieces and then do some of the
A's and we're the open source community
for some of the other drivers down there
you can see we support over a bunch of
many traces languages supported me it
works so today for quick areas that
that's going to talk about just a little
bit about this CX powerful driver then a
little bit of a refresher for the six
Oracle version 5 and then obviously six
and then go to some more advanced tips
and tricks for people who really do want
to get their phone gas so so who is
using CX Oracle database access layer
this who's using Python at the moment
took up more Python people perhaps there
fantastic that's good to see
and then so what does everybody else
using are you doing other languages or
not maybe developers okay so CHR is the
package which gives access as you can
see on the screen to all the features in
the Oracle database began as a third
party project it's now under the Oracle
of umbrella has open source license and
we
recent release it has most of the
features of the DB i spec from Python
couple of excursions and they have a lot
of extensions there the overall
architecture this does kind of confuse
people who aren't used to it we still in
this space all other sort of drivers the
C language drivers Python though in PHP
they all sit on top of a horrible client
libraries so I need to get those article
libraries on your machine somewhere and
then obviously a Python speaking up to
you users reading the scripts pulling
down into the CX our play API and those
client libraries of the things which are
responsible if I'm talking through to
our database so told us as I have there
this is your cloud but I have two clouds
like this is my cloud slide 4 divided
against the advice on premise necklace
so easiest way to get those client
libraries is the artistic climb having
benefits of having a client library
there is like completely well tested
static everybody uses it our internal
tools tools user testing groups test it
I'm used for a whole bunch of high
availability features connection
management features caching network
traffic support network encryption is
anybody enable network encryption with
the oracle net layer so you know
traditionally it's not part of the
drivers that's not part of CX article
but it's just the lab beneath so you
have it available through sex horrible
as well
talk about that my time nowadays we have
these pre-built libraries young
desirable for anybody using our politics
has some binaries out there which
everything is whatever the package
manager oh I'm sorry I do have one more
little bit of cloud there just a couple
of URLs if you're interested in there
it's a client zip install zip it's our
exhibit install unzip to install or you
can get RPMs on various like our client
today I think that's it that's the intro
everybody's here let's go straight at
the five so five point two there's a
little bit of a gap between a flat point
to a 5.3 5.2 came out in 2015
powerful began contributing code into
into a five point two that was also the
first foray into the Python space and
then then we hired Anthony and Anthony
to an English is the creator maintainer
of the OCS CX article interface
so we had this huge release in 2017 this
I'd be like 1 less than one year no or
just on the one year ago so had a huge
bunch of features on cover some of those
today some of them of course I won't
have time for this talk was actually
with this presentation is really
designed for an hour tour and I should
have said actually at the front is my
colleague Ann blame Carter who's talked
earlier today he's talking about some
Python stuff with the artboards io ug
collaborate conference in a couple of
weeks is doing hands-on lab on python
and doing a session as well
one week so you know this is subjective
inspiration of that 12 apologies contact
me if you want more information things
like things actually I'm sorry I don't
get time to cover today so a radio right
yes I'm jumping right in here for people
who don't know what's going on normally
you can execute a statement you can
execute a sequel of deal single
statement and get the results back
that's fine but you're sending across
your inserts of tens of thousands of
records and ten records executing that
statement that's generally another
fission so we recommend using this
execute meaning make it we've just been
there for a while which is why it's not
on the slide I'm speaking about the new
features the key thing with optimizing
the client Python to database
performance is reducing network
round-trips reducing that the calls we
interrupts on the database and the
database server has to wake up has to do
some work for you can't do work for
anybody else as a sent messages back so
execute many reduces those round-trip
significantly so example of DML
obviously an insert update we merge and
this extra feature which is added here
at 5.2 lets you work out exactly how
many rows were affected by each of the
data values which have passed you which
I'm going to show the next slides that I
go to
need to set up the scenario a little bit
pretty much basic parent-child
relationship don't really care about the
data for this example but effective
you've got a client IDs and parent ideas
so here we have the execute medical so
now you can actually see it in action
sort of passing in at the top there you
can see parent IDs don't wait so passing
in three values so thankfully we were
executing that at least Nathan three
times with three different values 30 20
30 and 50 if I can read my little font
here with this extra new option for
those who we've reused there to get many
radium our accounts true you can
actually get back the values which were
deleted for each of those IDs here I've
obviously got some kind of fake data
assumingly
that I had three rows which had parent
idea quite two you get this so one
little extra flag you can add you can
actually then power your apps and
understand that what's going on when
you're Dana gets transferred to the
database
that chair is another little option
there to the execute many is that if
you're trying to insert 10,000 rows what
happens if one of those rows there's a
doing value what happens if it has a
string - must be a number you know
10,000 rows inserted 10,000 roles
relative back whoops not so useful quite
often you just want to insert everything
you can maybe you can fix up at one or
maybe don't care if you're doing some
data ingestion for log analysis or
something just do best effort the
various solution lets you actually solve
that problem
let's you return an individual error for
an individual dirty set of data and
while making the other pieces of data be
inserted correctly so here's the example
you can see up there in red I've got a
couple of Jupiter keys one where the
parent doesn't exist that is an insert
there on line 9 just a straight insert
into the child table and you can see
here it didn't pointed out before but
you've got three bind variables and if
you look at the array of data to insert
three columns so I'm going to execute
that insert for each of those records
there each of those 1060 and ten red
will be bound to those three buying
rooms and we always use bind variables
why do we use mind variables for
performance because it means you've only
got one sequel string so that only has
to be passed once for different data
values use it for security because
there's no data embedded with the
statement they during the statement go
across to the database separately very
very important I just sort of taught
before sequel injection issues about 40
per 6 percent or something of security
problems use blind variables so anyway
back to back areas as you were reading
ahead there I'm sure and I'm sorry I
should've passed water there we're gonna
get an array back of errors so for each
of those that we got two errors there
one duplicate key one parent is not
existing it two burners back that we
couldn't process and there's a offset
there which is a zero-based offset
a little hard with the numbering up
there but you can see that Brown set to
is the third day that I do down there
when I 18 we have got that the college
chicken turkey so this is really useful
you're going to do inserts large
families I don't know the data set that
Anthony told me a couple of days back in
terms of performance but I know it's
afternoons talk I'm going to talk about
execute menu in the context of nodejs
and the other graph is performance is
way up versus just a sound effect to do
so excute menu really is very variable
and this kind of extra feature makes it
even more useful to how much by the 5.2
enhancements rich which I really don't
have a lot of time to get into 32
kilobyte varchars and drawers you know
now that we don't just have to fork a
limit on data and we started to see
obviously people putting pressure on us
for more my good examples of how to work
with Bob's and my Bob's really efficient
as well if you want to get into that
space you need more than 32
it's coming up later and you're a small
features here small features it has
always been a always better at going
forward Python 3 obviously introduces
Unicode by default somebody using Python
3 I guess they're in a few people
anybody's still using Python 2 7 oh yeah
I'm kind of still stuck a little bit
back but I know they're pushing really
hard to everybody so it's straight into
the 5.3 features so I can get into those
really nice man speakers finding named
objects so there was support for query
remaining objects you know things like a
special data objects you could query in
all versions of CX sorrowful now you can
actually find them so you can take a
data value and find a free insert or
fetching out of the database I'll just
mention point - and it was sure see like
I did indeed mapping straight into
Python objects as well see effect or you
can just deal with Python objects in the
Python code find it into Oracle and
Oracle PL sequel or the sequel just be
dealing directly with the Oracle object
in the backend so you don't have to do
any data mapping you don't have to
ah sequel functionality okay let's have
a look at one simple example so this is
the SDO special objects are pre supplied
object it has some sub objects there if
you look down on the lines you know 11
12 13 some other horrible pipes down
there I'm not going to go into great
details on all of those but let's look
at straight example so we have this new
get type method so we have to actually
do make it clear to the database object
database work out what that sto geometry
looks like so then we can do it totally
in Seattle can reduce internal data
representation to match that we do get
type 3 times because I mentioned that
there's other subtypes and then we just
create a new object there I'm using the
object directly or you need to use a
type object with the brackets and then
set something up
extended an array or two separate of a
plaintiff values directivity of the 2003
and the very bottom insert and I've just
doing a straight line into the table sto
title so that makes it really very
simple
and I saw a great demo from our spatial
team recently and I think there's some
talk with this conference a lot of
Python happening in a special world and
very they were very excited steam very
excited look like justice Felix article
for some reason and demonstrations of
putting Python safes are or plugins into
the data visualization tools of an
article holding a lot of the other
things which I played not aware ups and
literally in that station space the
other Python libraries third-party
Python libraries to deal with special
functionality integrating that with our
most fantastic special functionality in
the database
sorry I was excited by that
so they'll circle up collections and
records were kind of fleshing animal
support here and index apply tables and
Records again we're using the sort of
get type functionality sorry you have to
be able 12:1 who's this not on 12
database sorry to be negative I know you
don't want to get them in Europe your
company hasn't quite got here to that
stage yet because anybody's still using
a like an 11 or 10 or something like
that some obviously I mean yeah a lot of
people using multiple ones so everybody
is on twelve point two point zero point
one latest patch set security level okay
I'll take that as given or you're using
cloud with a teensy right so regret
gradually animal is functionality into
the drivers as it comes out of the
database so here we have any
user-defined type use of T so this is
just something we've created it's a
procedure which has an indexed by time
what we would need to pass out in
passing out sorry as I
so
cool proper people not familiar with
Python doubles everything before far
behind three it is calls a procedure and
we binding he's gonna fantastic a random
color syntax or Python that's what they
don't try to say that commerce their
first possibly the value there and we
can iterate over that opened when it
comes out so we now have an object and
we can just be right and prepared the
boat around
and if you want to print out the assless
ass list is just convinced
representation to the Python list then
you can use it in Python as any normal
at least
so I know some talks today have been
pure marketing some talks about being
pure demonstrations I'm trying to fit
somewhere in the middle hopefully you
know giving you a little taste and
actually understanding what's going on
without you watching me fail this as
demos final finding PL sequel records
very similar yeah this is the set up
again with the L single side package
user type record in this case and we're
going to pass it in and out and there's
the method at the bottom does some magic
just slide we're examples of them want
to find the dynastar so let's see what's
going on
so even Python code can use this get
type kind of works everywhere that you
object we saw that before no surprises
and then we just set those attributes of
that object now has these attributes
which correspond to the attributes that
we created in the PLC cool side of the
database I just said those directly and
possibly even then in this case pass
them back out again as well as I have
changed all the way out according to
that procedure which I couldn't feed oh
that's projectors like the optiflame
trust me
okay implicit results
so if this what results are a way of
getting query results as out of the
database without you having to do any of
that finding they're very easy to use in
any sense I've got to pass those
parameters there's a special syntax last
year the next slide
Elena's a obviously a piece of Python
and
piece of Python to get their results out
so here I'm calling at a lot of us
blocks are not using a snow procedure
but you understand it's the same and
there's a new DBMS sequel package I can
just return the results I'm returning
the result of that curseth a query back
into the Python land and then get
implicit results call on line 14 just
iterates over each of those single
statements and then I'm going to get
printed out of the bottom in fact this
would probably be one talk about what
because it's it's all one pretty we've
done with one but I'm renegade results
page of those queries and they those
queries as you can see they have
different shape different kinds of
columns things like that
so scrolling curses has anybody used
scrollable curses in any sense we have a
lot of interest in this when we talked
about it there are big powerful open
world conference so curses as you know
know the query result sets you select
you select a to get more better get more
data and then if you in your application
need to buffer it you've got a buffer it
so you can go backwards when somebody
just I want to page back to X or
something like that
scroll up spelled with curses away where
Oracle does that for you there's still
buffering somebody still has to allocate
the memory and hold on around until you
decide that you're finished with it but
we do that for you so the pros and cons
to that use it as you will and it's
paradise
so when you're creating the cursor in
the example as we sort of cursor method
just gives you the panel that reviews or
to execute statements you just said this
do scrollable activity true and there's
a scrollable so a few examples here
probably too many examples but you can
see scroll a lot of people's true at the
top and just execute the query and then
I have various modes that I can send you
to say which record I want back from
that dataset
I want the last one first one but I want
to get absolute position number they're
backwards of the minus four for what
down at the bottom on line eleven and if
we follow along and you remember from
the dataset they effectively were just
going backwards and forwards across the
row last very first very
so it's it's kind of kind of
that's something you would use in apps
yeah use it love it sell it great
okay a few now that really big
interesting topic and I spent with our
advanced queueing team last week just
last week I wish which time zone they're
fired up to extend their functionality
even more and expose it more through all
of the database drive access layers but
there's some pretty good stuff here
already so anybody doing micro services
IQ has a role they could use there it's
a queuing producer/consumer you put
something in a queue you pull something
out from the queue anarchical has a lot
of functionality am i going into about
when you get the first one out with a
message to stay enough people than that
so other people can look at them expiry
times era had like things like that but
for the Python point of view which is
what we're here to talk about today you
and to set it up we're going to create
an object we're going to be passing this
object backwards and forwards you create
the queue so pulling some feel sequel
obviously nothing to do with Python
there at that stage create a queues and
this is set up in the database and
there's no cures across racks and all
sorts of things and we start that
connection
so in Co terrible use that magic get
tight we seen that before yeah what is
that time yeah what does it look like in
the database point of view and then we
need to set some on key options and
message properties now what do you have
an example of that later but on key
options include those things I mentioned
like whether the buffer messages with a
commit needs to occur things like the
head attribute include things like the
number of attempts and delays and
exploration policies and things like
that so you get a create a book
and you object at that type nudity book
title sticks and major in your favorite
books this year and then we could just
call this on cue function down here now
this may change if we start adding
things like a ray take you and things
like that we may need to change this API
a little bit you come to its one will
still be around
so message has been sent off into these
that we had a little bit of print debug
statement where and then the other
somebody else somewhere else another
process another one of micro-services
something like that can be listening for
those so they also need to know what a
UDT book looks like they set up their
options and this is where I said some of
those options that get the first message
don't wait if there is is nothing to
listen to don't hand out block just
return an empty
and we just DG we just look and pull out
those books and obviously as you know
we're going to get the site books back
some of this is like easy you know just
you could just do this in a sleep and
yeah we try and make this easy for you
if you look at IQ there are lots of
options you're trying to abstract out
into the database access layers and it's
important for you to tell us which bit
is too abstract
so you know make sure you have a
dialogue with us right there on do
terrible places like that cards if you
want to send me email about the things
you are doing what you're trying to do
where you're trying to take the
businesses come and have a discussion of
us about the things that you need in
these languages so I see a telecoil 5-3
had a whole bunch of other stuff I
mentioned as a result sets Edition base
redefinition people know that for being
up have multiple versions of your secret
blocks in the database at the same time
and run time decide which one of those
blocks to use the same signatures worth
looking up times actually God I'm trying
to get through lets you verify the
successful frayed year or a comedic
there was a failure in the middle so
people don't have to duplicate commits
more money twice my bank account of
things
that to get a kind of subject or logical
transaction I do you can call back to
that at ice to say hey have you have we
seen this before did it actually make
the owner based on never obviously but
things that were covered then we call
back
yeah dedication lifetime job right about
I guess yourself oh six okay
what do you don't know so almost 2,000
subjects are literally less than in
Europe but if you look at it seems to be
fewer changes than in that flat points
for the noise I'll get into that in a
minute the big one is that Python wheels
sir
how do we do that we refactor the code
base underneath and we introduced a
layer which we call low dpi C which we
retrofitted to being data based
programming interface and that is a
slayer C code these drives like I kind
of look after C drives and we now use
that API see in the know DARPA baby
driver pythons a horrible driver
the third party person who looks after
the Ruby gi8 there's also got a second
implementation coming along using OTP I
see there's a go implementation as a
Haskell implementation or based on this
voted Class C so we kind of targeted at
tribal as the important thing of course
is that the six Uncle Hank you know it
hasn't changed
so we've stuck in there if you look at
that diagram that one really just stuck
in that little extra one way only PRC
and you don't need to know about that
you're just calling that
so a little bit of a sidebar here it's
really this this layer is really aimed
at third base driver maintainers but it
is out there a github open source you
can use it if you want have your write
up see applications
feel free today
the kind of key install things that it
does is that it compiles without needing
any are pedophiles or anything like that
so it kind of makes it easy to deploy
distribute and because it uses DL open
at one time for these it dynamically
looks for all the libraries it doesn't
need to have knowledge of those and Parv
into it it's a one binary in this guy's
one Python binary if you install it and
run with different versions powerful
client libraries so if you install
different instant clients it'll pick up
whatever you've got in your library path
and that's the key trigger
that for our wheels we notice to be one
wheel and it works with whichever
version of the Oracle client library 11
to always that you have installed so
that's the major thing
because let dl open you'd now do need to
send your laundry session there's no way
around you have to set that it was a
little trick there in flight by three
and some platforms we were able told
about a pretty decent lookups sorry
that's not possible it has changed but
the benefit beyond to give you wheels
out why is that
just apologize for its me so you can
just run its Python - a install and away
you go
okay so shadowed B DB so who's using RAC
a possession clustering who's using
shadow databases lightest greatest so
you know we now have shot at done
devices that can be split across
multiple instances and powerful handles
that
so David last year we added the API into
who see examples temporary logs so if
you're passing lobs into PL sequel
binding I mean how do you pray that love
to be able to pass it in
a few tweaks last when I see somebody
was asking questions somebody got
involved with the project was like I
couldn't do this particular code block
need to support the DVI is standard so
Anthony's had eventual support of their
form
close the connection when the context
complex patterns
to
okay thoughts types of tricks I got a
few minutes ago it's a slide since the
editor
I spoke about round trips trying to
reduce traffic between six articles and
the database minimize that array size is
the way you do that for queers so you
may have seen this in sequel Plus
anybody's still using sequel plus it may
still see that and obviously lots of
other tools to do things they either
call it prefetch unit like all that are
a fetching expecting the same thing
there's some batching up data comes
across with everything to say give me
one row some way I'm actually sending
back ten rows in case until you
need the optimized me back web traffic
buying variables passively but before do
I need to ask you about that again you
don't need to get without who's buying
workers do not use string concatenation
and build up sequel statements accepting
very well as the five cases where they
have your own hard coded sequel in your
the hard coding the hard currency will
be never don't take sequel from users
and hard coded don't take data values
from users in the hard code better
execute many spoke about that before
tick you've got that in your to listener
toolbox now session pooling I don't have
any particular slides on but that's
certainly a big win so you want to set
up a pool of connections in CF syrup all
available for fast use especially doing
like a micro service versus people are
hammering your service you want to be
going to the database the connection you
might have a process to start out use it
finish with a way for the process to die
you want that pool of connection it's
ready to go so you're doing ten ten
things at a time if you're posting
connections
and if you're running mid tears Python
on multiple mid tears or PHP Python or
any of these languages jwc you can also
set up a kind of pooling in the database
called database resident connection
pooling and that lets the database side
resources be shared across whoever is
using them at that particular time that
has some advantages is this so I don't
have any other to kill slides on that
this is just a general tip and trick
thank you look it up ask me questions
later
okay some real big tips sub-classing
connections and you can do this because
as well so we have some ones in place
classes the cell phone connection cell
phone cursor
and then you can
so that Python to do your utmost desire
so in this case we are creating a new
caste class which is based on that
superclass they pre supplied class
Philip down there like five we're
calling back to that super person at the
parent class this time we're passing in
that database service named Anthony
chose that a long time back but
basically your connection straight to
the database and so basically hard
coding which database this application
connect
and kind of extending that then we can
also have a cursor class or enforcer
class and this effectively traps any
call the users doing to fully execute
extending extending that to be what down
there at the bottom line 17 it's a game
I'm calling super first class to do the
execute by the time I sculpt they were
actually printed out at some trace
information so depending on this passed
and of course this may be pretty hard
there was a connect from line for the
top of the blue box absolute line for
where we didn't print and then we have
all the bind variable so if you want to
see all of the bind values that you're
being sent to the database and hack your
systems and expose it to hackers do this
so it has frozen cards obviously I'm not
suggesting you do do that but this is
the way a lot of people do want to know
what's going on in their applications
and you can obviously do a whole bunch
of more interesting things as well like
logging and things like that I do how
about execute say
you saw
perfection functions okay
so
when you do a query I'm gonna get a top
of that and you can actually manipulate
that before it gets back into your
application layout
we're Factory I'm gonna just show a
simple example but which is that you
have the column mapping but you might
actually want any custom objects that's
kind of probably more interesting real
application so here's a sample of our
own factory we've got our cursor that
they execute using this standard Python
of collections package and just re
naming the tuples so if you look they're
gonna find seven reps of those new names
new parent ID in a description idea
description title
and we just think that access that
object most those attributes of that
object as if it was natural which is
what pythons all about
obviously gonna get back the data
to get equivalent output if you weren't
using about my factory and you were just
doing these folders I got there under
ten just a straight loop over the rows
and dragging up the rows and printing
out the
oh shoot
like an appetite handlers so this that
one change the objects this one changes
the things like the data values
themselves so set an output type our
the key one I want to go to is a few
minutes is returning the lumps as
strikers and blobs and spikes so unless
but let's stop another strange example
first
so this is without it this is the before
seen say getting number if you look
carefully about one or two in the blue
box they are numbers is no quotes rather
if I add a output type and also here it
like for when you have my hand type
amphitheatres
and I'm just saying that if the type is
number then we're just going to return a
string of a certain size set it up so
Excel knows about it online
hi Pamela
and then when I do my query same queries
before my inside and wider exactly the
same and I have the output type every
and if you want magically there are
quotes around the one other two so I've
converted that to numbers and this is
kind of useful I think I have to cut out
the example a decimal but you can do
things like use the Pythons decimal
converter and things like that I kind of
need if you have issues with number of
conversions between articles decimal
format and you know the binary format of
Python
and or for the Doctor Who's you can use
exactly this technique
back
to your desire but they somehow I don't
show now with lots of strings and
you said output type handler here again
and to say if the input type is going to
be this is aligned to the input type of
the data is a club and you actually do
it paddle it as as long the same that
was some type of blog
7% that output I kind of love and when
I'm not query this is your call title
some people who have used CF cycle we've
mobs will know that they would
traditionally have to do something like
a value don't read to a reed method on a
return value to actually read the long
value what that means is that read is
another round trip to the database
so the query is a round trip give me
what we call a lob locator back you know
just a pointer and then have to go and
read from that point and that's great if
you're streaming your large volumes of
data if you're doing media streaming
things like that that's what exactly
what you want but if you're in though
you know megabyte from size a little bit
bigger than us 32 Camacho's whenever you
find that this is a lot faster than
having to do that second round trip so I
definitely recommend that if insert a
string you generally don't need to worry
about doing anything matter if you just
pass the string in and inserted behind
the string your big blob string into a
bubble type in the database or you can
use the cursor set input sizes I'm sorry
I don't have an example of that
the better I'm sorry but there are cells
in the github repository there's some
sample say restitution and I don't to
use that okay
this shows committing a horrible object
to an arbitrary Python object so what do
we have here we have a new a new method
I'm not showing you the building object
which you can see there in line to just
assume that's there's something a Python
you know whatever crisis keep building
an object and we're gonna pass in the
article object and you can see there you
know object building ID so those are the
object types which we've seen before
that I call
we now set the output level to use that
new converter so when we do our select
down there on line 11 we're getting back
the apply some updates
so that we could deep work with the
local objects you know the object object
building ID could do that we don't have
to do that we can work with our own
custom objects extend them whatever we
like in a Python landscape input type
happens all the way around
so
a lot of magic here because we do it for
you you said and you attribute people
type and law you neither set these other
curses or the connections depending
whether you the scope really want to
apply to everything in that application
or just a particular execution on the
curse
let's settle on some lines 14 at 16 yep
you're seeing it correct that's all
that's up there so we have a mythical
building object being created in your
Python object we created this is what we
want we want to just be able to buy this
in line 16 that new Python object I made
it to the database they say that's a
goal you know this is a Python object in
our pool that doesn't have that
directory so let's have a new mapping
and I'm sorry for slight wave purposes I
don't show you the gate type call but we
do do a get type and so that in this now
converts the Python types into another
object I'm assigning each of those
Python object values on the right hand
side into the article - a box a Python
Python representation of
we set up I can put handler magic
basically saying that we returning an
object am I going to use something to
kill it in poker better they are in the
red and it works
okay so I'm kind of winding up I think
we've got about four minutes left or
something like that so just a quick
summary over the last year we had a huge
number of new features pushed into
pythons in example so I do recommend you
update that pip install upgrade see
example do you recommend you update
Oracle database but don't forget Oracle
database entire purpose what we call
client-server interoperability so you
can be using version 12 to client and
talk to an 11-2 database or face back
there's an official supporter version
there's an actually works which is even
greater so you can't go back even
further about the other way around so
you can at least upgrade your client
version and there are some advantages to
that in terms of things like the session
for management of dead dead session
detection and things like that so at
least operator are required to prepare
and hopefully you have to take advantage
of something's new features to make sure
your applications really fly
we've had high pirate rpms proof testing
I didn't mention I really should give a
shout-out to our testers once Roger came
in under uncle's umbrella we have tested
a dpi level we have testing a platform
level we have function at a stake you
know there's a lot more going on there
so I think things are getting up finding
a lot of edge cases and quirks and
things like that they're being fixed as
we speak so see example long histories
been going for a long time extremely
popular is our most popular of the
open-source drivers about two to one so
at various times I mean you know the
flames of a month and holidays whatever
balloon container hundred thousand times
a month
oops I'm not like Todd mentioned have
you heard about our cloud isn't even a
religion - yeah thanks
and we now use this powerful abstraction
planner and just in the wrap-up slides
we do have a new series of office hours
for a lot of technologies here in Oracle
and there's a Python office hours comes
up which as you carefully will notice is
only a half an hour and I know your
developers I'm here want to sit around
for an hour so we just schedule it for
half an hour
turn up don't even have to be there at
the start we can it's a video call you
can darlin if you want chat whatever
works for you
ask questions we try and have a theme
each month so next month you I'm going
to talk about that XQ many so we have a
few slides on that and then we'll just
sort of hang around for no questions
will probably drop off but I do
recommend it's a way to establish
dialogue
perhaps some depth about each of these
features and obviously when you have
your favorite topic you could say hey
next month can you talk about thanks
and this is it that's the wrap up that
is me there's a Facebook group there
which doesn't have a lot in it except me
posting the coolant of what I posted
Twitter but I know in some regions of
the world people don't use a lot of
Twitter so I just push that out there as
a group so you can join it if you want
but there's a lot of places you can get
resources and Canada can get help
we're working that dog team to make sure
we can produce the properties with
documentation as well some say travel
just the API documentation
so appreciate your time today thank you
very much for coming along hope you
enjoy our perl poet and if you have any
questions please do come and ask me
after the session I'll be talking at
five o'clock on my purchase in one of
these other rooms also be happy to see
you there as well thank you very much
oh if you want a question yeah you
cannot shadow you can come up and ask
questions across all right because I'm I
can't quite hear with a background sighs
okay so this is this a standard horrible
question which is in some sense is my
responsibility because I own those
instant client packages I mean I there's
a lot of technologies under them for
various different groups that contribute
to it but I kind of get the
responsibility for chasing it
there are licensing issues because
they're third-party licenses in there we
have to satisfy there are business
reasons so we have to go through our
legal group you have to go through our
business groups to try and get approval
for that and the big one we wouldn't do
it in the wheels perhaps is like there
isn't maybe actually wheels but some
some languages we may not do it because
we wouldn't know which platform was
actually being deployed on time so we
really could do you do you know that
it's it's a known issue we'd like to
help that you had meetings even last
week on this stuff ongoing issue but
it's a it's a big big company big
company issue you know a lot a lot of
really important technology there like
the current encryption support and
things like that
so that question which comes up is why
don't we just get rid of that and write
a native driver which pop star for
database we'd have to do that for every
single language we'd have to support it
how would we do the encryption levels
yes that's a together so you know there
are pros and cons to this you get a lot
of features just for that little bit of
install but I do appreciate
yeah yeah yeah so we've done some work
there in the messaging error messages
that will now tell you which one you're
missing yeah I've got plans remember
that slide which says but don't make any
purchasing decisions yeah I'd love to
have the user installs it perhaps MSI's
on Windows which included the windows
redistributable which is the big problem
windows and anybody who knows me I
worked at a Linux group and if you seen
my others they bother about doing
interviews up there on the side of the
hall
the last one I did with him is wine
shouldn't use windows that's all these
open source things actually do turned
out to be a little easier on Linux this
does it's just the way it is but we'll
try and make things easier for you as we
can on Windows and certainly having
people binaries and wheels and things I
think it's the next stage they know who
something caught on that as well
thank you any more questions yes
performance did you say football
installing I don't I don't actually know
for the Python site to be honest there's
a huge range out there for the database
site we always try and courage your DBAs
to speak to your developers because
there are things like aw are all those
sort of there you go
so it's your fault because deep that's
actually not I mean if there's often a
big divide between DBAs and developers
but there's a lot of tooling with a MOS
like The Awl reports will tell you
oh you've connected too many times you
should be using session 4 oh you know
the statements being passed too many
times oh you should be you're doing the
binds instead of syncopation so in that
site the aw are the automatic workload
repository and the addm tools the
perfect so those are the ones I
recommend the Argos got our plan that I
recommend ok thank you very much that's
it we should wrap up thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
