technology Network we're going to get
started with a quick session here with
Dan McGann one of our developer
advocates with the Oracle database team
hold on a second we're going to light
this up on periscope right now all right
what's your Twitter handle DMC it's okay
hold on a second so at DMC than1 again
okay and this will be on Twitter go yes
okay this will show up on the Twitter
feed and we are now live so I'll give
you a chance to yeah let me get that
retweeted cool yeah what we'll do is
we'll just kind of like hang out and let
people like notice that we're here we
should wait oh our hi everybody hi folks
how's it going I've never done a lot of
stream before we never I actually well
we've done them on YouTube before huh
and they're pretty interesting but you
know who's got time to toggle over to
YouTube so we tried out this periscope
approach it's worked out really really
well so we we're finding we have 500
viewers on these so oh uh very cool so
here we are now you'll notice that Dan
and Laura are kind of in the upper
corner and there's a reason for that
Dan's got a plan ready go let's do this
alright so this is actually part of the
presentation I did today my talk was on
real-time data and web apps and so what
I'm showing you is actually what I
showed the audience I'm not going to
show you a lot of the code behind how is
put together maybe you can make it out
to one of the other oracle codes we'll
be doing but hopefully you can
participate in the game right now so
what I want you to do in a moment I'll
give you the URL but you're going to
open up a browser and go to this URL and
you're going to see this web page here
and it works on mobile and all that and
these are all the cities that Oracle
code will be visiting so there's 20
cities here what I want to do is pick
your favorite city are not limited to
one and you're not limited to one vote
just come in here and vote as many times
as you want for your favorite city or
cities you'll see on the left is a
ranking and right now everybody's tied
for first because of course there are no
votes but that will change
hopefully shortly and you'll see the
number of votes as well as a button to
cast a vote you'll also have access to
the dashboard that we're going to leave
up here to see who's participating who's
winning right here we have the URL that
I want you to go to so this is a HTTP
colon slash slash bit dot ly / or called
- our TDR T's for real time
so hopefully if it is working as it was
earlier today you can go here and we'll
start to see some boats coming in life
right on well that sounds great okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
go ahead and I'm going to go back to our
main screen here so let's talk about our
about what you've been working on
recently so I'm sure that you've got
quite a few initiatives rolling we've
got the developer initiative is keeping
you very busy on yeah so what was your
presentation about here
real-time data I was about socket IO
really we talked about some of the
underlying technologies that are around
today to to do real-time data streaming
data such as WebSocket and web RTC but
really I focus on socket IO simply
because it's a much easier API to use
than web socket directly it does things
like multi casting it gives you the
capability to put people into rooms so
kind of like in a chatroom
right right but you can use that in
different ways and it also handles auto
reconnect so if somebody puts their
phone in the pocket to get in the subway
and then they get where they're going
they take it back out it'll reconnect
automatically handles all that for you
so I advise folks just to go right to
socket IO and have a better web socket
experience it actually doesn't just use
WebSocket it also uses long polling
which is a technology that is nearly
guaranteed to be cross-browser compliant
I'm in total upgrade to WebSocket if
it's supported by the browser which is
most browsers these days so handles all
had complexity for you and that was one
part of it so it's you know how we keep
browsers and sync with our mid tiers and
and push data out to them but of course
the data especially no gesture is it's
often said we want to keep these to be
stateless we don't want to hold data in
here of course we can we can do caching
but you know the two most difficult
things and development right caching and
naming things oh yeah they're cache
invalidation anyway so we want to use
the database good to oh here come two
votes all right hey let's see yous in
the lead here
so right now San Francisco well that's
not a big surprise right
Francisco is in Belize it's actually the
only one folks are voting for right now
so far so yeah yeah so San Francisco's
winning that changes a little bit so
that's part of it but but that's your
scene here right so we're connected to
no js' and no jess is pushing us these
updates but really what's happening when
folks are casting about we're doing an
insert into the Oracle database ok so
data is changed in the database and we
need ways to let the mid tiers and of
course eventually then the clients know
about those changes and so I went over
various technologies within the database
that we can use for that and so there's
two parts there's this event that needs
to happen whether it's via triggers DBMS
scheduler we have advanced queues we
have continuous query notification we
have lots of features within the
database that you can use for eventing
and then of course you need to be able
to communicate about these events that
have happened and so for that we have
going back in history you tale TCP UTL
HTTP is your lower level we have
packages for sending mail the one I like
the demo is with Apex web service
because it speaks press which is cool
but there's also there's another way to
do this which I think will be really
cool in the future it's one of these
safe harbor statements right but we're
looking at native driver pushing and so
at that point you're doing a whole lot
less than the database layer okay and
you staying in node in JavaScript where
you're comfortable but you're able to
register queries and get notifications
really just sort of evented and can get
that stream of updates happening your
data directly so nicely we'll get that
at some point yeah what does it take in
order to make that happen
well the driver team so that's led by
Chris Jones yeah they prioritize things
according to you and so the the drivers
hosted on github it's an open source
project so if you go to github and look
up the Oracle database driver for nodejs
you know file a file a ticket or an
issue I figured what they call my issues
I believe yeah and
and let us know that you're interested
in this feature and the more folks that
do that sort of the more the higher it's
going to bubble up on Christmas priority
list nice well well that's good to know
you know and Chris is a very busy guy oh
very tough because he's running the
node.js driver out on github and you
know participating driving a lot of good
code there and then then you're pretty
busy yourself yeah I gotta tell you so
let's talk a little bit about some of
the things that you've been blogging
about recently you have you've got this
really cool blogging series I love it
there's a couple series actually one of
my I still need to finish yeah just been
a little bit too busy to do that shoot
should we should we just switch off for
this it looks like yeah that all the
most we're going to get okay well let me
see hopefully we won't like there we go
and we're gonna put us back here right
there it is cool good so so the most
recent blog post was on integrating font
awesome into Oracle jet oh so Oracle jet
is Oracle's JavaScript extensions
toolkit it's you're going to give it
like a framework for client-side
development similar to angular yeah
or will react or any number of UJS it's
a little bit more all-encompassing than
some of these libraries they focus more
on for reactive view for example just
that that view layer really efficiently
handling just one thing and doing it
well jet kind of does everything you
know they everything in the kitchen sink
so it does in addition to that view
layer and I should say that they call it
a toolkit because it's really a
collection of open source JavaScript
technologies that have been around for a
while really proven themselves such as
knock out say it's required Jas and even
jQuery and jQuery why and so on and so
they created this toolkit and they added
a bunch more custom code for things like
custom components and UI layer and data
visualizations and that's actually what
we were seeing a moment ago when we were
seeing folks voting and you can see the
graphs changing and
so this is all an Oracle jet app so one
of the things that it do not include is
a font icon library and for a lot of
folks that's fine they're going to use
their own custom in-house built font
library but for a lot of folks we just
go to font awesome so I recently wrote
how they could integrate font awesome
into their jet project and coolest name
in the world which is that fun awesome
come on say you know you sit around the
table or should we call it well we could
call it this is a oh we call it awesome
okay I've never thought about but you're
probably right that's probably exactly
what happened it's probably it yeah that
is neat though so I wrote about that I
would love to find some time to show
folks how they can integrate other
frameworks and libraries such as in a
web pack required j/s some of the
components within jet jet you could say
there they're showing their age but the
fact of the matter is if folks are
feeling that JavaScript fatigue we're
all hearing about these days you might
want to take a look at yet because
that's sort of that enterprise option
it's going to move at a slower pace but
if you don't wanna wait I want to show
folks at least an air code layer how
they're going to integrate you know
start using es6 you know babel to to
transpile their code and and do that via
a web pack and not have to use some of
these other things so that maybe they're
a bit happier with the framework as well
so got it hopefully hopefully I can get
some time to do that yeah well that
would be good so tell me about some of
your own development stuff what are you
working on at home when it goes you know
so here are you renovating your house or
no no no I'm not that fun yeah I'm just
you know my work is my passion so I find
myself doing a lot of this in my own
time usually my own time I'm going to
try to find a way to do what we're doing
on a daily basis and make it easier more
automated and so most recently I was
working on a tool I think I'm calling it
sequel router right now and so the idea
is you know when you're creating an API
nodejs
that
tied into a database back-end you spend
a lot of time creating routing logic and
you could call it controller logic and
then your your model logic and this kind
of stuff ultimately at the end what
you're doing is creating a URL that maps
to a sequel or pio pio sequel stored
procedure or procedure okay and so I'm
trying to remove all that that middle
area and just take the URL map to sequel
and PL sequel how's that come it's
coming along it's a lot of work so a lot
of work
but I think the ends justify the means
so we'll see how it turns out that's
kind of cool I can't wait to see how
when you get that run in a little bit of
a pilot yeah that would be really neat I
hope so tell me why did you submit a
paper to Oracle code I mean what was it
about this venue that set you know yeah
well I didn't do a paper I submitted
three or four and not to this city but
to all twenty hey Wow yeah well we'll
see I see if I get to end all four but
the idea Oracle for the longest time has
had open world which of course is a
massive event but developers I think can
get lost in that shuffle you know
there's a lot of other things happening
at open world so having a developer
focus conference I think is really
important
yeah and you know it's just it's a place
where everyone can come and know what
they're going to see is code right and
some slide sure but hopefully you know
stuff that they can take back and enter
their their daily grind and and use to
improve their flow they're what they're
doing day to day make their apps better
and that kind of thing so yeah yeah it's
a good crowd here we we sold out for for
our place here we dramatically
underestimated a lot of interest but you
know like you think we're going to be in
eighteen different cities we'll probably
do a revival here and then Oracle
OpenWorld really is only you know it's
only nine months away
it's right around the corner there yep
we'll be getting in touch with people
there too so all right well I wonder if
we hit refresh and see if we've got
same thing to go here and and one thing
you know it's not your code as much as
it's the latency on our are I do that
web yep no but it's looking like we've
got some boats there so it's really
great fun yeah you show us that it was
really good talking with you today dear
as well thank you appreciate it
okay you guys are ours coming up next
we'll have Mike Fitch WA who is our vice
president of the database application
development team and he's going to be
talking about a few new things that his
team's got rolling out so that's going
to be a lot of fun but we'll see you on
periscope in a few minutes talk to you
soon cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
