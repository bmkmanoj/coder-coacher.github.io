from oracle and i'm going to talk about
configuration for java ee in the cloud
to date
so I'm sure you've seen it already many
times in case you forgot what is that I
remind you this is a legal staff and it
says that what I will talk about today
may change in the future and may not be
included into the final product so don't
trust me that is today so here is very
gender I will start with a short
introduction with a little bit of
history of configuration related
frameworks after that I'll jump to
problem definition well we'll talk about
what kind of problems we are facing what
needs to be solved describe use cases in
this kind of stuff after that I will
actually describe what's proposed
including the features features in
details roadmaps and these kind of
things and at the end i prepared a shot
sample use case not real application you
can run but sample use case which help
you better understand the features and
at the end i'm playing in a QA session
if we have time what we will definitely
will so please keep your questions to
the end so let's start with a little bit
of history my list starts at two
thousand three but it should have been
started actually from first job release
back in 96 the bedtime properties class
was introduced the first and the only
standard lame for working with
configuration in Java the first attempt
to implement and functionality we would
like to standardize now was done in 2003
by Apache Commons configuration project
it supports typed access to
configuration parameters that can read
configuration from different sources
another key date is 2009 then spring
free was released this release
introduced configuration and chord
approach their configuration is stored
coded in the annotations and after that
can be injected to classes using
dependency injection 2011 first version
of delta spike was released it has a
configuration module there the ideas of
externalized configuration multiple
sources were implemented it also has a
nice spi based mechanism of attaching
new configuration sources these days
started some attempts of making java ee
configuration standard so in 2013 my
cave presenting his proposal on java one
he collected many user requests talked
with people and came out with some ideas
about what should be included in the
standard in 2014 Oracle introduced a
sore way where were questions about what
kind of technologies should be included
in Java EE eight so i have a screen shot
with results here and from six java ee
configuration what was there was voted
number three the first one was jason BTW
so it indicates that user themes that
configuration configuration jsr is
important actually a now oracle
introduce new survey right i will have a
link at the end of a session so you
should go there and vote give us your
opinion about what you think is
important we need to know it
so I was same here the 514 Netflix our
chairs was introduced this is
configuration from a protocol for the
cloud it has dynamic configuration
features which worked with mutable
configuration without restarting the
instances it's also integrated with
apache commons configuration and netflix
users please now in their products so
its production ready yep in 2015 and at
all trash and let Nelson were working on
a previous our proposal it was rejected
for some reason but it gave it birth to
Apache tamiya more than a feature-rich
configuration for a work it's one of the
inspirations for my proposal and of
course we were many other frameworks
trying to solve or simplify
configuration problems I mentioned tolle
these because later in montauk albury
offense them saying something like this
feature is inspired by tamiya or rhesus
the same what's used in spring framework
and so on now some fresh statistics I
was talking about the web back in two
thousand four but there was another one
which is a joint effort of diesel and
Java Guardians results were published
last week so it's very fresh where was a
question how important is to enable
dynamic configuration in java ee
applications so it's about dynamic
configuration so maybe it's not true
currently present related to what i'm
doing here but it's related anyway and
results are 31 dot seven percent of
participants think it's very important
and only ten percent then the four to be
precise I think it's not important at
all so it is indicates that people are
still interested in this and they were
in throttle I think 825 if I remember
the helper tissues
okay so now let's talk about what kind
of configuration related problems users
operation so I was talking to many
people and found out that there is not
come on understanding of what
configuration is one understanding of
application configuration is a server
setup for a given environment in means
of virtualization installation class
drink and this kind of things so some
other set of people understand
configuration as runtime configurations
on time parameters such as vm memory ok
ill this kind of stuff another
understanding is deployment descriptors
ok makes sense parameters have used
frameworks so if your application is
using j'ai pas persistence.xml or CDI
beans or web.xml these kind of things
resources used data sources message
queues it also makes sense and some
people think that configuration is
actually a set of scripts used to deploy
your applications prescript scripting
facilities I'm not saying that we are
sticking with these definitions this is
what people think I'll give a definition
for what we think configuration is later
when I will talk about the gesture
proposal so now finally let's talk about
the problems and the first problem that
where are other frameworks around
actually it's not a problem that there
are other frameworks it out is it good
the problem is that there are many
frameworks trying to solve the same use
cases and we're using different api's to
achieve the same goals so there are
technologies to standardize and the
first problem is a lack of standard API
another problem is configuring many
instances of the same application in one
go it's a very common use case now
application applications has many
instances in the cloud there can be some
properties which we need to configure
like her timeouts login level of
whatever need to be set for all
instances and the current model of
configuration their configuration is
actually embedded into the package
doesn't work nice here first problem may
be the most requested use case actually
is a deploying application on different
environments you know you have to test
test abroad this kind of stuff currently
again before deployment to other
environments we need to repackage
application with environment
configuration users want to avoid it
users ones application move it from
another environment without any
repackaging next use case is dynamic
configuration use case and currently to
change configuration we need to update
again a little package right but for
some properties it makes sense for some
preparation doesn't make sense so for
properties which doesn't make sense
application can handle we change itself
without restarting without redeployment
and the last use case last problem is a
configuring a batch of micro services so
nowadays applications are not mono
leaves but a set of micro services and
often some configuration related to the
whole application to the bunch of micro
services or to a group of micro services
which are serving some particular
business need again crack it into which
packages inconvenient here so here comes
the proposal which will include
solutions for all these use cases
and now it's actually defined what we
think configuration is so first of all
we are talking about application
configuration it's not about runtime
configuration of the web server cluster
not about scripts so configuration of
applications and application and
resources used their configuration is
not modifiable bubbling by the
application it can be modified by the
environment or but not by application
application can only read it
configuration is a set of key value
pairs of the map keys and values of
strings and the structure is flats map
flat structure not a tree a standard
where proportion is called Java EE
configuration it includes the following
features so first is a unified Java API
I don't think I need to describe what's
it it's clear orders next feature is
externalized configuration it means
decoupling application configuration and
application code moving can figure out
of the package this feature source the
most of the use case as I mentioned
before application doesn't care their
configuration stored it just treats its
using provided configuration API and
this is actually optional so if someone
wants to use the classic model of their
configuration is abandoned in the
package it's okay can be restricted
support of multiple configuration
sources means that configuration
framework reads combines merges
configuration from different sources so
part of configuration can be read from
the properties file another part from
web server and third part from cloud
service so config favor combined setting
gives the murder to application as part
of that we need to standardize for
months types of configuration files so
where I think you know supporting
Cemil Jason and properties files format
out of a box so coming back to the
sources sources actually ordered and
high layer sources over right values
property values from the lower level
services and this is a concept of layer
in a novel rise again the frameworks I
mentioned most of them have this kind of
concept configuration descriptor is a
way to define what is configurable in
your application specify properties you
spoken for in configuration and the
metadata it's optional dynamic
configuration is an ability to react on
configuration changes which is big
feature it includes polling sources
framework providers expressions context
I'll explain everything later inspired
by a child and the last feature is
integration of other Java EE frameworks
in a way that we also can read and
figuration from the config stories so
not store it somewhere else but use the
same source as application is used where
proportion with GSR to be included in
Java EE eight we are proportionately
java ee release in this next year but
don't have time to include all proposed
features to the first release so we
selected these features here the core
features api externalized configuration
configuration sources multiple sources
and layering to be included in Java EE
eight and all others we are if you're
into an extra days because of time
and here is the roadmap and here I
should remind you about the second slide
about trusting okay so this is just a
vision so so you can't say that you set
on Java one that public draft will be
released on april i can say that
remember the second slide so we are
planning to submit a GSR request after
java one in october come out with early
draft in january public draft in april
and final release in august you see
that's pretty tough so now let's go
through all these are features in
details and we'll start with the API
lets used example first approach so
imagine that they have a property file
okay here like like here it defines free
properties a B and C to read properties
we need to create an instance of
fileconfiguration engine first so it can
be created using something like an fink
provider and get configurations to
default configuration without any
customizations now let's see the first
property and yet property method can be
used for that with property name
parameter and it returns the value Java
one string query if you read property be
as it shows here it will return nine
buttock region 9 and string the first
sample shows we can not exist in
property so in this case null is
returned important to say that no
exception is ruined in this case for
sample is default so we can read the
property if and doesn't exist which one
with default as property doesn't Java so
in this case default is going to be
returned in stream and the last use case
last sample it's not your case is
typesafe property reading in this case
we are providing it
I here and when framework read seated
after muchly converted to this type so
long 2016 is recharged so let's take a
look at on this mechanism in details
converters so where he is to pack a
framework with a set of default
converters four types listed here with
primitive wrappers big glasses URL URI
date java.util.date and Java time
classes calendar this kind of things and
given ability to register custom
converters so so it's customizable and
customi horses can work this way just
implement the class sorry interface can
be order similar to that he has one
method converting string to your type
implementation can look something like
this and register it in the framework
like this we've converters method
accepts your instance of your country or
two after that it can be used in the
similar way as I explained before again
most of the frameworks I mentioned
before half this fish configuration
sources I touched it a little bit before
look at the picture application reads
configuration from Quantic framework
right do you see my cursor here oh yeah
you do it doesn't care their data is
physically stored it knows the framework
itself but it can be stored in files in
different formats in different locations
can be stored on the observer or it's
possible to create your own custom
configuration soars like this database
is not support by default but can be
created by users so it reads
configuration from that
bass and it's pluggable to configuration
for the coast and ettore configuration
service our order it and the order is
defined by number or you know which is
assigned to each source then we source
plugged into the framework as I
mentioned already sources for higher
ordinal augerite various resources flow
or you know I have a picture which
explains it so it looks it may see maybe
but I hope it explains it so imagine
that we have for configuration sources
like this 110 hundred twenty hundred
fifty two hungry and these numbers
actually organized and we have four
properties p1 p2 p3 p4 right and in this
matrix in this table the ball in
crossing means that these souls has this
property defined and if it's green it
means that this radio is X from this
source actually returned them to read
the property so let's take a look here I
get property p1 it's defined in three
sources 110 120 200 so we value from 200
sources return easy T to defined in two
sources 110 120 120 return so the same
with vista hope it's clear by default if
nothing is configured configuration
framework uses these listed sources to
read progresses and this arrow orange
here alone shows the direction so first
of all it looks at the files in a meta
in directory inside the package after
that it tries to find properties in
environment properties and system
property has a high orjinal here this is
by default and as you see the
configuration by default is not
externalized rights is to keep the
compatibility but it can be externalized
using these methods so our free ways to
customize configuration
runtime parameter let soak asset
customized customized externalization
api and config sources xml file let's
quickly go all three of this so we first
method around time parameter it can be
called configure source for example
right and it spit suffice relocation of
your source like lease for example right
or it can be a web server like that so
configuration framework recognizes what
is it file or web server and creates the
appropriate source itself it can be in
leashed as well so we can specify list
of sources a certain time parameter and
in which case their first source has the
highest original and lower lower lower
lower and so on our second approach is
using API so instead of default
configuration we are using a builder to
build custom configuration and it has at
source methods where we are specifying
our sources you see and these numbers
are basically originals the disadvantage
of this approach is that sources are
hard-coded to the application so not
externalized but it's also a use case
and config sources xml file is the short
option and for me it looks like the most
flexible one alex wayne wine so what is
it config sources it's an xml file we've
defined format which is used to define
configuration sources and web parameters
so when starts config framework looks
for it in inside the package enmity
directory but it can be placed outside
the baggage so the advantage of this
config xml is you see all your sources
in one file and you see the sources
order so basically it's one place to
define all your sources so it's not like
sources somehow you find somewhere else
and you need to find very I defiance
with everything is one in in one place
so coming back to how to define it so
where is another one time parameter
configure sources not source but sources
in this case where we specify location
of the file can be only web server can
be on a file system another way is using
API so again we've sources method and a
location of the config file basically
placing it outside the package has many
advantages because we are externalizing
not only sources but on not only source
but sources definition we can actually
add sources on the fly or remove sources
on the fly so it's very nice and here
are two samples first just defines to
configuration sources you see it's very
easy one and the second one and the
priority repairable airing that refers
drunk at a high ordinal than the second
one so it's very visual the second
sample is a little bit more advanced we
actually specify or generals here right
so if you don't like the natural order
we can specify all units or resources
and the third sample it's actually cost
and third-party config source which
reads for instance configuration from a
cloud service so we define a class which
implements some config source interface
must be on the classpath and we do find
some parameters here like user and
passwords you get to cloud this
parameters are passed to you this class
on creation to the constructor so I
finished with features plane from Java
88 now and we will jump to other
features plan for the next jollies
integration with other Java in
frameworks so the idea is to integrate
the configuration framework with other
frameworks like JP a servlet jax-rs
wherever else the way that we read
configuration from the same source as
replication and user advantages of
externalized configuration so it's
possible that web.xml is stored
somewhere outside of the package and
persistence.xml for instance in cloud
storage sound like this configuration
descriptor this I already mentioned that
this is a nice thing too they're all
your configuration is defined in one
place so this is XML file we've defined
format which describes all your
properties with some metadata I am sure
that you have a situation there you are
working with some library and you know
that some features a configurable but
you don't know how to configure it so
you need to go through the source find
out what's the property name and going
to internet find out you know find a
manual sometimes it's problem so these
features sauce with situations so you
just need to find configuration
descriptor and usually it's in some
predefined location than the ridic
everything is explained to them so take
a look at the sample we have a sample
descriptor here with four properties
defined ABCD and see that B's has it has
default value and she is immutable this
configuration descriptor is not required
as optional so if you have it it's great
if you don't have it ok and it's not an
XML schema I would like to highlight it
as you have questions is at xml schema
which is not responsible i mentioned
immutable property on the previous slide
so you may ask what is it so i have the
answer immutable proteus this property
which she reads only once like final
field in java and after that you can
change sources or wherever it's not
really it's cached in the framework next
time it will be you eat is when you
start your application so it can be used
for some properties which are not
designed for to be dynamic like for
instance connection strings right so if
it's immutable it's only once if we
change it into stuff by design so to
better explain it I prepared these
pictures again with balls i don't know
why i use balls to describe
configuration all the time so basically
two pictures both of them explaining
region one property in this case is
mutable probability in which case
immutable property and this is actually
time scale so it shows how configuration
sources are changing over time and what
the value of the property returned so
for mutable it's the same as I explained
before always radio from the source with
highest ordinal return so you see at t
one moment in time is 150 t 2 150 again
and here we added another source before
you know 200 so we are returning is
video from 200 source and at t for
everything is removed except 120 so 23
for immutable it works differently so
when we read it see one moment of time
it's the same as mutable so value from
150 sources return and after that we are
changing sources wherever we will use
cash and which is what we read before
always return something like this
dynamic configuration this is actually
for features so the idea is that
configuration can change an application
needs to handle this change and
configuration can change because we
change something in the configuration
file or a property you are reading
actually depends where is an expression
altitude later it depends on some other
properties which are changed or it can
actually be dependent on the data path
from the application and which is the
context again I will explain it later
important to say that changes are not
initiated by application itself as I
said configuration is application can
only read configuration not arrive
configuration so a first which is
pouring framework and similar to water
charge has and this is ability to read
each configuration sources and some
predefined intervals or second fish is
expressions so ability to use al like
expressions in your values and property
resolvers is ability to call java method
in expressions and context is the way to
pass diet and data from the application
to configuration framework and use these
data in expressions so it will allow us
to use something like conditional
sources so it sounds complicated right
so let me demonstrate all of this I hope
you'll understand it better and we will
start with polling so my idea is that
each config source may be polled for
changes and point interval is specified
when resources plug to the framework
like this so she we've sourced method
has additional parameter duration and
which is actually very fresh interval
and it has a Java time duration type
another option is to specify polling
interval and config source XM
l file as its shown here so very special
attribute quad refresh rate and actually
see refresh rate is actually for four
sources so we can actually ask framework
to pull the sources list itself so we
add it we can add sources dynamically we
can remove sources dynamically and do
this kind of funny things another
feature expressions so i l-like
expressions in property values tamiya
costimulation so take a look at the
sample the property foo here has the
expression as a value an expression
means read value from some other value
it can be used for instance if we have a
bunch of microservices which I part of
bigger application and we need to define
the same login level for all of them so
what we do we define configuration file
put their blog level right but all these
services can use different variables
names property names for plug-in level
so how to do it property substitution
basically this use case so we assign a
property to a value of other property
defined before so the next samples to
samples demonstrate formulas so bar is
full + 10 and bus is full x bar and
conditional sources so here we have
enabled attribute which has an
expression meaning that this source will
be plugged in only if
value of this expression is true it's
very useful property resolvers allow to
define custom code and expressions so
this use case shown here is injecting
resources from the cloud for instance so
we define a special resolver bitch gets
resource name from show from the
expression goes to the cloud gets
resource from the cloud right connection
string for instance on URL of some
service and injects it back to your
configuration so here cloud resolver is
defined it has some parameter your clown
credentials it has named cloud and it
can be cold like this so in this case we
are getting cast DB its connections
think possibly from the cloud and the
sample above we can have a similar
resolver not we have can be created for
Eureka for instance and it will query
your record for this drink provided and
injects it to configuration and the last
feature configuration context are
charged has similar feature but not
exactly the same so sometimes
configuration depends on some variables
such as vacation type geographical drone
profile and these variables are defined
in the application so this feature
allows putting this kind of variables
into configuration context and then
other properties are queried from
configuration they can depend on this
application context so different values
returned depended on what's in the
context and this let's take a look at
the sample which is from previous use
case candy
no source so and this is a piece of code
so we create context put some variable
there and after the to read the property
of a special way right and depending on
what's in the context this source can be
enabled and additional configuration
source plugged in the witch can
overwrite some of the properties i
prepared a special sample to demonstrate
all these features so let's get gold
will just go through it maybe you will
understand it better so it's based on
client rating application we made to
demonstrate how microservices can be
used on weblogic it's on github link is
here basically it consists of four
microservices customer rating blacklist
and financial records the entry point is
here is from banking area and it returns
a list of customers from the database
and for each of the customer it
calculates rating using with rating
service in rating service calls
blacklist service to find out who the
customer blacklisted or not and after
that it caused financial record service
to get history financial records service
can call public registry and after that
it uses some complicated business logic
to come out with a number 0 to 9 which
is the customer rating so i will talk
about configuration so i will touch only
these two micro services because for the
others configuration is more or less the
same so this slide shows request so
varies get customers method and she here
with web which is the actual application
used we use case is that for IRS
application where it on only
30 rolls because of the interface
limitation and for all others like this
web we return hungry records what is
that looks like that standard for each
record rating has calculated using this
URL achieved this is a customer ID
provided there were numbered returns put
here return to the customer so let's
define first a word configuration is
used by these two micro services and its
database connection string it's a rating
service URL number of records return
it's different for iOS and others and
log level for rating services similar
URLs of two microservices it calls and
log level now i defined configuration
descriptors for all this configuration
so i put these properties here so
customer database is immutable rating
qrl can be potentially mutable so
application may handle it handle change
a records count default is 100 but for
iOS application can be 30 how to do it
so I owe for this reason I have this
context property Eric a proper will be
used later I'll show you how in config
sources and low-level info with default
so rating service i'm not going to go
through it is more or less the same and
here actually configuration files so
this is I just duplicated descriptors
here and it's a good idea to define log
level in the global scope so there will
be one file below for global
configuration and where is one property
log level just warn boring to
configuration files for
each of the microservices see actually
here I redefine prologue level so this
is a concept of Olga rights so we are
overriding to really define globally and
if these source has only one the
property records count and it will be
plugged in only if application is IRS
i'll show how now here sir config
sources basically all three files I
talked about before I here and the order
is from global to application
configuration and after that this is the
conditional source block in if
application is iOS easy for rating
service is very similar so I think it
doesn't work explaining all of that
basically would say it I use the model
the configuration store it in shared
file system and on a web server but it
can be done different way there are lots
of flexibility in defining configuration
infrastructure and from one point it's
very good from the other point it can be
hustle can become a nightmare for
environment administrators so what's the
solution to that and solution can be if
vendors cloud vendors introduce some
cloud service or service for each cloud
responsible for storing and managing
configurations it will eliminate a
problem of defining and managing
configuration infrastructure and it can
be pluggable to java ee configuration
framework as configuration source and
here are some more ideas it can be for
instance hi available and if the magic
is scalable if your application is B
kits in the cloud it's possible to do it
can be integrated with other cloud
services like security for instance or
service registry it can have a nice UI
and rest api
and some additional features like
versioning history security forever
where is the server not a service with
similar functionality and it's sprint
config server but as I said vendors can
come out with true cloud solutions we're
possibly seen it already as well so next
steps sorry the first thing very
important for us to hear your feedback
so please find some time and take your
story technical comments can be sent
here as some other links JCP related and
we have to learn more on java ones or is
not much to learn because we're at the
end now and these free sessions are java
ee related just can go to second now
now for sure custom custom property
resolver can be created and used to
encrypt and decrypt things what I don't
remember the question kappa can repeat
question I don't remember question so
basically the question was about is it
possible to use some encryption in e.l
expressions correct or how can we handle
security problems and my answer was that
you can create a custom property
resolver which will be responsible for
encryption and decryption there are the
security problems now this is just a
proposal you know and in the expert
group later we will definitely think
about security and other things more
questions please
yes
so the question was that I mention I
need to repeat your precious right a
question was about a configuration of
other frameworks I mentioned that this
is going to be feature of a framework
and the question is how it's how it will
work right so my idea is that it's up to
the framework maybe right so it will
somehow define itself the storage
mechanism its data from there from the
convicts or so from configuration
framework I think it should be like that
but again this is just a proposal right
and I don't have an exact answer now i
have only envision how you know
basically the problem is defined the way
that it has to be done somehow right but
i don't know how we need to think about
this and come up with some proper
solution
I know if Lee if container container can
also be a client for configuration
framework definitely yeah it can be a
client and it can be actually a source
right so it can work this way definitely
please
this is we are talking about Java only
is it repeat the question so you're
making me problems so the question was
that is it possible to use with kinder
features for non java applications
correct yeah so we are making the answer
is we are making a Java framework we are
making the Java API right so it will be
java only okay
theoretically it can but I assume this
is not our problem here right more
questions yeah okay okay
you
so the question is is it possible to use
basically pushing instead of polling
right so it comes to a question what is
better pushing or pulling right and for
the cloud environment my understanding
that Pauline is more reliable because
pushing sometimes you don't know was it
pushed was it confirmed is it not
confirmed and polling in this case is in
reliable because the framework works on
the client side right and just read
things all things it's yes or no the
source can we can resource all the
country to source with serious threat
and poor link is actually is actually
also used by a child right and it's very
actually what it's inspired by their
solution basic ok next question
we will see so basically I need to
repeat the question so how how much work
we need we can get from Tamiya and why
anatol can be expected or cosmically
right so we actually still don't know
about the organization how it will work
right so I can't give you an answer now
right but as you see this proposal it
leads to a part which is pointed to java
ee 8 is very very similar what tamiya
has right so I assume that a lot of
things done by tamiya we will just reuse
it ok
yeah i can say that i already talked to
a fan at all right we already sort of
discussed this configuration dresser and
things and it looks like we are on the
same page more questions please
not for now at least because as I said
okay question was a can be used
dependency injection right we have a
very limited time before java eth so i
assume that no dependency injection in
the first release at least but after
that of course can be in it probably
other windows too so if if there is a
core that maybe even spring for upcoming
release may implement they also
dependency injection sort because i
think that you seen whether or not this
can be standardized or whether or not
different implementations easily have to
go a determination has you get so many
problem is is the time frame it's not
that simple because you just
you got the answer okay more questions
okay okay i think if it's a part of
configuration managed by java in
configuration framework then yes at
least at least we can think about this
because integration integration is a
part which we will work later right so
at least we will think about it okay
any more questions
so we're finished thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
