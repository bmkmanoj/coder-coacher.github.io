evangelist at Oracle and today I'm talk
to you about database manipulation with
JP a so JP a actually the Java
persistence API is one of the most
popular and important API is in Java it
was based on the first formal versions
of hibernates a very popular framework
and then it got put inside of the whole
specification and became a standard and
should I will show you how to use it for
deal with your data so let's check it
out
well when you are using JP a you will
map your your tables inside your
application as entities so we have here
this is a notation entity and we also
have another notation that is table if
you maybe you have a different name for
in between your class and your table
grow table and database you can use this
this annotation tool to specify the real
name of your table and here we have some
queries I will show after so going
forward here we have an ID we have to
have an ID for the table because in this
case JPA will use it to generate the
this sequence a case is an ID so we have
here an automatically generated ID and
also the name and email in case just
exactly names in the table and in the
class and in the rest of the class is
just regular Java
plain old Java object not nothing
different than that
okay and what we have here a user bean
is stateless being okay and we are using
to manipulate our GPA entity so we have
an instance fro your from your entity
manager and we are getting it from the
the
the application server using that
persistence contest annotation and we
have summited
regular method for ADD and you do
register and we are using the identity
manager to persist and we also use it to
remove here and we are also using it to
merge to do updates on your table and we
also have methods furfrou entity manager
to find by ID that's why we need the ID
on the entity and we also have another
one for find by name where we are using
the queries that we wrote on the on the
ATT so we have here the name of the
query using user dot find by name if you
go there user dot side by name is that
one okay so it will run this query here
selects EU from user where you name dot
okay so is that the how do you write
queries in JPA and when we find by name
we became maybe not found not find that
that register so it will launch the
Secession the result exception so then
we just return though as the name it
doesn't exists and we also had a final
there we'll just list all the registry
the table get is a result okay what I
then here is write unit tests using J
unit so we can actually manipulate the
database and seeing how those things is
going on we are using here beautiful
framework for from open a GB when we can
stand she ate a big container inside of
our user test our unit to test sorry
so I have here the user being that our
being that manipulating the data HPA and
we set up once we we got the the test
running and when it has ended it will
close the container and here we have all
the methods being tested so
the ads and we then use the assertequals
here update and we move so let's build
and once it's built it will run all
those tests ok so we have here the
output so it will start up a new
container a open a GB container
I ran the tests so here are three tests
no failures and all those those methods
is quite good and working that's it for
today thanks for watching see you next
time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
