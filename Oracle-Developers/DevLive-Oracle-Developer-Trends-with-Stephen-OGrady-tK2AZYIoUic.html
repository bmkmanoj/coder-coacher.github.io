of dev live I'm Laura Ramsey with the
Oracle technology Network and I'm here
with good friend and industry expert
Steven O'Grady from Redmond how's it
going okay yes
well good glad to have you here how long
has you you've been here at our event
all day long yeah yeah for the opening
keynote since X so um you've been a
friend of our technology for a long time
oh yeah we've covered them for a very
very long time going back much further
than I would care to admit as much
exactly so let's let's take a walk down
memory lane
quickly open Solaris ah those are the
days
birthdays oh yeah that was some fun we
did so hard work than we did yeah
there's a lot that went into Chile on
the Sun side in terms of trying to take
a you know long time proprietary code
base make it open source picking license
how do you do governance you know sort
of a fitter it's at our dinner so yeah a
lot of work a lot of hora a lot of hard
effort I think on both sides right
openjdk indeed yeah again there was a we
actually just had this conversation with
a some folks last night in fact about
licensing choices and implications of
you know what they you know what was
ultimately chosen and so on so yeah
we've we have a long history here I
guess hey we had some news just last
week about of j2ee STK eight or
something along those way GlassFish yeah
there's always you know GE her j2ee and
EES has become has always been a
essentially standard that's attracted a
lot of attention it has its you know
certainly advocates it has people who
are you know hey so I'm moving fast
enough and so on so in that respect it's
just like a lot of technologies we cover
yeah ok I'm going to pull vault over to
docker ok what's important for us to
know about containers and about docker
in particular a good question I think
the simplest I mean basically to
it's actually funny were talking about
open Solaris cuz open Solaris as some of
the folks watching probably know had
essentially implementation containers a
long time ago in zones and you know that
the thing is is that what really caught
I think developer attention with Dockers
is that they made it really really easy
so they took containers it made it super
easy to implement and you know if you're
a developer there are a lot of reasons
to use it but one of the ones that we
look at most is that it makes it easy
and lightweight to encapsulate a
particular environment right so if I
have a particularly developer setup or
development environment set up rather
with specific libraries and versions of
code and so on I can quickly neatly
encapsulate that in a much faster
lighter weight faster than akin to the
VM so I don't need the overhead of you
know bundling the entire operating
system in there it's just the container
with just the pieces that I need good
though easy lightweight to share you
know very dense but yeah it's Dockers
really Dockers been one of the fastest
growing technologies from a developer
interest and point that we've ever seen
Wow no good to hear because we're there
you know indeed to some extent for each
other uh let's talk a little bit about
github okay
is that really becoming the developer
community and marketplace is that really
the place it's you know certainly the
largest it's certainly one of the ones
that we focus on when we so we just
released our latest programming language
rankings they dropped was it last week I
think in github is one of the sources
that we pull for that so certainly
there's other centers of gravities other
places that people host code but you
know it's quickly become in a really a
default you know for the most part you
know as an analyst for example somebody
tells me that they have an open source
code base that's the first place that I
would go to look right if I don't know
so yeah it's it's a huge center of
gravity so when it talks in talking
about your rankings
you know what which JavaScript language
was at the top of your list why are we
still looking at Python PHP kind of
things javascript was number one has
been for
a very long time Java is number two
Python actually jumped PHP we had PHP in
third place for I think as we as long as
we've been doing the rankings it you
know quote-unquote slipped that's the
number four still a very very popular
language and then you know as you go
further down you see other languages
Ruby's slipped a little bit I want to
say with seven or eight you know but you
know frankly one of the things that you
know we try to do you know with our
rankings as we do with any rankings is
you know those are pass the smell test
right you got to look at it and say this
is does this look right we were to run
the rankings and it says well not to
pick on community but if Haskell for
example which certainly has its
adherents and you know the really nice
software written in Haskell but if that
comes out on top then okay we probably
on the files
yes obably need to look at some rankings
but now that the rankings like more or
less as we'd expect them to well you
know I talk about putting you on the
spot you're ready yeah okay what was the
first application you personally ever
wrote Oh God
I wrote a and I really really hope it's
not service any longer I wrote a
essentially a front-end for version
kauai wrote my own version control
system for mainframe software subversion
gonna no no no no it's much worse than
that no my first my first engagement
actually the systems integrator was with
a client that was still running
mainframe stuff which we hadn't been
trained on it was one of those hey go
figure it out and this was in was a BIM
edit I think was the name of it the
procedural language yeah I had to write
the versioning system all the UI's for
it it was Tara it was legit aleal
ouch-ouch of what language should use to
write it in so the environment was been
met I don't even know what they called
the scripts okay I think it's like
dramatic script or something like that
so yeah so that was the first likely
giad production application that i've
wrote very good very good
so here's another good question so I was
I don't know if you knew this but I can
actually tell whether or not you're
going to get a promotion base
what browser you use interesting okay
yes so which browser do you use Chrome
oh you're gonna get you're going to get
a raise and you're probably going to get
a big promotion to go ahead I'll take it
yeah this came from an article there was
a study not too long ago where they
compared the browser that you use to
whether or not you're really you know
successful in your in your career okay
and they found that developers that use
either Chrome or Firefox are 30% more
likely to be successful and be promoted
in their career than people who use
Safari or Internet Explorer interesting
I guess that makes sense
yeah it's very specially picking away
from the default so presumably you're
investing a little bit more in terms of
year about a no effort career that is
exactly the findings scenario see he's a
natural analyst that was that hard to
figure but okay so when I shared this
with one of my developers back at Oracle
headquarters the guy said oh that's not
interesting and I said how can that not
be interesting he said actually what's
interesting is what shell tool they use
yeah or text editor yeah so which teller
is a sublime typically whoever I use
most the time him I'm I've use Emacs
I'm not a VI person and yeah I was going
to but yeah probably these days I'd say
sublime alright so when is the next
month fest the next micawber fest is in
october we actually have a iot event in
september and london the months before
that all right well thanks so much it
was great getting together with you know
my pleasure
okay talk to you soon yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
