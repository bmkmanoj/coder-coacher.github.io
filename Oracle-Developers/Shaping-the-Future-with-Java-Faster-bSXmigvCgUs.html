people this is my evil doppelganger look
no seriously it you know it's sort of
like Ken was talking about earlier
that's kind of how I looked you know
when I started this job and it's really
you know don't start a job like this
you'll like grow a beard and it'll turn
gray and it's it's really really
difficult this next slide is uh it's
switched over the wrong way here we go
is always fun so please memorize this
there'll be a quiz I like to start first
of all just to reflect a little bit on
on the things that Ken was talking about
here because for us you know ken is
really kind of typifies the experience
we like to see that people have which
other right for him Java is not just a
tool that he uses it's something that he
clearly loves it's something that has
helped to shape his career and the
direction of it and you know basically
to summarize what he said at the end it
turned him from a really miserable
person in a bad situation to a guy who
just loves his life and you know it
really shows and and you know I'm
nothing that's gonna happen for everyone
who programs in Java but it could so you
know if you don't you might want to try
seriously though the the four things
that you see on this slide or some of
the things that we think about when we
think about the java community right and
all of the resources available one thing
that's important to us is communication
around java and you know this is kind of
one example that oracle funds the java
magazine which if you haven't checked it
out please do it's it's just a
tremendous tremendous resource it's
beautiful and it has great articles and
I didn't write any of them so I can I
can actually say that or I have it yet
anyway I've submitted but they'll never
take mine so in any event that there are
a lot of other publications that are
great
there are wonderful resources in the
user groups and in fact later today
there will be a Chicago Java user group
meeting it's I think it's six o'clock we
have some more information and I and
some other folks from my team will be
there to answer your questions so please
join us for that collaboration will Ken
mention that he's a job a champion for
anyone who who's not aware of this
program this is actually a program which
recognizes people who have been
instrumental in making java successful
and continue to do so and you know
typically this is people who have done
that not just as a part of their career
but or their sort of daily work but
people who have gone above and beyond
and this is a program that Oracle takes
part in and helps to fund but it really
is run by the Java champions themselves
so the people who are in that are chosen
by Java champions and and if you go and
look and see who some of the people are
there I think you'll recognize some of
the best speakers in the industry some
of the best minds in the industry and
and we really appreciate everything they
do final C here is his contribution and
I'm going to talk a little bit today
about open JDK because this is where the
the construction of Java really goes on
today and I think that this is actually
at the moment kind of a an underutilized
resource in terms of figuring out the
direction that Java is taking the design
decisions that are made you can see in
open JDK the current state of
development and the discussions around
new features it can help you understand
why certain decisions are made and
really get some insight you can even do
things like look at individual code
contributions patches and fixes as they
go in and even the code reviews so it's
a great place if you want to learn about
Java and you want to learn about its
direction to go and sign up for the
mailing lists and kind of understand
where things are headed
okay so this is sort of the Harper's
index of numbers around Java I won't go
into great detail here let's you know
just suffice it to say that in the last
just over two decades Java has gone from
you know something that was kind of new
and exciting and as Ken said small to
something that is big in every respect
sorry that was a not a very good joke in
fact you know Java is is tremendously
popular it is a great choice if you want
to learn a technology and know that
there's gonna be a lot of demand for
your expertise it's just a terrific
place to go and I think this is
something that you know we've always
viewed as an important facet of Java we
try to make Java something where the
programs that you write will continue to
work and the techniques that you learn
will continue to be relevant
even if new ones come along and in many
ways what we try to do is do a lot of
the heavy lifting so that when the
computing environment around you changes
you're someone insulated from that and
so this is I'll give you just an example
of this we saw an application that
camera at home now he said well I took
this code and it still ran and I think
what you fail to mention was the version
of Java that you were running was a
current one right it was probably Java 8
and when you originally wrote it it was
probably 1.2 it had swings so it had to
be one not two at least right so that's
you know that that seems really simple
and obvious but the more experience you
have in our industry the more you
realized that that's actually kind of an
anomaly it's something kind of special
when something that he wrote 20 years
ago he can just take and and run and it
still still works another example you
know as we move forward there are lots
of things around you that are changing
the hardware is changing the operating
systems are changing and in fact even
the
and language and api's are changing but
what we've tried to do is make it so
that your java program actually will
still work and be able to take advantage
of all of those things that are changing
around you so this is sort of something
that you know may not reflect on too
much but if you think about it as
hardware is improving software doesn't
necessarily automatically get all of
that improvement somebody is doing the
hard work of actually making it so that
your Java program converted into byte
codes and then into native code is
actually writing to use the
optimizations in the underlying hardware
and you know there's a lot of heavy
lifting that goes on there a lot of it
comes from my team but frankly with open
JDK a lot of it comes from the industry
as a whole and so what I mean by this is
if you go to open JDK you will see
people from work all taking part you'll
also see people from places like red Red
Hat and Microsoft taking part you'll
also see hardware manufacturers like
Intel and arm taking part and so you
know that's that's pretty neat and
pretty unique and it really can only
happen because of the open ecosystem
around the development of Java ok
so I mentioned this before Java
development is is done in the open and
increasingly so and I'll mention
something on that in a moment it's
evolving and and as Ken said there was a
little period there where not so much
what's happening there actually was a
lot happening then there were just not
new major versions of Java the VM was
continuing to evolve the implementation
of Java was evolving but essentially the
language in the API is we're not going
through a lot of change what we have
seen and what we're seeing increasingly
going forward is more change more rapid
change and hopefully more rapid change
that improves your life doesn't make it
harder and so you know what I'm pleased
to say is we have a lot of tools in the
Java ecosystem to make sure that
as we're moving into the more rapid
change with six-month releases that is
something that happens in a way that
that works smoothly I'll give you an
example of this has anyone heard of the
TCK do you know what that is okay so
only one person and he works for me so
that doesn't count
so the the D CK or sometimes it's also
called J ck is a compatibility test kit
for Java it is something that we've
built up over the last 20 years it has
literally hundreds of thousands of tests
that test compatibility of the Java
implementation to make sure that it is
consistent across different operating
systems and platforms and windowing
systems and also across versions of Java
so this is something and this this
sounds really simple and obvious right
of course there's a test suite but keep
in mind this is a test suite testing and
implementation against the specification
of Java now how many of you you know on
a daily basis read the Java
specification a lot of people well I'm
not surprised by that there's I will say
a colleague of mine here on the front
row who is heartbroken to hear this
because he spends a good deal of his
time making sure that the Java
specification is up-to-date that it is
complete that it is good and consistent
and coherent and in fact I'm going to
bring him up to say a few words in a few
in a moment here so he can he can the
moon the fact that you don't all read
the specification every single day
having said that you shouldn't have to
right nobody should have to but it is
there and it is fairly unique I think
you'll find for programming languages
that Java has this and it is something
that means that we are have you know a
great resource to be able to tell as
we're making changes whether those
changes are going to break you or not
and try to make sure that we're we're
not breaking things so you know
essentially our goal is as we're moving
more quickly to make sure that we're
doing so methodically and carefully and
in a way that's that's making
improvements I'm going to also mention
scalability because I think that this is
something that we've sort of noticed
over the past probably three or four
years you know we see the other
programming languages that are out there
and that have gained some traction can
mention Ruby there are certain certainly
others that were recently have been
getting a lot of enthusiasm and noise
and this we actually think is great we
have a lot of those are actually built
on the JVM some of them are not but I
will say that there's a tremendous
community around programming language
development most of those folks all kind
of know each other many of them are
actually on speaking terms which is is
great in fact more than that we we
actually have a small conference which
we've hosted for almost a decade now
where people who are working on
programming languages get together and
talk about their experiences because you
know this is something where you know we
think that most designers of programming
languages have more to learn from each
other from talking and sharing and kind
of understanding well you know what did
you guys try over here how did that work
has it gone well is it not gone well
what you know what new possibilities
that bring about what kinds of
challenges were inherent and and and so
that's kind of cool
one of the things we've seen with all of
these languages that have come around is
that many of them sort of they come
about there's a lot of enthusiasm and
kind of growing community around them
and then over time people kind of figure
out the things that they're good for and
maybe the things that are not quite as
good for one of the things that we've
seen is kind of an ongoing trend is a
lot of people trying these out as a way
of getting more rapid development right
this is something that really supports
me I can I don't have to write as much
code it does a lot of things for me but
then often that is is great when you're
getting started and you just want to get
something up and running because
nobody's gonna keep funding you if they
can't
see that you built anything on the other
hand the next step is going from that to
you know hundreds of thousands tens of
thousands hundreds of thousands millions
hundreds of millions of users and when
you need to get to that level of
scalability many of these tools that are
new or have not quite gotten to the
point of maturity yet where they can
handle that and so a lot of people have
been turning to Java so we've we found
there sort of a complete group of people
who maybe weren't introduced to Java
maybe they you know thought it didn't
seem that appealing it was like man my
mom wrote in that language I don't want
to write in that language but you know
now they found that you know when they
really need something that's going to
support them for the next stage of their
growth they turned to Java as as that
thing our goal now is actually to get
back to the point where people never
need to make that first step of choosing
wrong and they can just choose Java from
the beginning so that's part of what the
six-month releases are about is making
it so that some of the small
improvements that we do you don't have
to wait for two or three years for them
to become available to you in a ga
version instead you can get them right
off the bat okay this is also something
we're seeing as as people move to the
cloud is you know very interestingly
there are a bunch of clouds out there
that are provided by vendors other than
us I know that comes as a surprise but
in fact there are and in fact what we
tend to see is a lot of noise from many
of those vendors about Java and you know
part of the reason is what they tend to
find is that a lot of the workloads that
people run in the cloud are actually
Java workloads
okay so on the platform side what are
some of the things we're investing in
well I I want to say first and foremost
that security is always our number-one
priority
so you know we will always if we have a
choice between working on making
something more secure or adding a new
API we always will work on security
first and I think we're gonna see that
that becomes even more important in the
cloud I think there's stuff in the news
about this even today and the fact that
there's a debate about whether that's a
security breach or not is an interesting
one but I do think it's it's kind of
undeniable that you know security is one
of the most important topics in our in
our industry working on developer
productivity and compatibility right so
compatibility I just mentioned also
trying to find the places where you know
Java rightfully was given kind of a
reputation as boilerplate heavy or you
know being very verbose and not in a
good way we've been working on ways to
slim that down and make the compiler and
the runtime smarter so that you don't
have to write as much increasing density
now this also is is a very very
important topic as you're going to the
cloud basically the more you can get
running on less computing resources
unless you're going to have to pay for
in the cloud and and that's always good
same thing with startup time as we're
seeing people run some kinds of
workloads there are smaller things that
need to just come up do something and
then go away you want to make sure that
the overhead of startup time each time
is is not eating a lot of resources also
work on predictability I'm gonna mention
this a little bit later we're gonna talk
about it some more and and finally
making sure that what you're running is
actually something that where you can
understand what's going on
so flight recorder JFR and Mission
Control are two important parts of that
so at JavaOne last year a few months ago
is basically September so just about the
time that that Java 9 came out we
announced a couple of pretty important
things
one of those things was that we would
start Oracle would start someone is
getting a call here whose phone is this
you want your phone here you go
ken is calling I should have answered
that would have been fun all right so
yeah so so we announced that Oracle is
going to start producing open JDK builds
and in fact that is something that we're
doing you can go and get Oracle built
and tested open JDK bills and those are
always going to be at the latest Java
level we are all toll icing licensing
those under an open-source license and
that of course means that you can take
them and use them according to that
license for pretty much anything you
want there are of course obligations
that the GPL imposes so that's good to
be aware of we also took a set of
features that we had that previously
were commercial and closed source and
we've opened those up so I'm gonna talk
in a moment about some of those and then
the final thing here is is you know as I
mentioned open JDK is a large community
and it's a community of a bunch of
companies but also a lot of individuals
who've gotten together in order to to
implement Java
okay so Java 9 the last version that
came out of course brought us the jigsaw
module system this is something that
we've seen in the past six months a lot
of people playing with experimenting
with trying it out swapping war stories
are one of our goals in this really was
to make the transition fairly easy so it
was an important design criteria that it
not be all or nothing right we didn't
want you to have to go and and go
through an entire exercise and
modularizing all of your code and having
the whole industry have to do that in
order for you to be able to start and so
a good deal of the work and why it took
so long to deliver was making sure that
it would be possible for you to start
using it without Marshall rising and
then start to modernize pieces as you
went along and allow the industry as a
whole to do that without having some
kind of big bang
moment and in fact we used it as well
to modularize the jdk itself okay and
you know this this sounds obvious maybe
it sounds trivial but in fact it was
quite a large exercise so you know we
found that in fact it took us a couple
of major releases to actually go through
the JDK am fine places where there were
dependencies that we weren't even aware
of and clean those up and basically get
to the point where it could be
modularized now why is this important
well we talked about smaller footprint
and higher density right we talked about
security
well actually having a modules JDK is
important here in fact what you want to
be able to do and what Java 9 lets you
do with jigsaw and with j-link
is basically create a custom runtime
that has all and only the pieces that
your application needs right now why is
that important what of course it becomes
smaller it also becomes more secure
because you know if you don't need say
the desktop module for graphical user
interfaces you don't have to bring that
with you you just need the pieces that
are there and so if there are
vulnerabilities that crop up in those
areas you can rest assured that you know
that code is not even there so that is
not a vulnerability that affects you
this I think is something that we're
gonna see becoming even more important
as we're going forward okay there are a
few other features in nine
I'm not gonna go through that but of
course you know 9 was a big release it
had a lot in it it took us multiple
years to deliver and so in fact there's
a tremendous amount there and by the way
I think I have to give a talk and talk
about containers right so a lot of what
is there and a lot of the things that
we're working on going forward are
actually thinking about things that can
help Java play well in a containerized
world okay and that's really because
we're expecting to see some of these
aspects right it basically becomes very
very important for Java to be able to
understand what kind of environment it's
running in and for you to be able to
tailor what you're doing into the kind
of environment that that containers
afford you and I think we're actually
gonna have a number of talks I see
somebody here today in an orange jacket
who's going to talk and there are two
guys in orange jacket
only one of them will be giving a talk
on containers I bet though okay so so
why does this help well of course you
know you get all of the benefits of a
managed language and runtime right but
you also have a language which is
hardware and operating system agnostic
in fact you get the kind of safety and
security that the JVM gives you but with
reliability with compatibility and a
tremendous echo system available to you
so you don't have to write everything
yourself you know if you need something
there's a really good chance that
there's a library a framework out there
that provides it for you already so this
is something that we're committed to
going forward you know we see the great
use that people are making of Java in
big data and machine learning and that
kind of you know super large heap
environment but we also see people using
Java extensively for things like micro
services and using things in containers
and so we're we're really focused on
trying to understand the things that we
can do in Java that
make that better as as we go forward
okay so I mentioned earlier open
sourcing commercial features I'm gonna
mention a couple of those now
Mission Control and flight recorder so
flight recorder is actually this now
this sounds like well you know I've seen
a hundred things out there that tell me
what's going on and help me diagnose
performance and threading issues and
that kind of stuff in the JVM the
difference about this is the flight
recorder actually uses the data that the
JVM itself is generating in order to
make decisions about when to optimize
you know what code paths are hot when
memory allocations are occurring when a
garbage collection is occurring and so
many of the other things you'll see out
there are sort of an extra layer that's
collecting more information and that you
know can be a huge source of overhead
and in fact that overhead itself can
actually change the behavior of the JVM
so that what you end up debugging is
something completely different from what
happens when that debugging information
is not there when you use flight
recorder you don't have to do that right
it is using information that's already
collected by the VM it's just surfacing
it in a way that you can access with a
tool like Mission Control also being an
open source which will allow you to
really dive into depth and kind of
understand what's what's going on class
data sharing this is is basically
something that allows you to take the
code of your application and put it into
a shareable library write a dynamic link
library and so what that allows you then
to do is share the code not only of the
the JDK but also of your application
across multiple instances that are
running in the same operating system or
even across operating systems so again
that helps a lot in the startup time it
helps a lot in reducing overhead and
footprint and then usage tracker is
something that that we built and have
used at Oracle and now it's being open
sourced it allows you to keep track of
how many VMs you're actually running and
where they're running and what versions
are running and other stuff like that
okay so if any of you I'm sure probably
a lot of you just before coming into
this said gosh
I'd really like to download Java and so
you went to a site like the Oracle site
and you said I'm gonna download it this
is what you saw no that's kind of
exciting but you know it feels a little
old and stale to me I mean this is like
6 months old right that's no good so I
think we should do something about that
in fact Alex could you come up here this
is Alex Buckley and I think I want I
want you to help could you just can you
press that yeah press the big green
button all right and we had a long time
figuring out oh now look at that
somebody has press it again that's no
good yeah somebody's trolling us all
right okay well there we go so now what
will the page look like even more
exciting let's see Oh
all right Java tan
alright this is not live but it would
actually it may be as we speak actually
live if somebody wants to check it if
it's not don't say anything all right
we'll put it this way by the time we're
eating lunch today it will look like
this and in fact even more exciting I
mean this is all kind of commercial and
stuff can we like shouldn't there be an
open-source version - all right there we
go
this is the open JDK site and general
availability of Java 10 at at what time
1020 all right right so I you know Alex
I think what would be kind of fun here
is maybe we can talk a little bit about
what's in 10 and I think the first thing
to notice I remember that big long list
of stuff that was in 9 the list that is
in 10 is a little more svelte it's kind
of yeah it's you know it's slimmer it's
but it's very good and so why don't you
uh can you can you who can not hear me
excellent no one can not hear me
everyone can play me good so my name is
Alex Buckley I work in the Java language
team and my day job so to speak is to
edit the Java language specification so
I am I wouldn't say heartbroken that
people are not reading it again it's
quite a few references also who who is
using a stack overflow regularly yeah
that's that's a lot of hands
I'm always actually pleased to see the
linking directly to 841 a method
overriding so let me talk about the most
fun and develop a focused feature of
Java 10 we often hear the criticism the
Java is too verbose has too much
redundancy and we can't change the Java
language overnight but if you've looked
at Java rates then you'll know that
lambdas and streams were pretty
successful down payments on reducing
that of debt of redundancy and the main
trick that lambdas have for avoiding
redundancy it's type inference now Java
is statically typed and always will be
but you can see that in short snippets
like I'm passing to the filter and map
methods they're just as readable without
explicit types and declarations than if
I had to say what the type of the block
and the type of blue ah now of course
the the types are still there but the
compiler infers them so that your IDs
can can still work well that was all
pretty successful so in 10 we're
introducing the VAR keyword to bring
type inference to local variables this
is the most frequently requested feature
from developers coming to Java from
other languages Scala and c-sharp and
even C++ all have this feature now Java
is late to the party on purpose because
when you're adding features to the
number one programming language in the
world and you're adding those features
for all time the cost of a mistake is
very high
so we think very carefully and
cautiously before adding a feature even
as small as this one keyword to the Java
language we've seen developers coming
from those other languages is that once
you've used this feature it's hard to
live without now some people will freak
out at the loss of type information who
is freaking out right now there are
hands not many hands thank you but thank
you for being honest because I mean
seriously because Java is not just a
tickly type but it's it's always had you
know types to the left and to the right
and to the up and to the down but if you
think about it what's important in short
snippets of code like this is it the
types of the local variables all their
names we would argue that it's really
the names because as you read the code
and bear in mind the Java principle the
reading is more important than writing
as you read the code you're looking for
the names in the flow of the code the
types of the local variables are often
just implementation details if you
choose reasonable names for your local
variables and often the code with var is
more readable than the code with
explicit types at the top because
there's none of the repetition between
the type name and the variable name and
the brevity of our increases the
prominence of the variable names so this
is in Java 10 it's in at least one noted
IDE right now I encourage you to try it
out and with that I'll hand back to
George thank y'all
what Alex wasn't gonna say it also lines
up really nicely okay and for anyone
who's curious I mentioned the
development being done in open JDK that
means you can actually go and read the
JEP that is the JDK enhancement proposal
which talks in quite some detail about
the design and design decisions made and
in fact you'll see you can see that as
well for some of the other features that
are our intent
okay and the next thing that I wanted to
mention and I'm actually going to bring
another colleague up on stage to talk a
little bit about this so we've done a
bunch of work on garbage collection and
specifically the g1 garbage collector in
intense so I'd like to invite Charlie
hunt to come and talk about that Chicago
local Charlie hunt all right
thanks George his house working up here
kind of felt like Jim Valvano on he's SP
speech but I don't think I'll have
something as entertaining us as Jim
would have to say up here so in in jdk
10 we made some really nice improvements
with g1 the one that's getting a lot of
attention is is we've multi-threaded the
full GC so if you're having to get to
that situation where do you want us got
to go into a full GC it's now
multi-threaded there's some other things
that we've done to reduce pause times or
we've refactored some code or we're in
pauses in g1 which make those pauses
faster what you're going to see out of
that is because g1 is time based you
know so you set a goal for a pause time
so you say ok so my pauses are gonna get
faster okay but how does that work with
a pause time goal what's going to end up
happening is you'll have less frequent
GCS because you're able to do more work
in other words you're going to collect
more regions if you remember g1 is is
region-based
so you'll have less frequent GCS another
exciting thing in the area of garbage
collectors as you see on the slide here
there's a project called z GC z GC
borrows from the name of the ZFS file
system from solaris
DGC is a low latency garbage collector
so if you're in this realm of you're
looking for lower latency than what you
can achieve with with g 1c GC is worth
taking a look at although it's a new
project you might think well there's a
lot of work that goes on with collectors
there's a lot of evolution or maturity
that has to go along with collectors z
GC is very well along its way to being
mature I've been beating on this thing
on an awful lot over the last year and
I'm really impressed with it it's it
really is closing the gap in that need
of low latency I think with that I think
I'll turn it back over to you all right
thanks Ron
okay and in addition I should mention
the code for z GC
is in open JDK and in fact there are
also early access binaries that are
available so you can take that you can
download it and try it today as well as
binaries for other some other projects
and in fact with that let's look a
little bit into into the future here so
Java 11 well what do we know about John
11 and we know one thing about it it's
coming in six months six months from
today I think and in fact it doesn't
have very much in it yet and the reason
I say yet is because the model that we
have with these time-based releases is
essentially that features are not added
to a release until they're done so
basically you can see that in fact 11
already has a few things that are passed
the gate and over time it will have some
more things it probably will be roughly
the kind of size that 10 is so it's not
gonna you know be like 9 and that's
intentional again
we want to make sure that you're seeing
rapid evolution and getting features
into your hands quickly but making sure
that the features you are getting are
well tested well thought-out well
designed well specified and and and so
again you won't see features coming into
the 11 early access builds which by the
way are available on about a weekly
basis and until those features are are
really done and really solid and those
early access bills are provided so that
you can test them early so that you can
try them out and understand how they're
going to affect you or what what
possibilities they bring to you and so
that you can give us feedback so even if
you don't want to come to open JDK and
start you know hacking on the JVM a
great thing that you can do to help
yourself and to help folks in the
community is testing and giving feedback
of those early access bills okay so out
even past eleven what are some of the
areas that we're looking at I'm just
going to mention a few things very
quickly one of the the things that we
think is a a big challenge that we are
tackling with I think you called it what
was it the Brian gets down payment
system you know basically doing small
bits that were biting off in each of
these smaller releases as as they come
along is actually working on object data
layout and what I mean by that is let's
see if you were to look at the way that
Java the Java Runtime lays out memory
and puts objects into memory and then
you were to look at what Hardware
designers think of in terms of how they
think data should be processed and the
kinds of optimizations they're putting
in these two things actually don't go
that well together
Java essentially from it's very
beginning had as a a philosophy that
there were primitive types and there
were object types and you know you were
kind of one or the other primitives gave
you you know the possibility for great
speed they essentially were native
and handled that way by the runtime
objects were not objects gave you a lot
of flexibility but sometimes could be a
challenge for performance because the
runtime had to make assumptions about
them and what it could do with them
things like garbage collection right so
basically what we're looking at doing is
understanding that in the past 20 years
the world has changed and the biggest
change is that CPUs have gotten a lot
faster but memory access has not really
in fact things have gotten very
complicated in hardware design with all
kinds of levels of caches that the
hardware uses to be able to do things
more quickly so it really becomes a
problem for a managed runtime of trying
to make sure that the memory you want to
do work on say you have a large
collection of objects is all actually
properly aligned and available to the
CPU that's going to do an operation on
this set of data so that it can do it
really really quickly for you as a Java
programmer you don't get to make those
decisions of where things are and how
they're actually represented we want to
make sure that Java is doing a great job
of this for you and make it so that you
can just write natural great Java code
and the runtime will do the magic to
make the performance be excellent so we
think that part of this the next step
here is basically making it so that you
can indicate certain kinds of data where
you're prepared to give up a little bit
of flexibility that you get with objects
in order to have better performance and
so what will happen eventually is some
of these more complex data types than
primitives you'll be able to indicate
are something that the the runtime can
actually deal with in a way that allows
it to make it very compact that makes it
possible to fit a lot of data into a
cache line so that the hardware can
process it really really quickly when
it's needed to the main key here is
basically giving up object identity in
order to embrace immutability and I
think that you know this is something if
you're interested in this look for talks
on project
Halla its you can think of value types
here and you can actually go to OpenJDK
and see the ongoing work on this and in
fact even bills that have early
prototypes of this today another area
that we feel is important is native
interrupts so ken mention earlier j'ni
Java native interface he said try not to
use it it's really painful I can
actually tell you because I was there at
the time that the Java native interface
was not really designed to make it easy
to to call between Java and native
languages and in fact it is possible to
do much better and we think now is the
time to do so so we have a project
called Panama which is working on doing
exactly this and you can kind of imagine
the way this works is you sort of feed a
particular tool a header file a native
header file and it basically creates
everything for you in order to make it
so that you can call back and forth
between native and Java and use data
between native and Java but in a way
that is both more performant and also
more secure than what J&amp;amp;I lets you do
today
another process that's project Panama
you can check that out a final project
to mention here is loom and this is this
is about bringing fibers to the JVM so
basically it's about letting you do
things with extremely lightweight
threads very very lightweight to create
invoke and switch between and and so
that's something that we think will be
sort of the next evolution of support
for parallelism in in Java ok so finally
just to kind of bring it all together
here we see these trends in computing
and we are always looking at ways to try
to make sure that Java is bringing you
the possibility of taking advantage of
those things right so we want to always
make sure that as new
things are coming down the pipe whether
it be new hardware or new programming
models that Java gives you support but
in a way that as Alex said is very
thoughtful and you know we're we're
designing not just for the thing that's
trendy this year but for the programs
that you know 20 years from now one of
you is going to be standing up on stage
and showing a program that you wrote in
2018 and it's still gonna be running on
the latest the latest version of java by
that point we'll probably what will we
be will be it like Java like 400 or
something it's gonna be awesome okay so
in any in any rate thank you very much
congratulations to everyone for getting
to this point where we have Java 10 and
I wanted to mention a few talks that are
going on so please check these out and
as I mentioned there will be a Chicago
Java user group session at the end of
the day where you can come and enjoy
some beverages and also ask us questions
so with that I'm going to hand it back
to Gerald and don't go because he has
some important things to say right
