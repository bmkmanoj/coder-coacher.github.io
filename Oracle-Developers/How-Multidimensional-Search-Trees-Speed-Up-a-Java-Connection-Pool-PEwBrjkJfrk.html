your attention I'll try to make this
presentation is interesting as possible
and
my name is URI dog of a pretty print
principal member of technical staff and
pipe and I work for jdbc and you CP
group and here is my co speaker hi
Samantha he's a director of product
management in the very same group so we
we provide a great way from from Java to
database basically so and today I'm
going to speak about some optimization
approaches for the connection pools
database connection pools I think these
approaches have a kind of more common
importance because they can be used in
some different applications so
connection pooling is the common
approach of of saving on database
connection creation because database
connection creation is typically a very
expensive operation so why not you keep
working set of several open connections
and share them between user sessions
like website user session or something
like this so and because a limited
number of connections are shared in
between lots of user sessions the the
most common point is to save on borrowed
time so as quickly you borrow connection
as as better and of course you need to
return it back to a pool as quickly as
possible as well so and so we're gonna
we're going to talk today about several
topics the first topic is KD trees these
are basically
multi-dimensional trees which index
points that are located in a several
dimensions not necessarily 3d three
spatial dimensions but let's say sixteen
dimensions or something like that and
not necessarily special special
dimensions but lexicographical
dimensions or time dimensions or so so
the first topic of my presentation would
be about KD trees in common so they come
from computer graphics but we are going
to use it in in a kind of unusual way
and so then the next topic would be
about this unusual approach so the the
multidimensional three in in a space of
connection pooling and what what
dimensions of what dimensions are what
what we're gonna what what three
dimensions are here the third topic
would be about wait freedom so this
thing the connection the core of
connection pool is completely weight
free and then the three
multi-dimensional tree is is also a
weight free and the everything is
weighed three it's a connection who is
pretty complex piece of software there
are thousands and thousands of lines of
Java code and there is no a single
synchronized keyword in this code base
how can we do this I'll try to I'll try
to describe so and fourth topic is about
collecting everything like trees a pool
itself and how trees index a pool itself
so a pool pool is linear and there is a
there is a next level of
multi-dimensional trees and
dimensional trees reference to some
slots in a book and how it works I'll
try to describe it and the fifth topic
is about benchmark results so how what
kind of effect does it bring to us and
so benchmark would demonstrate that we
gain significant performance and also we
gain such thing as scalability so we
deal with 10,000 users connections as
well as with five user connection there
is no big difference it's it's not an
issue for a regularly implemented pool
with with with synchronization and
typical approaches like Java collections
arcing or other things so let's let's
start with with the problem here is the
problem it's a its benchmark which opens
which creates five connections so we do
with five connections and x-axis is a
number of threads so from ten threads to
ten thousand threads and y axis shows
the how many bottles per second you can
do so this benchmark is does does
nothing with a database it just borrows
connections and you turn is it returns
it back in in a concurrent manner so
there are ten thousand threads borrowing
connections at the same time and there
is only five connections available so
with with 10 and 50 connections the
number of burrows per second is is
pretty is pretty high like 200,000 and
as soon as we grow up
user sessions it degrades let me tell
how this pool is implemented this is a
UCP 11 204 this is a standard Java
collection and user session is
attempting to find a first available
connection to grab and grab it and
market world so once once it it is
looking for a connection it needs to
synchronise to walk that connection and
modify it I mean tried tries to set
borrowed flag on it and other threads
are waiting until this slot is is
available again so this is the problem
another problem there are two problems
in this presentation another problem is
let's suppose we have solved the
previous problem it was solved in 12 102
but the pool was sequential and what if
we want some some selective connections
not not any connection like it like in a
previous benchmark in a benchmark we we
were looking for for any connection the
all connections were equal in this
particular case connections are
different and they are labeled so we are
we here we are looking for a
specifically labeled connection so and
with sequential who we are having
problems once a pool size is growing
from 50 to 500 connections the baro baro
time becomes bigger so we need to index
it some way how can we index it there is
a java map it's it's a pretty standard
solution but we have several things 22
index like for example give me
connections from instance one with label
blue which costs 75 or give me
connections from instance to away both
green cost zero and it should live up at
least 10 seconds because it could be
invalidated in 10 seconds so these are
dimensions instance label cost and time
out connection timeout so I i would say
that there could be 16 such dimensions
at least in a connection pool so let's
talk about KD trees KD trees are
basically a graphical thing it's pretty
well-known there is nothing new about it
it's very well described in Wikipedia
and it it's basically used in such
things like geography astronomy geology
computer graphics and the artificial
intelligence so there are there are some
references by the way this is an article
about KD trees the second is is an
article about skip list skip list is
also a very very famous thing it's about
some set of data which is organized in
several lists and several lists are
having a subset of subsets of this data
we're going to use ke skip lists and a
third is a very good article in the
journal of computer graphics
technologies it's it describes KD trees
in a very detail and it describes its
implementation it suggests some self
balancing algorithms and so on it's very
interesting article and I would HIGHLY
recommend you to to read it so let's
start with KD trees k d-q this is
basically a kg three is a basically very
simple thing it's it's a generalization
of a binary tree but the difference is
that on this level we index by X for
example for for two dimensional space so
this these points are two dimensional so
for the first dimension so we index this
X and X dimension then a level lower we
index by Y dimension and then the level
lower that one we index it by X
dimension again so that's how it is
built so you built is just just the
modifying the accesses maybe I mean
changing changing the axises changing
the dimensions so on you can you can
have as many dimensions as you want the
only restriction here that the more
dimensions you have the bigger is a tree
so if there are too many dimensions you
have another performance problem because
three is bigger so a navigation is
longer right so so you should be very
cautious about the number of dimensions
so as for connection pool I have lots of
things to index through KD trees but so
far I index them by database instances
labels connection costs and and that's
it so far so but there are things for
accusation coming so with KD trees we we
might have a simple search like like in
a Java map so we can solve the problem
finding a point here by a regular Java
map so
you just specify a point object with the
coordinates you implement equals and
hashcode hashcode and put that point in
a map nothing not not a problem but
there are two different kind of searches
the next search is the nearest neighbor
search for example the point 5 3 is a
nearest-neighbor of point seven two but
not a nearest point 481 so and the most
important thing is a range search so we
can specify a range and find a sub set
of points that satisfy that range so
very basically the range search looks
like a database select statement select
onion give me a number of employees of
sailings sales department that which
salaries are in between that value and
that value so we can we can do this with
kg trees but we don't need to have a
in-memory database or something KD trees
are something that helps us to do
similar things with a comparatively
small amount of data which is the issue
for I mean which is the key which is
exactly the use case of connection poles
so here's here is how we are doing range
searches so the points in between range
35 x axis X and 28 x XS why so there are
there only two points so this is a
recursive navigation we are just looking
for appropriate points changing changing
the axises for each level X then Y then
back back to X again so I think it's
pretty easy
you know kg is a little bit more
complicated and I am just on just
describing some very basics of it and
you should you should read the wikipedia
article and this computer a journal
article so how do we apply KD trees to
connection pools let's let's talk about
labeling so as i already told
connections are not equal for example
some connections could be preheated for
some specific kind of operations and
some convention connections could be
preheated for another kind of operation
so it would be more beneficial for some
special operations to find some special
connections so we do we do labelling for
that so we can label some subset of
connections with a specific label and
some another subset of connections with
another specific label and if there is a
shortage of connections with a specific
label appu could give an application a
cost cost to repurpose a connection from
one label to another so a cost could be
in between 0 and 100 zero cost mean
means that this is exact connection as
esse 1 and 100 means that this
connection there is no way of
repurposing this connection to a
required label and there are some costs
in between so
labeling could be used for anything you
know it's it's a pretty abstract feature
of the UCP also there are so full with
labeling we we have we have two
dimensions a label a connection could
have several labels but we can we can
put this connection into many points of
a three for each label so a label is one
dimension lexicographical dimension
because labels are our strings and
another dimension is a cost so we
already have two dimensions now for UCP
UCP can I mean connection pool can
handle clusters and clusters bring us
for more dimensions database instance a
database a host and the service so for
more dimensions and of course there
could be more dimensions like like as i
said as i said like time out of
connection validity or things like that
there are several time outs and here
here is the here is the kg three with
three dimensions as an example so it's a
instance its label and it's a cost so we
have instance one instance three
instance one instance three label japan
USA and and the cost and for example we
are doing a range search for instance
one a label and costs in between 0 and
75 a red shows how we do this so this is
X Y
X Y and so on so read show what what we
have chosen with the range search now
and now everything is weighed three so
as as I said I I use a kind of approach
for organizing a connection pool which
doesn't doesn't use synchronization here
is here is here is the here is what I am
going to tell so there are there are not
synchronized words this also also there
are there are no other locks any locks
from Java API there are no semaphores
and basically there are no common Java
collections regular variables are good
atomic variables atomic references
Otoniel atomic billions are also good I
prefer to use one one directional grow
only self-made linked lists and why is
that because synchronized when two
threads are trying to are trying to
enter a critical section there are lots
of context switches in between threads
and this slows down the execution you
can there is an analogy of threads flow
is like is like a river flow and if you
hold a critical section for a long time
it's like a boulder in a river but if
you hold a data for a very short time
which is typically recommended you can
use I mean it's fine to use synchronized
sections but hold data for a very
our time but a show holding data for a
very short time it's not a boulder but
it's but it's you a pebble and it brings
it brings some turbulence in the river
flow and the turbulence loans down only
stagey water flow is fast so to make it
steady not try not to put even pebbles
in a riverbed so that's why it's it's
like a sport for me never never your
synchronized and the only way to
synchronize for me is just using Atomics
it's very it's very challenging
programming wait three programming is
like as someone wrote an article it's
like programming 21st century and things
something like that so anyway so never
using organization what atomic
synchronized frequently code is very
contagious that's what I've told you so
let's let's look at this so this is the
grow only one direction or linked list
it's empty so far so we are trying to
add an element so we create a slot we we
make it resolved so to make it resolved
there is a there is an atomic reference
and I write a third a third object in it
so if that atomic reference is filled by
a by a thread object it means that this
slot is resolved by this thread
now we put some we put some detail on it
so we modify and we release it so we we
put a note in that atomic reference so
there are two threads attempting to
write data so the first thread is going
through this because it's filled up
already and it builds another slot this
is one directional a linked list so it
builds another slot reserves it mean
meaning it writes its I mean it writes
itself into have reference another
thread that's a signal taneously it goes
through the first slot because it's
filled already and once it discovers
that another slot is reserved it goes
all over it and build another floor so
it serves it writes data so they both
write data and release it now for thread
one of them deletes and write data so
one delete and three and three threads
right data so now we have a list of six
slots with five elements
so now when when the threat is looking
for for a room or is looking for for for
a data which is required it goes over
reserved slots what was going to happen
with resort slots each threats builds
revisit q revisit list this list of
slots that are supposed to be revisited
so once once a threat going is going
through the whole list and finds nothing
and there is still something some slots
that are not visited yet so a thread
visits them releases them and if it's
happy it finds what he's looking for it
is looking for if it's not then another
religion another revisit and another
religion so of course it could be
configurable because number of revisits
it's expensive so this approach allows
every thread to progress every time and
there is there is nothing to wait for so
let's put all things together so I was
talking about revisit queues and now
let's let's consider revisit use as skip
lists
yes uh-huh yes
yes because because the thread thread
resource and slot can you repeat the
question that's it was it was more like
a statement yeah it exactly it's not a
question why Kristina yes yes that's
really a statement is the main benefit
the fact that you don't use
synchronization there is no way that
area yeah and actually there isn't
signalization because once one thread
reserves a slot it writes itself so this
slot is not accessible by other threads
you feel free to change anything in that
slot because that's a guarantee that
nobody would draw would make an attempt
to write into it one question here and
then there
yes yeah so the question is when you
reserve you just done a flag yeah it's
not basically a flag it's a it's a
reference to a thread object yeah and
other other threads before before trying
to attempt this slot they look into that
reference if it's now well we we can
reserve it if it's not now it's too late
to reserve it and then we gonna revisit
it and of course of course this atomic
reference separation is implemented like
compare compare and swap God compare and
set this is this is a hardware operation
it's very effective I mean most of
architectures implement that on a
hardware level only on the RISC
processors implement implemented in
software so for escs maybe we are a
little bit slow but but still it's it's
it's a good solution for the rest of
architectures it's a hardware it's very
fast question uh-huh
a list itself a next link is also an
atomic reference so it's it's I think I
think it's it's pretty fine to implement
handmade list with with the ability to
to remove those holes but in my
particular application I didn't want
this because every hole is supposed to
be filled up with something new when you
add when you add it and even in order
not to start looking for the very stuff
when you update a list in order not to
look from the very start I remember the
first empty slot to be filled up if
there is if there is a requirement for
that I mean if there is an operation to
feel to fill it up any more questions so
let me cancel one oh sorry
repeat yeah so the question is the
typical use case what is the typical use
case so in my so my application is about
connection connection pooling so it's
it's a cache of connections but of
course this this thing has a bigger me
and now he's asking is it the average
case a large scale carnation dwelling
where you have lot of activities it's a
large scale so I was talking about ten
thousand threads it ten thousand threads
of the big number it's really big number
yes I even excuse me is your question
answered okay when questioned he
so the question is why don't you use the
concurrent connect collection I don't
remember right now why I didn't use it
because I implemented it as a year back
and wait freedoms I was reporting right
freedom a year back and jerra 150 Joanne
2015 my guess was that a a little bit
too heavy weighted because you know Java
API collections they are very good no
questions about it but they are for
general usage and my goal was to to gain
as much performances as possible so I
preferred a very very simple things to
use so handmade when the directional
list is very simple it's just like 10 10
lines of code so that's that's probably
why in law in my previous session a year
back someone asked me why i use
concurrent maps but concurrent maps do
not implement that skipping so it was
interesting for me to implement this is
keeping algorithm so you once a slot is
resort you skip it you run over it and
keep progressing through the rest of the
list so and that's that's why and so do
you mind if I continue one more question
I here we have 27 minutes so we have
time yeah go ahead
let go free how can you clean it again
repeat if it's it so if if a slot is
empty can a thread can progress with it
right yeah of course yeah a thread 11 a
thread wants to to write something into
this structure it of course considers
writing into those empty slots for the
first this is the first thing for a
thread to fill up those holes and one
well while thread is is attempting to
write something into this slot it looks
in that reference of whether it's resort
or not if it's not reserved of course a
thread writes something adega into it
yes yes yeah that's a linear that's why
that's why we are talking about KD trees
so KD trees would would have that those
empty slots is this answer so let me let
me start at the next thing so this is
how skip list look like so again we we
have revisit revisit lists so
authorities looking through through that
structure and collect all those slots
which have been reserved at the moment a
thread was going through them so we
collect the list and this is this as a
kind of skip list it contains just a
subset of slots not not also slots and
this skip lists there could be as many
skip lists as as you want so we have as
many ski base as thirds are so but we're
gonna we're going to skip lists as
kg three leaves so kg three points to
skip lists with connections of the same
quality for example if there is a subset
of connections on instance one with the
label Japan and with costs 50 so there
are 55 connections so there is a skip
list of those connections pointing to
the long common structure right so
that's what skip lists are and skip
lists a point I mean the 33 leads point
to appropriate skip lists so how it
works and now a benchmark results so the
first benchmark as i described i
described already ave at the start of
the session it's it's about borrowing
any connection on a linear on a linear
pool and there are just five available
connections and we grow the number of
accessing threads so this is how it was
in a bottom this is a number of burrows
per second it degrades once we increase
the number of accessing threads and here
is how it works with with with that r is
your friend skip approach so it's its
first of all it's scalable so it doesn't
degrade once we once we increase the
number of threads and also it's it's
just basically faster as for another
benchmark it's about a finding
connection with a proper label this is
also a significant gain so this is how
it was
blue line so the response time you
graduate with the number of connections
in a poll worker set working set and how
it became so it's now it's totally
scalable because all connections are
indexed in the in the cage III and you
are able to to find the proper
connection using several dimensions it's
become it's pretty much like a select
statement as I said it's like give me
the employees of Department sales with
the salaries from X to Y not older than
25 so so there is still lots of room to
optimize because with these kg trees I
can optimize not only connections but
for example borrow requests because
borrow requests are different because
application want different things also I
can I can are organized pull statistics
for predicting what connections are
needed to be opened so there could be
some prediction algorithm and I mean the
sky's the limit so that's over to the
hand things for you have 20 minutes we
can ask a lot of questions so is that
here
so explain how the KD tree search
algorithm works are it's pretty much
like a binary tree so you know in a
binary tree you just recursively
navigate through nodes and collect the
items that fit the ranges for the KD
tree it's it's this very same binary
tree but the levels of this EKG three
correspond to different dimensions the
very top is X dimension then y dimension
then Z dimension then again X dimension
why dimension Z dimension so while you
recursively look at the level X you can
pair X element with ranges and if it
fits you compare other other coordinates
with the ranges if it doesn't fit you
just skip it then you go to the next
level and then you compare the Y
dimension and so on does it answer your
question ok thank you there are many
question there lady the lady
uh-huh
no it's it's unlimited because a tree a
tree is unlimited it could be as deep as
possible I mean as deep as the ocean so
there's it's it's it's a it's a
indefinite a continuation in a recursive
manner so it's it's it's a recursive
navigation with changing with changing
coordinates one after another what it's
balanced a balance its balance if you if
you take care of it if you take care of
the balance because it's it's it's a
special problem it's very well known
problem so of course if if a tree has
been degraded into into how to say that
into a rope it's it's it's not a good
thing but yeah you should rebalance it
in my particular case the work the
working set of connections is a pretty
much stable so we don't refresh
connections basically for a long time so
once I create a tree it keeps unchanged
for a long time so there is not so many
modifications of a tree there are lots
of navigation operations not
modification but navigation there is a
question of it
so your question was about optimizing on
this on the same if if a query is is the
same for many requests you know you
realize that it doesn't change a tree
right three is is unchanging this big
because we are reading currently
currently I don't optimize on it because
it's hard to predict that the next query
would be exactly the same as the
previous one so there is no optimization
about it uh-huh yeah it's completely
synthetic they are not asking the same
thing they are scheme different bits
it's a random it's all right now so a
thread is a thread is looking for for
for a random instance for a random label
and for a random cost there is in
question there yes yeah
could you do when you build it louder
when you build a tree pre optimization
when you building the tree pre
optimization like sorry no I don't do a
premie optimization but I I mean I
understand your point because pre
optimization would bring more balanced
tree right not at this point probably it
would be a next iteration quite quite
frankly I did implement what is written
in the article i referenced this is this
is going to be my next iterate
development iteration so it's it's not
decided yet so far it's a question
yes it's it so it's in some form it's
already in in our label for 12 to now
you mean to have 20 to 12 to 12 202 yeah
because this one is for 12 to 0 1 and
you refer to weblogic and I know you
have more more cramming for this
particular label so it's so weblogic
they have their own connection pool but
they can use a UCP if they allow
customers to use UCP if they want to but
we do share a lot of code you know the
weblogic active grilling we shall out of
good yeah unfortunately this code is not
open source so it's pretty much
commercial but according to my
description it's pretty much easy to
implement a tree itself wait free
programming is very difficult so
synchronizes is a very convenient thing
but it's it slow because it forced
threads to switch contexts a lot it's
like I said it's it's like it's like a
pebble in a river even even a very short
synchronization so I prefer not to use
it and this is a challenging programming
but it pays for itself any other
question aha
pool
we become linear a year so your question
why we become linear or what yes yes I I
try to demonstrate that with this
approaches we never degrade while while
increasing while increasing our
resources that's what is scalability
about and this the thing is we do have
you know as a product we have the
requirement more and more customers are
adopting the Morocco universal collision
pool so we have to address all those
issues so it is a a requirement that we
have seen from our customers so last
year URI has demonstrated the weight
free that was in 12 10 2 release of the
UCP now the multi-dimensional thing is
now for the 12 to release of the
software no there is no library it's
it's totally it's totally handmade I use
I use variables I use Atomics I use
general Java a very little of Java API
some bring maybe some primitive
collections very primitive ones so the
primitive the more primitive the better
yes go ahead
this is Alicia our team member yes
developer from GBC group any other
question yes one day how close to time
look up how did the cow close the time
you look up
constant type I so Michael can he
explain excuse me I just didn't get
speak up yeah he will expect you go
ahead Micah on sometimes no no it's not
it's not my intention it becomes
automatically it's just I'm just
bringing the performance to the top
level to the heart of the hardware there
is there is no more context switches
that's why it's it's steady so I mean
the the worst thing is about I mean the
standard algorithms there are two things
which is a context thread thread context
switching so a threat is not a process
it's it's a white weight process so it's
faster than than a UNIX process but it's
still it's still not it's it's still not
free because you need to switch stacks
you need to switch registers you need to
reorganize the memory a bit and so on so
it's it's expensive so if you're if you
are able to avoid switching threats
meaning you need to let them flow freely
without waiting to enter something so if
they don't wait to enter something they
run faster because they don't switch
contacts on upon the CPUs and another
thing is not to let
loop not to let led to threats look
something in a sequential manner you
know of course it needs to be in text
but with our with our problem problems
we are trying to solve it's not like
indexed with java map because we have
many dimensions so that's why we use
trees so and while using trees and that
skip algerie without a synchronized
keywords we just bring up the stuff to a
top performance and that's why it's
teddy we add some more requesting
threads but it's still steady the time
is same but it's not it's all because I
wanted it to be same it because it's
automatically happens that way okay
we still have seven minutes are you
exploring other any other application
use case for this yeah Union Damien the
same approach for other other
application yeah thanks for the question
because I forgot to tell it's I think in
my understanding it's it has a bigger
meal because this pool is like our is
like a storage of something and threads
Arkham are competing on this something
so it's like it's like a common memory
for many threads like something some
subsets of threads is passing some
information another subset of threads is
getting that information so it's like a
buffering in between in between tons of
threads and this is kind of very
complicated buffering it's not it's not
like a fee for it's not like a stack
it's not like a DAC it's it's like it's
like a buffer with ability to index and
search I think it's a very common
approach and and it could be used in
many different applications right so his
question is so it's looking it's like
you're looking into you do yeah yeah
yeah it's like it's like intellectual
buffering in between threads yep so
initially you should you might think on
it like that but in your work in my work
we're not looking into some other use
keys because our journeys I'm develop
the connection primer connection pool
guy maybe on the side a question yeah
huh threat it's a the more the most
typical picture here is a small number
of connections but a huge number of
requesters I mean threads that are
looking for those connections so memory
memory considerations is also important
but I didn't I mean I did have some
problem so far because there is I mean
because the new introduction is it
depends it depends on the number of
dimensions basically
uh-huh
number of addresses is larger yes it's
larger than the number of connections
but we have
oh we we have we actually have a certain
addresses so we don't search the whole
memory we searched some very specific
slots of memory so the rest of the
memory is not a she's asking infinitely
can be applied to to this kind of
problem sorry if this technique can be
applied to finding empty slot in memory
or empty space on these things like I
didn't think about it yet okay yes is
that so are you saying about the
organizing associative memory of maybe I
you know why not he has not fought about
I you should think about it yeah okay we
have two minutes maybe one last question
who's gonna get the last question okay
thank you very much thank you very much
thank you very much I'm really I'm
really happy that you came the adventure
here I just answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
