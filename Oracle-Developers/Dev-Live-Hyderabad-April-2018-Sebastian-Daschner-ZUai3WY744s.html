or here to have a conversation with
Sebastian - now welcome thank you and
just lead off by saying I'm really
bummed because I missed your session
today but I think we can continue the
conversation we were having our
breakfast because you're talking about
something that is really near and dear
to my heart and that's productivity yes
so you did a talk on developer
productivity
so exactly developer productivity
well it's let's say we all agree that we
should maximize our keyboards usage
right so that's basically that topic on
steroids and taking much much further so
in a nutshell it's about productivity
and a couple of principles and mindsets
that come along with that applied
specifically as a software developer
right in all kind of areas and no matter
which job you have you should be
productive in some sorts right but
especially as a software developers what
kind of mindsets can we adopt what kind
of principle can we follows in the tools
we use and the languages we use and so
on and so forth in order to become
better at what we do in order to become
more effective and more productive okay
there's two things I'm hearing you're
saying there's actual tools that people
use and there's a mindset involved right
right
so let's tease those apart a little bit
in terms of you know maybe the mindset
first what is the mindset here what is
the how do you how do you instill the
ability to focus you know right so in
general you're totally right with doing
these two things apart because you can
always teach you know better usage of a
specific tool specific shortcuts and and
so on and so forth but I would say
there's some underlying principles with
that they're quite similar - no matter
which specific tools or technologies
you're using for example that you should
be able to focus on the task at hand as
much as possible and that all first of
all sounds quite logic right but what
that involves is then if you apply that
principle further it's quite interesting
for example try to minimize all
distractions that you have tried to shut
down all the mail notifications
smartphone notifications and so on as a
fourth I use a Linux environment a
window manager that only shows me the
current window it had the current ask
what I want to work in nothing can pop
up and exactly where nothing will pop up
I try to use my my keyboard usage and
all kind of things so I don't even have
to you know take that movement move my
hand away from the home room where my
hand is supposed to be my fingertips
where the right the productivity is from
the the arrow cursors are even to your
mouse right just try to maximize and
maximize to focus so I take focus
literally in all kind of areas with that
if you take that principle further and
that is just one of the principles for
example and try to embrace automation is
another one which is I would say try to
use a computer or computers in the way
how them how they were built and amended
are they meant to be exactly because
computers are very good at doing stupid
things really fast and really in a
deterministic way without doing any
blind mistakes as we as humans would do
right so humans are much better at
thinking of complex tasks try to do some
kind of deep thinking rather than just
manually executing boring and repetitive
tests right this is what the computer is
used for and just try to automate that
as much as possible and then if you
think of keyboard shortcuts or all kind
of macros of all kind of sorts
there are also some kind of automation
right because otherwise you would just
to manually do some some tasks manually
perform some actions and these are a few
examples of what what I'm what my talks
about and yeah I'm really passionate
about that topic and I'm also really
want to get these points these
principles across so not just say oh
here a couple of tricks just throw them
at this particular tool and you will be
more productive no well maybe yes you
will but that's not the point it's about
how to apply these principles and how to
take a step back and look at all the
things you're doing each and every day
in each and every time when you develop
software and try to think okay is there
another way around an easy way around
the better way around that we can use
so okay so what's the benefit here okay
so I can I can focus okay so I'm gonna
listen to you I'm gonna be able to focus
but why what you know it because why
can't I be checking email looking at
Twitter and all this stuff at the same
time
right and that's also the most important
question why what we should ask much
more often right because yeah where's
the point right so first of all I would
say by applying these things you're
minimizing context switches right so we
as humans also have a huge penalty and
paying for context which is not just
computers right when we executing tasks
so the lessons are small the context
which is the better and why are we doing
this well to be more productive to
basically get more done and why are we
doing that well to get more done in the
same amount of time and also ultimately
believe it or not but enjoy you work
more right when you can solely focus on
some tasks that you're doing it's much
more enjoyable than being dragged around
this and this and that and this
distraction coming along and then at the
end of the day you may have accomplished
something but it doesn't really feel
good rather than as opposed to diving
into some topic really going away for
maybe an hour and just doing that task
really well and then well point how long
I mean so in terms of full rights how
long I'm eating is it then you know is
that people will here focus and
concentration they think hours and hours
and hours and it's not necessarily true
that's not necessary to absolutely and
it highly depends well first of all I'm
the person so a few persons can you know
concentrating focus for much longer
period and also it highly depends what
on the task you doing for example if
you're writing a book let's say let's
take an extreme example and and I
noticed that for myself you really want
to have even a whole day when nobody
will distract you and that's that's
really great of course you won't be
typing like 12 hours non-stop
that's for sure but you will be working
in that and your mind will be working on
that topic for basically the whole day
when it comes to corporate environments
then it also depends on the team you're
working with right so ideally you want
to deep
into something and get into non
distraction mode for half an hour or
longer
also what depends on what your and your
rate is in which you should respond to
email right how responds if you need to
be mostly it's fine to you know be away
for 30 minutes or longer depends on a
team of course but at least these 30
minutes that's for example a minimum
time frame I would suggest because less
that it really doesn't make sense you
want you want focus then the context
switch time you know the penalty is is
too high so that's okay so a couple of
things here are you noticing a better
quality from the ability to focus
absolutely okay so you have better
quality and I think most people would
agree with that but most people don't
understand the cost of context yes
switching because it it's immediate you
know looking at my email and I'm looking
in my car they really don't see I mean
this is an all field this is not just
you know software developers that
there's that the cost of context wishing
is actually very high exactly and the
point this keeps you with the surface
right right
and the point is that cost is much
higher than the actual time it takes to
switch let's say you progress just as I
said I'm switching to email it's
superfast you see it switch back and
forth no your mind doesn't you're still
up on top exactly doesn't work I have to
be able to transcend and get down here
right but that takes a certain amount of
time right I'm interested in what the
reaction was because particularly lot of
young people here so I'm seriously older
so I understand these concepts but I had
to learn them painfully over time what
so for here for the conference actually
to be honest I was surprised that this
room was quite full because normally
normally that is some kind of topic
where people would agree you know or is
this typical saying off it's it's common
sense maybe it's not common practice but
it's not common sense everybody would
agree that you know using the keyboard
is a good thing and try to memorize
keyboard shortcuts and all kind of
source but not many people apply that at
least from my experience when in in
projects so this is why I was quite
surprised that this room was quiet quite
full before
for that session and people then I would
say of at least from the reaction I
could tell that they somewhat enjoyed
listening to to that topic I don't know
if they had that specific thing in mind
when they read the abstract or when they
read Oh productive development right
that somehow makes sense it's kind of
obvious right but if you think of all
that principles I would say and this is
why I'm quite passionate about the topic
it's it's a super important topic to
think of and it's so important principle
to follow and topic to embrace follow up
on that because I've been around a lot
of Engineers and your previous jobs I've
had and I don't necessarily find that
the same concepts apply to other other
other disciplines right like just so
unfortunately exactly I mean it's it's
because I mean you can apply this to
anything managers to be able to
understand the fact that the engineers
do need yes time alone you know what's
more obviously to be working in teams
but they need time obviously without the
distractions yes and and this is a very
important point especially for managers
to mention to just acknowledge and
recognize to understand that pattern
that way of working that you really want
to disappear for some time at least as
as a builder let's say as a software
developer as an engineer to work on
something to really get something done
with a great quality and not just being
dragged around and managers just work
differently you know their whole point
is to communicate constantly and they're
embracing emails and meetings and all
that and they're good at that and it's
great but just we all of us have to
understand if we're working kind of
differently and we have specific needs
and if you have builders of all kind of
sorts engineers technicians software
developers and your team you should
leave them alone ideally they're happy
with that you don't need to talk to them
all the time they will just appreciate
it I think managers can learn the fact
that their whole day does not have to be
spent on the surface right there are
times that they can also dive deep
absolutely because there are lots of
management processes that would really
benefit
managers just stopping going down
cutting things down and you know
actually focusing a little bit more
right right absolutely true but having
that said I would also suggest that
software engineers well they know about
that topic mostly but they also tackle
that topic from the other way
telling managers how they work and how
that works right in the same way if
let's say take a different topic talk
about cold quality right it makes sense
to do refactoring and to invest some
time to make the code better whereas a
manager would immediate initially not
see that benefit right it's just time
spent for nothing no more features but
it's a good thing to do and in the same
way we explain those managers hey it
makes sense to take apart a sprint and
just improve quality so that in the
future will be more productive and for
nowadays my impression most of the
managers get that get the importance of
coach quality and in the same way we
should be able we as software developers
should be able to communicate it back
and say hey this is the way how we're
working because then everything will be
better higher-quality
more productive and also more enjoyable
software development so I'm pretty sure
they they will understand what we as
developers also have to understand that
difference in ways of working and they
don't mean it bad right they don't make
that on purpose to distract us and they
just want to communicate they also have
these needs they need to know about a
project how is it going it's the whole
way how they're working with just we all
of us need to understand that it's kind
of differently and we can communicate in
both ways so this may be something to
take away just communicate with your
managers as well and just tell them what
do you need in terms of working yeah ok
let's shift gears a little bit here this
is a this is a pretty big event you've
been to a lot of Oracle code events yes
is this your first time to India no it's
my second time in India and the second
code event so I was in New Delhi last
year was my first time in India actually
and yeah now I'm back for Hyderabad and
Bangalore in a couple of days next week
yeah so what's your so do you have any
sense of you know what's your opinion of
how things are going right now today
alright today yeah and that's also my
impressions I was really impressed how
many attendees its are here for yeah
right for a one-day event is just really
incredible I'm and I'm really
fee for that and also yeah as I
mentioned how many people surprisingly
attended attended my session and it's
just it's great it's always great to see
enthusiasm about technology I would say
and yeah I just love to be at these
these events great well thanks for
joining us yeah thank you
orientation I share your passion in this
and this awesome and well it's call it a
day for that and thank you everybody and
we'll see you soon thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
