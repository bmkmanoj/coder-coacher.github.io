my name is your employee I'm from Oracle
technology Network and my guests today
are markers and Sebastian
hi so I you actually produce now a java
magazine that's correct
so I'm just going to show it for them
for the audience so so tell us like what
is the magazine about the Megane team oh
I don't need microphone I've got my own
and then Java pro is about Java
development which hacker is focus which
is different to the other magazines more
on development of praxis on doing not on
science more but on really developing
code creating code and so on our core
topics are actually the buzzwords going
around around death of a child
understand okay so then Java development
and do you talk about you have like Java
AC so lambdas and what else what other
topics do you have and for Java AC so
let's let's just say I we want you of
course it's all in German it's a German
magazine yeah still to this moment we
plan to go first of all the web site
will go to English about in two or three
months we are actually in the
development in the designing of the
English web site and then the first of
all we will not go step with a magazine
into English but you can bring in
English blocks articles blog articles
and we can publish them via our website
yes okay so all the content will be in
English in two months two or three
months of it we are planning a road map
okay we don't want to over commit here
thank you you're welcome
no problem okay so you have like a
reactive programming yeah there's our
name is a rubric so we got the magazine
split up and you can be divided by that
by the colors of kimchi so we got a Java
core yeah
Java Enterprise Architecture web
development frameworks
then we got test tools and a little bit
of testing yeah
and so in architecture DevOps agile even
mobile development yes it's a small part
but it is a part of the Java flow cloud
cloud we have actually not in this
special magazine but cloud is of course
if a topic in the Java from active not
not in our first I'd like that issue
like that cloud and micro-services
ah yes buzzwords drivers that's more
than the buzzword great positive so and
how often do you issue a magazine every
month
how can you every two months every time
oh okay and so how do you find like
writers I mean what's the problem is
like we have people in the community you
actually want to write an article in a
new magazine so what what can we do
actually feel feel easy contact us okay
we are the website Java - pro de and
then just scroll to the bottom click on
become an author and then I can bring
German it's still in German of course
and then you can just send us a short
issue about what's your article about
what how do you think you can create
this article and then you will give
feedback if the article is good enough
and the writing is good enough you will
make it to the incident magazine and
that's the point where guys like markers
get into the game market is one of our
experts in our expert board which the
experts are looking at the articles and
we got four different topics different
experts and they're in the in the
process within if the articles fit in
the Praxis practical issue content of
the java for magazine okay so what kind
of tips would you give to people who
want to submit content yeah they should
write content which is you have free of
advertising so very necessary they don't
want to have advertising in the magazine
but pretty good quality technical stuff
right so now your detector right and not
not focus on
right yes yes we do exactly the same
thing you have we have articles about
products of course ideas and tools and
testing and quality of course but the
most articles about the architecture and
Java Enterprise and Java core features
right it shouldn't be about like selling
a product but it should be like about
like how do you do development what kind
of tools you use and in that context and
you mentioned like frameworks and all
the things I got yeah yeah very good and
I know that you also are doing a
partnership with Java Magazine
so what is that about yeah we are
we are investing in advertising we
support them because it's it's very
interesting for us to invest in a
growing magazine so if software is free
then it will it will grow much more than
paid software and it's the same with a
magazine is the magazine is available
for free then you can expect that it
will grow and it's very interesting for
for address advertising partners like us
to pay to buy advertising in this
magazine and be at conferences and so on
right and I mean we need more content
around Java so I think that we need to
cross pollinate for sure so thank you
thank you so much for about issuing a
magazine and notice this is not easy
yes I sort of work so and sake thank you
for stopping by and and telling us about
this great magazine so thank you thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
