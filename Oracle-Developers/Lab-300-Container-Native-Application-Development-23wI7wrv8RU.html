to your Java micro service and enable
the search capability for your new
product catalog to do this we're gonna
assume the persona of Derrick we're
gonna go out to github modify some of
our Java code and then commit that
change from there we'll watch the
commits execute in the worker pipeline
where we'll save our new container to
docker hub and then we'll provision the
updated container to our kubernetes
cluster and test our product catalog to
make sure the search is working as
intended now to get started when we go
out to it hub make sure you click on
your Twitter feed at the top so you're
reset to the highest level and then
click find file we want to look for a
file called static tweets that job
now once you find the file
edit button and you want to scroll down
to the line that's actually preventing
our search from taking place today so we
need to go ahead and delete this line
the bottom and issue a commit now once
your commit is issued look up at the top
and you want to take note of the hash
code related to the commit now we can go
back to worker and watch our build
execute we can watch our push release
take place out the docker hub and then
we can see our new container deploy
directly to our kubernetes cluster if we
go out to our kubernetes cluster there
we can see our our twitter feed
service is up and running
and if we drill into it one of the
things that you'll notice in the label
field is the hashcode I told you to take
note of earlier you can see that this is
our new codebase actually running in
kubernetes
now if you scroll down the page to the
services menu and you click on the
endpoint for a product catalog the last
thing we want to do is check to make
sure the search field is actually
working in our catalog and if we open up
a product like Crayola we can see that
all the tweets that are returned do
relate to our product so our search is
working just fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
