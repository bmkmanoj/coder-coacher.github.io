technology emerging technology actually
out there it's not going to be a social
web it's not going to be artificial
intelligence it's not going to be the
big data and so on but blockchain has
the potential to change the business as
we know it
world economic forum they predict that
in by 2027 ten percent of global GDP
would be stored on blockchain we are
talking about 15 trillion there Gartner
says that blockchain is going to add 176
billion by 2025 to the business in terms
of gains in productivity and so on if
interpreter using blockchain and 90
percent of the organization's would be
doing a blockchain project very soon so
I hope that gets your attention
my name is Deepa Goyal I am a senior
director in blockchain cloud service and
with me is Emmanuel Abaddon Emmanuel has
very strong background in the blockchain
he has founded one of the company big
blockchain mining coal mining company
also the big data company in the
blockchain space and he's going to take
us through the blockchain journey what
his blockchain he's going to shed those
days how it evolved and so on hmm then
we are going to talk about the black
blockchain platforms and applications
out there what platforms are available
for you to use and what an application
would look like in the blockchain space
and then of course we want blockchain to
solve all the problems for us and we
will look at some of those use cases we
what what is being experimented and so
on we also have a demo to show you
blockchain in action so we will go with
that and in the end we definitely wants
to leave at least five to ten minutes
for you to ask any questions and
comments and so on so with that let me
hand it over to Emmanuel to take us
through the blockchain journey
good morning everyone can you hear me so
I'm gonna be battling with this mic for
most of the day so bear with me so what
does blockchain I'm gonna try and go
over this high level and at the same
time try and give a bit of background to
those who may be new to this concept of
distributed ledger technology so we
believe that blockchain can bring
greater transparency and accountability
across complex and multi-tiered business
networks it can enable real-time
transaction processing and tracking of
assets there is no central repository of
data in a blockchain Network and thus
you can actually enable only privileged
participants to see the the content of
that ledger in addition to there being
no single point of failure so there and
we already mentioned multiple benefits
of a technology and I'd probably say as
you see there are many concepts here
there aren't new but are pretty much
being regurgitated to solve a problem in
a coherent manner so if we go to big
coin institution white paper I remember
when I was a JP Morgan I mentioned to
one of my bosses there that this
technology is essentially going to solve
a lot of problems we have internally
when it comes to reconciliation and they
and their forth and they probably
thought I was the most craziest person
possible so Bitcoin started with a white
paper by you know sued anonymous
anonymous identity called Satoshi
Nakamoto as most people know and it
essentially described complex but simple
and simple at the same time concept of a
distributed time stamping mechanism that
supported a pseudonymous cryptocurrency
we know today as Bitcoin so at the same
time you know great thing about the
white paper that actually through threw
me into the whole thing deep end it was
the concept of how actually solved the
design ten fault tolerance problem the
designs and generals problem
specifically for Bitcoin and also you
know we it's interesting how the network
is pretend to protected directly by
incentives and as I went on to actually
work in a Bitcoin mining space those
incentives actually support the network
who operates a protected essentially so
a bit contraction is secure because it's
using you know elliptic curve
cryptography to essentially swap
transactions between participants while
also using the previous transaction hash
representation stored into the next
transaction so what you really have with
subsequent blocks are with the the
mining is something that's more
complicated - well more difficult to
actually undo over time so you get
immutability or as people really call it
tamper evidence or temper you know
tamper evidence as a result so a Bitcoin
block is essentially an amalgamation of
multiple transactions that are being
hashed and bunch into mocha routes - you
have a single route that is posted onto
the block header then posted onto the
network
the person who solves the we like to say
mathematical problem which is really
just a lottery system the person who
solves that lottery problem is able to
post a block and everybody can validate
that transaction and validate that he's
a valid participant to actually post a
block which gives Bitcoin you know the
decentralized nature that it requires to
actually succeed so if we like to
summarize what a blockchain truly is it
is a system for maintaining distributed
Ledger's in a way that allows
organizations who do not fully trust one
another to agree to the updates of the
ledger using peer-to-peer technology
rather than you know reconciliation or
third party off chain or off channel
processes which are prone to failure so
four key properties there are multiple
properties obviously we don't have all
day
but four key properties of blockchain is
the shared concept and a transparent
concept so blockchain
ledger or ledger is shared across
multiple participants in a permissioned
environment we're talking about shared
across trusted entities it's immutable
in a sense that you know you you were
only allowed to make updates to the
ledger so it's essentially it's a you
can make modifications you make updates
you can't delete previous entries as a
result
we could talk about things like pruning
because people always ask the question
what happens when data's ten years old
depends on the use case and depends on
regulatory problem you're trying to
solve as a result as well then it's
validation and wrong with repudiation
that comes with it as well so multiple
peers executing small contracts or chain
code are able to validate the the
updates that legend also validate the
logic that was executed ensuring that we
have consensus across disparate peers it
can be encrypted for confidentiality we
can go into that as well so you can
actually encrypt each transaction or you
can make it open it's entirely up to you
so two types of block chains people can
break it into four sections five
sections but you know I like to think of
it in two sections we've got the
permissionless block chains and then we
have the permissioned block chain so
things are classify as a permissions
will be Bitcoin etherium some of the
other currencies I'm sure people have
heard of RI cos and a craze that's going
on as a result those are generally
permissionless systems the permission
systems are some of the things you've
seen the enterprise Enterprise aetherium
hyper layer fabric are 3/4 so and so
forth and I think that's where the
innovation is really happening for the
enterprise where people are
participating in a way to actually solve
complex business problems using Bitcoin
to build business networks using
blockchain to build business networks so
if we summarize some of the key benefits
we have the decentralized and
peer-to-peer nature which removes the
central authority or removes the
reliance on a single point of failure
it's a distributed ledger so copies of
the ledger are distributed across
different parties meaning if there's any
issue or any let's say hack of any
particular end of it in a particular
entity but the the actual correct layer
will be displayed or available across
multi peers there is the immutable
transaction history a lot of people know
about log based architecture those are
some of the paradigms involved and small
contracts which is really just business
logic I mean I hate the word smart
contract but it's out there it is simply
just business logic that's shared across
disparate organizational bounds then we
have the transparency
nature of it so you can have
transparency and opacity depending on
your use case as well making some
transparent visible to people and some
opaque to others who don't necessarily
have the privileges I'd like to say that
you know blockchain ties together many
existing software architecture paradigms
distributed computing meets
microservices we're talking about
service architecture log base
architecture business - essentially your
building business consortiums using
existing known architecture paradigms
but in new and interesting way I hand
over to Deepak who's going to talk a bit
more about some blockchain applications
and platforms Thank You Manuel so now
that we know about the blockchain
technology let's look at some of the
platforms which are out there and before
we even go there let's look at like what
what are the components of a permission
blockchain platform and here we are
focusing on permission blockchain only
not the public blockchain as you men
were just saying that Bitcoin etherium
and many of the crypto currencies these
are the public block chains out there
but from an enterprise perspective like
we are looking at permission blockchain
here we need someone to authorize
someone to identify everyone has to be
identified actually who is participating
on the blockchain and what the
transactions they are executing so first
component of course are the nodes nodes
represent an organization so blockchain
is basically a business network that you
are creating and there are multiple
organization participating in that you
can't have just one node in the
blockchain network there have to be
multiple nodes and these nodes are
talking to each other over the network
it could be or the internet could be
something else so these are the nodes
which are doing which are representing
organization doing most of the work of
course the blockchain is a distributed
ledger technology there has to be a
ledger with each of the node each node
maintains its own ledger that's the
that's where all the transaction
information is stored and how this
information is stored is through a smart
contract a smart contract is the piece
of business logic that is executed on
these nodes and it looks at the world
state and based on that it updates the
Pledger but one other concept of
blockchain is that all the nodes should
agree with the transaction that is being
executed now how do we actually take
care of that that is done through the
consensus mechanism so there has to be a
consensus algorithm that is in the use
for a blockchain network so for example
in the Bitcoin there is a proof-of-work
consensus that is being used
eutteum use something else and hyper
laser fabric out there they use the
consensus based on Kafka or drain and so
on so that's another component that that
is required in the blockchain network
and if we move on as I said like this is
a permission block chain so for
permission blockchain there has to be
some sort of membership services and
entity services which can say ok only
these people are authorized to
participate in this blockchain network
not anyone can do that
not anyone can do a transaction an anima
T is a feature of Bitcoin
that's how Bitcoin came up because you
don't want to be identified when you are
doing transaction over the Bitcoin which
you can be anonymous but on this
permission blockchain you have to be
identified that's and there has to be a
membership service there mm-hmm
then if we have so many components you
need some sort of admin console some
sort of monitoring tool that using which
you can monitor your network you update
your network to the administration tasks
and so on
so there has to be an administration
console and last but not least you have
to have the end-user applications which
are talking into the blockchain network
so these applications can use that
various API is to invoke the smart
contract which will start a transaction
on the blockchain network so this is the
this is what and I am obstructing
actually here a lot of simplifying it
just for the information purpose but
this is what a blockchain network
component would look like in any
platform so if you go further and look
at some of the open-source platforms
which are out there just listed here 3
aetherium coda and hyper logic fabric
some of the criteria that you would see
like what
each of these platforms is doing so for
example in governance
aetherium developers in aetherium
aetherium developers are saying like
what what goes into this code eyes are
three and hyper laser fabric is going by
the Linux Foundation security and access
aetherium is primarily public logic they
have started something called etherium
Enterprise Alliance which is out there
working on it but not out there yet
Artie coder this is a permission block
chain and so is hyper ledger fabric
transaction validation area mentioned is
done through the proof of fought wire
miners in etherium and coda it's why are
notaries and high polish fabric tears
tears to the validation of that it smart
contract that's the piece of business
logic that you are responsible to write
for your transactions that in etherium
you can use solidity and serpent coda
portal in Java and hyper layer fabric go
so so on actually there number of things
that you need to consider when you are
choosing a platform with which to start
whether you are working with a public
blockchains permission blockchain and
what is your target area what kind of
use case you want to implement and so on
so there these are the open source
platform that you can pick up but there
are a number of commercial platforms
also out there that you can start with
and I'm just going to talk very briefly
about the Oracles Club blockchain cloud
service what we are doing in that space
and this is the Oracles implementation
that we announced yesterday here we are
going to provide all the infrastructure
services on the cloud once you come to
the cloud you get a blockchain network
running you don't have to worry about
all the infrastructure details and
configuration of the blockchain network
you are ready to write your a smart
contract and deploy it on the network
and not only that we are using actually
a number of other Oracle services which
are available on the cloud like IDC s
for security so there would be enhanced
security that you can do and if you are
running your java applications for
example or mobile application or any
other
application on Oracle cloud and you want
a single sign-on an integration between
these application that would be much
easier with the service so your
application could be running an
integration cloud and so our build
process and so on and using the REST API
you can call into the blockchain cloud
service one value-add actually we are
using the hyper laser fabric actually
for blocking blocks in cloud service and
hyper laser fabric if you are familiar
with that it provides the native SDK API
using which you can call it smart
contract on top of that we provide the
REST API so your application developer
don't have to worry about learning a new
native SDK API they can just use the
REST API to call into smart contract and
run blockchain transactions one other
unique value proposition for Oracle is
the applications there are hundreds of
applications that Oracle has in here P
supply chain customer management and so
on as well as IOT and at CM so we can
what we are working on is creating the
integration point from those
applications into the blockchain cloud
service so these applications today are
running in silos within the organization
boundaries we want to extend the
enterprise boundary and create a
business network even though like many
customers are running many different
applications as ERP SCM and so on but
they can be all on the same block chain
network and have the visibility into the
data so this is all I am going to talk
about the Oracle blockchain cloud
service if you are interested to learn
more about our blockchain cloud service
there are three sessions that we have
between today and tomorrow
feel free to attend any of this the
first one is the hands-on lab session I
do not know if space is available on in
that or not but that starts at 11:30 and
at 3:45 we are going to go into much
more detail about the blockchain cloud
service what it is what our strategy is
and roadmap and tomorrow at 4:30 we are
going to go into the details of use
cases that our partners and customers
are implementing using our service
so let's talk briefly about use cases
even though there is a session tomorrow
where we even go into much more details
but what kind of use cases are
applicable for blockchain
of course we have as I said before that
we want blockchain to solve all the
problems in the world but that's not the
case
not everything blockchain is not a
solution to all problems out there so we
have come up with a few questions that
you should ask yourself to determine the
applicability of blockchain solution to
your problem so first of all the
blockchain is applicable only if you
have a cross departmental or cross
organizational business process so if
you have multiple organization which one
to do the transaction with each other
then blockchain you should consider
blockchain as a solution if you have
just the intro Department application I
don't see actually much value that
blockchain can bring to you is there a
trust issue actually that among the
transacting parties so if you have
multiple organization do they trust each
other so that's the problem blockchain
is trying to solve it's trying to put
that trust in a non trusted environment
so there are multiple business which do
the transaction with each other they do
not trust each other but they still have
to coexist
and they have to trust somehow the
blockchain can solve that problem
are there intermediaries in your
business process so for example in
payments especially the cross-border
payments it goes through custodians and
it goes through a number of
intermediaries in between can you
eliminate those intermediaries to
expedite the transaction process time
and are these intermediaries trusted can
can they be trusted or not so the other
question you need to ask does it require
periodic reconciliation in many cases
you are doing the transactions and you
have your own database or the
organization has their own database they
get out of sync and at the end of the
day end of the week or month whatever it
is there is a reconciliation that is
required and that's a time consuming
it's a offline process and it takes a
lot of effort to do that so if there is
a
conciliation in your business process
yes blockchain probably can solve that
problem need to improve traceability or
audit trail so this specifically applies
to the supply chain use cases you might
have so you are getting actually your
parts or you are getting your goods from
many different vendors many different
suppliers and you do not know where they
are coming from how they are coming from
what the status is and so on and if
there is something blockchain if you are
putting actually all that data in the
blockchain
this can be blockchain can be a solution
there do you need the real-time
visibility it goes back to the raw audit
trail if you are putting actually all
the information in the blockchain as
your goods are traversing from your from
your supplier to the end user you know
exactly where your where the things are
and also this actually goes to the
auditor and regulation especially in FSI
where auditors need to look into what
you are doing and blockchain can provide
a view to them can I improve your
business process by automating certain
steps so is smart contracts that you are
running in blockchain that get those can
be used like on a certain event you can
trigger a business certain event you can
trigger a transaction and automatically
let's say release the payment for
example goods are received
if goods are received I can receive an
event from the IOT devices and then the
payments are released automatically by
the bank because Bank receives an event
as well
so those kind of automate automation can
be done using the smart contract which
are running on the blockchain so these
are some of the questions actually that
you need to ask before you starting with
the blockchain really and see that
whether your business process can
benefit from blockchain or not let's
look at some of the use cases out there
especially in the financial services
industry in FSI actually there has been
a lot of research going on over the last
two three years and we have listed here
some of the use cases which are more
popular especially the cryptocurrency o
everyone knows that Bitcoin and
atheria and many other colored coins and
whatnot are out there the remittance is
like payment industry so using the
blockchain I do a talk talking eliminate
the intermediary actually from in
between and just do the payments across
from from the source to the target
capital market security settlements for
example they stop trading you trade is
talking it takes up to three days for
the stock to really settle and that's
the current nonce so if we can eliminate
possibly we could eliminate that using
the blockchain if everyone is doing the
stock trading or at least the settlement
process is on the blockchain supply
chain trade finance and so on so these
are the use cases in FSA industry FS I
started this but FSI is not the only
industry where the blockchain is
applicable there are number of other
verticals where blockchain is being
explored especially in public sector
healthcare supply chain as I mentioned
and many others in public sector like
Land Registry or both records there
those can be stored on the blockchain
especially the Land Registry once you
actually when you buy a house here in US
for example you have to go through the
title insurance company which does a
search for the title if someone else has
a claim for it if you have an audit
trail where the property has been if
that audit trail is there on the
blockchain there is no need to search
because all that information is there
what hands it what hands it has said the
property has changed since the beginning
of its existence so use cases of use
cases like that are coming up health
care electronic health record imagine
the area consortium of hospitals and
insurance companies in which doctors are
participating and patients are
participating as well and the electronic
health record for the patients is stored
on the blockchain now when you change
the insurance or when you change the
doctor or hospital you don't have to
transfer your electronic record it's
already on the blockchain
you just need to authorize the top
particular doctor hospital for access to
your record especially this is
especially useful in the case of
emergency where you don't have it and
you are somewhere else not in your local
in your locality where you later
and how do you access your medical
record if it's on the blockchain it's
very easy you just authorize okay these
are the ID and you can go and look at my
record so those kind of use cases in
health care supply chain as I was
mentioning that you can track the
complete quote path dot quote path but
the genealogy of the parts where it's
coming from and so on and Emmanuel is
going over the demo of a auto
manufacturer which wants to track all
the parts and how these are being record
recalled and if a particular part is
recalled then how to inform the end user
through the dealership and so on hmm let
me also walk you through a use case of
trade finance so if you look at the
current process what happens when a
buyer and seller first of all they have
to agree and and have an agreement put
together so buyer and sellers are
negotiating and they get an agreement
once that is done they step number two
is that buyer asked Bank its bank to
issue a letter of credit once the letter
of credit is issued that letter of
credit sent to the seller and seller
informs through the sellers bank
actually and seller then sends the goods
to the shipping company to a carrier
carrier then since the goods to the ship
to the buyer and basically a lot of
steps are involved and everyone all the
participating entities here have their
own view of the transaction there is no
common view because everyone is
maintaining their own database and so on
so that's the challenge like we do not
know buyer does not know whether the
seller has shipped the goods or not
there has to be an out-of-band
communication in order to do that and
when the shipping company has delivered
the goods to the buyer seller will not
immediately know that and payment it
takes a lot of time actually for all
this process to complete mmm
if we put all this on the blockchain
where all these five entities in the
simple use case are participating on the
blockchain so they have all a peer
actually on the blockchain Network and
whenever a transaction occurs an entry
in the blockchain
Leger is made so everyone now has the
same view of the block of the
transaction if an agreement is signed
that is put on the blockchain if a
letter of credit is issued Bank actually
goes and put the letter of credit on the
blockchain and sellers bank would
immediately know that there is a letter
of credit are there and I can ask the
elect to release the goods to the
shipping company and when the shipping
company delivers the good to the buyer
it could be through the IOT device that
an event is automatically generated and
put it on the blockchain and one thing
when that event comes the bank can
release the payment to the seller all
this can be automated and it can be done
in the real time and everyone has the
real time visibility of of the
blockchain so that's the advantage of
the blockchain with that let me give it
back to emmanuel to show you the
blockchain in action and then we will
open it up for Q&amp;amp;A hello again
so key thing I was trying to remind
people is blockchain is about business
networks and networks require
participants just like Facebook won't
exist without users blockchain cannot
exist without having participants and
networks so Tim one of these case I'll
show you today it's very rudimentary but
it should get the point home to increase
the traceability of vehicle parts for
more efficient recall process and major
vehicle manufacturer simply integrated
blockchain with our ERP software with
four existent dealerships so they've
invited these four delicious to be part
of their business network in order to
allow them to share information on a
ledger so how is that going to look now
can we model this using Oracle
blockchain cloud service so how do we
model it using appalachia fabric so the
network setup is using the concept of
privacy channels or you know we just
call it channels so as you can see you
know this can be a one-to-one
relationship I want too many
relationship and many to many
relationship for this simplicity we just
have you know a manufacturer connected
to four of these car dealerships in
which they're exchanging parts
exchanging vehicles in addition to that
what we do have
so is you know the ERP software
integrates indirectly via the blockchain
using nothing other than restful api
calls so here is all cool solution which
is the Oracle blockchain cloud service
platform so we give you a dashboard that
shows you your participation
organizations and those participants in
your network in addition you get to see
the number of peers who are
participating locally also transactional
information relating to how many blocks
have been cut omni transaction have been
executed so on so forth and also general
health information to the network so you
can imagine doing this manually by
fabric is a laborious process you have
to get a security right you have to get
the setup right you have to worry about
the infrastructure associated we've just
tried to simplify that for our customers
in addition to that you can find these
vehicle manufacturers actually added
four dealerships to his network so he is
the founder of this network and
subsequently has invited four members to
this network so as previously touched
upon by Deepak the participants to the
network directly you have a certificate
authority that governs who can
participate in a network you have the
restful proxy that we automatically set
up for you that turns your vac 12 factor
applications or you know micro Elms of
small contracts into restful api so you
can call directly also if we look at the
topology of the network what we actually
have is a channel setup so we have two
peers set up for redundancy this could
be any kind of setup you want or in
addition these two peers are can eat
connected to the supply chain channels
of each of the vehicle vehicle
dealerships so if we go to one of the
car dealers for example we find that
they've got correspondence set up so
they are a participant to the network
they have two peers as well for
redundancy and they're also executing
across a channel which is the supply
chain channel related to the name of
their vehicle manufacturer so let's say
for example on Detroit auto and I'm the
vehicle manufacturer we already said
before that vehicle manufacturer
should only if you gave to see all
transactions whereas the car dealership
she don't see transactions that pertain
to them specifically so if I type in one
of the vehicles that I know we find that
this vehicle has been traded twice and
in addition to that we also have if I
can scroll across we have two
transactions correspondent transactions
that essentially show the initial
created state of the vehicle part and a
subsequent transfer to Stevens auto so
if I go to Stephens dealership I get the
identical transaction as well now what
if I wanted to go to another dealership
as well for this go across what if I
want to go to another dealership as well
one that doesn't have permission to see
the transaction between a manufacturer
and Stephens dealership if I get no
results so people always talk about
security through
blockchain being an issue but there are
fairly simple and some more complicated
ways and solving it and those are some
of the things we're looking into as well
but channels are something that comes
out the box out of I pledge your fabric
I will always like to mention you know
it's fully open source so you can start
your an apologia fabric networking you
can participate when the Oracle network
of quite easily and vice versa
so if we want to look at a small
contract what is a small contract really
as I said it's simply nothing more than
a twelve factor application the
developer only needs to care about
building is data model which is in this
example I'm using simple JSON objects to
model a vehicle and a vehicle part
subsequently there are there's design
patterns already built in where you
specify the functions you want to call
and those are exposed automatically by
the rest the restful gateway that we we
provide so simply by writing your
functions that essentially put in get
state directly to the ledger you've
basically built a smart contract now
these
contract can be sent across the network
so if we look at the chain code this is
the smart contract that is executed
directly on this vehicle dealer and the
same correspondent smart contract will
be executed on the vehicle manufacturer
so if we talk about what happens when
you excuse my contract I make a restful
call or I use a fabric SDK to
instantiate a smart contract transaction
which is called a proposal that is sent
to multiple endorses who are required so
for example in financial services I
could say three of them major top banks
need to sign off on them on a
transaction and maybe two or three
discretionary signatories as well that's
something you can define via the
contract so you can do bonds swaps you
name it it doesn't really matter you
could specify the endorsement policy
depending on the asset class or
depending on essentially on a small
contract so in this instance we have the
vehicle manufacturer being a sighted
signatory and also the card will be in a
signatory on the transaction once you
have enough endorsements that
transaction is then pushed onto the
ordering service which then allows
everybody else who has access to the
channel to get an update to the ledger
so imagine you know setting this up in a
standard way you'd have to have half car
you have to you know if Cassandra some
kind of data store to some extent the
amount of components you have to put
together to make it work to be quite
complicated in the person enterprise but
it's put together in a nicely packaged
form using happen at your fabric and
which is what Oracle's built is current
token implementation on and as I
mentioned as well you can quite easily
represent this so you can quite easily
interact with Oracle blockchain cloud
service using or restful endpoints so
just using postman and important a
certificate required for security I can
execute a smart contract transaction
quite simply as well so I think from
that perspective we we no chain code is
something right now that you write in
the go program language so if you're
familiar with a go language very similar
to to Java if you know object orientated
programming you'd get you server quickly
apart from how it returns values you get
used to
quite quickly but overall we plan to
support things like Java and other
languages in subsequent releases but you
know from a developer's standpoint the
developer doesn't have to worry about
consensus the developer doesn't have to
worry about storing information and
persisting data to store developer
doesn't have to worry about how data is
replicated across disparate disaster
recovery areas and the rules related to
permissioning and so on so forth
develop only needs to consider the rules
that govern the transaction of assets
between the intermediaries that is it
and that gets automatically replicated
across the peers who require permission
who actually have access to that network
so you get distributed computing you get
the distributed execution of chain code
and you get the multi-version
concurrency support that comes with
blockchain out of the box so I think at
this point we could probably take it to
a Q&amp;amp;A so if you have any questions we'll
be happy to take them
what's the cost you ask the cost is
something that we are working on we have
not finalized this but we know how we
are going to charge it it is going to be
charged on the basis of transaction so
number of transaction that we execute
but we don't have final cost here yeah
yeah that's a really good question
actually like so performance is
something that is very near and dear to
us right so yes for example Oracle
blocks in cloud surveys we say
Enterprise grade and performance
enterprise customers need performance if
you go to a Bitcoin the performance is
very poor actually it's like five
transactions per minute or some per
second but with the hyper ledger the the
permission blocks in that we are
implementing that's not going to cut it
why transaction per second is too low so
we are looking at like hundreds of
transactions per second actually that's
the throughput that we want to do yeah
that's a very good question so you know
if you look at the shift to you know
okay do you think blockchain replaces
events events III no I don't think so I
mean we always talk about what use case
drives blockchain right d-pad listed the
six or seven use case is that it drives
us if you use cases tailored to that
then maybe blockchain might represent
might be the best solution for you
people are moving to log based
architectures result anyway because the
Gann teaser gives you the consistency
you can get as a result and just simply
you know working with code that doesn't
have to worry about data being removed
mutability of data solves a lot of
design problems for an architect or for
any engineer so you know I think if you
think about event based systems then
think about the use cases first and then
see if blockchain fits that so this this
chain code that I wrote pretty much you
can hack it in a couple of hours
obviously I went a bit overboard and got
a bit crazy but you can put something
together that you can execute a small
contract you can call a REST API very
very quickly the the thing that actually
takes a time with other implementations
really just a set up once you set up
it's really just a essentially if you
know how to write JSON object it's not
that complicated and you know go program
language you've seen if you know Java
you know C++ you know C you could figure
this out quite quickly so just to repeat
actually what he was saying that key is
here to set up the environment and all
that once you have the environment
writing the smart contact is very easy
and that's where the commercial
platforms like blockchain cloud service
can help rather than going to open
source where you have to collect
assemble all the components
you right so we are actually in the
early adopter program right now it's not
generally available but if you are
interested we can talk about that
yeah that's a good question so I mean
what we say for Bitcoin does I mean
blockchain doesn't solve every single
problem on earth right so if the
problems it solves is where you've got
potentially disputing parties on
transactions the great thing with a
blockchain
is the ledger is authoritative so it's
not a maybe the transaction app and
you've got signatories you've it it is a
transaction so it is the authority that
is where remove some of that fraud now
if we're talking about scanning a paper
document and then storing the hash onto
the blockchain well if the original
document was falsified in the first
place and does really solve your problem
doesn't so it's really going to depend
on where are the frictions so wherever
you have middleman which are corruptible
and you could turn that middleman into a
piece of code that can execute in a
server list environment absolutely
blocking can solve that problem for you
but when you yeah
no not necessary as Emanuel was also
mentioning me you can have one instance
of the blockchain running on Oracle
cloud one in your data center itself or
it could be in some other data center
some other cloud that's not a
requirement research but it has to be
like interoperable with each other so it
has to like for example we are using
hyper laser fabric as our implementation
so it can interoperate with hyper laser
fabric instance out there but if you
want hyper laser in etherium to
interoperate together that's not there
yet I think like ultimately it's going
to be all one big network which can
interoperate with anything just like
Internet is today but not there yet
so those are actually part of the
network I mean a diagram might have
misled a bit but it is part of network
so every addition of a partner to
network is actually in a ledger itself
so it's built in right that was just
eliminated every organization has to
have its own membership service actually
so I solve it and I Saul
certificate-based
okay that is smart contract right it's a
good question actually that's like how
do you describe your smart contract like
do you really need a programmer to write
the smart contract right so that's
something we are looking into it right
now the limitation is like you have to
be a go program or a Java programmer to
write that business logic but in future
we might have like just English like
language you write in that and that is
somehow translated into the URI smart
contract which executes or some other
things like very domain-specific thing
like FSI we might have something special
another right so that's something we are
looking into that any other
so the question is I was a theorem
different from hyper laser fabric
aetherium right now I mean there's a
theorem and it's enterprises theorems
are two different things right so
ethereal you know the difference is I'll
draw would be the language operates on a
solidity it's it's a it's it's own
interpreted language with its own JVM
that comes with own issues as a result
of course right so you can't really
write native code words with fabric you
can write full-blown applications and
get full-blown hardware application
performance as a result right so that is
one of the differences in addition to
you know the security and provision
permissioning of etherium theorem is a
public network operates maybe five to
twenty five transaction per second if
you're lucky but the enterprise I don't
know what numbers what they're quoting
is right now but I can imagine it'll be
you'll be higher but the the difference
really is how small contracts are
offered and how they're executed it
essentially okay last question here so
so you know right now it's they're hyper
your fabric is using a key value store
so it's all keys and values you can
store anything in that but so I'm using
JSON objects to store to be used to
store in the database okay so it's ten
fifteen actually we have run up our time
if you have any other question we will
be outside thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
