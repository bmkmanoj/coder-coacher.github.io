the pie on wheels project it's a
do-it-yourself robot for teaching Java
in the context of the internet of things
first of all unfortunately character une
ville didn't make it because you had to
leave earlier so what we'll do it anyway
so okay my name is Michael Hoffer I work
at the University of Frankfurt in
Germany and my research interests are
basically visual programming concepts
but as a side project I do also 3d
printing and some IOT stuff and Garrett
and I thought about creating this little
robot because it's very easy to build if
you've got a printer and I mean printers
are affordable affordable for like
schools and universities so that
children or students can build their own
robot and they can even modify the
appearance of the robot and so on so
it's that is the goal for today to
explain what this robot does how to
build it and how to program it ok first
I've I'd like to give a broad overview
over the robot and after that we'll
explain the Raspberry Pi and the GPIO
pins and how we use that to control the
the motors and after that we will have a
brief explanation of 3d printing and
also designing the parts for the robot
and coding the parts actually because
who has actually seen the 3d printer in
the trap ok quite a few that's really
great and yeah I also demonstrated a
software there that we will use also
here and after that we are going to show
how to program the pie on wheels we
created a small API for that and also
how to use the XP sensors that's usually
something that Gary does a lot to create
sensor networks
yeah so let's start with the robot
itself here are the parts that you need
to build the robot so first of all of
course you need the Raspberry Pi itself
and then a few 3d printed parts like
this one here it is the board holder for
the Raspberry Pi it looks like this we
print up that in the Java have also got
a white one looks like that it's updated
to the raspberry pi model b plus so we
also have version 4 for a Raspberry Pi
be so you can use either B or B plus if
you like and then we have some strange
parts like this one which is a battery
holder you can see it here we use it to
attach this mobile charging battery here
usually use for smartphones but it fits
well into that then of course we need
wheels like this one here and we also
printed them they look like this and
then we have some holders for servos and
for the breadboard and then we have the
the borders the servo motors just two
resistors for LEDs and infrared LEDs
like this one and this one I've shown
the battery already and then you need a
breadboard and a few cables so that's
pretty much it so you don't need really
very much to to build a robot basically
just a recipe pie in a few other parts
so here's an example how you attach this
mount to the Raspberry Pi
and underneath you see the sketch that I
made to plan the the robot parts so here
are the other parts the breadboard
holders here battery holder and then you
see here the Raspberry Pi holder so and
if you assemble it then it looks like
that basically just put the breadboard
battery and everything together I use
this kind of break out cable here for
their for the Raspberry Pi you don't
have to use that you can just use these
male female cables to connect but this
is also very nice if you are not decided
which pins you will use so okay so how
do we actually turn a servo into a motor
because you when you think about robot
motors there are different options like
stepper motors continuous rotating
normal brush motors or you can also use
servo motors a servo usually is limited
in the ankle it's just for like steering
something like a car or it has actually
a motor inside and then then a year
mechanism and a variable resistor to
kind of estimate the angle of the servo
but they have the advantage that they
are pretty cheap so this is like this
one i got this one for like 5 euro maybe
even 4 for euro something like that and
it's very simple to turn it into a
completely rotating continuous rotating
device so you open the servo and then
you see here we have this gear sphere
which helped a lot because it's quite
strong and then we have this variable
resistor here to measure
the angle okay and you can rotate it
forever it stops after like two hundred
and something degrees and so you take
apart the gears and everything and here
is also a little beast if you don't take
that out then the gear will stop here so
you just remove that with a knife or
something first I missed it and then I
was wondering why it doesn't work but
this is quite important and then here is
the resistor again and you just pull it
back basically when it's in the middle
position this is one possibility and the
other one is that you could actually
completely remove the resistor and
replace it by two constant resistors to
kind of simulate the middle position
yeah and this is like the mounting that
we use for the server and then this is
attached to the Raspberry Pi holder so
the servos run with pulse width
modulation and this is something that is
quite easy to accomplish if you have
hardware support for that but the US Rep
I has only limited pins for that so I
think the B model had only one and it
was only increased with the B+ but we
can also use ordinary gpio pins i will
explain that later because we use a
special service that hooks into the
linux kernel and simulates that for us
so here you see the the poles with this
it's this one here and then we have a
period like the frequence frequency of
the whole thing and I mean the
proportions are not ideal here because
these are a lot longer so you see
frequency is like
20 milliseconds and the pulse width is
about one milliseconds up to point two
milliseconds and then you can control in
which direction and which speed the
servo moves so here you see the full
circuit we just use three of the GPIO
pins from the raspberry pi like I think
it's pin 25 and then we have this
actually it was the pin for so I should
have put it here but it doesn't doesn't
matter because we have also the full
schematics online and Fritzing
schematics who knows Fritzing it's a
yeah cool software for for really
painting these circuits and everything
and it's used a lot in IT context and
then we have here the irregular LED and
an infrared LED that we try to use for
interacting with the XP sensors later so
it's also I mean it's just a couple of
minutes to build that actually so do you
have any questions about the hardware
part like how to assemble the robot or
the electronics and servo thing okay if
not then we move on to 3d printing I
mean 3d printing is a really exciting
thing at least for me I got my first
printer like half an a year one year and
a half ago and it really changed the way
I thought about and think about
producing and prototyping things because
I mean actually designing such a wheel
it's not so easy if you want to directly
connect it to the servo and also the
other parts they have clicking
mechanisms and so it was not that easy
for me to just manually do
and with printing that's no problem I
can tell the printer to just print like
ten wheels overnight and other parts
it's really nice thing actually I built
this printer from a dude yourself kit
it's the first version of the Ultimaker
printer and you can assemble it in one
up to three days depending on your
skills yeah and this is the printer that
I have in my office for just playing a
bit building these these machines so how
does the printing actually work you've
got a printing hat that you can see here
and it has a nozzle and you can also see
here you see here this nozzle it has a
very small hole that you cannot see it I
think but it's very thin like point four
millimeters and here you see the nozzle
isolated and you heat the nozzle up and
then there is a plastic wire that goes
into to the nozzle and then plastic
melts and you get out very small thin
layers of plastic and the printer will
move around and put one layer on top of
another and the plastics that I used are
basically PLA which is a biodegradable
plastic and you can do also print that
kind of plastic in your office it's no
problem and then there are other
plastics like abs which are not so
friendly they're awesome it doesn't
smell that good and it's not so healthy
to print that in in a living room or
something but you can do that as well I
mean it is a bit better more doesn't
break that fast and prints at little
higher temperatures but peel is fine for
building such a device sexual
so here is how printed parts look if you
carefully look then you see all these
layers it puts on top of each other and
there's a very very cool thing about
that because I visited a friend just a
few weeks ago and he has an electron
microscope and we could really closely
watch these parts and I mean these
devices are very expensive like 100
thousands of dollars so here you see the
why when you see it here with like this
being two millimeters and then we sue
min into also other parts around that by
when you see here these are two layers
connected to each other so I can see
that there is a lot of structural stuff
going on on the on the micro level and
you see layers as well
and if you go closer than actually the
plastic starts to melt so I cannot show
you its pictures yeah it was very cool
because you are then at the nano range
and you see bubbling and stuff and I
first thought okay there's something
going crazy going on I see atoms or
something that was not quite it it was
really like the heat actually on the
plastic but if you zoom out you you see
don't see it anymore after that because
it's just so small and it's really fun
to watch that actually I couldn't record
a video of that and I didn't dare to try
it again because I could have probed the
machine yeah so that's really fun and 3d
printing really I mean many people say
something like okay you can / plastic
but what's the big deal actually I mean
you can print bracelets and some funny
figures and we printed cubes and stuff
like that but actually I mean it's a
really huge improvement for prototyping
things and also that what we tried and
actually is somebody created a fractal
structure just a few days ago with the
programs we wish out there in the Java
app and I would love to try to print
that because such a fractal structure
it's not easy to build yourself but it's
very easy to print actually because the
printer doesn't care as long as you be
in the the limitations of the machine
then the printer doesn't care how
complex that geometry actually is and
here's also one quite impressive
mechanism the special thing about that
is that the joints here are just printed
as they are I mean you have to take out
one joint and then print it in a line
but actually the joints are printed as
they are here they are just bit hard to
move at the beginning but the printer
can handle that so that only very few
connections are in between it's quite
loose and then you can loosen them even
further and then you have really
flexible stuff and this is really hard
to to to manufacture in any other way
and I
managed to print chainmail like
structures like chained me like
bracelets and also gear mechanisms
unfortunately the the gear was gone
after 30 seconds when I showed it in the
in the Java app but so I can show it
here because this is kind of what the
most impressive thing I printed because
it's a complete planetary gear mechanism
that comes out of the printer completely
assembled and in school I also attended
to to like workshops for for building
robots and ships so like modeling stuff
and it was very expensive for me to
actually get the parts like special
bolts and nuts and get that assembled
and now it's really really cheap to
accomplish that so I think this is a
huge step forward even if we in the
consumer market can only print plastic
at the moment and not something like
metal or so but still I mean metal
printing is around for for quite a while
and there are even people who like to to
use this for a kind of molding yeah this
one was a do-it-yourself kit it's sells
for like a thousand euro and it has the
advantage over the one that we showed
here that you can improve it for dual
printing you can print even 20 materials
like this traffic cone I mean you have
dual extrusions as two wires of plastic
different colored and you can even do it
like one water dissolvable and one water
resistant and then you can even break
the limitations like printing big
overhangs because the printer you saw in
the Java hub when you would like to
print something like 90 degrees it would
just fall down but with what it is all
the limit here is you can just print up
support structures and then print this
90-degree angle like big bridges and so
on and then you put it into water and
then
several hours it's just gone and I mean
you can also do that if you just print
it with ordinary plastic but then you
have to remove the support structure ask
yourself and here's also another example
I have started to build a drone actually
a 3d printable drone and this is one arm
for the drone and inside there is a very
fractal-like structure with a lot of air
in it but still very stable and it's
also very difficult to design any other
way than just use printing at least at
home and they I build it like like a
bird's bone or something just with some
spaces and holds for cables and engines
and of course you can also print stuff
like a holder for the leap motion such
as a protection case for that and things
like that so it's really fun so the only
problem we have not discussed so far is
how do we create the geometries right I
mean it's easy to imagine something
really cool but then I'm getting that as
a real 3d object on the computer is not
so easy there are some options like
professional cad cam applications that
you can use you can even use blender for
that which is open source or openscad
which is also a script based language
for 3d modeling or you can use the new
JC is G and J FX get and it's all done
in Java yeah so the problem with
openscad for me I mean it's very
powerful tool I used it a lot and I'm
really grateful that the developers did
that but the problem with it the
scripting language is quite limited you
don't have any editor support or like
even variable every length or lists or
some other collection types and also I
didn't like the license so everything
you see here is under bsd license you
can do it for whatever you like just
grab the code and do your own stuff with
it and it would be nice if you just
what you do with it but there is not
actually no limitation because I think
then if you want to provide stuff for
teaching and for learning you should
give the the the users the ability to do
anything with it actually so how does
chasey as she work I mean you have to
think about how do you actually express
the the geometry I mean if you use
javafx ready for example you have these
3d triangle Memphis and basically you
could just put in all the vertices
manually and then assemble the mesh but
this is really complicated for something
like like this or the the drone arm or
something like that so we have to come
up with a different solution and this is
something called a constructive solid
geometry this is a type of algorithms
and the the the operations that are
supported our union so we use these two
circles and we can Union them into that
object here we can difference them so we
can cut out parts of a circle or sphere
or anything else we can do intersection
so only the intersection remains after
applying that operation and we can also
do a whole operation like wrapping two
objects so the Union operation here we
see some source code how that works in
JC is cheap and which I said we have a
cube and so here is the cube
and I removed the comments from there I
get a nice fear and what we can do now
with it so we can create the Union okay
and there are also some some other
examples like this we can move this fear
to somewhere else and then we get this
geometry and the special thing is the
intersecting polygons inside these two
objects are removed okay so it's
completely just has one outline so
that's the basic idea of the algorithm
the same with difference but we can just
cut a hole into that cube looks pretty
nice I think even though it's not so
easy to to print actually so we again
create a cube a sphere and then we
compute the difference between cube and
sphere so it's really easy and
approachable even if you don't know that
much about like cat operations here we
just move this fear a bit and we get
that geometry and what you can also do
is you can transform like translate
rotate and scale objects which helps you
with something like this then there is
intersection which is pretty cool as
well because you can have this like
rounded cubes in a way and so we we have
a mix between the sphere and the cube
another example like this again here we
just have basically the intersect
operation and in this case the transform
okay yeah of course you can so a good
question so we should be able to say
something like like this it's a bit
smoother and you can can even smooth it
further
yeah it's subdividing I know it's I mean
when it creates the sphere I mean really
when it creates the primitive geometry
because actually it's a geometric object
but we translate that to like polygons
in the first step and this is where what
it does here 16-8 is what we used here
and I mean you can keep that variable I
mean you just have some some variables
in your code and then you can change the
resolution afterwards because if you
create complex geometries it takes some
time if you have high resolution okay
and here is the hull version which is
also very interesting because it's just
you can imagine some plastic bag around
the cube and then the sphere so like it
first does the union of sphere and cube
like in the very beginning and so yeah I
can even change it more into a pole
actually like that we use this this also
a lot to something like that here and
can print pills
this is just using two spheres and then
wrapping them by using the whole
operation and I think the the API is
quite affordable I mean it's not very
difficult to get used to it and I try to
keep it that way that you can use like
auto completion in netbeans and it
always tells you what you can do
basically we also have javadoc for that
okay so now what about the software
stack we've got a server running on the
Raspberry Pi we have a an API that you
can use to control the robot from from a
client and we do that with xml RPC at
the moment and yeah then we have a very
small IDE it's a job of X place where
you can connect to the robot you can
create the geometries like I showed you
on the previous slides and you can also
interact with it program in it from
groovy so here the JC is she is
completely integrated into that and you
get all the source code after the
session so what I did to actually
install that stuff I just took the
ordinary raspberry and nooope image put
it on the micro SD card and then i
installed the server that i wrote and on
the client of course we have to have the
the ID so how to install the server so
first apologies for that the link is not
yet working because i had problems with
internet previously because I was not
here in helping but i will upload it as
soon as i can so everything as i said is
open source with all the source code and
i also give you the precompiled server
application for the Raspberry Pi this is
also because it incorporates some
services the in addition to the Java
code but everything is inside there you
basically just run the pie on wheels
server script and
you're up and running what you can also
do is you can use the RC local file on
the Raspberry Pi and just add the the
paion wheel server there and then just
reboot the pilot will start on every
reboot so here is the the IDE so we have
just a connection screen actually
doesn't do anything because the it scans
for the four raspberry PI's in the
network where it's currently connected
to so you don't have to specify any IP
addresses or so and if you have more
than one robot it will just connect to
more than one robot then we can interact
with it we can program the robot and
here we have a very nice control that I
will show you later Garrett has created
that one it's a really fun like yeah
locating control radar control and here
is the design application
so maybe I showed that now
so now the Raspberry Pi connects to the
hot spot that I created with my
smartphone and this led that you also
saw in the in the schematics is used to
indicate the state like when it's booted
up it will should blink I just leave it
here for now so that you can see because
if I put it on the floor probably you
have difficulties to see the robot
so you see now the raspberry pi is
blinking so and here we are connected
okay we get this nice connection screen
and we are talking to the robot so now
the the API okay just show it here I
don't know if you can see that actually
the font size is too small okay it's
fine
I think
just crashed let me try again sorry so
what you can try is we can move the
robot forward for like three seconds and
if I run that
just keep it and you see we have a small
dot that moves so even if you turn off
the robot you will see where it would
move so now let's try it on the floor
and we tried that and it should
oh it's stuck
okay yeah let's try again here
so that's how it all works and as I said
if you connect more than one robot then
it will just distribute the commands to
to all of them at once so we have api
for actually moving the robot and also
for letting the LED blink a little and
also for changing the state of the
infrared LED under the hood for the the
pulse width modulation we use the PI
blaster demon which is incorporated into
the Jaffa so you don't have to do
anything and it will talk to it because
it creates a linux device and then you
can specify the pulse width and just let
me briefly show you the the
implementation here
this is the server application and here
i created a pulse width modulation class
and you can specify the min value and
max value and send our values and which
gpio number it should choose and the
cool thing is you can actually use any
GPIO pin for that and we won't do
software pulse width modulation which is
usually used if you want to do it with
regular a GPIO pins but it uses a kind
of a hack actually in this demon so that
it can do a pulse width modulation
without using the cpu too much so it's
quite precise and the servo can turn it
can stop it's basically it and the LED
it can you can set the brightness and
you can also release the LED after usage
or it can blink with certain frequencies
and stuff like that so it can really
communicate back from the robot and you
can do that from from this IDE what you
could also do is you could actually yeah
I don't know I will show that inferred
stuff later when we come to the XPS so
what we did here is made for for
teaching right this is why we created
this small IDE so you should take that
and use it for teaching kids or students
or whoever you like because you can
learn programming in there and I don't
know if you were in my previous session
yesterday it was about visual
programming and we'll bring that all
together so that you can also use the
the better programming ide for that
robot but it's not yet done right it
relies on groovy in this case here and
the text based version and also the IDE
relies on groovy so it's not difficult
to bring those two together
so here is the design software you can
just type any kind of code you like and
of course we have prepared examples like
the board mount which looks like this
and you see we just we have predefined
classes as well which you see here in
just create a class that does all the
polygons for us and then you can use
that and can combine that let's see the
wheel
start one
and you can also save that directly as
stl file for the printer or as PMG like
just a snapshot as i did for the for
these slides actually and you can save
the the script files here we have a
special ending like Jeff X cat or you
can just save it as groovy and we
actually also did that with with
interacting here with the API it's just
called PI on wheel script or also groovy
so that's the basic soft and hardware
interaction you solve the API and this
IDE any questions about that part yep
what kind of quiet
I mean type of material it's called PLA
it's biodegradable plastic it melts at
like just below 200 degrees or sorry I
don't know exactly but about that and
yeah all these parts are made of that
plastic and there are other plastics as
well like flexible pas that you can use
for bracelet and stuff and then this
water dissolvable that I talked about
and also ABS I mean as I flown here with
the cone you just have to extruder hats
and then you print the white one and
then the gray one and then again the
white one just by switching the nozzles
basically so you cannot really mix the
colors like I want a 90 degree 90
percenter gray and just ten percent
white or something yeah I mean if you do
it with the JCC then you just create
like when you saw this cube example we
just go back to know actually it's
difference like this one you could also
use everything that is a hole now you
can just do the diff apply the
difference the other way around and then
you use both 14 color one and then for
the second color you use the other one
so I could have done something like fear
difference cube you know this is this
one here and by combining both of them
then you get a dual color print oh yeah
no actually not no difference here so
enter its intersect actually because
this one I mean it looks cool but
it won't print yes this is the
intersection okay and the other one was
the other color and then then you just
feed both into the printer software and
when you do that then you have to make
sure that you select both and say dual
color print then it will merge that back
again because the stl file format in its
original form does not have support for
multiple colors but that's the way i
created this cone so it's fairly easy
actually and especially if you mix
different materials like flexible ones
and non-flexible ones this is really fun
because you have flexible parts and
non-flexible parts and it's really nice
for bracelets and stuff like that yeah
other questions yes it as I said earlier
everything is completely open source on
the bsd license as much as i can some
parts might be under lgpl but still
usable for basically anything you like
but i like bsd most for teaching and
stuff because you should be able to do
anything you like with it if you have
great idea than just do it and i didn't
have internet earlier so i will upload
the server a pre-compiled version of the
server later but actually everything you
saw in the slides like the the the code
examples which is also just a java vex
program is already online and the other
one will be published today and just on
github and if you visit my webpage i can
give you a card later on then you just
go and download and also if you read the
session description then it will be
shown there as well yeah
so
basically we covered the pie on wheels
API and then Garrett and I thought about
adding support for these XP modules who
knows them okay a few these are small
devices running at 2.4 gigahertz and
like 2 milli bot and they have a an
indoor range for y'all like 40 meters
and actually we got the the XP pro in
this case so it has an extended range I
don't know exactly the range but it's
more than that and it has yeah auto
range here for the normal XPS is 120
meter and yeah we run it at three point
six volt and it has a impressive
operation range from minus 42 up to 85
degrees Celsius so they have different
mesh or like connection types network
types and they are programmable which is
really cool it's kind of a small
controller in there and they also have
very small wake-up time this is very
fast if you connect them they're just up
and running as you saw earlier with the
pie this is not the case it takes like
seconds up to a minute or so to boot and
it's had it has its own yeah standard
for for the remote thing here are the
connectors you can connect like VCC and
gnd you have digital pins even pulse
width modulation pins and you also have
analog pins this is really nice because
you can read analog values as well this
is the setup that we use for those
sensors so we have an infrared receiver
on them and
you could use that for example for
interactive even further with the robot
so it has to drive to a certain point
and then you move around and stuff like
that or you could also send commands
explicitly from the computer and then
hand it over to the pie whatever you
like and these small devices are also
very easy to set up I mean you just need
a small battery as a battery that runs
at three point six volt few cables
breadboard and then here a breakout
board for the xb1 resistor and infrared
receiver that's everything you need for
that setup it costs about twenty-five
hero depending on where where you get
them so now about the network topologies
first there is the mesh topology that
has a really met like structure the
notes are communicating to each other
and it's good for wide range networks
because if you try for example to
communicate from this one to that one
this is the distance that matters right
between two notes and the actual path
through the network will be discovered
by the devices themselves so it has the
advantage of being self healing so if a
node doesn't work anymore then you still
have if you have another path from one
node to another then it still works and
it has as I already mentioned a wide
range and yeah the problem however is
that it's very complex to set up and you
broadcast all the time so therefore you
have higher power consumption so that's
why we use the star topology so we have
one coordinator it's this one connected
to the laptop and then
we communicate with all the notes so we
have not such a big range but in our
case this is no problem it is very easy
to set up I mean besides the fact that
setting up these devices is not always
that easy because sometimes they just
break I mean because I started
developing for those just two weeks ago
and when I when Garrett gave me those
and I started playing with them and I
said okay I broke them all because the
software tells me that they don't
respond and I have to rewrite the
firmware and everything but then he said
yeah sure that's quite common so you
have to try ten times and then it works
and that's exactly how I set them up but
on the other hand if you set them up
once then they just run forever so the
star topology has the advantage of
having low power consumptions because
each node knows that it only has to
communicate to the coordinator and this
one here is why it we use be so it
doesn't matter that much it's easier to
maintain a problem is maybe that you
have a short range or that the
coordinator is the bottleneck if you
have many nodes but in our case this is
not a limitation and of course you don't
have interaction between nodes but yeah
I look for this case this is the ideal
setup so no that was too fast we want to
demonstrate now the feature here so as
the robot doesn't drive that well i just
rode like that but like you to see these
leds and if i connect or hold the sensor
near and led
okay doesn't get work don't know maybe
the battery it's broken now just let me
try to restart that
all I should do it with so like that so
actually there's native code in it so we
just play in the native code for having
it not working
yes
that's really bad because it's actually
very so much fun to watch that
so then I say that we are open for
questions I try to fix that while you
ask questions and also am for the first
three questions I'm giving away these if
you have raspberry PI's so we have three
raspberry pi holders so yeah question
here it would actually and what we
thought about is having like a small
ball inside you know even a like a metal
ball inside and you could click it and
then it could move freely this is what
we thought about but I have to redesign
that for though for that so because
there yeah this is also an option yeah
yeah you get one
thank you you're welcome next one
no further yep excuse me you mean the
electronics I mean of course they are
services that sell that online I think
they are not that cheap so if you plan
to use that for education really and let
students or kids play with 3d printing
and designing then you should probably
consider buying a printer because then
it's easier but if you only want to
print one part like just for for seeing
how that actually works then it might be
sufficient to to just order that online
there are several services I mean I
don't know where you locate it just
check check online and also there is a
webpage called thingiverse and yeah
we'll get pretty much anything you like
I mean even if I I designed everything
myself here and i uploaded daughter to
Thingiverse but to be honest everything
you need i mean like for drones and for
robots and there's so many parts that
have already designed there what I'd
like to encourage you is to use the JCC
and upload your own designs and the
source code to Thingiverse because what
i don't like about the the openscad it's
very restrictive GPL license so it's
very difficult if you play with stuff
that is not under GPL and then sometimes
people refuse or companies and that's
all so happy with GPL I of course the
things should be open but I think bsd is
a better option for that yeah
hi blaster yeah so I came up with the
solution to actually integrating that
into the jar file like so we have the PI
blast binary inside the Jaffa as
resource and now let's see pulse width
modulation device so i have filewriter
to the device the pipe last device and i
can write a pulse width modulation come
on I mean this is all private so not
exposed and to start the the PI plaster
I get the URL to the resource I just
copy the file to like something like a
temp I plaster make it executable and
run it so it's really easy because a
Java developer will not notice that
there is the PI plaster behind so I
don't want you to install special
packages recompiling your kernel or
something like that I mean there's also
this server plaster which is
specifically made for servos but you
have to recompile use the kernel module
and like that what one much better
because it's broader for not only servos
but also LG's and stuff and integrating
that into a trap file is really easy and
it's at the moment made for the pie but
one could also extend that to support
other boards as well yep
which performance the real-time
performance I mean no I mean real time
performance mean this is just a robot
that moves around and it's for teaching
stuff so I didn't have any performance
measures really so yeah so if you have
further recommendations or your own
ideas i mean i would also like to to
improve that to also support other robot
models but this is just the basic one
that we just designed now the focus is
of course to keep that very simple so
that it's easy for people to build that
one of course not every school or
university has a 3d printer but I mean
the technology is moving and I think it
will be in almost any at least
University in just a couple of years so
I'll try to set the pup if you are
interested then just stay here for a few
minutes and ya then thanks a lot for
