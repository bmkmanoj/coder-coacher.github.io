of live session here at in Seoul let me
host Javed Mohammed and I have as my
guest today pretty quick but pratik
patel who is the CTO of trip lingo
so pratik welcome thanks and thank you
for coming over
I guess we were just talking off camera
a little bit that you've been to quite a
few of the Oracle code cities yeah so
just kind of can you numerate them again
so in order to Anto london tel-aviv
Tokyo and now Seoul so yeah I mean
anything okay I won't tell you to pick a
city but okay any any anything that
stood out really from any any of the
visits to article code yeah it actually
I was pleasantly surprised at how many
how many great developers there were all
the events whether it was in Toronto or
or London or Tel Aviv or Tokyo it was it
was great to see all of the really
passionate developers and ginga interact
with them during the day and you know
afterwards at the social it was it was a
lot of fun okay all right well
developers are the folks that we're
targeting and you as a CTO I think we
were talking last time you actually one
of the things that you do is cold yep
you don't so you're part of us startups
always kind of very interesting because
it's everything is kind of very hands-on
over the years I mean how do you find
that the role of the development has
changed in with respect to startup size
right so what's interesting I think
about the way that especially very small
startups have been structured or what
what happens at these startups is that
it actually I don't think has changed
very much over the last five to ten
years specifically that especially at
very early stage startups like basically
seed around or even before that
early-stage startups the the CTO of the
company
still very much involved in day-to-day
development and of course there's a
little bit of a spectrum there some CTOs
are very hands-on in terms of coding and
they do coding you know all the time and
then for other startups depending on the
person I think some CEOs will code some
of the time but not all the time but I
think that's been a constant is that
especially in early-stage startups when
we talk about the the actual the the
getting involved in the day-to-day
programming of features and products and
stuff like that
the C tails are very involved
early-stage startup CTOs are very
involved even with the coding even today
I start up as many years old now I don't
know if it can be called a start-up
anymore but I still code almost on a
daily basis Wow so yeah so and and I
think a lot of that has to do with the
fast pace of Technology compounded with
the fast pace of what happens at a
startup all right so so tech as you know
moves very very quickly especially it
feels like the the rate of change in
software development has accelerated
over the last 10 years dramatically in
my opinion it just in terms of the new
tech and frameworks and lots of things
coming out but I also feel like the the
speed at which startups moved today
compared to five or ten years ago has
also accelerated in terms of adoption of
technology pushing products and features
out faster and I think the I think they
to kind of go hand in hand with the rate
of change of technology and with the the
things and the tools and platforms which
are available when you're in the startup
to be able to provide features or
building features etc building products
even at a small company so there's no
rate at which you could do something
like that is is compounded by the fact
that we we have all these great tools
that are coming out that help us get
products and features out faster and on
top of that you throw out the the
amazing advances in infrastructure that
make a huge difference so I kind of
disagree there so
two things I wanted to kind of build up
on and I think you it's a very broad
subject so just together so so one thing
you were talking about infrastructure
will come to that second yeah the first
part I just wanted to ask you is like
with high cold low code no code is the
is the level at which your coding does
that is that changing you are that's an
interesting question I think that that's
the answer is both yes and no at the
same time there's still a lot of the low
level code that has to be written and
you know this kind of linked together
things and very fundamental level is
still very much there and then you think
of all the maybe not frameworks is the
right word but all the off-the-shelf
libraries that you can use which allow
you to access features and whatever
library does for example at a much
higher level is because there's so many
open source and available libraries now
you write a lot of low code but a lot of
it is also just interfacing with
libraries to do things that would
normally take you a long time but now oh
I can just pull this library off the
shelf so I think today a perfect example
of that is some of the advances that are
happening in the machine learning space
you know in the past you would have to
program everything from scratch for that
but very quickly what's happened in the
ml space is that well you don't actually
need to be an expert in these low-level
deep learning or machine learning
algorithms and libraries and stuff you
can just pull a library off the shelf
and then pick a pre-condition machine
learning set and plug it into a library
and all of a sudden you can do image
recognition right without having to have
all that code that you've had to written
and doing all the training and all that
stuff that you have to do for machine
learning for example so it's so yes you
still do a lot of the low-level stuff
but there are a lot of off-the-shelf
libraries that allow you to code at the
high level very quickly and not have to
spend a lot of time building out very
rudimentary things to build a feature up
okay so the second part thank you for
fancy that you also touching what
infrastructure and with the advances in
DevOps and
the ability to actually spin up
environments in the cloud as has that
rule changed oh yeah definitely so I'll
tell you story they're the first startup
I did way way way back ago I remember
that long yeah he surprised we actually
and went and bought servers to put into
a rack for that startup uh-huh right and
nowadays if you if you talk to people
who are new into the tech startup space
that that that concept is just
mind-boggling ly like completely
different all right it's like what you
bought your own servers why would you do
that you just rent some some space on a
cloud infrastructure whatever and you
deploy some code but but the the cost
and the time and everything that it took
to do that back then now is completely
gone all right so it's it doesn't matter
what you're interested in terms of what
you need to deploy you can just
literally rent for very very small
amount of money just to get started
right I think this is why the rate of
startups in terms of its startups being
able to push out features has
accelerated greatly because you can just
rent space whether it's on AWS or Oracle
cloud that's right yeah thank you based
on Oracle cloud they exist yeah it's
great to have choice right so but you
can just rent space for you know five or
ten bucks a month or whatever right and
you need very little money to actually
get started and in it's so easy to scale
up it's like I'm using a small instance
on Oracle cloud and now I have you know
a thousand users next month I may have
ten thousand a hundred thousand users
you just turn a dial on their website
you pay a little bit of extra money and
now you can support a hundred thousand
users without having to do anything
I think that's phenomenal in terms of
being able to get a start up from zero
to a thousand users to a hundred
thousand whatever the scaling problem
has already been solved for you and
that's a huge headache it used to be a
huge headache it's like oh now we have
to go get more servers and put
to Iraq now we have to configure them or
pay somebody a lot of money to configure
them now you just literally log on to
for example the Oracle code website you
turn a slider up to say give me a bigger
instance and boom all of a sudden you're
rolling with a lot more capacity there's
lots of other things we have to worry
about obviously we have to make sure
that our architecture can support that
and etc etc but just to be a the just to
have the ability to do that is
phenomenal today and and you know kind
of looking back on what I've been had to
do in the past to get to that level of
automation is just it's incredible that
the speed at which you can ramp up a
team and build code and boy get users
etc okay it is quite nice anyways last
question yeah what keeps you up at night
other than kids and anything else is
going but in terms of kids taking all
those things in terms of being a CTO and
developer and you've got a live you know
you've got a site in which thousands or
tens of thousands they're using so so
just from a bigger perspective yeah so
to be honest with you I don't really
worry too much about the DevOps side of
things because almost all this cloud
infrastructure handles this for you very
well right whether it's you know
automatic scaling or if something goes
down you can get you know it back in the
day used to carry pager and you get
paged nowadays you just get an email or
a text message or push the monitoring
software exactly so all that stuff is
kind of handled which is great it makes
you know it makes our lives easier and
lets it lets us focus our brain capacity
on building features and products but
the the challenges that is always
constant over time is how do you do how
do you do sales onboarding new customers
and all those kinds of things right so
so but when you work as a CTO even
though you're involved on the tech side
typically it's the making sure that you
get new customers every week or every
month or whatever right especially if
you're the we're more in a b2b kind of
space so we sell
luckily the company's right b2b but
making sure that we provide the features
that new customers or potential
customers want being able to provide
those features fast enough and just
being able to close sales and things
like that and kind of keep keep the ball
rolling you know and and accelerate how
fast the ball is rolling those are the
big things that really worry me
okay yeah well pratik thank you so much
for coming by
glad we were finally able to do this on
the absolutely xx City yeah but really
appreciate it all the best thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
