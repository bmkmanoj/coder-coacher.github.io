Borges welcome to the tweet for beer
hopefully you guys got already enough
beer for the whole week right who was at
the taylor street already okay who got
drunk last night alright so we got a
team here alright cool so this is a talk
about an experiment on enabling
beertender we used the Heineken one and
connecting it to the cloud right so
instead of just asking for beer you have
to tweet and then connect if you don't
have an account so we made it more
complicated to get beer but the idea was
to experiment stuff with a good outcome
beer so just guys please read these this
is not a product not a promise at all by
all means change things make change and
etcetera etcetera etcetera I'm a
borgeous I'm product manager for meat or
in North America and also gel evangelist
for java ee java facts and etc i think i
just don't know about java cord in MEA
put SC affects me I'm ok if you want any
more information after the session you
can contact me on Twitter or over email
that's me Marco maciel sorry well I'm
gonna stuck here i'm from brazil the
Java ME java and by the team I work for
for Latin America and I work with this
guy and he got me with well let's do
some nice things with Java oh ok and
with Pierre 2400 and right now let's
start so who is here basis or knows who
r l in Latin America no matter map I
know you are please ok so let's continue
so I d before I go through that we
started playing with these idea remotely
just make sure you guys are give you
some context I since I'm a televangelist
deal with Java Midler and mark of the
with Java is V job embedded of rocks
bear paw sword we know we decided to
come up with a demo that involved all
those things and Mark was really good to
the hardware stuff ord we knows
connecting Rosberg pies burning stuff
and other things and I'm good at the
board and stuff now just before so we
have an idea of what's going on behind
this is a job 2020 picture of Java stat
and Miller is tagged for Internet of
Things on the device we usually go with
the proposer here is of course using
Java in the device which enables what
give gives the option for users and
developers to work with Java card job
embedded you can use the Berkeley DB and
when you look at the job embedded can be
depending on the harder you have
you can play with Java SCE embedded not
just the Java ME II but anyway it's
embedded and then we have the gateway
which is the more powerful device that
would maybe gather information from
these small devices and then calculate
stuff process data and then send that to
the cloud and then you have of course
the cloud and we have a bunch of
software running the back end process
all that stuff we used a java ee
application running on me door to it
being able to connect the devices that
we have in order set up of the tweet for
beer here is just just an overview I
want to spend much time here so
solutions for embedded devices how many
of you have seen this picture before
okay good so it's a new picture for most
of you this just gives you an idea of
where to deploy and why each platform it
exists so we have Java card for really
like just playing for security stuff we
can have like your credit cards they are
probably using drop a card and it's for
really really small footprint so like 50
cape for or even last eight cakes 88 k
so yeah it's really small and then we
have a little more powerful devices that
we would then run Java m.e I mean I
don't know any example of Jeremy you can
run respect by in Java me we also have
all the blu-ray players in the world
runs java me too most people don't
doesn't know about this but all the
roommates has a virtual machine inside
and brazil we have all the tvs the
digital tvs have java me and better
inside of the ology fees because
the interactive layer for develop
applications for the TV are built using
Java ME and then finally for the
embedded devices world we have Java Sea
advanced which is Java Sea embedded
which is pretty much the same java SE
Debra's on your laptop but it comes with
additional features so for example the
compact profiles in Java 8 if you heard
about that that is part of the java SE
for embedded then you can have a smaller
JVM or with only a few things that you
may require to run your application
instead up the full JVM full features of
of java sea and then depending on the
device you can have java see this
exactly exactly the same is the case of
that's the case of Raspberry Pi in
raspberry pi you can run Java C Java Sea
embedded in Java me because they are all
compiled for ARM processors so it can
basically choose whatever you want but
in this case here are some examples like
ATM machines MRI machines those run Java
Sea embedded they need more power they
have more power and software that runs
inside and it requires more power to do
more complex processing in the device
instead of pushing to have data to some
computer network and then processing
there to get back so it does inside
already that's operation
let's try to yeah yeah this is a java me
well we're not talking more about
feature phones in the past java me was
was in all feature phones that were was
created but lot now our focus now are
and our focus has an embedded devices
for the iot world we are talking about
java runny and low and or meet and
devices in this jeff one will launch the
Java ME eight for a free scale board
called key key 64 is a board that runs
with our 190 kilobytes of RAM and you
can run Java em here 08 inside is not
the old Emmy that have a lot of
configurations and the old API so you
are talking about me8 the eight top one
just launched it so we're talking about
we have just this board and the left and
left is that your motherboard it's a
developer develop a concept for Jamal do
it runs java ee and has 3g and GPR g p
RS connector so you can send us a SMS
message received and mating calls okay
not have that has that microphone but
you can receive calls for a certain
number using java and it's very simple
to deploy a jar file inside you just
plug it in your computer and drag and
drop the jar you just created in the
NetBeans to a specific folder so it's
done and it runs java and raspberry PI's
and
other stuff we're talking about Java
there the new Java brownie and devices
with a very small footprint java seen
battle has Bruno a nation we are
preparing children and devices with a
little more power we're talking about
more power I'm not talking about servers
I'm talking about raspberry PI's 512
megabytes of RAM or a BeagleBone black
it's just in the middle or not so these
guys are not so small but are very small
so dis dis guys are very small too we
are talking about a computer with a half
gigabytes of RAM so it runs java SC
javis embedded in fact is the same it
has the same api's of the java SE the
normal java c you can run create program
a software in your computer in just copy
or ftp the the fire took a bigger bone
or a raspberry pi and it runs the same
way yeah and we have for example this
magic magical toy i love it it's the
lego mindstorms did who knows that my
might storms here yeah it's a very nice
toy I do toy not for a child it was Java
heavy inside so you can okay then choose
developer using third tools or for us at
least for me more funny to develop our
system to the Mindstorms user our
beloved the java the java sing ballads
is a very nice a brother has a badass
approach because the idea is not run an
SE sensors or small stuff this is for
Java ME for Japanese see we are talking
about concentrators databases gateways
imagine everyone here and wants to
automate your home your houses so you
put sensors and the light okay your
machine or I don't know your television
this is sensors it's the sensors r else
maybe Java ME but you have a
concentrator a guy that control
everything you talk not with your device
you are talking to this concentrate this
gateway so you control to store data to
make this guide talk to the internet
it's easier using java SE embedded it's
easier have this concentrator talking to
the internet to the internet of things
it's easier then make each device talk
to the internet so device talk to the
gateway and the gateway talk to the
internet and in this gateway we are
using java SE invited okay so one of the
one of the cool things about Java Sea
embedded for hard words that have that
the hard words that have GPU is that you
can run Java facts so for example
instead of running an ATM with a full
deck full pc inside you will just put a
raspberry pi or any board like that
inside the ATM machine got the big
machine but instead of occupying thirty
percent of that space with a large
desktop pc in a monitor you would just
use the device small device connected to
an LCD monitor and then you have a new
ATM bulk-buying much less space except
for the money but the idea is to have
the analysis really to to see that you
can have a computer with a nice UI
embedded on anything that you may want
so in our case we have the beard
but we could have done something even
cooler we could have embedded an LCD at
the beer tender to give information
about the temperature about how much
beer has been served about how many is
left how many people drank the Twitter
stream or something like that all that
running this small computer with iui
with a job of XY so you save a lot of
space in terms of hardware and Buddy
continue to have one hundred percent of
the features that you have when when you
deploy a pc for for those kind of use
cases the java fax platform is designed
reference with this these hardware as a
reference platform the beagleboard XM
power if you are but it is also running
on other hardware's not just these three
there are many more but mostly Raspberry
Pi freescale imx6 and 10 the boards but
there are other boards that runs LFX
with ARM processors and GPUs when they
come with the GPUs of course you can
deploy it most of these hope these
boards come with an HD hdmi port so it's
pretty easy to connect LCDs on it if you
want touch screen one of the nice things
about Java fax is you just plug an LCD
that has touchscreen capabilities and
that works out of the box with John
effects so you just need to write really
like code so i add least an hour swipe
left on your java code and they can have
a listener on one screen so it's really
easy to code those kind of applications
visual applications with drug effects
for the embedded market
yeah that's the other important thing is
when you're running java fax
applications on these kind of devices
the reason it consumes less memory and
kamrun is because it does not require
the x server on linux it goes straight
to the GPU so you don't have a window
management system running under between
the application and the operational
system it's really just javafx
application so you really need to
consider stuff like resolution of the
monitor so the perfect the perfect way
to set up the application is to have the
same size else where you are going to
deploy it if you want to have dynamic
calculations it's possible to have an
application at ultra scale for different
resolutions but that may require some UI
that will give you some you are
challenges to have a responsive UI of
your application but it's possible so
it's really it's really it's a really
good platform for visual stuff and
you're going to show you why we used jar
effects here until not why how we use
java effects on the tweet for beer and
finally some some real deployments where
javis c java me driving ballads being
used you may not you may not realize but
in your day day by day in your life you
end up stopping by at machine similar
like this one at some point and all of
them run java you go to a doctor's there
the radiator there may be an error an
x-ray machine that already gets the
image and sends to the computer over the
network that probably is running job
inside so that's the embedded market now
it's not like they ate the web market
where we can you can run an application
and just the point on the web and
everybody will have access to it it's a
different market so we really need to be
involved if you really want to work all
these market you pay attention to that
it's a it's a very very niche market so
it's not like I'm gonna write these
embedded application and put on App
Store right you need those machines run
it so it's another market we are looking
at here
ok so the java treat for beer project
just before we go there so again we
wanted to demonstrate java embedded
javafx for embedded the cloud in terms
of thing is not working etc and I
thought what if someone needed to tweet
something in order to activate the
beertender that was the basic idea if
you if you want the machine to pour beer
for you you have to tweet now the
interesting thing about these use cases
that that's a really good use case for
awareness for brandings for social media
for all of that so you let's see let's
say that you are running a party and you
want people to expose your company brand
only if they participate somehow with
the party and that participation comes
from it comes from Iraq interaction
interacting with the machine in our way
that hey you need to do something to get
what you want we'll give you for free
but you need to do something so in this
case would be tweet for a beer now this
is how Marco did the initial setup well
I use I don't know if you know this
cactus Heineken keg whoo-hoo here no
this guy this this type beer can you do
notice beer Taylor it's a very small
beer tender you can have yet your home
near your TV and PlayStation and your
wife will love it in your living room
and when you are just thirsty you just
leave always leave it a beer keg inside
yeah and plug in the wall to have it
code but it's a it's not big it's
something like this size and we can have
it at home click easily yeah the problem
we would just we bought this this keg
this the standard and we realize that
this is not an electric that tender so
the the beer comes out using the big ass
inside of the CAG it's like a spray like
a something so well we cannot develop
armor or some device to make this
movement so I i use i used the eval a
solenoid valve a little issue if you are
if you all know but to serve all that
exists in some washing machines so yeah
it's brand new okay I brought my anyone
but I use a solenoid valve to open and
close the the CAG to get a beer so it's
why burn for this image there so yeah
it's a it's a it's a solenoid valve that
goes into the CAG between the whatever
you call it in English and the beer keg
so it is the the beard vendor is always
open so the valve is in between and then
when you activate when we need to eat we
activate evolve turns on for a few
seconds the beer goes out and then we
close it after a few seconds we I mean
how general like we are gonna ask at me
oh oh oh very nice it fits very well how
do you calculate these these devices
this is work around four hi I didn't
calculate I try a three or four and you
feel and this the beer it begins an
story ends and very very precisely how
did it go I put three seconds or four
seconds five seconds and waits okay I
stop it so yeah it's a it's a it's time
basis so you have to define how many
seconds will be open so if you if you
give a bigger cup you need to give more
seconds now of course you can do
something some some interesting stuff
for example you could put a
sensor in here that could maybe get a QR
code printed in the cup that will tell
the Machine how many milliliters or
what's the volume of that cup and a
couple have the Cure contraband and then
a machine you will know how much to poor
instead of you figure out how many
seconds so you could have a rocket small
camera here gets a career code sends the
machine machine notes what's that volume
or you can go even further and actually
put three four cameras in calculate the
volume so that would be a little bit
complicated but it's possible so that's
Marcos wife yeah once this is kind of
like of money destroyed the machine at
the first so in the end this is the this
is how you we got it it's just one valve
in between plug to the relay that is
connected to the Raspberry Pi and it
just turned on and off like at the
beginning we thought oh my god how you
got to make it we're going to have a
serve motor to turn on the end off up
and down the arm to open the keg or are
you going to do it so it just used
evolved so the flow for this project is
this so you want to have some here you
look at the screen that is at the
beertender and you see this QR code that
has some red hashtags in twitter and a
ticket now the tweet the guy sees these
takes a picture goes twitter and goes
twitter and tweets now when he tweets
this application here is connected to
twitter and searching on twitter stream
when we got our tweet with the hashtag
and this ticket at the end now why the
ticket basically because you didn't want
people to get the hashtag and go to the
bathroom and keep tweeting and messing
up with our demo so we wanted them to be
at the booth and it will look at the
screen hey my ticket is okay this one
this number then i'll tweet &amp;amp; poor's
it's really fast like
23 seconds probably at most the
processing from the tweet until the beer
is poured and then this application
updates the ticket it reloads it
automatically this is the this was just
this is a demo this is a better version
of dy we had a button to reload just in
case something didn't work but it was
reloading automatically after activating
the other raspberry pi so we send that
information to the cloud and the order
of a pie is connected to the beertender
and activates it devolved you can sorry
bro just to to code Matt but Dwight you
raspberry PI's ok we can we could use
just one but I lived on base angry
general and Bruno is based in some pollo
so we thinking about to use you because
I will build one power of the demo and
he will build another part of the demo
and we can using this disk the cloud we
can have a point that we talked with
each other in a cloud so we not need to
be closer so it was a very nice approach
because i was with the keg and he too
heated each test and I I have I have I
had to drink all the beer because the
guy goes with me so it was about hey
Marco want some more beer fix that and
now treated something like that so it
was a really really simple setup the
Java code for all that it's really small
you don't either you wouldn't think that
to have something like that would take
just a few days really we in less then I
think we took a two to three days if we
count how many hours we spent it in this
project it's about two to three days two
men hour I spent so much hours fighting
in testing the solenoid then the storage
in code again
I / to coding java the java code was
written in probably one afternoon by two
men hour but one afternoon so it was
really really easy to implement that
without the knowledge that we already
had for java i mean if you wanted to
have something like a hospital a small
computer I screen some nice UI and
implemented in C++ or whatever would
take like weeks for us to do that so
having the knowledge on Java platform
and having a harder that supports it and
vice versa it was great and we could
implementing java facts DUI the java
headless Raspberry Pi code to plug the
GPIO port and turn on the relay to
opened evolve was really really easy and
then you have a java ee application in
the cloud that connects the two the
hchildress berry pies so we went from
almost end-to-end dissolution oh it just
didn't have to Java card but maybe we
think about it so the guy lost his job
because now you can self-service right
so this is a picture of the setup this
was an event at tDCS in in Brazil so
someone comes to the booth takes a
picture it tells the javafx application
is connected to Twitter and then you see
the wire its processing Twitter here and
when it gets the this tweet here with
that ticket it changes the ticket and
sends information back to the cloud hey
activate the beertender and then this
other guy here is connected to the cloud
as well listen aah should I open now
should I hope open now and then it gets
the information a open now and then it
sends not this one I'm sorry this one
and it turns on the relay that is
connected to the beertender here so it
was a really nice way to demonstrate the
technology let me just show you
when you are tweet for beer right here
we have here
a Raspberry Pi running a java fixed
application which is connected to the
internet application since
a signal to a server which communicates
with our other Raspberry Pi that has an
application running on java method this
application switches on and off the
relay which connects with anything k it
turns on the cake so you can pour some
beer
so now we get a ticket number this
ticket number will be copying it
going to Twitter so we can tweet
hashtag
here I gotta face it
and I will be tweeting right now this
hashtag with the number which will be
activating
the application running on the Raspberry
Pi which to do a relay which will turn
on
let's look at how this goes
yeah in the beer is really nice and call
true
that was alive warm as hell it was
really warm to be or not not cold liar
but it was really nice and I set up nice
booth like small just to raspberry PI's
the beertender a touchscreen small one
and you can see javabean use everywhere
in the cloud the UI and the embedded
device controlling a GPIO port so to
give you some some idea some ideas on
how we did is we're going to show you
some code here so for example just this
is like how to generate a random number
in Java you go that in Google you get
this code here okay near random next
float x 900 thousand plus a hundred
thousand and you get six numbers
randomly always stack overflow awesome
here you have a patchy camel the
particular project to process Twitter
now how do we process Twitter can we use
to it for Jay yes you can you can you
can that's a nice that's another nice
nice thing about Java in the embedded
world you can take any library and we
use them in a better devices if it's for
Java Sea embedded or Java Sea of course
but you can definitely use almost any
library that is already already exists
and put them inside the embedded device
instead of writing your own or etc so
you go to a pet chicken or Twitter there
is component that you can say hey
Twitter to the component extreme and
filter these keywords so we used the TDC
for example plus Java beer and whenever
you got a tweet you call this method
process to eat now this matter here you
get these Turtles the text and the
current ticket from the UI so this is a
java facts property it gets the value
from the UI and let's check hey does it
contains the hashtags yeah
does it contains the ticket at the end
of the tweet yes so if true we're gonna
set the body of the message in this
exchange and put it through so now going
to filter it if it's true then you're
going to just clear the body but you're
going to invoke the URL in the cloud to
tell the beertender hey activate the
beertender and then the cloud is now is
aware of of that flag and we finish it
we finish this by processing a new
random ticket that will be displayed
here now this finishes the Twitter
processing with these few lines of code
I was able to connect to Twitter filter
get check the requirements of the tweet
and called invoke the cloud to say hey
you need to activate a beer tender
wherever it is we i mean what
application doesn't know about the other
one that's why we wanted to use the
cloud here and then i generate a new
random ticket that is displayed in the Y
so about the application in the code in
the Java EE side so we have just this
restful service it's turned on we get a
put and I get so put to set turn on to a
false and the gap is being called by the
beertender raspberry pi that will check
the status off turn on if it's two of
two of phones not going to go you
through this but basically you can get
java ee application easily deployed in
the cloud with plugins and tools works
for everywhere so if you want to look
into java ee for cloud you have plenty
of options in oh this is interesting
actually so Oracle cloud is providing a
NetBeans has provided NetBeans plugin
for the Oracle cloud so you can run java
ee applications from that beans directly
the cloud you just have to sign up for
an account and then you can configure
that beans you activate the plug-in here
you create your application I'm sorry
you create
find your new ad cloud provider you
provide your username and password and
etc and then you can just go to your
enterprise application in that beans and
say hey I want to use the server in the
Oracle cloud and then you got you have
it connected to the call p easily so how
do we turn on the beer with gpio don't
use these at home the colors really like
lame and stupid and ugly so you're going
to realize why but it's because it's a
wild true right it's just like keep
checking the cloud for when it's true or
false oh it's true okay turn on the beer
changer and then it clears and keeps
looping so that it's yeah that's what it
does you check the cloud if it's one we
gotta activate the beertender now we
used Joey seven jax-rs children Oh
client api we create a new client we set
a target the URL we say i want to get on
that that URL and say if it's true i'm
going to return one because the code
that Marco did was one and I didn't
follow his instructions correctly and
then you had to fix it so this is how it
this is the very easy way to do with we
did I will not say the hard way but well
I'll show you I not so very easy way to
do it yeah I mean this is just like make
let's make it run but it's definitely
not the best way to do it if we were
going to do this for production for
really a product we would probably use a
WebSocket connection to have it
communication stateful communication
between them instead of just keep
checking the cloud that's lame right so
WebSocket communication is a fully
bidirectional communication between
servers and clients and we could do that
between the raspberry PI's centralized
in the cloud and a WebSocket endpoint
that would be the preferred way to do
this but if we just wanted to have it
a demo here sorry man but after done it
does and don't change a line of code
everything that I saw in my life that
are in production using margaret codes
are still running production will never
using this and i wanna get here it's
spaghetti spaghetti sorry it is not
spaghetti code this is a bad posture
yeah yeah not that's so small code bad
posture so how do you turn on the beard
theater so pretty easy gpio pie for Jay
if you want to juice simple things with
relays and some monitors for temperature
etc p by 4jays really good library to do
that you can use the the raspberry pi
ports instead of using arduino or other
stuff just use those ports are already
there and connect it by 4 J so this we
got the instance we set which which port
is connected in this case it's hard
coded its port number 05 but we could
have done something more dynamic and
then you say hey set it at high energy
which turns on wait for 4 seconds or
whatever we set up and then turn it down
and shut down the connection with the
GPIO so i would say how many lines of
code i counted a hundred maybe even less
than that less than 100 cut lines of
code for all this project except for the
javafx you why because that's a little
bit more complex in terms of f xml to
defense they find dy with xml and markup
but in terms of really what's going on
and with everything it was really really
easy to do it so uh before the thank you
let's give us some try here with
the application so this is the
application running in java facts now
you let me run it again because it
probably crashed
the insert thing about the JavaFX
running scen s embedded at that Bruno
didn't change a line of code to develop
this board to that s the to the desktop
a laptop like this and the Raspberry Pi
it is exactly the same jar file yes
that's yeah that's the same application
I've been running the team binary that I
run in my laptop is running at the
Raspberry Pi so you can just move it
with ssh is that anyone wants to change
the ticket if you tweet that it will
hopefully change the ticket because it's
connected to the internet so if you
tweet that QR code but no beer yeah no
beer we are not a lot of analog serve
beer here black see already that change
sorry we heard we heard something about
next year someone's can't okay
so this is not the same version that we
were running at the Oracle OpenWorld otn
booth it's a previous version but
hopefully it works so 34 yeah 91 so it
changed now at this time if there was
berry pie of the beauty and it was
online it would pour the beer somewhere
somewhere in the world okay maybe maybe
someone is drinking out this beer in
Thailand whatever so uh pretty easy
setup Rico demonstration of end-to-end
Java and just to give you some thoughts
oops
on the javafx part this is a this is the
definition of the wine we just used f
xml we add a bunch of stuff here you see
this this is an interesting thing the QR
code the QR code is being rendered by a
service service on the internet not it's
not being generated in Java we're just
we just used a webview that gets the
that wants an image actually not not
another webview I'm sorry an image that
once gets a remote URL from the internet
so there is this project called ZX zing
to that is elaborating Java to generate
QR codes and they have a rest not a bad
service but a URL that you can say give
some parameters like sighs and the text
and it will generate for you the QR code
so you just put like image and the URL
instead of our local image we give the
URL a remote image so it loads from
there of course because we have to be
connected to the internet anyway and
this disservice very very useful service
and fast very fast yeah not not so yeah
good just because I I thought now it's
because of the EMS I'm not gonna replace
that right now but yeah you can just
type the URL and it renders the image as
you're seeing here okay so about a
Twitter let's just take a quick look at
a Twitter code the Twitter route code we
got we were we changed a little bit the
code for for java one and open road is a
little bit different from you guys saw
an in the slideshow we used a few
lambdas and streams API but this is the
so we got a Twitter stream and we
process it to eat when it gets based on
on on
hash tags etc and we got for example hey
I'm gonna does it has all the required
hashtags and we're gonna do a stream of
that you're going to filter with the
required hashtags in the configuration
we're going to collect it we're going to
check the size so it becomes true or
false and we do the same thing with
dimensions so if we just Jesus I small
we had to do this is it a retweet
because Twitter was streaming retweets
as well so you were getting a bunch of
tweets we didn't want and if they were
processing it all together so we did we
also added this check here does it
contains a tweak the ticket then we see
at the end of the string yes and then
inside the header okay tweet the screen
name in the text so we can have a kind
of log later but basically now comes the
code that you use song later in this
light okay so we SAT through and we we
make camel take a no call the beertender
URL and then I finish homework here by
generating a new random ticket it was
like just a few lines of code and
processing twitter with the logics that
I I need or a want from my my project so
this is this is the javafx application
it shows a Y connects to Twitter and and
gives tickets now Marco will show you a
little bit of other stuff
ping face please well i'm going to show
you the tough way no sorry they're not
very easy way to do it I used to
approach the first one was the spaghetti
and very short way to do it a fast way
using the Java River Java but I used a
product colored Oracle oep for embedded
devices here in France this it's sub
product call at OAPs Orab embedded
processing is a complex process of a
event a project that you can use to
control an event in real time for
embedded products so it comes with this
interface that you can connect recall
adapters like temperature adapter or
Twitter adapter and this adapters are
connecting using for example a java java
code so we can create your class rear
listen to the cloud or we were well i'm
getting some properties here and these
guys he is runs and keep running and a
capturing the information of the java
code rate there are road and east
component to a call channel so it came
to catch information and send a process
or essentially the process what's the
processor it's like an SQL code so you
can write like this
from the channel select from all the
informations from the channel right now
where the status is one or four so it's
like a workflow that I can control the
process the process using SQL basic
language it's called c ql okay this is
not the easier easy way to do it but we
are talking here of a beer example what
is this product you can run it and your
real product for in the field you're
talking about companies that has a
thousand sensors running per second so
this guy here or equipment processing
has this capacity to read a thousand of
sensors and using this language and its
component in filter and send the results
to another channel for example and okay
it's a to hear it's a channel for
approval operably Twitter and even
approved I want to know if this guy can
drink so I have another processor here
that I can make a query and compared
using for example two different
processor or a cache element that I can
get all this the last all the two-year
did guys that the authors of to use I
can can get is this store in the cache
and compare all data in this cash to the
new to it and is this guy already drink
it in the last five minutes for example
okay Linda said in this case
of the beer but you can have well this
sensor doesn't has pumped for my
requests anymore and it's it five
minutes are five minutes that I didn't
achieve answers from the sensor so i can
send it to another processor for example
here drink approve it but i can send to
another channel and this channel process
another thing that is send a message to
the studio administrator or send or open
another sensor or send a email or SMS or
just eterno not a CAG but they're known
an alarm or something okay for the beer
example it's very hard and very
difficult to do because the oap runs in
strain is inside that the raspberry pi
with 512 megabyte megabytes of harm
certainly a little bit heavy and a TD
let's it takes a little time to get up
let four minutes yet the idea here is
just give you an example of how to use
event processing concepts and
technologies to do more smaller
processing like you know you don't want
to it would be nice to just use an event
processing framework or in technology
and do that hey is this guy did these
guys drank five beers in the last hour
if yes then we're going to avoid them so
don't keep drinking getting drunk and
messing up but even this case is very
hard to do it because this is not the
the use of Jews they use for this you
need to use this guy to runs a thousand
one hundred thousand message per second
oh the any any of its processing with
caching shouldn't be running on the
embedded device it should be running on
somewhere else connected to it and just
giving the flags okay stop this guy or
do this or do that instead of running
actually at the the valley device that's
why we recommend for that using more
powerful gateways to have that kind of
complexity processing the data outside
of the devices and they don't have
better control and email yeah well this
is average was just to show you that
this product is X we tested with this
the CAG runs okay but for this example
was not yeah the best way to do the
question yes we are open to questions if
you want yes
delicious
hopefully I'm sorry the question is
about the gpio a few yeah I / j actually
yeah we use a pie for J the open source
project that were made to connect with
the chief GPI use of the Raspberry Pi
it's a very simple project very nice
work very well works very well very well
and its really really download the code
the the jar file pulling our project use
the tutorial of the site and make it
works yep i first see the project by far
Jacob see the native libraries already
so it integrates everything Vijay and I
for you you don't have to call that port
so you just really use the Java code and
this is the fact i thought it was it
real easy so I 4G these are the project
by for today yeah it has a lot of useful
tutorials and codes they moves examples
diagrams but the bad thing it's just for
raspberry PI's before if we have another
device you have to use to for example RX
at TX it's another library for connect
to the GPIO of the device okay more
precious time to another one yeah I
don't think we have more time now thank
you very much thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
