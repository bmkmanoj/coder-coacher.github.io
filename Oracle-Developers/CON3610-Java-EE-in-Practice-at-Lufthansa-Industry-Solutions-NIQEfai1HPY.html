Burns and large and I are going to be
talking about Java in Java EE and
practice at lufthansa industry solutions
I mean just make sure I can see the
notes here yes so we are using the
twitter hashtag LH ind java ee and we're
also using the crowd mics application so
you can use that or if you have
questions you can raise your hand we
will have some time at the end for
questions so if you'd like to do it that
way you could do that this is the oracle
safe harbor statement and we're very
well cover here because everything we're
talking about but for the most part
actually is stuff that's already
happened we do have some stuff about jsf
2.3 and java ee 8 in here as well so
that's the safe harbor so the funny
background to the presentation here that
brought large knife to the stage
together today and at javaone last year
I was at the zero turn around party
anyone go to that last night a tradition
bar burger party and I met up with some
friends there and you know I heard a guy
was saying oh well we can't use Jay
rebel because it's not in the big book
of standards I heard that I'm like well
it's jsf in the big book of standards at
lufthansa and they said well yes it is
and it turns out that guy was evo he's
probably watching on the stream i hope
he couldn't be with us today because he
had some pressing business concerns but
he helped to produce the presentation as
well so that meeting at javaone brought
me to frankfurt eventually i was on my
way to dev ox and stop through and met
with the guys there and that we started
preparing this talk so my point in
sharing that with you is don't feel like
you can't get yourself up on stage for
java one next year the call for papers
is a going to be opening at some point
please do submit they also have the nice
ignite tracks as well that are a great
way to get started if you're new to
being a speaker you want to say anything
else about yourself and arrival um no I
thing just has everything okay
okay so we're going to be flying at two
different flight levels during this
presentation flight level 350 is the
high level or we're talking about
architecture and more abstract concerns
and then flight level 25 is where we'll
be going right down and dirty into the
code and this is the junkers ju 52 very
famous old the Lufthansa plane and so
when you see this altimeter here Howard
Messer then you know that we're going to
be flying low at flight level 25 okay so
before we start I would like to give a
small overview of who we actually are
because well probably everybody knows
Lufthansa but there's in the Lufthansa
group there's mayor more than just the
airline and so we are Lufthansa industry
solutions and I would just like to go
through all of the segments that are in
the Lufthansa group so on the left you
see the air line segment that's 41 the
Lufthansa airline but we also have other
airlines in the group like Swiss
Austrian Germanwings then the second
segment that's aviation industry in
there is the Lufthansa Technik that's
the company you actually saw the video
off in the beginning so they are doing
the maintenance repair and overhaul of
all the aircraft and all the components
in the aircraft and they don't only do
that for Lufthansa but also for other
airlines on the external market also in
these segments aviation industry is the
ls GE it's the sky chefs that's
the company really does the catering for
all the flights all the food and all the
pillows and cutlery and the blankets and
everything you have on the flight that's
that comes from LSG the third segment is
the finance and service part in there we
have for example air plus there are
business travel management and the LG BS
that's left on the global business
services they do like financial
procurement stuff and for the other
companies within the left on the group
then the fourth segment that's logistics
Lufthansa Cargo so that's also airline
but not passengers but cargo and the
first one this is where you find us
that's left on the system's and left on
the industry solutions actually by April
this year we were one company or cord
Lufthansa systems but in April we split
up and the name looked on the system's
was kept by the guys who do the
applications that are very close to
airlines and the Lufthansa industry
solutions is the part that does all you
know also for our four airlines but also
in other industries like yeah the
maintenance repair overhaul industry we
are in the health care industry and
several others our customers are about
fifty percent or fifty percent of the
the revenue is done in within the
left-hander group and the other fifty
percent is done outside the group with
external customers
Thanks so as I already said we do have a
lot of customers within the group and
also outside the group and we create
lots of different applications for them
and we not only create we also operate
and maintain those applications for them
and to be able to do this at a
reasonable cost we need to have some
kind of uniformity in the applications
that we create and that's the reason why
we set standards for ourselves for one
thing and in projects standards help us
to to avoid reinventing the wheel we
don't need to do everything again and
again and we get better quality from
that and also we it makes it easier for
people within our company to switch
between projects because the skills that
you need is similar and also in
operations and maintenance we get a
better chance to automate things and
also of course a skill set that is
required is not not as much
but the thing is we don't have only one
kind of application that we create so
the requirements vary quite strongly we
have like applications that are internal
for internal use within the customer
organization we have applications that
are business to customer we have
applications that are business to
business we have applications that have
10 users or others with 10,000 users we
have applications that are business
critical or others that are nice to have
we have fed client applications and we
have browser based applications we have
mobile or desktop applications so it's
really quite a quite a big variety of
applications we have so we can't just
have one standard that tries to cover
all of that and we also need some
flexibility in the standards because
there are sometimes the customer just
has their own standard technology stack
and they say we want to use this and of
course we don't say no we don't use this
we let me use the customers technology
stack so isn't that also the case that
the customers technology stack includes
runtime environments they have the
choices they want websphere jboss or
whatever they have yeah of course you
sometimes you have that so yeah some
have a contract or just have bought some
application servers and then you have to
use them
but the kind of application that i want
to talk about today is really one that
we do a lot that's business-critical
desktop web applications so we're not
talking about mobile here we're not
talking about head client here but yeah
that's the thing we really do a lot and
we really have customers who have like a
hundred or several hundred applications
of that kind within one company and that
we maintain for them
Oh
so
one characteristic of those applications
is that they often live for a very long
time and they are often used for a long
time without any changes so we like we
did it develop them and then they are
used for five years and there's no
change to them and then after five years
there's maybe some some change needs to
be done and then we need to find people
who can actually work on that
application so it's kind of like a
aircraft maintenance analogy when you
have a business that's built on
maintaining airplanes you have lots of
different kinds of tools and those tools
need to last for a very long time and
sometimes you don't have to use them for
a while and then the need arises and you
have to be able to know that when you
take them off the shelf you're able to
do everything you need to do with them
so it's not like a sometimes with
software it's kind of like a tool that
just expires and collapses and
evaporates into dust and ashes and you
know software and standards kind of
fight against that by allowing it to be
maintained and you know that when you
take it back off the shelf you're able
to use it because it's based on
standards
exactly
so this is a selection of the
technologies we define for the for the
technology standard stack for the kind
of application I mentioned and as you
can see it's actually pretty close to
standard java ee its most of them are
java ee technologies they are just some
of them that we added because we find
them useful like we added primefaces on
top of jsf as a component library and we
added for example hibernate search as an
extension to jpa when we want to do
full-text searches there are of course
also other technologies that are less
formally specified whether that are
still useful to us so while i mentioned
that standards were very important and
you have to be in the big book of
standards the big book of standards has
things that are else not just JCP
standards there's other things that any
kind of technology that is less than
approved for use kind of show up there
so what we another factor that we need
to deal with with these long-lived
applications and particularly in a long
live business we in the technology
industry like to look at the fact that
you know Oracle has been
the mid 80s and think that's forever ago
but Lufthansa has been around much much
less longer than that and they have had
to do and evolve their business
practices as the business matures and of
course that means technology changes as
you go along so you have at any point in
time a mix old and new technologies
being used and also a mix of old and new
skills that need to be inside the
organization is to deploy those
technologies so I think there's a bit of
a point of comparison here between
static languages zactly type languages
and relational database management
systems versus the newer crop of
standards that are based on dynamic
languages and no SQL no sequel but
unfortunately the complexity has to live
somewhere and some of the benefits that
you get with the traditional Java EE and
stack the type systems are very
appealing to the enterprise customers
like Lufthansa and you know I'm not
going to read through the slide you can
check it out later when you look at the
presentation or get the slides from the
website but it's basically a matter of
flexibility and maintainability there's
sometimes attention between achieving
those two goals and while the dynamic
languages make it very easy to make
changes and prototype things they're
much harder to understand once you put
it on the shelf and come back to it
later because the concept of schemas are
not as formally present
the concept of a compiler that enforces
type correctness and all of that kind of
stuff is not as present with these newer
frameworks so it remains to be seen if
these very very dynamic technologies
will find a place in industry that has
the requirements that Laura says just
mentioned
okay now we would like to show you some
examples we brought some example
projects that we just did in the past
it's actually to project and the first
one is called c-note that's a bit funny
because when we chose that name we
didn't actually know that it has a
meaning in the American language so yeah
it's really just just the name is we we
chose it doesn't have to do anything
with a hundred-dollar bill see note is a
project we did for the Lufthansa Technik
and more specifically for the product
division components that the the guys
who do maintenance of all the parts that
you can remove from the aircraft and
then do maintenance or repair them in a
shop and then you put them there back in
there into the aircraft and the scene
old application is a process based
application used by the customer service
to control their processes and it gives
them like central task this whether you
see tasks that they have to perform and
then they can work on that they get a
guidance through the process and it also
has an archive view where they can
search like when the customer calls they
can search for a good given that
reference number and look at what
happened there well the interesting
thing about see note is that we had to
do interfaces to more than 10 external
systems that for wanting trigger
processes in C note and that all they
are also used to retrieve information so
when you go through the project you see
information from external systems
we also had to integrate Outlook Web
Apps as an email composer and email
viewer because we didn't want to write
our own email composers we did interface
to Outlook Web Apps and when somebody
wants to create an email it just window
opens with Outlook Web Apps and the
rules that define if if the task really
has to be processed by a human and also
what yeah what kind of group does the
task is assigned to are very volatile
and pretty complex and that's why we
implemented them using jboss rules and
some excel decision tables that can be
quickly deployed to the production
environment the technology stack we used
here is java ee 6 with java 7 java SE 7
on the jboss EAP 6 application server we
use the calendar business process engine
and for the front and we use icefaces
because that project was started before
we define the prime faces standard that
we mentioned earlier as I said we use
jboss jewels for the rule engine and we
use hibernate search for the archive
search function i mentioned
so let's have a look at the architecture
so I called it an orchestra of years and
Wars because we have the central
business process engine that
orchestrates all the other separate
deployables that we have so we have
roses war for each business process that
we create that contains the process
definition and VPN bpmn to it also
contains classes require to execute the
processes and the UI for for the users
and also web services that can be used
to call them from outside and to start
the processes then we have service es
for the external systems so the wars
communicate with the external systems
through those external system services
we have the central task manager war
that only talks to the business process
engine so the task manager doesn't have
to know what kinds of processes we have
deployed and we can always just deploy a
new process and the tasks one that pro
said the process will be immediately
visible in the task manager without any
updates and yeah then on the right we
have the V archive and the thing is that
this kind of gives us a
some of the advantages of a micro
service architecture because we can just
keep showing you ways we can remove
processes we can replace the process or
updated without touching any of the
other stuff okay so the architecture
that Lars has talked about here takes
advantage of a lot of the standard
features right but one of the things
that you need to do with standards is
sometimes they're not enough sometimes
you have to customize sometimes you have
to get in there and make some tweaks and
figure out a way to square the circle
sometimes yeah is this is where the the
ivory tower means the dirty gritty
Street and with Java EE and with JSF we
have plenty of extension points for you
to do that and we finally descend down
into flight level 25 here we're going to
talk about one such example of that
because bars mentioned they were using
Java EE 6 on top of java SE 7 so they
had CDI in the mix but they wanted to
take advantage of a better integration
with the JSF view system that it was
provided in java ee 7 conceptually was
called the cbi basic view scope and what
they did was find a way to take that
concept and make it work for them in
their application
exactly so we were kind of stacked with
java ee 6 because the customer uses
jboss EAP and they well jboss EAP 7 is
not yet out so we can only use six now
and to create that view scope we just
yeah we just implemented the abuse go up
on our on our own and yeah brought some
code to show how we did this so the
first thing is we just create a scope
annotation that's just an annotation
that itself is annotated with the normal
scope annotation and in this case is it
is passivating because of you a scope
and the end is saved in the session the
HTTP session so it does have to be
passivating then you create a context
implementation I cut that out here but
that's where really all the stuff
happens but actually we could copy most
of this from from other implementations
because there are implementations of
this around for example in java ee 7 but
also in i think delta spike has it and
we copied it from cm3 because at that
time delta spike was in a zero point
something version and we didn't want to
use it in production so when you
implement the context then you really
just only have to
create an CDI extension which is pretty
easy you just implement the the exchange
extension interface observe some events
and at the context and you just don't
you need to think of putting that in the
meter and services facilities so to
register this extension and when you've
done that you can just use it like any
other CDI scope
okay so the next example I brought is a
thing we problem we often have is long
running reports so when we create
business critical application they are
usually deployed on two servers and we
have a load balancer before them and the
load balancer distributes the load
between the two survivors but also does
a failover and so it carries one server
and if it doesn't get a response within
I don't know one minute or 10 seconds or
five seconds or whatever it will head
over to the other server normally that's
no problem but if you have a
long-running report where that maybe
runs for a minute then you want to do
you don't want to have the load balancer
failing over all the time so what you
need to do is you can either increase
the timeout but we don't want to do that
because that would affect all the other
pages so the solution we decided on was
to do it in an asynchronous way so we
create the reporter synchronously and
then the UI polls for completion we
could also have used the push feature
myspaces also have has a push feature so
we wouldn't have had to call but yeah we
decided that polling is ok pretty ok
actually and yeah we didn't want to add
the complexity of ice push just to avoid
polling in this one situation so the way
we did this
yeah that's the report service that's
the stateless ejd annotated with the
synchronous annotation so instead of
just repair returning the report result
it returns the future and then the the
managed bean that calls the service just
stores that future and so the run report
method that's like the method called
from from the UI and then the report is
called and in the service the future is
stored and then it starts calling for
completion and yeah the polling part is
yeah just check is the report done yet
if it is done check if there were any
exceptions in the in the computation and
if there weren't any exceptions just
display the report result however you do
that may be populated list and then
display it in a data table or whatever
and if the report is not done yet you
just send some JavaScript to the client
to you know ask again in two seconds so
there's a
an appoint I'd like to bring out here
large just mentioned some javascript is
sent to the client another one of the
differences between your style of apps
and traditional Java EE stylist there's
a much greater emphasis placed on
JavaScript these days however that's not
to say that you can't use JavaScript
judiciously and effectively with the
traditional Java approach that we have
here jsf 20 we added support for Ajax
and you could leverage that and it works
very well my point in sharing this here
is that it's appealing for them to be
able to use just the right amount of
JavaScript without having to run into
any of the cross browser platform issues
any of the more difficult to maintain
aspects of it so here in this case it's
a very simple but effective and
necessary use of JavaScript Christian
question was why is the controller
serializable yeah that's because it's in
the view scope and if you put anything
in the view scope or and you see a
passivating scope you need to make it
serializable okay did you have a second
question
the second question was instead of using
javascript why didn't you send an email
notification yeah okay actually we have
some projects where we do that where the
customer just kicks on creating me a
report and then the report is emailed to
the user but in this use case the
requirement the customers requirement
was different so they just wanted to
wait until reproduced is played in the
UI
okay so third example one recurring
thing we have is that the customer wants
to have changes and the database tables
trackable and with that I don't mean a
complete complete versioning of the data
like this hibernate envers but I mean
they want to have fields like insert
user last update user insert I'm last
update time in all of the database
tables and so we need to put these in
our jpa entities but we don't want to
fill them manually every time we update
or or in the create an entity so jpa
gives us entity listeners to to do this
so jpa will call us every time an entity
is updated or inserted and then we can
populate some fields but again we have
the problem that we are in java ee 6 and
in Java EE 6 I think it's in java ee 7
you can do it but in Java EE 6 and
entity listeners not a CDI bean so you
can just inject things into the entity
listener so what we did is we created
the entity listener just as a sin rapper
that calls the bean manager and we hire
an event on the beam manager and then
CDI bean can observe that event and
there we can have all the injection
stuff so for that the first thing we
need is a way to get at the bean manager
so we created a small class called bean
manager look up the thing I put on the
slide here is actually a little bit
short and because
if you do it this way it's really hard
to do a unit test so for the original
version we have a singleton pattern and
you can just put another instant
instance of beam manager look up into
there so you can mock it and yeah then
what it does is basically getting the
beam manager from jndi then the entity
lizna itself really only has two methods
and each has one line that's getting the
beam manager from the look up and firing
an event on that and the next is our
base entity that's the base class that
all the entities inherit from this one
has the entity listeners defined or the
one entity listener and it also has the
fields like created created user and so
on so yeah every entity that inherits
from that gets the fields and also gets
the behavior of automatically filling
the fields
it's the rest of the fields okay and
then we have the CDI Observer that
observes these events and as you can see
we can use injections there we inject
the principle that we get the username
from and we also inject the date
supplier that's our way of mocking the
date or making it possible to set a
specific date in unit tests and then it
just absorbs these events and sets the
created and so on fields
okay the second project that I would
like to do to show you is called ham
sweet it has nothing to do with hand
because ham is the latter code of
Hamburg Airport and that's actually the
customer that we did this project for a
ham sweet is reimplement ation of some
of the central systems of the Hamburg
Airport so it contains features like
flight plan editing like flight database
and also management of the airport's
resources like the fingers that the
airplanes doc add and the buses that
bring people from the from the planes to
the two terminals and everything yeah in
this project we had to integrate about
50 subsystems existing subsystems that
send data to our system or receive it we
had the customer required that some of
the changes that are done either in the
application itself or in one of the
external subsystems need to be visible
immediately in the browser and there are
also some very sophisticated datetime
calculations including time zones and
everything so the project is now on java
SE 8 but in the beginning it was java SE
7 and even then they use the back part
of the new daytime api because these
things become so much easier with a new
daytime api the apart from that the
technology stack is jolly 7 now it's
java SE 8 they run on the wirefly
application server but they plan to go
on
EAP 7 as soon as sets out then there's a
mule enterprise service bus that does
all the communication between subsystems
and also some internal communication we
use primefaces for the front end and
also the prime phases push feature for
those immediate updates in the browser
date I maybe I already told that they
use hibernate and verse in a pretty
interesting way because they don't only
do the versioning but they also use
events from envers to trigger updates to
the to the mule and then back to the
application server and to the browser
and there's one part that is planned to
be implemented in xjs so you can even
integrate JSF and do some parts in a
JavaScript paid based framework and as
they decided to use xjs because they
needed a gun scheduler and there's an
existing component they can use that's
based on xjs
so the previous example when we get down
to flight level 25 talked about the use
of the CBI of you scoped another feature
that's being shown here it will be the
use of expression language integration
now expression language I like to think
of it as the Swiss Army knife of Java EE
type stuff you can get so much done with
L because II L is present in all of the
different layers it's really the glue
that holds lots of the different layers
together and jsf has a thing called the
e l resolver chain which is a chain of
responsibility pattern when any piece of
e l is resolved this PL resolver chain
is traversed and each instance of the
eggs link in the chain is ask the
question hey can you resolve this
expression and it says yes or no and it
says no a good on to the next one the e
l lets you link up your model objects
with your new pages but there are
certain times when you need to have
access to that from the java side as
well and large they're going to explain
that how they got around that problem
hmm exactly so the problem we had here
was that the customer wants highly
configurable database data table columns
so they want to have like the labels and
some help overlays that you get when you
move the mouse over the title they want
them to come from the database so they
can configure all the text and they also
want some kinds of data formatted in a
special way so numbers always to the
right and text always to the left and
some kinds of data always in the middle
and then some data is initially sorted
ascending and other data is initially
sorted descending and
yeah actually pretty complicated and to
do that consistently we wanted to create
facelet template for the column and we
couldn't use a composite component
because when you have a data table you
can just put a column in the composite
component because the data table expects
the columns to be of type you I column
and a composite component is not so we
use the facelet template the old way but
still you get one problem if you do that
because when you do sorting in
primefaces you put a sort by expression
in the in the table yeah and the table
that's like the initial sorting and you
put sort by expressions into the columns
that determine what if you click on the
column what should I sort by and the
thing is that primefaces compares these
expressions literally so it just looks
do you have the same value expression in
both of the of the parts and if they are
the same value expression the column is
displayed as sorted but when you do this
in a template the value expression you
use of for the column is always the same
because it's always liked the name of
the parameter you passed in from outside
so the sorting still works as long as
you don't specify an initial sorting or
do an ajax update of the table but when
you do that it all gets broken and the
way we solve this is that we created our
own tag and check Handler and the tag
would make the copy the value expression
from outside the template to the
component inside the template without
just having a different value expression
that references the outside expression
but it's really that expression so the
code for this is yeah I emitted the tech
library xml code you have to write some
a little bit of xml code but yeah the
main thing is the tag handler and this
tack handler yeah it's actually quite
simple because it just needs to
implement the apply method and then it
gets the attributes of the tag so yeah
that's it's a bit confusing because it's
all named attribute here but so there's
an attribute of the tag that is called
attribute and it gets that and then with
that name it asks the facelet context
its variable Napa to give me the value
expression that is known under that name
that I printed it put into the attribute
attribute
and then so now I have the the value
expression and I had to add some code to
avoid copying the the expression more
than once because if I changed it then I
I can copy it again so or I would
override it this would actually look a
lot better in Java 8 because we could
use the what's called computer absent
method for this yeah but in the end we
just set the value expression to the
parent component of the tech you're
currently handling
yeah that's how we use it assuming the
Tecla clip was called might a clip then
I just I have the composition and in
that I have the column tag and then I
say copy the value of the value
expression behind the value attribute
into the salt by attribute of the kalam
tech or component baby another Delta
between the current trend towards more
and more action happening and the client
in the browser and the browser acting as
the thing that pulls all the resources
together in many aggregation happens in
the browser in this Java EE world it
makes a lot more sense for this kind of
customer to have the server act as a
content aggregator pull the resources
together from lots of different places
perhaps going out to the cloud to get
other service data but assembling
everything into one simple package that
maintains the viewstate there on the one
server the talks to the browser for
example and with this approach you can
have a simple amount of HTML that's not
so
subset susceptible to cross browser
problems and that's one of the hallmarks
of being able to develop the
applications in this way
okay now looking to the future you know
we're moving forward with java ee 8 and
we have some new features there and we
also add some new features in java ee 7
that they haven't been able to take
advantage of yet thank so one of them
that was interesting was the faces flows
feature faces flows to the feature we
added a JSF 2.2 maybe and it lets you
have a view state that is shared among
multiple views so you can think of it as
smaller than a session but larger than a
request and larger than of you if you
have a collection of pages that are all
related in some way like a booking flow
or a checkout flow they it's very well
integrated with CDI you can have the
beans declared to be in flow scope and
they will automatically be made
available for garbage collection when
you leave that flow scope another
feature that we are added in SF 2.3 is
multi component validation this is the
oldest feature in the JSF spec issue
tracker and it uses the standard bean
validation and bars already mentioned a
couple times the need for website
integration
we now have web socket in java ee 7 it
was introduced them and were able to
make use of it in the java ee eight
specification
so we gave you a view of what it's like
to have IT consulting in the aviation
industry we compare Java EE with some
other current alternatives both of which
are in use in some capacity and discuss
some real world examples and some very
low-level details and showed some of the
many problems that are best solved in
Java EE so thank you for your time and
if you have any questions we have about
10 minutes left so yes
dear
Jesus have to
right so the question was you're on ee 6
je bosse a p6 but there was a jsf 2.2
feature that you basically back part is
i'm repeating the question for the value
of the recording
is there anything GSM two points
back forward
smc are very
let me restate the question and
embellish it also the question was is
there anything that you've seen any e7
or no I'm sorry eight or e that yeah and
in da that's coming up that you'd like
to backport so one of the features that
we've added is the inject ability of
lots of different jsf artifacts so
you're making good use of CDI but now in
jsf 2.3 all of the jsf artifacts such as
the faces context and the flow scope and
all those other kinds of things can be
injectable into CDI beans so it's a
similar it would be a similar kind of
approach to what you did already exactly
also yeah it would be nice to back for
the push so ever push feature but it's
probably going to be a bit more
complicated than the thing we did with a
new scope so we will have to look into
that but yeah maybe if it's available as
some kind of library we would probably
use it any other questions
yep
it's like a question the question was
were there any performance or stability
issues in the usage of Davos rules
actually yes we we did have quite a lot
of problems with that I think the thing
is that jboss drools doesn't really
integrate very well with Java EE so yeah
but in the end what we did was we set up
two separate application servers just
for the application or just for the one
deployable that contains the rules and
called that using a web service so
because we had problems with current gen
space and performance not so much but
yeah mainly permgen space because there
was some kind of memory leak I don't
know if he introduced it ourselves or if
it was in the in the jewels
implementation but yeah we solved it by
putting it in separate servers that we
could restart anytime we need to
okay the question was why did you did
you look at spring and if you did why
did you choose me over that or a longer
answer well actually they we do have
some applications that use a spring
framework but yeah for these
applications we just wanted to stick to
our standard and that standard is Java
EE probably you can do most of the same
things with with spring as well but you
just have to stick with something you
define as long as it works for you any
other questions
okay well thank you for your attention
and have a great rest of your conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
