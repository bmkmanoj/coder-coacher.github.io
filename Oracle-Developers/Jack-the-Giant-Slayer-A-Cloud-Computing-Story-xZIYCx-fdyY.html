we have this this little friend here I
don't know I'm not little I I'm tall no
you're just sitting doing this this high
thing here so we're gonna tell a story
of Jack right jack adams is near here I
know java developer on a corporate
developer yeah so Jack what kind of
things you you you liked you'd like to
work on oh I know java ee guy oh you are
java ee guys I think you're supposed to
be this talk isn't about small devices
no no it's not devices here what's those
things I don't know okay so yeah so this
is this talking here is going to mix a
little bit of things here and we're
going to talk about cloud computing jack
hey on adding the clouds you want to be
in the cloud so Jack if you want to be
in the clouds and you want to be out
let's do like this I'll put you down
there and you're going to learn how to
go to the cloud okay yes that's fine ok
so I'll put him right here and and then
he can go see the cloud ok Jack stay
right there hey can you give me a nice
on top your watch my phone top you mean
your laptop no nice on top oh can you
give you the phone top oh that's your
phone top what's the advantage of the
phone top it's very light okay good
alright so keep your phone top there and
you'll learn how to do things alright
guys so thanks very much for coming um
my name is Bruno salsa and here's my
email my Twitter if anyone once you get
in contact later and my friend here it's
ads menahga say hello hello guys I
matsunaga I'm also as brunel i'm from
brazil and we're going to have a little
talk about cloud computing deployment
strategies we've java technology yes so
the idea the idea here is that we're
going to talk a little bit about you
know what what what kind of things you
need to do or you know how do you get
learn more into the cloud and we're
going to talk about lots of different
technologies hear from you know from
continuous integration all the way to
deployment pipeline you're going to talk
about infrastructure we're going to talk
about lots of different things of course
I'll related to Java okay so no didn't
work yes okay now it worked so you know
so Jack of course we all know the jack
and the beanstalk story so this talk was
supposed to call the jack and the
beanstalk but Beanstalk is a product
right it's a cloud product so it would
confuse everyone and so now we're not
going to talk about being stalk the
product we're going to talk about you
know being stalked this story all right
y'all know Jackson beings in the
Beanstalk story and you know jack needs
to in this the reason why we chose that
story is because everyone wants to go
deep in the cloud right but you can't go
deep in the cloud you have to go up
right so we're going to try to go up the
Beanstalk to see how far we can get in
the cloud so so the first thing that we
see is that there are some things that
every java developer kind of already
have in there you know in their
knowledge and those are the basic things
are we going to use to start to start
going up the cloud right so let's talk a
little bit about those three things so
the first the thing is the basic notion
of cloud computing all right we're not
going to talk about the basic notion of
called computing the one thing that's in
terms of developers you know all those
discussion of cloud you know
infrastructure service platform as a
service or things like you know oh it's
I'm going to run a private cloud or
public cloud or hibbett cloud in terms
of a developer those is more like
taxable kind of things right it doesn't
change that much you know the whole in
fact the whole idea of cloud computing
is visualization and we all know about
virtualization right we all we have all
been running virtual machines for a long
time not java based on machines right
have built on machines
with with different os's we have been
doing tests on Vito machines for a long
time the main difference here is that
now we again all those with no machines
putting server somewhere and making this
whole thing work in a different way so
of course yes I understand in terms of
seasoning and making this whole thing
work and and you know if you work for
Amazon or for Google or for Microsoft
you have you know there's a lot of back
stuff that needs to be done but in terms
of us developers that we want to write
write our application we're going to put
the application up you know those things
are not so fundamental that's not the
big discussion that we have to have but
yeah I think we all know we all
understand that cloud you know the one
of the biggest adventure of clouds is
elasticity you can you can you can
request new resources and go up and down
with your resource that's fine you know
it's all of this make sure your whole
whole infrastructure much more agile you
can optimize things that's fine so the
other thing that we I think we all
pretty much comfortable with is the
whole discussion about open source right
so open source you know Java the OpenJDK
has been open source for several years
now every you know a lot everyone knows
about it clip snap beans are the main
application servers have you know either
open source or have open source versions
I mean we are we are understanding
portion of open source it allows us some
of a lot of freedom the interesting
thing on the cloud is that once you have
uh you know you want you want your
infrastructure to scale up and scale
down your honor to work with you know
this with this very cool infrastructure
and if everything you want to do you
need to you know buy a new license or
you know you need to to get a different
version of the software to run on that
particular infrastructure because you
can't recompile things you know you
that's that hinders you on how you're
going to do those things right you know
the past things that you had on a vendor
that would you give you
like a piece of software components that
you know that you can't you know you
have to pay by the server or this kind
of thing of course that's not going to
work here right so and if you go a
little bit deeper and infrastructure
side you know and you want to run your
OS and and take benefit of these right
you're going to see that of course a lot
of times you're going to need more
control on on what you can do with with
that so open source will allow you to do
that will give you the source code that
you need to actually benefit all of
these another important thing is the
community right you if if you're going
to go into those areas by yourself
that's a big problem it's hard right so
if you're going with a lot of other
developers from other companies from
other areas that they're always out also
having the same problem there's a lot of
people working on the same frame of the
same tools so you can benefit from all
of that so open source is your friend
right it's boarding your friend so one
more you know I didn't find any image 26
statistic about cloud deployments right
but you know if you take a look at the
top 500 supercomputers in the world
you're going to see that almost one
hundred percent of them runs linux why
is that because you know you know if you
if you're going to run on those big big
big gigantic infrastructure's you have
to be able to control what you're going
to do so that's why amazon runs only
enough that's why google runs on linux
so if you're good if we're going to
deploy even on windows server on the
clouds it's probably maybe not on
microsoft azure but how the other clouds
it probably has a linux behind there
somewhere being the cloud infrastructure
so open source is your friends right and
and i think that you can use and you can
benefit from this in everything you're
going to you're going to do so we're
going to talk about a lot of difference
open source tools that we that we want
to stay here and so in the last thing
they were going to talk about that we
all are used to is automation right
developers out
everything it's it's a you know do we
have that basically rule that if you're
going to do something one time just do
by hand if you're going to do twice
ultimate because you're certainly going
to do a third time right so I know we
are not always do that right you know
sometimes after a whole year of doing
things by hand you're like oh man if I
had automated that I would have saved
hours of my ear s but that's fine we all
know there's a lot of automation tools
that we can use it's it's a big time
saving it's prevent errors it makes
things a much more streamlined and the
cool thing is when you talk about cloud
computing automation gets a new level
right because now you can automate
anything you want right you can automate
your network you can automate your your
infrastructure you can create and
destroy machines you can you know you
take your your possibilities of
automation to to a branch on to another
level right so I think that with that in
mind we can we can think about you know
growing from that so we've with those
beans right oh just one back just back
one so one interesting thing is that you
can see that now is story our beings are
not beings our coffee beans right
because when you thought we were talking
about Java Java is is part of the cloud
infrastructure today right you know you
have a lot of several of the of the
cloud players use Java as part of the
infrastructure a lot of the framework
that exists use Java as part of their
development but more than that every
single cloud player offers you java
right so if you want to do you know when
you're moving to the cloud one of the
big thing that that's that's the
research has shown is that everyone is
afraid of locking everyone's afraid of
you know putting everything out your
eggs in the same basket and if you're
going to do something in the cloud you
really need to be able to move your
application from one place to the next
right so you know
keep away from the vendors that try to
force you to a very strong lock in you
know all the big vendors are offering
you some form of Java development but
there's there's there's there's most of
the vendors allow you to use all of the
standard Java technology so you can
actually run stuff in the cloud out of
the cloud and and as a developer this is
very good because now you know we're not
talking about some completely new skills
that you have to have you know if you're
if being if you're a Java developer you
already have in these skills and and the
knowledge to start putting your stuff in
the cloud right and i think that's
that's that's very good for us because
really we have been developing
applications for many many years before
those cloud things start happening but
if they are ready to run in the cloud
that's good for us right so let's then
start start going up the Beanstalk right
and I think the first step that's that's
like a very basic one right but it is
our buttes you know if you want to do
something the cloud if you want to
really really use all of the benefits
all of the automation we're talking
about here and everything one thing that
maybe for a lot of us may like of course
we all knew this a long time but it's
surprising how many people is to ours to
not just you don't have a good automated
independent bude for for their
application so that's one thing we all
need to do for anything even if you're
not going to do in the cloud but from
everything from now on we are we are
assuming that that exists because this
is the base of all the automation we're
going to talk about from here so when we
also talked about buttes we're talking
about having automated unit tests
automated integration tests to increase
the confidence of your build and I
believe that the most important part of
having an automated viewed that it must
be reproducible so that we can eliminate
or at least reduce some of the
instability of the
we show some some things nets but our
main the main reason for for introducing
some talk not technologies this session
is to make and reproducible development
environment are the reducible test
environments and a reproducible deploy
on deployment environment so and of
course the big thing is here is
continuous integration right you know of
course you can extend continuous
integration to continuous deployment
continued delivery that's all that's all
these kind of things but the basic
building block is you know to have a
continuous integration environment that
allows you to continue this Butte and
continuously test your whole environment
but the cool thing about this is that
the continuous integration is your your
automation you know big step right once
you have a continuing integration
process then you know you're in
dependent you know your builds our
automated right and then you can start
to boot from there and you know the main
reason why we need to do continuous
integration is to minimize our risks to
minimize the risk of something goes
going wrong to minimize manual work you
know every time you do a manual work
that means that something they may be
forgotten at some time something made we
have this this you know everyone has a
store like this but you know you know in
a project in a very very large Bank a
few months ago you know they have this
huge migration one bank acquired another
bank they had this huge migration they
need to to you know to get everything
all the systems put together they had
all weekend to make this whole thing uh
you know stop the whole banks you make
this whole system together and
everything and they did all kinds of
tasks and runs in and all and so
everything was ready and on the day that
they're doing this something fail you
know the bank didn't come up they spin
out you know several days almost a week
with the whole Bank off and in the end
they found out that in the whole meter
of the things there
the prostate you had to do an ftp to
your machine right and someone when when
you know they did all the tests and do
the ftp but when they are doing this in
production he was he was the guy wasn't
the same machine so instead of doing on
ftp CH them to the same machine he
copied the file right when he did that
when he did the ftp he triggered some
other stuff with the pfizer just ftp
that's when he copped by hands from one
generation to another that didn't happen
and so the whole thing fell apart right
from that point on nothing else work it
and they took you know they took a long
time to actually find out have to redo
the whole thing big mass every time you
do something manual those kinds of
things start to creep in and the good
thing about 20 news integrations that if
you're doing this that means you are you
are deploying your application hundreds
of times right before he actually
getting into production so you're you're
tweaking your script until it's they're
very very well thought off they are
working very well so that's a very very
important step after us and now
emphasize again the importance you can
see it as you can see tests as a design
to for the projects but I believed for
continuous integration and later
continuous deployments the most
important part of having tests automated
tests is the confidence you have in your
deployable software that's the basic
kind of automation you can tell tom NT
automate anything that you don't trust
so that's what we have to work on yeah
especially because we know when you get
to the point where you're you're
building your holding for structured to
actually make those things happen you
want to be to trust a lot that that
those things are going to actually
happen right so and of course the tool
that is the you know the main open
source tools really open source is good
for you right so the two that's the main
open source to for doing continuous
integration is Jenkins right so so this
little guy is going to represent Jenkees
all the time here is their logo and i
think that's that's that's what we're
running here and that's all that all the
demos are going to be run from Jenkins
now once you have your continuous
integration that's you know you are even
if you're not run you can choose
integration in the cloud right but you
can if you want right but once you have
your continuous integration you are at
least above the cloud right you're a
Bureau of the the big tempest is you
know above the the big problems you're
you can you can see a blue sky right
because that's a that is usually a very
big step a lot of people don't realize
how important that step is and sometimes
some projects to actually make that
happen is a big step right but once you
do that you have your clear sight to
actually start automating and going very
very not deep but very high in your
cloud story so the next thing we're
going to talk here a little bit about is
the platform as a service we're not
going to talk specifically about any
platform as a service provider but you
can see here there's a lot of platform
providers you have heroic oh you have
open shift you know you have Amazon you
have J elastic there's so many others
don't know we there is there is this
image we sometimes I should have with
the image hmmm aside and started I did
but you know sometimes they don't
realize how many providers we have right
we are using some as examples here but
there is literally hundreds of providers
of of platform as a service what's its
Adam it's it's a cool thing the platform
as a service allow you to actually just
get your application just deploy
somewhere you don't have to worry about
anything else right you just get your
application put it up there and and the
platform will provide everything you
need so they are going to take care of
security going to take care of
scalability they're going to take care
of your application running right so we
don't have to worry too much about that
the good thing is that we you know you
have so many different platform as a
service providers that you are not lucky
to any one of them right that's a good
thing right you could you know if you
can get your job application you can
base your application standards you can
push your application to any other those
providers and you know you some of them
will allow you to just upload the war
fire for example or a job application
some other ones we will allow you to do
a git push right we get out
vidimo well we believe that platform as
a service is the first step for a Java
developer to deploy an application to
the cloud and it fits perfectly if
you're willing to accept the limitations
or the configurations that the provider
forces you to have but you need more
flexibility then you have to look at
other options right so in terms of
platform as a service just as an example
next using an example openshift is
always a complete open source platform
as a service that you can both run on a
provider the several providers providing
openshift its red hats open source
project but you know there's a several
providers provide an open open shift but
you can ask also have a platform as a
service in your own infrastructure so
you can have open shifts run internally
in your own your own environment and
have your own clouds you know in open
shift will control everything for you
although you're running your own
infrastructure so this kind of
flexibility that open source allows you
so you know you can have the same
environments that's your cloud provided
its offering you internally you can test
you can run all kinds of different other
things that you want you want to do
internally you know you can you can even
run in your laptop if you want to make
some experiments so that's that's the
kind of it's not the only one right so
I'm just some of them are just here as
examples but just just to show that you
know it is a full Java pass solution
that you can you can run yourself if you
want or you can you can pay and that's
it that's a good thing the flexibility
of you know having a provider when you
want to have a provider and if that
provided phase it fails you you can
switch another provider with the same
infrastructure or you can have your own
infrastructure because you have
different needs that's an important
flexibility that you have that you want
you have and so with with a solution
like this you know that's the very very
basic thing right you have your code on
a code repository like it for example
you have your continuous integration and
you're just gonna
upload a war file for example or just do
a git push in some of those providers
and you can just push all your
application to the provider very very
simple a lot of these you know uh all of
this provides allow you to upload a new
version and then you once the new
version is working then you you r out
the old version to the new version so
you can do like a continuous deployment
type of thing so very a very
straightforward kind of thing okay sure
we show yes go ahead so we're going to
show you just an example how how easy
this thing can be and so add some work
where are we going to you're going to
deploy this we're going to have a demo
to Heroku i think the the first thing a
Java developer tries to to deploy on a
platform as a service is a war usually
you have you already have a war on your
beauty system you deploy there there are
some providers like Heroku openshift and
cloud foundry that allows you to
directly from your source control
management software like it to make a
push to their repository so that they
can trigger Butte and boot do themselves
a war to deploy in the past so Hiroko is
one of them already created an
application and if I make a git push to
their nodes so so this why he's doing
here it's not we already have an
application or just a normal java web
application and he's just pushing to
hero kids it's a funny thing a lot of
people get confused about this but you
know isn't get my code repository so
yeah it you can have multiple
repositories and you can push your coach
different reports that's why he's doing
here he's pushing to the Heroku hippo
story and Heroku has a get hook git
commit hook so it's rick is a maven
viewed when it finishes it it takes the
war and execute an embedded songket on
their platform I believe that I'm
main disadvantage of this approach is
that you already have an automated
beauty system probably using Jenkins and
you're doing the same beauty again on
Heroku or any other platform so you
don't have the certainty that that you
have the same war use it in testing that
you're going to use in deployment you
have different Wars probably anything
can go wrong in the middle of the of
this but anyway it's a very easy
deployment strategy so you have it
running on Heroku it has just been
provided it's already working yeah as
you can see it's a very simple
application but of course you know it
provides a full job is tagged so you
know you I think I think you all are
here know what that means right so you
know you you all can get in up any war
plication any java web application
you're running and just push to her over
here question yes you're not uploading
manual for website here right you're
doing you're doing a get basically
you're doing that you're developing your
environment you know whatever your
environment and then you know you're
doing you're doing a git push you're
pushing your source code to Hiroko right
so when when when the source code gets
pushed to her local Hiroko gets your
gets your code and compile everything
builds the war and the plaza war right
so you don't even need you have that's
what he's saying is that you have your
your own beaut system locally but you
also have another beauty on heroic oh so
that may may generate some some some
problems right if there's some
difference between those boots isms that
may generate some problems right there's
a question there oh no well yes so so if
you're not using get oh so actually I
should repeat the question right so
right so so special for recording but if
you're not using gits Hiroko and several
of the other providers are using gets so
if you're not using gates you will have
to push to a git server any way to do
those guys
so you know the easiest way would be to
use get or choose a provider that allows
you to upload a war file right and and
and so we're showing here on a git push
right that's that some you know some
people sometimes get a little bit
confused because how about me is that's
my source code right yeah and you know
his question just for the recording so
his question was you know how about my
beauty I don't want to upload to a
website right and so some other
providers like you know if you go to
Amazon Amazon Beanstalk right that's
their their past platform what you do is
you actually upload the war file so yes
you can go in the web upload your Wi-Fi
so you have your beauty oakley you will
upload your war file and then amazon
will deploy or your war file but of
course you also have in decline api wet
our web service API so you can call this
in the script so the good thing about
all the cloud vendors is that all of
them are script scriptable right you
have an API usually a REST API that you
can call and to do all those things
scripted basis so you can automate all
that no you don't actually need to go to
website and commit that okay so then but
but you know that's that's all nice and
good you know past platforms that's
that's a lot of them very good ones very
reliable you know platforms all of those
cloud providers even have three tiers
for example you can run a heroic Oh
applications out paint anything right
for for as long as you want because you
know as long as your application is has
just one cpu running it hiroko doesn't
charge you anything so it's excellent
for you to play around and prototype
things and you will solve a lot of your
problems with you know scaling things
because you don't need to worry about
the platform is no need to worry about
security blah blah blah but the truth is
a lot of times you have your you have
your develop your application you have
chosen some architecture in the past you
haven't decided some specific API that
you are used
in some specific functionality that you
need and you know your tree can be it
can be really weird right you know
instead of our nice and beautiful
natural tree right you can have like
your own requirements if your
requirements that are crazy what can you
do right you're not going to run on up
because because as Adson said one of the
biggest problems with the past providers
is that you know they they provide you a
platform and you have to run under the
constraints of that platform if you're
if you're outside the constraint their
platform you have to change your source
code and if you're if so so if you can't
change that or if your architecture is
different for some reason then you can't
you can't benefit from that the other
thing is a lot of times you know the
provider requires you specific ways of
doing things and then you get lockage to
that provider so be careful of that
because you're using a technology that
allows you to a freedom of vendors and
if you lock yourself to a pass provider
you have a problem a lot of times you
may not see this problem but for example
we're from Brazil right so how many of
those past providers actually have data
centers in Brazil right and you may not
you may not think that this is a problem
until you have customers there that you
may need to provide service there and
then you find out that your past
provider doesn't provide a service there
and there's nothing you can do because
you know although your application is
Java you lock it yourself into a plasma
past platform and it doesn't run in
certain certain situations so you know
those are the kind of consideration that
you have to have and a lot of times you
may be easier for you to think you know
in ways of having the same applications
running on any have more control of the
infrastructure other consideration is
that sometimes you want a specific java
version to run your application you want
a specific a tomcat or jboss version to
run your application and the platform as
a service you usually provides you have
that version you have to stick to it yes
some of them provide some kind of
flexibility that you can kind of install
your own stuff but that's usually way
more advanced that
so then you start to control your only
friends for structure a little bit so no
so you start losing some of the of the
benefit but so what do you do if you
want open source right open sources
again against again your friend because
if you're going to run a more
sophisticated infrastructure you can
just go to an infrastructure provider
but you know if you can get some cool
open source things to help you out
that's you know some of the things we're
going to show in a minute right so
basically the whole idea of the
infrastructure as a service
infrastructure as a service you know
that you call in when a vendor provides
you an infrastructure and you go there
and install uh you know you it's
basically provides you a server where
you install the OS you installed your
security you install your application
server you install everything right this
might be similar to what you're doing
internally it's way more flexible but of
course it carries all its own kind of
problems right because now you have to
manage all of these you have triple
grade your servers you have to upgrade
our infrastructure and this may be
something that you're not really
interested in doing right but of course
it gives you more control gives you more
Portability and OpenStack for example is
one of the several open source solutions
that that will allow you to run a
infrastructure as a Service Cloud
internally right so that means you can
even have your own servers and run this
thing internally what gives you give you
gives you the this the the the warranty
that you can hire a infrastructure
service provider that runs OpenStack
knowing that if they fail you or if you
go to another country where the provider
is not there you can get another
provider with the same infrastructure
because in an open source infrastructure
or you can even do yourself if at some
point you decide to do you know what
they call hybrid clouds that you run
parts of yours infrastructure provider
parts parts of infrastructure internally
you have the same
infrastructure because you have you know
OpenStack and several other open source
solutions we allow you should do that
right and so when we get to that you
know you're going to run your own
infrastructure that's kind of scary so
so what kind of tools we can we can use
to help this out so one of the first
problem that you're going to have is you
know you need to create and configure
your development environment right I
think all of those have that kind of
problem you know you get your to a new
employee in your company in your team
and the first thing he does is that you
say well okay so here our application
runs on on I don't jboss or glassfish
you need a MySQL database or oracle
database you know you need all this this
this kind of infrastructure blah blah
and your developer spends a whole week
or a whole month right creating the
environment that he can work with right
because of course you need a development
vironment in your machine and you know
this is cumbersome it's it's it's
complicated you require a lot of
knowledge so some some companies have
like pages and pages of documentation
how you set up your your development
environments and you know and the main
problem of that is what we call the
syndrome e of the developer right is the
whole idea it works for me right you
have a bug you have a problem and you
say well in my our environment works so
now you have to figure out what is the
difference between your environments in
everyone else's environments that in
your environment works so what's library
you're using what's what a version of
MySQL you're using what's version of
glass for tomcat or whatever you're
using and then you know and to find out
why it works for you not for anyone else
right so a tool that is an open source
tool that you can use to solve those
kind of problems is vagrants so vagrants
it's it basically it's a tool to build
your development environments so you
script what you want in a development
environment you say I want develop me
environments I want a glassfish server a
you know a tom cat I want
an Apache I want my SQL I want this did
you know you script everything you want
vagrant we read that script from your
version control and build a development
in a virtual machine remember the whole
idea of the cloud is visualization so we
can use visualization on our own
computer to help us out on solving all
those problems so they're going to
rebuild your development environments
we'll build a veto machine with all of
these things installing running so every
developer has a full environment that is
as close as possible to to to the
production environment right so
basically the idea here okay so the next
thing is okay you're saying that's very
going to read a script right so what
does that mean so is my infrastructure
going to be on version control yes that
is the cool thing and that's the other
tool that we going to talk about here
because the only problem that you have
is that now if you're going to build
this infrastructure a developer you have
to automate and manage that those
configurations of those infrastructures
right so basically how do I script my
infrastructure how do i turn my
infrastructure into source code right
before before the cloudy for
visualization if you wanted to do you
know a development environment you have
to buy a server right create all the
official infrastructure there if and
then to replicate that infrastructure in
another server so it's a pain right
because now you have it to worry about
all those things once you have
visualization now you can script your
infrastructure because you can create
your infrastructure whenever you need so
the other two we're going to talk about
here is chef so Jeff is a bass player
infrastructure a source code too so you
commit your descript to build your
infrastructure to to source control and
chef will build your server based on
that configuration right so that means
you can now have the same configuration
for anything you want to run what does
that means before before we show what
that means next we're talking about chef
here but another guy that's very famous
is puppets right you know chef and
puppet on this high level of things
we're talking about here or you can talk
about both of them interchangeably
basically what I've learned from working
both is that Chef is is you you write
your code as Ruby scripts so all the
developers are very fine with defining
your infrastructure as a you know in a
dynamic language and puppets build the
infrastructure as shell scripts so see
that means they're very very fine with
puppet because you know they can make an
easy understand to see the shell script
so you know but both of them work very
well worth the same so basically what
does that mean so basically what we have
is now oops I'm sorry yeah I can go here
so basically now we have our scripts on
chef so chef defines our scripts how we
want to build our infrastructure how we
how we want our servers configured what
kind of OS I want what kind of security
I need how my firewall rules are what is
my network looks like you know chef can
configure you know Network routes and in
firewalls all of that you can figure all
these I'm chef scripts you commit those
chaps scripts your code repository get
super version whatever you want and then
vagrants we read the chaff scripts and
build your development environments out
of the same definition so every
developer now has the same definition so
if you upgrade something in
infrastructure every developer has it
has the same infrastructure so you can
run so now all your developers are
running a very very similar you know
almost identical environment taking out
a test with one question we usually have
is that does that means that might
develop don't have the control of the
tools they use no that's not true it's
just you know it's the server side of
your development environment right your
develop is still going to work on you
know NetBeans eclipse IntelliJ whatever
you want and instead of configuring all
the servers you know on their own
machine they just have a vista machine
that would do all of that in their
environment so we're going to show this
running so you're going to show the
script first yes okay yeah everything
you need to to do to prove to use
vagrants beside installing it is to have
a vagrant configuration file it's called
a vagrant file as you can see it's a
ruby script basically I'm saying I'm
going my development and bute
environment is going to be based in the
album too precise 64 that's the box
where we can download the prepared image
we're going to provide the Java may even
get a tomcat for development purpose
using Jeff solo and we're doing to tweak
some configurations here on VirtualBox
which is the chosen provider to have to
Jude gigabytes of memory so chef
sometimes can take a long time to boot
the image so I've already have a running
instance here so I've just entered into
my vagrant instance using SSH all of my
source code is already copied
automatically when i boot the vagrant
machine into this directory / vagrants
so the difference here is I can code
using my favorite ID in my host notebook
but I use the vagrant machine to to to
call maven and mizuki tribute so if I
here run an MV n clean package it's
already running inside the vagrant
machine I can deploy I can test
everything inside the vagrant machine
but since it's synchronized when I get
here to my host notebook the jar is
already here so we just provided an
script and how how the chef script looks
I have a lot of cookbooks which is the
way chefs says what you have to start
how do you have to you have to configure
your machine your server so i have a
very simple chap script just just say so
we're going to have download install
Oracle from Java from Oracle to install
Tomcat 7 maven geets I'm going to modify
the message of the day I'm going to
modify the time the count on cat
configuration and the server
configuration to for my development
environment so basically all of these is
on source control so every one of your
developers has exactly the same
environment if some kids at some point
you need to upgrade to Java 8 for
example you can just go there change
your chef's your chef script every
developer have the new environments
configure for them yeah yes our
responsibility has increased since until
now we have the only sole responsibility
for caring about the code but now that
we have infrastructure where DevOps so
we must take care also of the
infrastructure that will be using in
development also in tests and deployment
okay so let's go a little bit more
because we are let's rush to be a case
yes so okay so now base what we have now
is that now you have your get your
source code even your both your source
code in your infrastructure definition
isn't it you can use this thing to this
get this this infrastructure to define
your development environment with
vagrants and you also use the same
source code and definitions so Jenkins
can can do the continuous integration in
Butte things so Jenkins can actually use
your development environment imbued your
vagrant machine to run your tests for
example so you the same development
environment d you have is the same
environment that you run your tests on
so you know you're now improving your
automation and all of these come there's
no error missing here but all of these
Kim come from chef over there right so
now the next step is that we want to use
the same infrastructure right to do our
production right so the same
chef scripts there are committed to get
we can now use to not only do a
development environment / fragrance but
also to do our production environments
so chef we will create both you know in
anyone like you're a physical server in
your infrastructure on on Amazon or
other infrastructure a provider chef
will beaut that environment that you
define it on your production or you know
on a open source open like OpenStack
they can be running your own internal
infrastructure or can be running on some
provided that you're paying for to run
an efficient infrastructure so you're
talking about here the same scripts the
creative development environment that
create your test environments they are
now creating a production environment so
you have a very sophisticated and very
homogeneous environments to run your
application at so at that point you're
starting you know your infrastructure is
starting to look more like a pass thing
right because you're not you not caring
so much about infrastructure you're
building infrastructure when you need it
and the way you need automatically here
i have a Jenkins beauty I plan I'm going
to manually trigger the butte here but
the important important thing to note or
show the logs is that the same a vagrant
machine that I use it on my notebook to
make the beauty is being used at my
Jenkins server to boot another vagrant
machine with the same configuration same
code it will take a few minutes to boot
but if you execute the same makeup maven
viewed as in my machine use the same
male version same java version so i can
i can rest assured that in my Jenkins
server i'll have the same reproducible
beaut as i had in my notebook we can
come back here later it will take a
while to diminish around is
okay so now the next problem that we
have is that ok so now building for
structure everything's cool it fine but
this is provisioning right provisioning
is when you start about a machine you
download everything you configure
everything you know how long does it
take even if automatically right how
long does it take for you to start a new
environment it takes you know you're
going to see it takes several minutes
for you to download everything from the
internet you know install everything
configure everything and we're talking
about cloud here come on one of the big
big big thing about cloud is the whole
thing is that we have virtual
environments and we have veto machines
so if you have little machines why don't
we create instead of creating provision
our machine why don't we create a image
with all of these already pre
provisioning and we can when we need
them we can just start it immediately so
there's no delay we can just start
whenever we want so now but we want to
do from the same configuration that we
have already have a configuration to
Butte the machine so how can we do this
so there's another interesting to thats
Packer so pecker is a to that allows you
to get your chef scripts right and they
will build a machine from your chef
scripts and once you have the Machine
Butte you generate an machine image
there you can just start later on right
so how does that that looks like next so
how does that look like then so now we
have the same chef script yes oh dear
hugs right here so he has the same chef
scripts community to get right now you
use Jenkins to bude your development
environment your test environment blah
blah and then jinx trigger specker that
will use the same chef script to build a
machine create a virtual machine create
an image and and now you can use their
image to run on a Vista box environment
for example right or upload that video
machine to Amazon to distil ocean to
OpenStack to wherever provider you want
to you want to run your viewer machine
from so that means that now from the
same
chef script that you have you have a
fully configured vista machine image on
your profile on your cloud provider that
will be available for you anytime you
need so this is you know so now you're
really automating this whole just hope
this whole process so anytime now you
need a machine to run your code you just
start a machine that's already
pre-configured pre-running and
everything and you can do this many
times right remain as many machines as
you need and every time your
infrastructure changes right you will
trigger a new builder a new packer a new
image and your image you always going to
be following you know the whole the
whole infrastructure process that you
have well we show a little demo of
packer yeah here at my deployment
pipeline I've produced it after the
vagrant Butte which you can see a button
here well we won't see but it's
successful so now we be a random Packer
to bude an amazon image am i so i can
run in production or testing the same
environment that i had in the
development and on Jenkins so when we're
talking about pecker a look we have a
Netflix like architecture we're not
deploying anymore just code or just war
we're we're deploying a code a Java code
as a war and also the whole
infrastructure need to run the code
we're not in deploying just wars anymore
but just a fool appliances directly to
the infrastructure as a self provider
yeah so it pecker takes a little time to
run so i'll just use one from my
previous butte here pecker it
automatically generates amazon am is so
that's the provider i'm using the last
one is this one it has already package
in ubuntu linux with tongkat and
everything else i just i know i know is
that we're packaging the whole
infrastructure with the source code and
our application in it right so we have
the whole thing as one package as a as a
machine image right
so so before Packer Everett people would
build a machine and then when the
machine is started you would download
the last version of source code and run
the source code but if anything changes
the infrastructure then your machine now
that you have an image is not unpair we
have the infrastructure with the change
of infrastructure your code needs so
we've Packer you combine everything in
one single package and so you run your
application always on the same latest
version of the infrastructure that you
create and I can scale it any time since
I have a ready am I a machine image from
amazon I can out to scare weights to
provide any number of machines when this
case go up or down mmm question right
yes so he's quite his question is a
repeat the question so that his question
is if Packer knows about other machine
image format so yes Becker knows about
different machine image formats you can
run on vista box for example you can run
ravine where you can run on just ocean
you can run several providers and it
does have a provider infrastructure that
you can add other providers to chew
packer so you could do other views on
machines if you want we do using the
amazon here but let me know later i can
show you the script but to configure
another to build multiple providers it's
just a matter of opening the JSON of a
pecker and introduce you I want now I
want to provision to this devotion or
VMware it will trigger the Butte and
just as we did it with Amazon yeah so
packet will build several provides at
the same time so you can have several
providers with the same vehicle machine
so again in the same image right or
image view the same way so the cool
thing about that is that now you're not
even locking into a specific provider
because you can have your own
infrastructure image for different
providers ok let's keep going because
we're not otherwise we're not going to
have time
so and then now we have all of these
right that's pretty cool nice and so can
I can I go step forward and and change
doing my applications do so can I
encapsulate my applications in in a
portable container that I have my whole
application with everything he needs in
a package you know in a format that I
can move between different providers and
I can I can have the whole thing running
so yeah there's another cool tool that's
a pre reason to the skull docker that
allows exactly that so you can actually
use chef to bude your your your whole
infrastructure your application needs
and packaged is as a container right you
know the little container is that the
way it was carrying over there you
package this in as a container so your
whole application is a container with
everything he needs you know all the
source code I mean for infrastructure
thing he needs and then now you can run
this container in multiple providers in
multiple cloud cloud environments so you
know you know in a very lightweight
lightweight wait the problem with
traditional images is that it takes a
bit of time to boot so when you have
some some delays can go up and down
mainly came up with dr. you have a very
light wave container basis on Linux
containers technology which is a
recently recently new in the million
external it's it boots very fast you
have a node isolation inside them same
linux kernel and dogs take advantage of
this elation to provide a very fast
infrastructure-as-a-service environment
yeah so basically when you need it you
need to start a new environment for
application you basically clones what
you have and in very very fast you can
start on you on your machine right so
with all that we basically gets in the
full deployment pipeline that's the
dream or everyone right you know they've
had the food deployment pipeline they
can go from your from your codes all the
way to your production environments you
know with the same stream line on a
platform and we for doing this in the
cloud then
means you know that that's you can
because all the visualization you can do
this very easy and you know you can use
all those tools to their maximum
potential right of course all of those
tools we're talking here a lot about the
cloud but all of those tools can run on
your physical server right you can do
all of these in your physical server but
of course if you can do this on a cloud
environment then those tools actually
really shine because they know they
can't they can't create everything you
need whenever that's needed and so as
the last thing we're participating we
know we came here to devil one of that
talk you know focus on on cloud and
everything and so we join you know
veneca zenyatta right here in front you
know thank you thanks very much for
their support we join you there
Raspberry Pi challenge and we're like
you know we're there just to help out
some people to decide their ideas
everything and one of the ideas was can
we do a Java to java ee 7 in in
raspberry PI's right and say hey that's
a cool stuff that we could do can we
actually do a cloud of raspberry PI's
and so that's what we have been working
on for the last couple of days there's a
there's a full team so what have you
helped it out filippi pedroso it's
another guy to helping out the name of
the other two that that's saying in
tomorrow yes who st. amour you know some
of the other people that join our team
so you know we have this this team doing
basically yeah he's just gonna going to
switch to the two we have a network here
that can't be connect to the internet
because the guys don't allow us to
connect the routers I mean switches here
to the network so we gonna is going to
change them to the PI network right here
and and so so now the thing is we're
Java developers right we're talking
about all this thing about the cloud
blah blah blah can we actually get our
environments and our application can we
use all the things that we're talking
about here and deploy those things to a
mesh of home cloud servers you know with
those with a $35 up I that's that's this
this guy here it costs 35
others you can have hundreds of those in
your house automating all kinds of
things you know automating your lights
automating your day-to-day things so can
you actually now get your job
application deployed to a mesh of those
guys and and can we do this with several
devices right because that's the thing
we have here pi we have a meno board
that is from intelligent use a different
ship set we have two other pies here we
have a gemalto concept board that is a
different guy so all of those guys were
in Java right and can we actually get
our job application to run on a platform
of multiple cloud providers they are
like minimalist called providers okay
the exactly same configuration in word
to use to deploy here in Jenkees in
vagrant and amazon at Heroku we deployed
on a middle board which is an atom based
board and here at a spare pi which is an
arm baseball board so we provided a
minimum cloud we have a load balancer
here it's routing the request between
the these boards so you can see it's
it's already access accessing our load
balancer if I we provided some code to
access some embedded tools so when each
requests reaches the has barrier or the
mean about it triggers a rest request to
light up light up these lads so as you
can see we're running the lads right
here mmm right and and basically uh you
know when he hits the the raspberry pi
will turn red when you reach the the
middle boards going to turn blue but
that's Emma God's weren't as really
before that's def what we were desperate
right before the cloud for some reason
this network here is not we're not being
able to reach the Raspberry Pi but
showed its fault tolerance gas cuz and
we have a cloud there has picotin join
the consider network but it's too
working huh yes and then and so
so can you go back there yes what is
that Jack so Jack is doing his own cloud
thing here Jack that's not the cloud
we're talking about we're talking about
some other cloud so but basically you
know if all those tools come on what is
this so with all those tools you know we
actually can get to the cloud right and
you can get java technology and java
developers into really in a full
environment that supports the best job
technology the newest java technology in
in a very cool cloud application ok so i
think we have like no mean it's no time
for questions i think we tend to turn
right on time thank you very much guys
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
