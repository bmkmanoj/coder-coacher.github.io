multi-device entire TV room that's
something that you can plug all the
stuff using Java in your room in the
local area network in short words to say
okay here comes the agenda so first I'm
going to talk about the motivation to
for this work all the stuff behind the
going to talk about the consumer
behavior and what people are doing like
how we are watching TV these days our
habits just change from the from maybe
five years now and then i'm going to
talk about a solution the state-of-art
you have the market i'm going to talk
about the problems that must be
addressed in the current state of art
applications and then i'm going to show
you propose a solution using java to
address the problems we just found in
this state of art market solutions we
have right now and then i'm going to
talk about the advantages some days when
they show some cold i wanted to show the
demo here life using the setup box and a
smartphone and a tablet an ipad actually
but it won't be possible it's okay oh
sorry okay these days last year google
has developed the research has published
a little research saying that ninety
percent of all the media interactions we
have these days our screen based I mean
they are all on the smart phones TVs
tablets or laptops ninety percent of the
media we see we watch in every day and
thirty-eight percent of our daily media
are consumed using smartphones I mean
might be an iPhone might be an Android
ok and then seventy-seven percent of the
times we are watching TV we do this with
a laptop or a tablet or a smartphone by
hand I mean we just gone what TV anymore
just TV we are in 777 percent at times
we do this using something else some
device elves in forty-nine percent of
the times it's anna smartphone and the
thirty-four percent it's a pc or laptop
okay again seventy-seven percent of the
TV viewers use another device at the
same time they watch TV and what we do
why do we do this why it happens that it
turns out that people I want to talk
about the problem the program want to
get more information and want to share
the opinions about the problems they are
saying the TV shows the concerts we want
to do this at the same time we are
watching TV and we're okay where do we
want to share and get more information
and talk about it at some time ago used
to be at the water cooler remember you
saw game for example you watch the game
on Sunday afternoon and then on Monday
you come to the work in your office you
went to the water cooler used to be a
place where people used to talk and say
hello and talk about the weekend and at
that time we used to talk about the TV
shows we watch it in the weekend at the
water cooler or maybe in the food court
the schoolyard
and so on but now we want to do this in
a Twitter and Facebook we just don't
come to the office and talk about the TV
shows we do this on Twitter and Facebook
and when in the free time I mean in the
breaks of the TV shows and oh maybe
while we are waiting for something in
the TV show we just use this time to get
more information to talk about the
program or two to share this with
somebody okay so maybe the TV is over
bye-bye TV we won't be watching TV
anymore and okay I work with TVs for the
I've been working with TVs for the past
10 years and I have no job maybe but no
no because it's a new trend people want
to do this while that they are watching
TV not they they want to watch TV also
it's that the people won't be just
watching TV like watching only to eat
they want to do this at the same time
they are looking for information in a
second screen device so that's a new
challenge you see a kid so baby it's it
just don't want to watch TV it's looking
an ipad for something so new challenge
now is to keep the audience focus on the
content we have a content on the TV we
want to keep the audience turn to the to
the content not just something else in
the tablet in a smartphone or in the
laptop it's okay so so now we have to
look for a solution we want you to have
a content in the TV that's the main
device in a room
the CTV we just can't forget that the TV
is still the main device the main screen
in the room we just can't forget that we
want to use this to support a Content
synchronized with the content in a
second screen we want to use the second
screen we don't want to fight the second
screen we want to work together it's ok
so I'm going to talk about to a
state-of-art possible options of doing
this synchronize the content between the
TV and the smartphone or tablet our
second string device we call it a CR
automatic content recognition the the
first case I'm going to talk about is we
have the content the producer is there
they send these automatic content
recognition is based on a fingerprint in
the audio in short words it's like you
have you you have your smartphone for
example it's with an application here
maybe an Android or an iOS application
and then some audio with a fingerprint
is displayed in TV and then the
smartphone recognized this audio and
then it looks for more content in a web
so how did it is the first step is to
the producers send the audio with the
fingerprint to the chua SEFs provider
somewhere in the internet so and then
the the producers send the main content
I mean the audio and the video shoot the
broadcaster the transmitter the TV
transmitter ok and then the broadcaster
transmitted to the TV the TV is going to
send the audio with a fingerprint to the
smartphone
and then when the smartphone recognizes
the this discontent of audio is going to
look for more information in the service
provider and then the service provider
is going to get some information from
the maybe social networks to have some
updated data and then it sends back to
the smartphone and then the smartphone
can send some feedback to the service
provider in this case the broadcaster
that's the the main entity in these in
this scenario that's the broadcaster who
wants to know the information to provide
information to the user it may not be in
control of the second screen because it
going to send some finger brains to
server and maybe the application is
going to look for more information in
the server and then get some information
okay so we have the the second and last
a state-of-art application this one is
basically in the negative just to
summarize this one is a base in an
active action of the user the user must
check in for example i say my smartphone
I just say okay I'm watching super bowl
game and then when I say that my
application is going to look for more
information and then the broadcaster is
going to know about it but it depends on
a in action and that's the same so when
the application checks in is going to
look for information and get this and
then the application gets back in short
was that's this so the control of the
second screen content and the user
experience and the feedback is base and
it relies on the
the reaction of the user of checking in
and saying to somebody that they are
watching that program so we have some
problems the broadcaster or the the
provider the solution is comes to be
generic so it might be used by a TV
broadcaster but it might be used by a
bluray Java programmer if it wants to
embody in applications entry be DJ CD so
the broadcaster may not have direct
control over the content and and if you
don't have control over the the process
you might be missing some business
information may be missing some for
example if you don't get information
directly from your user your audience
you may be missing for example there is
something really important in
interactive 3 that's directed content
publishing an advertisement for example
if I want to get all the man in the
state for example and send some
advertisement just for men about the
games and then I can direct at that time
or that second Swing content the only
for men I can do this I I won't be able
to do this using these technologies or
it's going to cost it's a fragmented
market because you have many different
program shows and many different content
providers and they just don't know what
solution to use so it's a high cost to
cover all the technologies and other
solutions and it's a an Internet content
dependent content distribution you saw
that it's mandatory that W
goals and a tonight and get some
information we are just missing the TV
broadcast channel that's live it can
sense it could send the data to you and
and related to the audio bases solution
it usually it requires some silent
environment for example if you have a
pre fingerprint in a inaudile and it's
all noisy in the room the the smartphone
or a tablet what never recognize the
fingerprint so you won't work at all and
in the last May no interaction is man oh
okay it's been oh it's not automatic so
the user must check in or must go for
some screen in the device to say that
okay i'm watching this program and i
want you to get more information so it's
not automatic so now i'm going to
propose a solution based in java that's
the main purpose here so what are the
requirements so i want to i want the TV
broadcaster and the providers in general
to control the process I want them to to
have control they might be a redirecting
read right sorry redirecting to a 30
part but I want them to be able to
control I want the user feedback to go
directly to the broadcaster or to the
provider the synchronization method I
wanted to to work life basically I
wanted to work life because in the audio
fingerprint you guys made all that it
takes some time to get the audio and
then to process
then you get some information so for
live events it's not so good and then I
want a solution that is completely
natural and not dependent in the user
action so if it doesn't require the
users action it's better and maybe a
solution that supports a no internet
access if it's not a fully dependent of
course if if we want you to have some
specific and live information it might
be it must be connected but we have some
bandwidth in the TV transmission that we
should use so that's the solution and
the main difference between these
solution and all the others I showed you
before is that the the engine in the TV
you have let's say a use case i show you
basing the brazilian TV broadcasting
scenario we have these days so the main
engine is in a TV the TV connects to the
to the second screen and the second
screen to the TV also of course and they
get some information from each other and
all the the the provider the providers
synchronization host is under is under
control of the broadcaster or the
provider itself so how come we just have
a home area network nor for example
you're in your room and as the maybe
you're not into the the technology of
the digital TV but you have all the
information the TV and you have a a
component called announcer it announces
the
the interactive application with the
agent we have an agent but which talks
to the smart phones in a peer-to-peer
communication based architecture and as
it announces that the application is on
the smartphone just get some information
through a file server okay that's a real
life real use case I wanted to show you
but basically it's an application and
Android application or an iOS
application have both here as soon as
the application is downloaded by the TV
it connects to the to the second screen
and they keeping switching and sending
messages to each other in a peer-to-peer
basic communication okay in it it's not
mandatory that the application will have
internet connection because we use the
bandwidth from the TV broadcasting
signal to send information to the second
screen so for example the the use case i
want to show you is a football match for
example the user is watching the TV may
the football match and then for example
we have a bowl so go and then somebody
from the audience is a real-life use
case somebody from the audience in this
stadium just recorded the goal recorder
the football game the part of the ball
so it sent to the broadcaster in the
broadcaster's wants you to send it to
all the people who are watching TV at
that moment so it sends in the in the
signal all together with the main audio
and main video the application coming
with the video sent by that user who are
watching the football game at Stadium so
you don't have to have internet to get
the video the video comes along with the
main TV transmission so advantages now
the TV broadcaster has full control over
the content so it can even ascend
content along with the TV signal the
user feedback goes directly to the TV
broadcaster because if it has internet
connection it can send some information
also and synchronization method is
automatic and works good for our live
events like football games live like the
scenario I just thought about and this
illusion doesn't require any user action
at all the user is just with the
application on and it receives a
notification in the top of the tablet or
smartphone saying that okay you have an
extra content related to the program you
are watching right now because we know
the problem you are watching because the
TV and the smartphone they are paired at
that moment and then as we use a
standard technology like Java we think
it we can reach all the mass audience we
are not using a proprietary solution
you're using Java so if we don't have
any internet we just can we can get some
content that's good at that maybe the
major advantage so but why Java I just
got these information yesterday
we have a billion desktops with Java
support have almost beaten downloads
each year of the JRE we have three
billion mobile phones with Java we have
all the blu-ray players in Brazil we
have 10 million Ginga enabled TVs the
tvs with Java supports and I don't know
I just don't put it here for the journal
if i should but maybe I could talk about
it not here and we have so it's a lot of
devices okay in just to know in Brazil
we have some expectations of having
maybe almost 60 billion of devices with
java TV devices of java in 2016 today we
have maybe a hundred million and if we
have 60 million is more than a half so
more than half of the TV devices in
brazil will have java so it's a lot of
devices actually it's 54 ok ok so now
some code maybe that's what we want to
show the best part that's an example if
if you guys want i can send you the
javadocs and all the stuff you need to
test it you may use it in android and
blu-ray not an environmental java it's
all java-based it's an example of a
application and excellent which runs in
a TV just have to politely we have this
facility that's a Gingka agent just
actually to create a ginger agent and
it's going to be listening to events and
sending events if it's the case that's
the access that's an embedded
application
and then we have the listener that part
was supposed to run the TV in the
application which runs in the TV
embedded so this code is supposed to run
for example here in the cell phone
that's the the listener we call this
library this PHP library call we call it
magic the magic link actually so we just
get the distance of the manager and
starts in you just start listening to
the event that just this then for
example in that first code we can send
the comments to the chewed application
which runs here for example you just
create the command using the comment
factory and you put information and then
you just add the comment that's easy so
I think we got the conclusions I I just
got this a presentation in half an hour
because I wanted to show the the the
real-life use case working here but as
it was impossible so just rigidly the
conclusions so the conclusion of these
work is that we have some solutions
right now in the market that have some
issues some major issues that they have
to be addressed so a Java solution we
just proposed can meet all the
requirements we have of automatic
synchronization methods and a reliable
synchronization because we use Java only
communication for you to know the the
the java version i have in this setup
box division 1 dot 3 so it's all pure
java and maybe any java is going to work
in any java so we believe that as we are
using a powerful standard like java we
can reach all the the mass we can reach
the most people as necessary in a an
advantage an advantage a scenario maybe
the TV will be able to send information
directly to the devices not even using a
internet local area network we might be
using another profile like zigbee or
bluetooth I don't know just using Java
ok so I'm going to have a lot of time
for the question and answers
unfortunately I wasn't able to make the
stuff work ok
let me maybe I can show you defecation
in the highway
demo I wanted to show you is that with
every football match right now instrum
period and then as soon as the setup box
download application and the application
is started this run in full irani is
going to be looking for devices in the
local area network which have the same
the same platform future people to
program so that's application we saw
where it's all there at that screen so
as soon as we have the application
running the we have automatically all
the broadcaster in Brazil the last time
I disconnected the reason the same
network i bought the web but the setup
box and the
don't have to be discreet so it's the
release any information and it
automatically is gonna be running all
the subject and the the second example I
was supposed to show you was a the final
match of the Confederations Cup you just
have to reserve two month ago the final
match with brazil and spain so in every
goal we had their the replay was insane
here was insensitive so you are watching
TV and the gate is playing okay it's
fine and maybe it's ten minutes ago you
had to go so you want to see it again
you see here and you won't be alone all
the people in the room I mean maybe you
guys want to be alone see it wasn't
supposed to be used alone to get is a
device to be used like your family
probably okay you see so its symptomatic
this goes to the other screen and shows
you all the information of this football
match and they require in the score this
video right now revealed by a look at
medieval festival SBT right now used and
as it is an open library and open API we
just feel it's open late night you guys
these are all hinges and use like
example you guys work with blue red
purple have a bluray you can have extra
content in the city beyond the video
beyond the movie prison so movie turbo
fast appears so what you are watching
the movie you want to the user check
again okay like a race so just put this
game in the TV like a big lead Jerry
application so this application can be
sending information to the second screen
because you know that probably the user
won't be watching the movie just
watching the movie they will be watching
the movie and getting some information
about the soundtrack of the movie or
maybe get some information about the
cars or getting some information about
certain herbs and actor naturist so we
just can put the information in the
second screen directly from the BJJ
application directly to the show the
second thing the bar ok
it's hard to talk about something that
we just can't see I wanted you to see
all the stuff and you see it working but
maybe next time any more questions
no not actually because it just needs
you to have Java so if you have Java in
the device it's going to be able to run
the these library in this case yeah
because or set up boxes of digital TV or
a blu-ray enabled devices which are the
devices the digital TV devices and the
blu-ray disc devices they are able to
run Java they are able to execute job
applications and to communicate in a
local area network communicate with your
smartphone or a tablet and so on in
these case these api is not supposed to
be a base in any communication protocol
it's just basing the peer-to-peer
communication protocol and in this case
it's internet so in the local area
network these case here I wanted to show
you is another Wi-Fi network so it's all
it's just internet
oh yeah that's a good question it's
something that our the broadcaster's
we've been working with they you wanted
to talk about it but they are still
trying to find a way to do this so
indicate of the video it was just these
example I want to show you the football
match and it was only once in a game but
these days they are sending only html5
with all informations and in the video I
think they are there going to be running
on a deer drm a solution a proprietary
may be supported by the the ipad and
Sebata bite d android i think so ok I
think it's all thank you coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
