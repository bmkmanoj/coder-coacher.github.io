of send links and free master classes

about three resources available to
developers from public libraries and
when you go to a public library first of
all what you need to know is as resident
of state of california you can have a
number of different library cards in
addition to the one that's in your city
so if you have for example San Francisco
Public Library card you have access to
approximately 8,000 books about software
development if you have a New York
Public Library card which you should get
whenever you go to New York because as
well for three months even if you don't
live in New York it's going to give you
free access to lynda.com for free now if
you are a member of Microsoft developer
sideshows program it's going to give you
three months of free access to
Pluralsight and that is just one of many
examples of free high-quality developer
resources you can you have available to
you today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
