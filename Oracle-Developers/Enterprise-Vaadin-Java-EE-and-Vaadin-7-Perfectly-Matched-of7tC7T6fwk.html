about budding especially bad in in the
enterprise my name is Dominick Dunne I'm
working as a researcher and as a
software developer for the Vienna
University of Technology in Austria
Europe Europe I'm employed in the
research group for industrial software
I'm a Czech leader in Austria and I'm
working on open heart open source and
always try to find race on how to be
more productive I'm always trying out
the new and cool stuff and sadly I
always run into packs and need to find a
way to fix them so I think let's start
who of you is already using button
please raise your hand
ok quite a lot who of you has been using
valine for more than 2 months
ok so for some of you some of this
content will be new some of it will
already be known for those of you that
haven't been using VAT in I hope it will
give you a good impression on what you
look up on out if you are starting a new
project on it and well let's start a few
personal opinions of mine so in my
opinion creating a scalable desktop like
Web Apps is quite a hard thing to do
who is in this with me ok very good this
especially hard to create a consistent
and accessible and especially functional
user experience and user interface who
is in with with me
ok good agile on the same page so it's
especially hard in my opinion to create
these web-based rich clients and make
them scalable to thousands of users
who's seen it with me ok and it's often
especially hard to scale over multiple
development teams so multiple persons
teams working on the same project at the
same time not getting to fight with each
other everyone knows this one yeah ok
good
my opinion valine 7 helps us to solve
some or maybe most of these problems and
I will show you now how we did this in
our project the case study we are going
to look on is a project for an Austrian
government agency they are doing some
retirement insurance and basically need
you to handle all the stuff that's that
belongs to it so handling user contacts
issuing the correct amount of insurance
to every person entered like the project
is built on multiple computers so they
have different departments that
create specifications for the web app
that's going to be development developed
and we have multiple teams that are
basically working simultaneously on
implementing these releases of course we
always have a tight schedule and the the
project managers are always on our backs
to well you know we have to to give this
product now to testing and then and well
everyone knows how this is right okay we
have some visually impaired users who we
have to make sure that the web
application is accessible to them as
well the system is used by more than
5,000 concurrent users every day in the
night it always goes to sleep as the
public employed people always leave at
around 3 p.m. so that's the time when we
are able to deploy of course we have
class that environments in production we
are wanting the WebSphere application
servers
it has unfortunately some issues that we
are always fighting with and for
development we use a patchy tummy in
currently version 1.5.2 so the task at
hand is we wanted to create a high level
of computer and development we want to
provide a great user experience we want
to keep the codebase structured clean
and battle maintainable of course we are
wanting unit tests and at least we
should most of the time and of course we
have to scale to over 5,000 people
because that's the amount of employees
that are going to use this system
oh good when I created this presentation
I said it will be five my five steps to
success my colleagues meant that it
wouldn't be wouldn't be fair to say it's
these ultimate five things that will
always work so I renamed it to proven
practices that worked quite well for us
I hope your cave is that as usual DC
staff that worked for us it might work
for you it might as well not work for
you as always it depends so take what
you what you think is good from this
talk apply it to your work if you want
to discuss it we have some time later or
drop me simple an email on the here is
you see my Twitter handle so feel free
to to follow me or tweet me or all the
other stuff that you can do on this
platform well let's start with it
okay the first step that we do in our
project is always creating UI mock-ups
so basically we have some people that
are working with Vista users that are
going to be using the application and
mr. people that are defining the
functionality of the application and
those people always create mock-ups and
treat them as long so long until they
are basically what the users expect from
our application when creating mock-ups
you have to a few things to you to keep
in mind in our opinion it's quite
important to create a web application
that is more or less stateless here we
actually did not follow this this rule
ourselves so our developer created a web
app is
tipple taps that could stay open that's
now quite an issue for us so please
always be aware that stuff that stays
open in the browser window is a bad
thing
what is especially important is that
yeah the designer should refuse to
people that will be using this
application think that's quite obvious
and especially for the the people that
always like to write these documents of
specifications hundreds of it and try to
create a usable thing first before
starting arguing this how big Keys
should use this logo B or shifting
around pixels and anyone had this
experience right yeah okay so to create
mock-ups we used basically two tools we
used balsamiq mockups to create the user
interface mock-ups from this user
interface mock-ups we then created user
stories and created developer tasks out
of them to be implemented by our deaths
for issue tracking we used a red man
it's it's proven quite well and out of
these mock-ups then our special web
designer created a more-or-less
Photoshop template which then was
approved by the customer and we created
a seamless button out of it yeah so this
is one of our first mock-ups as you can
see we had a search panel on the left
and a results panel on the right the
application was then extended to get
additional tabs when you click on the on
on one of the result
records and sadly we allowed the
customer to specify that those tab
should skip should be kept open and
that's now a scalability issue that we
have to rock with so if you're ever
creating websites with steps by all
means try to talk the customer out of
keeping those tabs open if they they
contain user context sensitive
information out of this mock-up our
designer then created is Photoshop Singh
it looks a little bit better as you can
see it's it's quite an iteration from
the first screen and here you can see
how it and looked in the final product
so it's not quite as fancy as in the in
the in the second mock-up but actually
the customer is quite happy with it yeah
so this is one of our mock-ups where the
designer
basically implemented user stories so as
you can see he added some notes
everywhere how this component should
behave it worked quite well for us
because we don't always have to search
through pages of specification and it's
quite obvious what should be implemented
and how it should behave at least most
of the times the the user interface guy
always updates this yellow boxes if you
have questions so it's more or less our
documentation of the web app and it's
proven quite well okay
step two code structure and architecture
to keep the project maintainable it's
quite important in our opinion to keep
the code based well structured and clean
we do this by grouping functionality
grouping the application in in kinds of
similar tasks and basically well I
should just show it to you so that's a
picture of our built architecture as you
can see we using apache maven we have
quite a lot of projects there
it's basically split up into a parent
project which has always a backhand side
front and side and API side in the we
have additional a utils package that has
common functionality that we need to do
to keep our app running and and to make
- to ease development in the core
package it's bay so we have these these
multiple concurrent releases and for
each release we more or less group out
functionality based on on the big topics
in the release so we had discus we have
two right now we have two big topics
unfortunately unfortunately the project
is in German so that the big project is
this Kooten service and this standard
and we basically called our application
around this big topic
so yeah every topic gets his set of
modules with the backend part where we
we divide the backend into the API
package and just a be e package in the
API package we put all the interfaces
for our services and entities or D TOS
available to the front end and we have
for each topic we have a front-end
package that basically contains all the
components and and fuse that this topic
contains ok yeah that's everything for
this if you have questions please just
ask so we don't have to do this all at
the end I think we have plenty of time
ok so our application is basically
developed in a more or less two T or
three tier architecture at the top we
have our front end those speak with data
transfer objects with our backends and
below our backends we have a data basis
we are currently running Oracle I think
it's 10g and we have some web services
we have 2a access as the websphere
application server and Tommy both use
are more or less the same stack we use
open JP a for persistence and we use
Apache cxf for accessing the web
services between the front end and the
back end we use CDI and the Apache Delta
spike project who knows Apache Delta
spike
hands up please ok quite a few for those
of you who do not know it it's a
collection of CDI
more or less helpless and it has proven
quite quite useful in our project so I
just can suggest everyone to try that
out when we now have our multiple topics
our project changes a little bit so we
have basically on the bottom are Quebec
and maven module that contains all the
common functionality of all the backends
on top of that we have multiple back-end
projects each second basically it's a
one-to-one relation between each pack
and project and each front-end project
and every front-end project then
registers with our let's call VB called
it core front-end package so the the
core front-end package actually contains
our our UI class and we have made some
hooks you need to allow our single
front-end our single front-end modules
to register themselves with our UI so
our UI basically contains the few
display in our case it was a custom view
display that allowed us to add content
inside the tabs we have we are using the
Navin divide in navigator and we created
an old navigation class to allow us to
basically do typesafe navigation because
it proved quite error-prone to you
always create those wells by hand ok
questions of yeah
architecture for this in development
mode these f es here they are always war
files and be using the Maven wall plugin
there's an option there that you can
basically create a second artifact
that's created as a child file so in
production we're basically deploying one
war file that has all these front-end
modules as a char file packaged and we
are using violets it's it's still a
little bit work in progress right now we
are manually registering the front-end
modules in the core front-end but we are
currently working on doing this
dynamically this CDI so yeah we have
multiple integration hooks hook to add
fuse to the Navigator API a hook to at
the the various navigation entries to
the navigation power and stuff like that
right now
well it's it's hard coded with Java more
or less but really working on a CD I
kind of doing it okay
any other questions
okay maintainability so to keep this
whole thing running for well long enough
to to get into pension retirement
ourselves we have to we have to keep our
code base quite clean and testable and
to not get insane with the huge amount
of classes that are generated when that
that you create when when doing a valine
based project we are using the MVP
design pattern who knows the MVP design
pattern hands up okay quite quite a few
and we're using it together with mojito
and test Angie so I will show you now
how we are basically applying it so
every part of our application implement
is basically split more or less into
these sweet components we have a few
that's always an interface we extend the
adding few interface and have some some
additional macro interfaces that we use
ourselves we in our interfaces we always
create sub interfaces for certain kinds
of behavior that we want to change
during one time so we always have some
kind of a click listener a special click
listener for this pattern or special
click listener for that button of course
our view gets always implemented and we
always create a presenter the presenter
is the only class that has access to the
backend and it has some data access
objects there to basically keep the
state of the UI
safe summer we created some helper
classes to to deal with this construct
but before I show you to that basically
that's the design we are using a van
when creating fuse when we are creating
components we sometimes use this
approach but most of the time we
basically do the logic inside the
component at least if the component
doesn't need to access some some of our
back-end service ok so to make working
with this model few percent a little bit
easier we create the two abstract
classes one is the abstract view and one
is the abstract presenter and those two
classes are basically typed to be VP
bound together so if you in the next
screen well let's talk a bit about that
the few always has some kind of layout
so our abstract view always extends the
custom component this helps with tools
like shareable and our few always knows
in a generic way that it has a presenter
it always always has a layout where the
components are placed and it always has
access to the Navigator then we have the
present presenter the presenter always
gets initialized with the view it is
handling and it always has access to the
navigator and in our case we add edit
add additional class that's doing our
right right base checking because we are
in in the current stage we haven't
implemented the Java access and
authentication service contract with our
views right now yet so that's how a
helper construction
so you make this a little bit more more
understandable I have a sample here so
at the top you see our two abstract
classes and below you have
implementation of the pattern so I
prefer for testing purposes I created a
user debug view and the user debug view
itself is just on an interface and it
only has the the entered method and when
you start basically the the the the view
implementation itself is always a
subclass of the abstract view and it
always has its presenter assigned so
that the workflow that we are the coding
work for we are using is always so
basically you start with the interface
for the view so you create an empty
interface called in this case use a
debug view extends the few interface
from body and then you start by
subclassing the abstract view and when
you start typing in the extends abstract
so you start by by typing in public
class use the debug view input and and
then you say extracts abstract view and
then you already have to provide
basically the class for the presenter
and that's the way those two are wired
together and then you start basically
handling yourself through the
application workflow so you start okay
the user enters the view so the enter
method is invoked and from the enter
method in the few you basically call
okay
presenter look I the enter method was
invoked I got these parameters do
something with me and then the the
presenter basically decides hey what
should I do now okay I look at the
parameters Oh a user ID was
specified so I look up in the service
and I I call back the view and say okay
I've got this user for you display it
and then the the view basically attaches
components to the layout and you be if
you then have that sorry if you have
some kind of form then the view that the
presenter basically registers in the few
what should happen if this this pattern
on the form is clicked and that's just a
callback these callbacks basically only
just taste okay I've got clicked now
invoke this or that method in the
presenter is that clear okay I hope it
is somehow clear because it's it's
always a little bit hard for me to
explain it when not showing real code
yes this few change event here is is the
event that's created by Vardon and
basically the view is is supposed to
pass this event and and filter out the
parameters so the the presenter never
gets access to any of adding classes so
that their own when you are implementing
the presenter a a good way to find out
if you did it correctly is to scroll up
to the imports of the java class and if
there is no single import of converting
then your did it right so basically then
when the user opens up the view the
center method is invoked you extract the
parameters from the event and supply
them as a string or as number whatever
you want to the enter method of the the
presenter and from there on you you you
handle yourself to the point where you
yeah a piece you know
date you want it to be okay so mr. still
step to you yes in my opinion bad in
love smoke eater they did those tools
are basically made to to to work
together while okay mockito does work
with with some other frameworks as well
but if you're doing MVP with Madden
mojito is in my opinion really the way
to go so let's show you some code who is
in it for me with me hmm okay
still motivated at least a bit okay so
oh I'm not sure if you can you read this
somehow some way okay good we see here a
test for a presenter we created you
present this called test presenter and
the test is called test presenter test
good that we don't make a test for the
test because then you just get ugly in
our project we have a special special
class called container test it does some
bootstrapping of CI for us it's
basically a part of Delta spike so it's
it's a good way to to do testing with
CDI integration without you are without
the need of tools like a Crillon for
example okay so basically our test has
always a presenter and the the few and
in the setup method we actually create
mocks for for when we are testing the
presenter we're creating a mojito mock
for the view and that way we can always
look if the presenter is behaving
correctly if it's correctly calling the
methods we have interview and when
you're testing the view is the other way
around too
let's look at one example yeah basically
it's I think it's quite clear isn't is
it not clear for anyone I mean I am B
I've been in this project quite long so
it all looks quite obvious we often use
the verify and bend methods in in this
mockito it allows us to really test all
kinds of the lifecycle of the few and
the presenter because sometimes it's
quite hard to trigger some kind of
exception but yeah that's the way we do
it and it has proven quite well ad is
there are question to testing the MVP
why is it does anyone do it differently
I mean ends up who does it this way who
doesn't do any testing okay thanks for
that for being so honest okay the the
slides will be online later so if you
don't well you can look at the code
later if you if you want to get a deep
understanding of it okay so let's go to
scalability if there's anything that you
take out of this talk today then it's
this sentence please remember it it's
keep your sessions sin and this is
really really really important in
writing and I will show you why this is
the case because in baden-baden has this
this construct of the Valene session and
in cellular based environments the
Varden session gets put into the HTTP
session and this it is one object so
the valence session contains contains
all the your eyes your so if a user
accesses your web app the main entry
point in a web app this patent is always
a UI and the instance of the UI that
your user is seeing is always put in the
interval in session and it's not just a
little object that is put there but
every component that this on the screen
of the user is put into the session so
every drop down the menu every label
everything is really put into into an
object and it's put into a session so if
you have some kind of form this let's
say you have a user registration form
and there are all the countries in the
world
and each country has a drop-down menu
with all the the states in it so you
have around I don't know a few thousand
objects there and if you're buying this
once to to any component that is visible
to the user it will end up in this
session so as you can imagine the
session will grow quite quite big soon
so yeah set a few things too early so
the UI always has a few display and a
navigator if you're using the body
navigator API if you're not you're just
attach the components to it and as I
said everything that is visible to the
user or at least will has a chance to be
ever visible to the user will end up in
the session so if you have a drop-down
with 50,000 elements Bardeen will handle
this quite well for you because it will
just show you I don't know ten ten
elements in a combo box and and allows
to the user to page with it but on the
server side
all those 10,000 to 50,000 elements will
end up in the HTTP session so
when when we started with our
application the session was well
relatively small we just had 700
kilobytes per user nowadays we have
around 3.5 megabytes per user if the
user just uses one browser tab and there
are applications around that have up to
15 megabytes or more as you can imagine
if you have a few thousand users and and
have replication this gets to quite some
amount of network traffic and and and IO
another thing you have to keep in mind
is that Delta replication of sessions is
quite broken right now because the
replication mechanisms of the
application servers are always well
right now they are the developers
thought okay people will will put stuff
into different attributes but wedding
gets puts everything into one single
attribute and if you if your session
gets serialized and PC relies on another
host and you change something in the UI
the user clicks a button or something
wadding just changes this object it got
from the data session and the the
servlet container is basically now a
charge to find out he has this object
even changed or not and this is quite a
broken right now so we managed to
actually get Tomcat and the web GIS
that's first application server to crash
so it's it's quite quite a mess right
now
the Varden guys made some efforts to to
get this working on the Google App
Engine because they are you are you're
only allowed to put about one megabyte
or soap in in the HTTP session and they
made workaround to put it in memcache
they are now working on creating a
pluggable mechanism so you basically can
put into various implementing a strategy
strategies where you want to persist
your session and how it should get
utilized so I hope this will be fixed
quite soon but the rule of samp is to
never to make sure that the session
never really grows that big and to
accomplish this well I have three
recommendations of advices for you the
first recommendation is to create a more
or less stateless app this with Vista
Navigator
with API and it's good practice to
actually use the class-based navigator
because it disposes the object well it
allows to the garbage collector to
collector fuse after they are not on the
users view anymore of course you have to
make sure that you don't have any
reference to it so in our project we're
happy half these steps we have the
problem that the fuse actually never get
really disposed into a state where we
can dispose them because as long as they
are in in as long as that the tap
caption is is still on the user screen
we have to somehow hold that a few for
him so we have a lot of objects that are
bound to the to the user session and
that's the reason why we now have some
scalability problems yeah then we have
us that the second tip recommendation I
can give you is to overwrite the attach
and detach method on your components
because this allows your components to
basically discard data that it doesn't
need so if you have this this formula
this this this form this with the drop
down and the 50,000 entries and this
form doesn't it
isn't attached to any component anymore
you can throw the the values of the
drop-down menu array but keep the rest
of the you of the user state and when
when the users changes back to this form
you have all the use of state and your
chest invoked at each method again and
say ok I know what the user field into
the the input fields but the date of V
we have in this drop-down we now load
again for the database and so you can
prevent all those those strings or
objects or whatever you're using as a
source for your container to be to end
up in the in the session when the the
session gets serialized it will
automatically call the an attached on
every object so if you do this cleanup
method just clean up in in every
unattach you can make sure that no not
well that maybe not every everything you
you put in your form stop downs or
whatever you have get up
ends up in the session ok so step 5
productivity so i now will show you some
some techniques we use to trying to try
to be more productive one of the things
we are using is Chava EE 6 I try to
create a demo of is e 7 but ran into
some issues with this class efficient
maven so there's sorry in no live demo
today but at least I can't fail with
that so we use CDI to to do our
dependency injection and we created
basically some annotations to do
transaction handling for some things we
have each bit in our application and to
make this very smart in there's this
Bardeen CDI community project
unfortunately it has some let's say
let's call it design flaws so we
basically had to re-implement the CDI
module ourselves via Swiss Apache Delta
spike because the current state of the
the version CDI module has some flaws
when it comes to clustering so I'm now
in the process of actually trying to
backport our changes to the official
module Madden has more complicated
process of integrating community
additions so I'm not sure when these
changes will be available in the indie
VAT in CDI module but I met the guys
this week and they're quite nice so I
hope it will be available well at the
end of October they are actually
promoting this the CDI module from alpha
to beta in I think a few weeks so with a
bit of luck we get these changes into
the official module and then it's
hopefully stable so but in the VAT in
CDI module has some helper annotations
and and classes the one of these
annotations is the CDI UI so if you you
don't it button provides of 8 you to
register your your eyes without the need
to to register them in the web.xml it
also allows to map them to various
passes and when you apply this
annotation and invadin creates the UI
for you you can use the add in checked
methods in your eyes and of course you
are able to basically inject every kind
of
opponent we see the eye and use
injection there as well when you're
creating components with CD I always
remember that the constructor may be
invoked a multi multiple times to create
a post construct method and yeah in our
project we now made the decision to only
inject services into our into our
presenters and don't create all kinds of
components we see the eye because well
we thought it would get quite messy
that's also the the possibility to use
CI events in your views we tried that
once and ended up with a huge huge
amount of event classes my my
recommendation is to don't use the CDI
event mechanism to do stuff like okay
the user has submitted the form or the
user clicked on this button because it
gets quite messy really really fast so
you we used the traditional approach
with adding listeners and and that works
quite well for us for some things we we
do use the event mechanism of CDI so
let's say if we have some global state
changes or stuff like reload everything
we have event handlers for that okay
well the plugin of course provides a CDI
a few provider and a UI provider a few
providing your eye provider is the very
button allows you to customize the
creation of you is and fuse if you ever
need to do some customization in these
behaviors just subclass these classes
and register them mister servlet that's
the way to go okay
I created one example where it's
possible to basically use Chaim s and
dividing push module to do kind of a
chat application in the demo I I made
just a button that was in in a few area
and made it at drag-and-drop capable and
then in another browser window I opened
the same view and and basically could
see how the button is moving around so
that's an ahe B it has produced some
methods it's based on a blog post by
Antonio Gonzalez I think most of the of
you know this name
it has no real magic in it but it shows
that you can use CDI this button and
that's basically just creating the
topics and the sessions and stuff like
that so no big magic here but here we
have the the inter more interesting part
to enable pash server-side push on your
application you have to actually
annotate your IVs at push annotation if
your man you manually creating the body
in cell that you have to add this
essence imported supported element to
your servlet configuration it's
especially important as this is using
the servlet featured one mechanism for
asynchronous support that or if you have
servlet filters in in front of your web
application that those are also
answering that those also support
asynchronous e ya and in Java EE 6
there's no really no real support for
our CI and s Inc operations so they fix
this in in e 7 but right now there are
not many application servers you can use
them
you can use a seven and bardeen's push
support is based on the atmosphere
project when I try to create the demo of
this I try to do it this last fish for
unfortunately the atmosphere version
that is used by Vardhan isn't compatible
with the native version using glass
before so the demo didn't work as I
expected
but yeah so if you have a few if you
have to see I extension in your body in
project and your view is created through
CDI you can just in check those topics
and say in session into your view and
use it like this so basically I that's
the the code that gets executed in my
demo that's the cue code that gets
executed then a user enters this this
time of you I created so it basically
just says okay hey the user entered and
that's the current date and publishes it
to Seamus message queue topic and that's
the code basically to update the UI so
in the UI you basically create a
consumer it's that standard Jamie stuff
and the really important part here is
that you have to lock the session with
you get an instant the VAT that's a log
for the VAT in session then you can
actually change the view in a way you
want it and then you have to unlock it
and then you say ok and now push the
changes there's a mode - it doesn't mode
in button where you can specify that the
push should automatically be propagated
with the glass this class before I
couldn't get this to work so it's
probably best if you always
we said okay now push the changes to the
client the budding guys also implemented
a way to basically one than any any
runnable in a way that it works a
synchronous Li and with push I basically
just learned this yesterday or two days
ago so I couldn't update my slides but I
will create a blog post about it
and so you can use this quite easily as
because Java is seven will get used
quite more in the near future I think
there will be additional helper classes
that allow you to bind various Java EE
features with your button application
okay
another productivity enhancer is the JPA
container it basically allows you to
create very fast prototypes of your
application by basically just binding to
your GPA entities it allows for quad
application and and binding whole whole
collections to tables in our project we
were we haven't used it because our
project is based on some external data
model that more or less might always
change and the project leader decided
that we have to use DTO so unfortunately
we we are not able to use this container
but if you're free to choose whatever
you want then you might as well give
this a try ok so additional productivity
enhancers we are using the biggest
enhancers in productivity is well
capable probably who knows cheerio
ok who use it it yet everyday not that
many ok so all the other guys that know
it and don't use it try it out it's
amazing software I don't get paid for
so it's a real honest statement it has
special integration for CAI it has a
special integration for the Verdean cgi
plugin and of course it has a
integration for Tommy that we are using
for development if you happen to have a
very important it comes even bundled
with them so you don't have to spend
additional dollars on the unseeable
another productivity enhancer is the bad
in test bench it's basically a extension
true to selenium they created some
helper methods or basically they they
created their own recorder to allow you
to create test cases and we beefin using
selenium without the test bench in our
project because well our customer
doesn't allow us to to buy a external
software and without this plugin
you really have to mess around this XSLT
non-express yeah and that gets quite
messy so if you're in a position that
you can make a purchase then a test
bench will really help you because it
but in added additional attributes to
their fields that allow for easy testing
and this is a tool that really helps you
with that
yeah what's really cool about this is
that they also included support for
phantom chess so you can run your tests
headless and quite faster than without
with a real browser and because of the
custom hooks dividing guys put into test
bench you also don't get in get into
trouble with any timing issues so in our
project we have a lots of a sweat dot
sleep 1000 and that really is a quite a
pain in the
so yeah if you have the money tank at
one of these licenses and it really pays
off the nice thing is it also has
support for che behave so in our project
we use che behave to allow the customer
to review our test cases we even
localized it for the for the people that
don't understand English actually we are
somehow not even allowed to use English
so we have to use German everywhere and
if you're doing behavior driven
development
che behaviors and Ice Cube so if you
don't have a lot of money or Tomcat is
the thing you really like like we do I
really could recommend Apache Tommy we
are using the Tommy maven plugin for
development and it allows you if you
configure your maven build to include
all those but in dependencies as provide
a child into your tummy then they don't
end up in the web applications web in
flip folder and your application
redeploys really really really fast so
we have redeployment times of below one
second and that's basically just hit
compile in your IDE change the browser
hit f5 and there you have your change so
I myself always like to use it use
charitable but if you don't have access
to charitable Tommy
vistas code is the way you can really
speed up your development since a few
days there's also a commercial company
behind Tommy II it's from a friend of
mine David Blevins who's the project
lead of Tommy and if you're doing
anything this Tomcat I can highly
recommend you to get in touch with him
he's quite a nice guy and and Han knows
few stuff so quick recap
create mock-ups talk with the people
that will be using your application
structure your code as good as you can
do my provided unfold should works quite
well for us keep this seeing scalable
try to keep your session as key as slim
as possible and iterate fast yeah use
cherry values test use test bench use
the tummy maven plug-in
there's nothing worse in my morals than
in my opinion than having to wait 10
minutes to to get the redeployment and
and see a change so these are the tools
that really help you get a fast
iteration yeah of course I haven't
planned this all alone so I want to say
thank you to my colleagues that really
helped me with all this stuff yeah and
that's actually the end of my first
presentation I say thank you for your
for your time
I created the page on my blog that will
contain this presentation I also created
a small form that you can enter your
email address and get updates when I
publish new stuff on Verdean
I will send out an email as soon as I
put out the presentation and I will send
out an email as soon as we got the
changes to the valancy I plug-in
published maybe I will send out an email
when I post some new blocks blog posts
that that covers wedding so if you're
interested in in any of these stuff just
go to this website and and enter your
email there so I hope you're quite happy
with my presentation there was something
new we need for well I hope for everyone
and if you have questions then please
ask them now thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
