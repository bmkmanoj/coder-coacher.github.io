I'm your host Javed Mohammed here in the
outskirts of Tel Aviv and a very first
session here and I have as my guest
today said Simon with Jade rod who is
the co-founder of the RJ fog and chief
architect so welcome and fed you've had
to prison date you have two
presentations one is the keynote and
then you have a DevOps the Greek tragedy
yes both focused on DevOps give us a
just a little trailer into each one what
about the emphasis is so yeah there the
main ID that we are trying to
communicate is basically from all the
experience that we are having with our
customers
Oracle being one of them we are seeing
some trained hands in the DevOps
revolution and the devil's migration and
we like to basically share our vision
and share where we are seeing the the
world heading in terms of DevOps
revolution
I mean it's really really impressive we
we we have to thank all the developer
that worked and code today to make this
revolution of being able to release
weekly and then daily and then to the
hourly some piece of software that used
to take us here who do releases every
year and have a very very painful
process
today's fully automated and and we are
doing this at we are doing this
transformation all over the world and
you can continuous integration
continuous deployment just and maybe I
should have started off with this with
just backing up in a kind of 30 seconds
what does jafer do so jpeg being a great
wonderful article code is a great
sponsor and having a lot of green frogs
all over villages so what our flagship
product which is artifactory is
basically responsible
or managing your binaries and it's a
binary repository manager so it's all
your software quad and beans they the
distribution platform for your software
and software on to put basically
software producer and software consumer
connected to each other and capable of
swallowing the rate at which we are
creating software today if you create a
sort of a piece of software every year
you can take care of it wrap it in a
nice box and make it beautiful and take
the time to ship it to your consumer
when you are doing it how early it has
to be fully automated it has to the pipe
and this is basically the main message
that we have to say that during this
revolution and during this evolution of
there is a lot of hurdle that are coming
our way but one of the main one that we
are facing today is to go from package
delivery system to a pipe connection
system to have a continuous flow of
software between the one that are hiding
it and the one that are consuming it so
in your keynote you gave a very good
example of how we've kind of evolved
from agile or even before agile to the
Toyota manufacturing system of how cars
were made
you only can to share that because I
think any kind of analogy that people
can relate to very well because you
moved from cars in an assembly line to
flying cars you talked a little bit
about that yes so we use the the car
industry and the car analogy a lot and
when we talk about software and software
production and so the history is like in
the car industry that we used to have an
artisanal really artisan approach to the
software building a couple of guy in the
guard
trying to create something no
communication by auto capable of doing
anything but at the end of the day what
they were creating was the one shop in a
nobody else could understand than them
and and it was a creation like a single
car created in a gosh and so yeah today
we are in the speed of automation so we
have a lot of robots a lot of Jenkins a
lot of kids a lot of
automation deployment continuous
deployment a lot of automated testing
tool and things like that that help us
build our software test our software and
validate all those processes
automatically and so instead of creating
software today we spend a lot of time
and energy creating software for all
bots programming robots and developing
the robots that help us create the
software that we write and and so the
next stage and the next evolution in all
this process and by the way so listen
when you're talking about that it
reminds me about the factory of the
future I read somewhere
it said in the future there will be no
humans that work in a factory there will
be all robots and there'll be one human
there'll be one dog and the dogs job is
to make sure that no human interferes
with the factory with roof and this is
what we are building to do when we are
creating is the the Yahoo so SAS former
from Yahoo yeah the great keynote great
sentence when he was talking about
DevOps revolution it's from commit to
prediction without human intervention so
he was writing actually dogs to make
sure that nobody was pushing buttons in
the process between the comet and and
going to production and and so where the
humans are are actually in the
development of robot and the
proclamation of abort and and and making
sure that the robot are doing the job
that they are supposed to do and but
what's going on today is that instead of
a delivering cars that are fully made
fully functional like it was designed
and delivered to the customer what we
are doing today is that we need to
continuously provide a better software
continuously from the software producer
to the consumer
once the car is delivered to the
customer the customer when it's a piece
of software expected to get the news and
all that we heard about the new tire
that giving better speed a new kind of
engine and so we are in this
age of not continuous deployment and
continuous delivery but continuous
updates and the goal here is basically
when you think that the software that
was already delivered and already
running at the customer face and he
needs to be automatically updated and we
are creating robots and automation for
the update process so it needs to run on
the customer of space so we need to
deliver the robots all the way to the
customer itself and so the analogy
breaks down in terms of the car industry
because basically we need to deliver the
car with the robot in the tank that will
be able to update the car whenever there
is a new feature that need to be and I
think in some ways we're already kind of
in the very early stages of that with a
car companies like Tesla letting you
know rather the new features and
enhancements are coming through software
and I'm sure again I don't know whose
quote it is is that all products in the
end will be software so whether we look
at Netflix whether we look at cars it's
an interesting future we were true
anywhere brother
yes software is eating the world totally
true and once you manage to digitalize
and put into 0 and 1 any kind of
software and piece of processes the
amount of connectivity and the amount of
things that you can do in your products
is became kind of limitless ok and this
is also the internet of thing inside
your car once so for example for the
Tesla I had this example that I want my
Tesla to be related to my Fitbit one of
the problem of the Tesla about the Tesla
update is that it's usually happening I
mean when it's happening at the wrong
time it gets very very annoying when
it's happening in the middle of the
night when I'm sleeping I don't care but
so if it was connected to my feedback
the Tesla car will know that I'm awake
and I'm actually at the party or
actually might with my kid playing in
the park and I need to take my Tesla bus
system with a date ok and and this is
exactly the kind of respectful honest
that's exactly the kind of digital
connection capability of software
because we have all the pieces that are
already there by just connecting the the
information between those different
hardware that are providing the data we
have an enhanced experience that was
very very fun and so I would like to get
the next version of my Tesla and my feed
me to be able to communicate to each
other and and not date my car while I'm
awake and it will know that I'm actually
a stick so and and so software is
hitting the world and that's why
consumer also whenever there is I don't
know a new kind of dolls or there is a
ring or there is a new kind of system in
my house I want all my other devices to
be able to talk to it and that this
combinatory connectivity needs and
encode is impossible to give to design
and to predict in advance it has to be
continuously updated we need to be able
to continuously update all our devices
and all our software and all the
connectivity between them and and this
is what we are helping building and
helping doing and so the technical
challenges are the the amount of
software that need to be updated so the
just pure single code of the software
distribution issue and the security
concern at the end of the day I don't
want my security alarm system to be
updated with software that was not
validated by the security alarm company
or whatever or many enemies are
attacking and things like that and we
are seeing it already
IOT devices hacking and things like that
stuff to happen so the security concern
so speed security concern and so for us
what we want to provide the most is
transparency
okay the ability to actually view the
flow of software and view this all the
developer and all the code that was
produced how it flows through it how its
tested how its valid
didn't L which deliver and have the full
visibility on on the flow we are the
pipe company we are the bunch of Falls
we like water and we all type companies
all right
well said I really appreciate you coming
down and sharing both your vision and
the reality of DevOps and the the world
that we live in so thank you and all the
best thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
