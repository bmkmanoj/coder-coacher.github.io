okay well welcome back everybody to to
Oracle OpenWorld and I'm Jim Gore's
Anzio and I'm here with with Eric Sadler
the vice president and technical
director of Oracle labs yep and Thomas
worked hanger
is the senior researcher at or collapse
and we're here to talk about open source
and Gras and DevOps and what happens in
Oracle labs so Eric I want to start off
with you and actually you guys have done
multiple sessions here at the conference
once just give a quick summary of what
you've been talking about so far
all right well they've been for drawl
related sessions at the conference the
folks from Twitter did a talk yesterday
showing their use of girl in production
so all of our political leaders tweets
are going through brawl
which is exciting and or scary well
they're going out very efficiently they
can use you know fewer servers to make
those tweets ago I guess there's there's
more Twitter usage it's being generated
in the new presidential cycle so it's
good to know they aren't having to spend
more cycles on their servers for that so
we also did a talk just now on using
brawl on the cloud for multilingualism
and for the benefits of fast startup and
lower overhead versus other ways to run
code and then you'll have a talk
tomorrow morning more developer oriented
talk that the Thomas is going to be
doing on how to program in a
multilingual environment and taking
advantage of the libraries are available
from any language you want to run
anywhere the girl runs which could be in
the Oracle database in Java hotspot in
my sequel and nginx we run it's an
embeddable engine which i think is a
good to contrast from a lot of other
engines out there
why is brawl so significant I mean I've
been having conversations with some of
the marketing people who are involved in
some of the people who are on the
product side and these conversations are
very interesting is a lot of interest in
it why is this so significant well I
think that you know in the past for
example I mean obviously Oracle database
is one of Oracle's premier products it's
what I started off doing in 1990 when I
first joined Oracle and having a kind of
an open source platform and any open
source platform you want as a way to
extend code in the databases it's really
exciting
we just put the growl embedding in the
Oracle database up on OTN this week and
so you can run stored procedures or
sequel expressions written in JavaScript
and basically build your whole
application in JavaScript one of the
things we're gonna be working on in the
next few months is to be able to
automatically push down javascript code
from mid to your applications and
environments like sequel eyes that kind
of hide you sequel from the JavaScript
programmer will hide from you whether or
not it's running in the database or not
and that's faster when you wanted to
have your code running closer to where
the data is and so I think that's pretty
exciting but it's something that's going
to be pushed out into all of our
products or a number of our products its
embedded as high up as our applications
so one of our SAS applications is called
Oracle policy automation and they're
shipping withdrawal as a way to run
JavaScript as a configuration mechanism
from within like the larger java
application so I think that's excited
and then we're also doing a lot of work
with the java group of course and
embedding Brawl as a more modern way to
compile Java and jvm languages so a part
of this obviously is the fact that it's
open source yes and not just open source
but the open development and taking
contributions from community developers
so can you talk a little bit about that
yeah well so we're on github and we've
been taking contributions from a number
of major players in the industry and so
Intel and arm sorry and Red Hat is
contribute the arm back in else do we
have that's contributing Thomas so we
have Twitter contributing as well
Twitter is actually running crawl yeah
and
we do have Red Hat we have Intel yes
Intel but you also have some open-source
contributors in particular universities
a lot of academics are basing the
research on our grub rot form or also
contributing patches and for us this is
very exciting because we really see
crawl as an ecosystem that will grow
only stronger the more contributors we
get because we scroll it's kind of it's
a technology that is has a
multiplicative effect with the nacho
ecosystem the more languages we can pour
them grow and the more embeddings we can
do is crawl the larger the possible
scenarios are because you can then run
any of the ground based languages in any
of the embeddings and this is really
what what makes this ecosystem so strong
so in terms of the ecosystem this is not
just open-source right we are doing in
terms of Oracle we're doing our
development in the open as well right
right so what you'll see is yeah some of
the stuff that we've done in open source
in the past is kind of a you know oracle
is thinking is generating all the code
and you know there's a periodic kind of
dump of what's happened out into the
community so yeah sure you can use it
what you want but you aren't kind of
seeing kind of the incremental so you
can't have seen the sausage being made
right and so we actually mirror all of
our contributions from our internal repo
out to github and the commitment stages
and everything and so you're really kind
of part of our community and in
particular in the lab since we have so
many people from the academic community
they're coming in and out from there's
dinner when they were doing work as a
student and then they come into an
internship and then maybe they become an
employee at some future point in time
that transition is really easy because
in or outside of the oracle employee
network they can still have access to
you know the core components of rawl and
so this process of doing open
development does this sounds like a
somewhat of a new experience right in
terms of you guys are doing it but not
everyone is doing that so I'm just
wondering what the you know how it's
going it seems to be going well we're
very happy with it I think that it's
easy for us because we have so many
strong interactions
the university's some of the other teams
at Oracle are not as used to you know as
many contributions from the community
and it's kind of getting over that fear
that all are going to check in some
weird code with some security
vulnerabilities and you have to be when
we take code contributions from the
community there is an employee that's
required to you know basically review
the code just like any kind of people
that are kind of managing the source
base in open source one want to make
sure that it meets the Oracle security
standards and it is not like violating
export control rules and things like
that so there's a there's a few minor
check boxes that an employee has to
check off before we pull a contribution
into the main line to keep the Oracle
the process happy that it can be
imported and included in the Oracle
products so is there a distinction
between working with say industry like
the Twitter's and all these other
different companies on this project
versus working it working with people
from universities and academia yeah I
think there is I mean at universities we
often get more experimental type of
contributions because I was like PhD
students they're very excited and do you
want to like push the limit really very
far so there we get often interesting
ideas but often the code also is not so
in such a good shape to be immediately
integrated so it often takes a little
bit more time until we can integrate
some of the contributions whereas from
industry we often get sometimes bug
fixes or where they are used for example
from Twitter when they when they find an
issue they will that that's stopping
them in production they will help us was
that or we get like very good very good
quality code like from internal or Red
Hat ready are interested in supporting
our platform or were they are interested
in making crawl running faster on x86 so
it's definitely very different but I
think we value those types of
contributions very much and it has been
very good for us so far so where do you
see the project in terms of its maturity
I mean it's still pretty new right right
you plan on scaling this I mean you plan
on what's your growth well in terms of
the teams we've really been ramping up
we presented the Larry Ellison last fall
and you know been continuing to grow the
size of the organization his reaction he
was very excited about it and you know
well at the end of the day if the budget
goes up every year and we're hiring more
people and supporting more languages and
and he's excited about it you know that
that's kind of where the rubber meets
the road so so that's very very
encouraging and yeah so I think that
we're starting to get into the point
where people are deploying more real
applications on girls so like you know
we were scoring that we're in the early
days of production applications on girl
I would say so we're working with
partners wherever that phase where if
you have an interesting application
you're having issues to the girl we're
going to spend our time our engineers
time to help you get going and get live
just like when we launched any product
you know we work with a small number of
people that our Oracle partners often
and you know try to help them with any
kind of teething issues or integration
issues and things like that and so we're
we're kind of we're doing that right now
so you definitely want to grow and you
definitely feel you have the ability to
grow significantly more yeah well right
now we want to not just grow we want to
get more applications live on bro so
like that that's where we are we just
like we want to get the you know more
logos to put up on our screen to show
that people are using draw for for real
things when we talk to our whole
customers
I think the the multilingual stuff being
able to run in kind of a performance
competitive JavaScript implementation
that runs all of node and all the rest
of the the JavaScript ecosystem but in
JVM and can run all the Java stuff
that's very exciting and then the other
languages become even more of a plus
okay so I guess the final question is
it's more personal actually I mean I'm
very interested to learn about what
happens in labs
I've worked on product engineering teams
and that has a certain way of doing of
doing development and I'm just wondering
what the distinctions are between a lab
development environment versus a product
development environment well you're
laughing is it was a stupid question
there's no no no and one of the things
that you know of course if you talk to
people in product development the thing
they seem to think is attractive about
the labs is they don't have a breast of
deadlines that maybe they have in a
product team you know we we started
working on bra in 2011 and so those
projects that that are very ambitious
that have a higher level of risk or you
know large scope and a long timeline
those are the kind of projects that we
look for in the labs that you know maybe
are hard to justify if you're in an
organization that kind of has revenue
metrics or a lot of deadline pressure
and things like that I think that
working with academia is another thing
that distinguishes what we do in the
labs all of our projects usually have a
significant academic interaction a lot
of future contributions from from
students as well as you know employees
yeah from an engineer's perspective for
us it's like on the one hand it's like
more interesting type of work sometimes
because we have a longer horizontal for
some of the work and it's more diverse
but it also means some more challenges
because the work can change more quickly
because as we steer our project the
direction can change more quickly
compared to an when you're in the
product group so means more quickly yeah
more quickly because we need to react to
early adopters feedback very fast so
that means we are the type of work you
have to do can change more quickly also
the project itself is longer running the
type of recorded directions we are going
can change more quickly because we are
they're kind of like a little startup
that needs to find its way and how to
get an action product out and I think it
startup word is pivot we got a pivot
right yes exactly
any preference in terms of I mean I'm
you sure you have experience in both
areas but I mean they both have
advantages and disadvantages right they
both have advantages and disadvantages
yeah I mean it I think that the the
challenge and being the labs is that you
are one level removed from the customers
and and what is you know on the roadmap
and so forth so we have to sell to other
you know engineering teams and as a
first step before we selling to the
customers and it's looking me a little
bit more challenging in terms of you
know figuring out what's relevant
are we relevant and you know because
more of our projects are going to not
make it it's a light if they are not
going to be taking the market maybe as
we hope to that's that I think the the
frustrating part but I mean getting
something like we're all out and
starting to get bundled in Oracle
products of super super rewarding and
and you know so we we aren't just gonna
dance with one team you know we dance
with a database guys dance with the Java
guys and we're gonna dance with anyone
at Oracle that's interested in Brawl so
we actually think a lot of our model we
call it open source within Oracle so
even for the stuff that we aren't going
to open source that you know we want to
kind of drive revenue with we make it
available to any team in Oracle that you
know it's got a commercial licensing
strategy and so we want to present you
know promote more sharing within Oracle
across the different lines of businesses
with the kind of things that we do this
the final question is I'm also
interested to hear your opinions on
cloud versus open source I mean those
are two big meta trends but they're not
happening in isolation and can you talk
a little bit about the relationship
between the two well I think that cloud
is a development model so open source is
a development model has a lot of
attractions because you know if you're
taking a dependency on a piece of
technology you want to know there's a
community around there the supporting it
it's not just dependent on one specific
business model to keep people employed
and contributing enhancements and bug
fixes to to the technology so I think
that's one of the things people like
about open source and they you know it's
obviously easier to bug if you can see
what you're digging into and it's easier
just to show your work so I think that's
really one of the things that open
source in the cloud I think that we're
still kind of trying to figure out what
extent people are going to be open cloud
you know what can I run applications on
any cloud provider in a transparent way
there's a movement for that now but on
the other hand you know a lot of open
source stuff like my sequel has been
kind of forked by cloud vendors and with
their contributions not contributed back
and I think my sequel is a kind of a
poster child for a lot of cloud
companies are using it you know with
proprietary Forks so I think that that
the jury is still out there a little bit
on to what extent that customers are
going to insist on cloud neutral API is
to build their applications towards so I
mean I don't think you're gonna get it
you know like a clear concise answer
from anyone none thing anyone knows the
answer or what's gonna happen there
that's one of the reasons why I'm asking
the question because it's sort of so
nebulous and I think we're all working
through the issues that's a very
interesting perspective I mean what the
question ever what are the common
components of a cloud how you deploy the
cloud I mean Oracle certainly had a lot
of announcements this week on on trying
to make cloud neutral development of
reality I mean if the Java have folks
have cement some announcements in that
area and there are something a lot of
small companies that are trying to
provide you know kind of meta a cloud
frameworks and so the Oracle has always
been an open company you know
standards-based companies and so what we
used to call like open standards you
know 20 years ago
now that's move the open source because
sequel is not something that you know
for nuria a database application you're
gonna have 100% interoperability I can't
take a sequel query from Microsoft
sequel server and run it unchanged on
the Oracle database you know the
knowledge you learn you know is
transferable but your code about
probably needs to be you know fixed and
tweaked a little bit to make it work
it's kind of a well-known space database
portability but open source is something
where since there's one reference
implementation everyone's using that
becomes a standard for interoperability
and to make sure that all of our stuff
knows how to work together so wherever
those interoperability and a kind of
abstraction exchange points are I think
that's where you can see open-source
software being the strongest and
wherever that is in the cloud we'll see
a lot more open source okay so I think
we'll wrap that with that so if I'm a
developer I want to get involved in for
all where do I go what do I do
simplest thing is to go to github and
just type in Brawl and you'll find all
our repos there and github issues and so
forth should also pitch you know first
oracle has a community oracle calm and
we have Oracle technology Network and so
all of the all of our stuff is up there
there's actually a more complete set of
binaries you can download on an Oracle
technology Network but you know
certainly in persuading the community
you know the right place to find all the
information sign on get ugly guys thank
you very much for coming appreciate it
thank you and I'm looking at my schedule
here it looks like we're about halfway
through our schedule so tune in for the
next day and a half or so for more
interviews here at Oracle OpenWorld
thanks see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
