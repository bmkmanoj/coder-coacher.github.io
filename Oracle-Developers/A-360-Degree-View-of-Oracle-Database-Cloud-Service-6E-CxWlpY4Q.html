enough after tea break I don't know what
happens after lunch break anyway so my
name is psy psy Ponnuru
currently with the deoxy technology as a
chief technologist in application
transformation space and also I'm a
co-founder and president of volunteer
religious group so how many are part of
the AI o ji here yeah so other guys need
to actually know what it is anyway we'll
talk in the later slides and also or at
least director and a developer champion
so how many of you know about or oklet's
program hmm
lot of work you need to do today okay
that's a twitter field if you want to
tweet something on my that's my twitter
field and McGinn I forgot to ask what
you know what I was deoxy technology all
about it's basically the merger between
HP Enterprise Services and CSC Computer
Science Corporation and you can see the
numbers talks right 170,000 employees
and so we are into multiple places like
you know now I think it's all digital
transformation so we'll talk about what
it is in coming slides but it's DXE
technology I think we are completed on
3rd April it's one year celebrations
also look at my day job so how many or
developers DBS ok I'm just really
interested to see like developers are
coming for that DVCS session which is
database cloud services excellent
so again if you try to understand
because it's a little bit deep slide
here so my job is to basically help
customers to move their applications to
cloud ok so it's not easy right so if
you go to any customer you have a
different applications like Oracle non
Oracle even some customers we have
mainframes like legacy so many things
right it's not easy
so you basically need to assess that
particular happy
patience it takes three months time
depends on the number of applications
and criticality and you know for example
all the systems are you know connected
through so are so many things right so
my job is to create their roadmap and a
business case why they want to move to
cloud and also create a business case
because we need money to move to cloud
convinced their business you know this
is the way you save your cost in next
five years you know but again if you
look at this slide this is called
treatments any applications can be
actually fall under in this buckets you
know for example you know Oracle forms
and reports right we don't have exact
applications up and running in Oracle
cloud so two options you can actually
just rehearsed which is lift and shift
or forklift whatever the terms and the
another option is you know forget about
Oracle forms and reports you refactor
into a Java cloud services okay
so we say you if you do a refactor you
will save a lot of money but if you do
just lift and shift it will be up and
running and you know one day Oracle will
say it's Adi supported Oracle forms and
reports oh so we'll all do all this
adding its crazies or but you know the
thing is we need to be make sure that we
know all the clouds which which cloud is
actually suitable for which applications
all the stuff yeah so if you're really
interested talk to me offline I'm happy
to explain and this is an Oracle e-m-s
program it's a it's something like an
advocacy program I'm sure your
developers and DBAs you write a lot of
blogs and you'll be maybe helping your
community in a different ways right
so if you start doing that so you are
eligible for this program you know for
example you may be writing blocks right
so that way somebody is actually getting
help through some way right and
sometimes you can actually track all the
statistics all the stuff so that's one
way and the second way is speaking like
this conferences not only this like like
this conferences even the small
conferences and also like for example
you may be writing their article in OTN
now it's a Oracle developer community so
there are many things if you are really
interested you are already doing this
part of your
job to let me know we can nominate or
you can actually nominate yourself okay
and there are a lot of advantages I
don't want to spend time because I
really in turn into a race here in 45
minutes I had to compete so much stuff
but yeah so if you're really interested
so two things you can talk to me or you
can talk you can go to developer launch
and there is I think she's here you can
talk to her about or Cleese program and
she can definitely guide you Lori thanks
Lori
yeah so next 45 minutes very basic
agenda before that how many are already
using database cloud services 1 2 3 4 ok
and Oracle cloud yeah oh my god that's
why we got coupons and everyone's badge
so you need to sign up today
and you know by the way you need to sign
up because this is a special code when
you sign up it'll you will get
immediately but if you go to you know
home and you sign up with a different
URL it takes time ok that's a secret I
should not disclose this one but yeah
sign up ok before going to the deep dive
so let us see I think you know again how
many of you know I don't know anything
about cloud only one excellent so we can
have one to one session but coming back
to this cloud right so there are like
there are plenty of services but broadly
it's categorized into three services
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service and sacis means software as a
service right so what is the difference
between these three pillars you can see
that you know the black spots like
managed by you and the white one is
managed by the vendor for example you
sign up for for example BBC s the
database cloud services right that falls
under platform as a service so or at
least responsible for you can look at
this the whole stack only application
data you manage right when it comes to
SAS it's everything is managed by the
cloud vendor for example Oracle right so
here here if you see in SAS you'll get a
lot of advantages because you're you are
actually focusing on your business
you don't care about your admin job
right so that's way you know that's why
and one of the best thing about Oracle
cloud is Oracle cloud is SAS based you
see lot of plenty of SAS based
applications like your financial
management HR management you have all
SAS based only the problem is you need
to accompany with that standard SAS
based you cannot do lot of customization
on it but yeah still you can do depends
on how you want to host yeah so the next
one is I'm just going a little deeper so
we know what it is is pass and SAS now
what is is again it is same as every
vendor but one of the good thing about
Oracle is so there's no pointer here a
bare-metal compute right so all your
critical systems can be actually run on
your bare metal server for example
Oracle actually introduced this concept
called clouded customer you don't
require because normally what happens
you know public cloud people think that
it is not safe I don't want to send my
data so most of the you know government
governance all the stuff so Oracle can
actually send the cloud admission to
your data center and you know Oracle
managed and it is the same cost only
thing is you need to sign up for a
minimum CPU okay I cannot say I want I
want a cloud machine but I'm not I'm
going to use only two CPU that's not
possible right
so that's one of the best option in yes
but I think you know every cloud Wender
provides a similar stuff and also
platform as a service there are plenty
of platform services one of the thing
today we are going to discuss about
database cloud services right and SAS
based again at CM human insight EHR
systems also financial management
financials cloud so many things yeah and
also this is a different way of looking
you can see all this is listed here but
today's I'm going to focus on only this
data management database and DB backup
okay that's under platform as-a-service
okay why should use database in cloud
right so one of the I think most of
developers and DBAs know what is our
most of the time we spend installations
and you know getting the server
so many things and it takes if for
example your server is up on server is
ready with the prerequisites then you go
and install that takes maybe a couple of
hours like two-three hours but if you
look at the whole timeline between your
procurement of server to installation of
database maybe if you are doing very
properly to be a one-week sometimes
three months right so but in cloud it's
it's all driven by UI interface in three
clicks you'll get a database up and
running right within 20 minutes
sometimes it may be 30 minutes and DBS
you know right how difficult to install
Oracle RAC so you here it is just
clicking a button and you'll be Oracle
tracker up and running how difficult to
set up dr system how difficult take
backups
everything is just selecting a box and
you and even you can give it to your
kids they can actually play it yeah so
that's that much simple but ultimately
you need to understand why everything is
that's what we we got autonomous
database right so they're saying
initially we thought there's no human
intervention they said we are losing
jobs but that's not the concept right
our focus should be more on innovation
as a developers you should focus on what
is your business right what your
business is looking how do we drive that
right this you should not depend on
saying that I want these systems
I want these software's need to be
installed so that takes one week team
one week time your innovation is taking
only a couple of first time so we are
shifting that to innovation and we are
losing the admin admin side okay so
there are plenty of advantages self read
a provision complete database cloud
pay-as-you-go you that's one of the
typical example for cloud you know you
just used for that time right especially
useful for in quarter close here and
close that's not possible in on-premise
systems right so you need a more CPU
more compute you can just bump up scale
up and scale down depending on that and
also testing and development you just
basically my company like for example
you come at nine o'clock and you close
your shop development activities at six
o'clock shut down the mission right you
are not charged but in on prime you're
simply you know up and running system is
so many so many things right you're
pooling power so many resources you're
wasting right again this is a another
slide eighty-eight steps if you want to
install database but when it comes to
cloud it is only three steps and these
are the three thing three things you
know just select a couple of options you
know I'm disturbing the screen or it's
very difficult I don't know where to
stand but you know it's a three things
like for example select releases
software edition and database type and
then you are good to go
we'll see that in demo so I'm just
really running I have 34 minutes now and
this is very important slide if somebody
wants to actually if you want to
convince somebody right so you should
talk to this slide so you are here you
can see the value creation and what it
is like you are all ongoing maintenance
cost backup patching hardware everything
is taken care but currently we are
spending that time most of our time is
actually on the open the amber color but
we everything is taken care by cloud
right so that's what we should actually
focus on the innovation side of it so
that's why the 88 steps can be possible
in three steps and also two hours time
can be possible in 20 minutes and again
what happens in behind the scenes you
will see that you know allocate compute
storage provision voice everything is
happening without your knowledge but
this is the even even if you want to
automate you follow the same steps right
I think I should see the screen it's I
cannot see the screen and also like so
again I think we discussed about DBA
patching backup and recovery maximum
security right there is a debate
everybody think that you put your data
in public cloud and then you know you
will be like a lot of security issues
but it is another way right so how many
of you actually I don't know how how
many of you actually connected to your
data centers are they really certified
up-to-date are you are you certified all
the certification what Oracle cloud or
Amazon provides sorry
yeah but I'm saying like HIPAA
certifications all those stuff yeah so
you know that's that's I think you
should think about that right for any
data center we need to be certified on
multiple things like you know HIPAA all
those stuff we never do that how many
are actually applying Oracle patches
security patches we never do that right
it's forget about other things so in
cloud it is must right so that's where
your data is more secure and remotely
you can manage on Prem and cloud in with
a one one single tool like Enterprise
Manager right again this is this is the
way you can get agility cost benefits
and also risk and again if you look at
the options you have standard edition
Enterprise Edition ie high-performance
Enterprise Edition high-performance
Enterprise Edition extreme performance
and you can see what are the options
available with this options ok so for
example if you want to go for like a
mission critical systems you can go for
e extreme performance depending on that
your even compute side changes ok
everything is online you can check you
know how many CPU is actually you'll get
but in demos I'll show you what are the
options available and another good
comparison slides so you have whenever
you go to Oracle cloud you can see these
other options excited Express a database
extreme elastic cloud database bare
metal cloud and exadata
so so depending on your your choice
depending on your business you can
select for example you can see your CPU
ranges between sixteen two hundred I
think this is now increased so depending
on that you can select what options you
need to choose again another way for
example Oracle database accelerate
Express this is perfectly suitable small
medium sized databases and Oracle
database it's actually pay-as-you-go
that's what we are going to talk and
show the demo and also database excited
at cloud services it's more suitable for
mission critical systems online
transaction processing systems so that's
the best one and bare metal you know if
you want to run that
workloads into bare metal and you don't
want anything to be run on
virtualization and also like you know
there are so many ways but this is
nothing this is Oracle slide six Oracle
journeys to cloud for example your data
center right how do you move to public
cloud so like first one is optimized on
Prem databases that's one of the
opportunity and also if you look at so
there are many many use cases right for
example if you want to move your test
and development so the another use case
is eighteen see you want to test your
existing application with 18 see is it
really working or not that's the best
option go to Oracle cloud and you know
deploy 18 see plug plug your application
see how the performance how any impacts
everything is fine then you can upgrade
to 18 see right that's not possible in
non from yeah possible but you need to
wait you know the Oracle strategy
whatever they release their release in
cloud after some time they'll release in
on Prem which takes sometimes six to one
year right so that's one of the best use
case also if you are really starting a
new business new application try to
directly go to Oracle cloud and you can
use it and also transform SAS right you
have plenty of quartz applications
packages bespoke applications running on
your customer I think you should
actually talk to your customer about SAS
based application that will give a lot
of value in terms of you know labor in
terms of maintenance everything you know
if you're really interested I can show
some of the statistics how much we have
saved and also if you look at I don't
know how many of you really look at you
know your customer portfolio right so
there are actually the same application
between you basically bought it from
different vendors you know for example
like a ticketing system right so you
have multiple ticketing systems so this
is the opportunity where you can use
only one ticketing system everybody will
come to that so that way you save a lot
of cost so key consideration moving to
cloud again this is another it will give
you some more ideas what are the
different things is so can I move my
data to cloud yes
you can move your sandboxes and you know
non-production instances so what are the
challenges it's like a capital intensive
time intense you you know for example if
you want to do something you need to
really need a server capacity available
in on-prem but in cloud you can just use
it and close it right so that way you
can say that pay-as-you-go and DB
deployments in 30 minutes and scale up
and scale down right so you have a
performance issue scale up and see your
your your your load is now nobody is
using scale down and again as I
mentioned same example use only that
certain period morning 9 o'clock to 6
o'clock then you shut down so you're not
charged for next two hours okay
again remember whenever you sign up
everything is good and you get a login
you start the database instances up and
running make sure that you shut down
that system otherwise you'll your
credits will go in one day or maybe in a
couple of hours ok so make sure that you
shut down the system whenever you want
you can bring up the system back can I
back up to the cloud I think this is one
of the best example you can do it like
for example you know the I think storage
is very very cheap and cloud right so
you can actually move terabytes of data
which is actually secure forget about
all taking big backups all the stuff I
know when I was in DBA we always take a
tape backup I forgot all the commands
but we never restored we always pray God
you know never give any data a crash or
production crash because we know we
never tested that I think there are some
companies they do all the testing but it
is such a painful process tedious
process but in cloud it just you know
take a backup of that instance and I
want to create the instance from that
backup and easy you know how many of
uses Oracle VM here Oracle VM VirtualBox
yeah you know for example you take a
snapshot like you install something you
take a snapshot that's saved and you
know come back off you did some nasty
work and you want to go back to the
different the snap or snapshot whatever
you say right you can go similarly where
you can take a backups and you can you
can play with that similar way in user
interface here
so again in terms of business you say no
upfront cost
whenever how much data you are taking
backup it depends on you know only that
much you need to pay and it's very very
cheap you can go to the price list and
you know it's less than whatever you you
buy the pendrive it's less than that
amount and create ad astra recovery site
and this is another example you know
your production is on-prem I'm fine
don't move your production but still you
can keep your d our system in cloud you
know that way you can save a lot of
things and also it proves your hybrid
cloud right what is the hybrid cloud
it's actually the integration between
different clouds so here it is public
cloud your on-prem cloud private cloud
so you can play with this so that way
you can you can also support hybrid
cloud model data warehouse where we need
really capacity like you know you know
whenever you run batch jobs you need a
really elastic capacity then you know
you are done your bad job is done
between that time then you can release
that so this is the place you can
actually use it and also business
analytics platform as a service so
that's available from Oracle and you can
use that and begin it's not stopping you
to use that one but you can use any
business analytics but one of the good
thing is Oracle provides everything in
one single cloud it's easy to integrate
easy to talk
well TP can I move my oil TP productions
yes there are so many critical systems
are up and running in clouds especially
in all cloud so you can actually one of
the important thing is fundamentals of
cloud where you can actually scale in
scale up depends on demand right will my
data secure on cloud so that's what I
was talking so you look at there are so
many certificates you know if we go to
Google say that you know Oracle cloud
certificates or Amazon certificates
you'll see plenty of we never understand
what it is even I don't know what is
HIPPA but you'll see like thousand
certifications and we never do that
yes yeah yes so you have a thousand
certification so my point is are you
really doing a ten on you are on your
on-prem data centers no right we never
do even I'm talking about I'm pointing
about how many of you apply Oracle
security patches as a DBA regularly it
depends on the customer again but when I
was working with the I think I can
discuss when I was working with GE so we
do like in a six months time you know
it'll depends on again different
different cost different different
groups inside the GE some of the groups
are like very highest security patches
some groups they don't care right so in
Oracle cloud it is all taken care by
Oracle or BB jobs are really easy here
okay finally so what are these guys
actually benefit as a technical team as
a developer the first box where you can
see faster access to new futures
infrastructure and you know basically I
was actually presented a different topic
in Hyderabad that is modernize your
development experience with dev CS where
you can actually write so normally what
happens if you want a computer system
you talk to your operating system team
but here you're you're you're all they
allocate some quota to you okay when you
log in you can actually spin up your VMs
and you can spin up your VM by just
writing a code right so that is you have
a perfect flexibility and you don't
require to depends on the operating
system theme so that's where you have
all the access and CACI was what they'll
get enhanced business inside
intelligence everything but the business
fast time to get market so what is your
developers main aim whenever you go to
office write the business wants some new
features business wants some
modification business what's something
so how quickly you can actually get them
into production that's your challenge
right so this way because nothing is
stopping at the operations level and
everything is in your hand because as a
developer you can maintain all the
layers from the operating system network
everything in your hand so you can
easily do everything with your hand
without depending on other operating
other operations team show me how it
works right so I was talking all
people may feel that I'm doing Oracle
marketing but how show me how it works
right so so let us quickly go through
the slide then I'll go to the live demo
so when you go to D BCS you'll see the
pink screen like this you know create
instance the next screen it will ask you
like you know on the bottom you can see
on the top you can see the three bullets
that's what I was talking about three
steps and you just provide the instance
name and you can just select you know
software releases you want 18 C 12 C I
think 11 204 I think not sure it is
still there or not but they're going to
D support that very soon and the
standard edition you know as I mention
Express Edition extreme performance high
performance and database types single
instance rack instance or you want this
rack instance with D are all just a
selection of box and say submit and you
know you have some more options where
you need to provide your system system
password and you see there is a in
another section on the left side so
database backup right so here itself you
are saying that I'm my backup should be
go to this particular container so that
it will be done at the time of ancients
creation itself and you have couple of
choices here where you can change the
port numbers and you know character set
all the stuff and say next it will show
the sorry next it will show the summary
but again still we are lazy we don't
want to give all the stuff there is
another pack where you can say click
starts Standard Edition Enterprise
Edition extreme performance you can say
that you know select that particular
option everything will be done in a
single click okay there are people they
want to they don't want to even click 3
clicks but you can do a single click
where you can get everything it's
something like if you go to a hotel
you got a means immediately solved but
if somebody will say I want that that
that that we take 30 minutes right so
for the type of people you have
everything quick starts so yeah so you
can see that you know I spin up one of
the instance yesterday you can see how
many CPU everything in the screen and
and also as I mentioned scale up and
scale down so this is the way okay my
database is actually performing pool and
my CPU is actually touching 80 percent
so I want to split space kale up so you
can just select that
option even the storage you can just put
how much you want and say yes scale
scale up then it'll scale up and your
work is done scaled down done right so
you're only paying for that couple of
hours time and also the snapshot you
know yeah normally we take our man back
up called back up whatnot right so here
it is it will take a snapshot of the
database and you can create the same
database for your development purposes
later and yeah so start and stop is here
you don't require to remember several
commands shut down commands I remember
my DBA days where you know you're
struggling between the shutdown options
you know immediate abort you have to
read multiple times and it's always
confusing it's all gone now it's just UI
interface you can say stop it will stop
which will start start right so what are
the other things you can see that you
know for example when you spin up
instance you need to open some ports
people can actually access through that
ports because for example 1521 you need
to open that port to access from the
tools or from your applications so we'll
talk about security in coming slides but
everything is closed when you create an
instance but you have to open all the
stuff back up patch clone so all backups
are here you can see the timings all the
ID numbers everything is up and running
and any time you can go back if
something happens to your production you
can book go back and restore recover and
these are the security systems like for
example sorry the access access rules
where you can see that you know
everything is in - that means it's all
blocked but you have to open by clicking
on that line symbol yeah so these are
like this is a one dashboard where you
can monitor a couple of instances you
can say that after code even after my
session right I'm going to shut down
that system so that I'll save money
right so you see just an example there's
another system which is actually shut
down but how my all things are up and
running I can just bring bring it back
in minutes create a database from the
clone your clone is available from the
snapshot you can do it click one click
MA
it's like maximum availability
architecture so you can select you know
rack with the data guard everything I
think in our companies we have a
specified DBS for setting up these
things but it's nobody is required now
you can do it yourself so what is coming
with DBS right so there's a big line
that's a DB CS but what is coming a part
of that so you have a monitoring system
right so this is all free stuff coming
when you actually spin up the DB CS
you have databases a monitor I'm sure I
think sometimes sometimes some days
after you really require to go where is
all that log and in all the stuff so you
can actually monitor everything from
this dashboard everything is available
and this is a free stuff not with
Enterprise Manager right so I'll show
you the demo and coming to and this is a
by default whenever you install database
you will get a database Express similar
to your Enterprise Manager where you can
monitor everything performance all the
stuff also application Express is part
of your DB CS now you can if you're a
developer you can start using it it's a
free again you can start building with
epics so let's go to live demo and see
I'm not talking anything wrong here so
let me show you the live demo so this is
a dashboard only thing is you need to
really monitor because every time Oracle
changes because every time before coming
presenting my slides how to really stay
can use new snapshots because the the
way even they that works is actually the
agile agile fashion okay they always
change depending on the demand this all
happens again that depends on your
internet speed right so that's one of
the prerequisites so this is a dashboard
even when you sign up right so you can
actually see there are plenty of
services but we I'm not going to talk
because if I want to talk I need a whole
full day but we only talk about
databases so you can customize
this dashboard dashboard whatever you
like you have a customized dashboards
here but when you go to databases right
and you'll see where you can actually
actually create your databases and see
how many databases are up and running
which did all the database statuses like
state shut down all the stuff so let me
open this so you can see that my there's
a instance actually yesterday I created
for a demo purpose and there is another
instance which is up and running and you
say click on here you can actually go to
the monitoring tool and before that so
as I mentioned there's a quick starts
for lazy DBAs or lazy people where you
can see everything is a here everything
is written you just need to select also
try to see will create one instance and
I'm sure we don't have 20 minutes
sometimes it happens in 15 minutes
sometimes it happens in 30 minutes
you can you can see actually the live
demo of what are the options we need to
select okay so this is a quick and we
don't want to go in this route but let
me go to the normal channel where you
can see that three-step process
trust me this is all internet problem
but if you have in your company I think
we can do it very quickly because I
think most of the guys that we are using
for internet in mobile phones it's all
shared so I say open service console so
I say create instance right so that's
where you start your database where you
say that you know code be a la and
that's all you need and you select and
there is a box here because Oracle
recently last Oracle OpenWorld they
announced doing that you know because
it's such a confusing here is a
different license model in on-prem
different license model so they actually
flexed it saying that you know you can
bring your own license if you are
already having enterprise licenses you
can use it here right so what is
important here is yeah still I see 11g
relates to but I think they're going to
stop in a couple of months
here is agency interesting rights so you
can select 18 C and software edition
again as I mentioned there are four
options you have extreme performance
high performance all those stuff then
then you can actually ask you know I
want a rack instance or a single
instance right so I'll say rack instance
say next yeah this is again it's not
performance with the Oracle database
cloud services it's all internet and so
what happens the next screen okay so
next screen you can see that you know
you should actually provide your
passwords and you know you want it big
backup is initiated at the time of
creation itself so you can select all
those options okay let me meanwhile jump
into this the monitoring tools right so
which is already up and running from the
AI o ug database let me refresh it this
is another challenge right so any
questions in between when it comes up
sorry
yeah saying but again your your your
challenges it's absolutely wrong because
you never see any performance issue
because it's the same mission it's up
and running and you have a privilege to
scale in and scale up right so you don't
face any performance issues definitely
you will face a performance issue in
your on-prem because when it touches 80%
or 90% of the cpu but again cloud is
nothing great it's the two missions one
mission is sitting here the another
mission is sitting there so it's it's
same migration used you know you can use
try transportable table space or
whatever methods we have so Ravello is a
different right so for example what
happens is the rebel owes business case
is something like you know one second
so revenue is for example okay your
dotnet application is up and running you
don't want to actually you know I think
it's very hard to say going to Oracle
cloud spin up our Oracle window as
Windows Mission and installing a dotnet
application instead of that you can put
that into a container and you can move
to the Oracle flower so it's not
impacting anything and most of the
customers like they don't want to touch
their legacy systems it's which is
perfectly working for the business sense
in that case you can just put it in
Ravello then you can move it it says
basically you are moving the whole as a
VM okay so let me switch back to this as
I mentioned the the the DB monitoring is
coming with a free stuff it's a really
difficult without internet I'm like
totally failed show anything
I think you guys can actually switch off
for some time then I can use my
bandwidth I don't know how many are
actually uploading the Facebook or
something you can switch off sometime at
least I'll get something here in this
room so DB database monitoring is coming
up it's very simple that's a username
and Express is coming up create instance
I'm thinking that there is some impact
somebody's actually following my words
somebody actually switched off the Wi-Fi
if you guys increase that I think this
will work so any other questions yes
what's that there are many third-party
providers but from Oracle it's a
standard process that's what I'm talking
to him right so it's the same method
when you yes
so you that's why I'm saying right what
happens when you actually migrate your
database from one system to other other
system what methods you follow you
follow our man back up or in Oh export
DB or import DB on transportable
tablespace all those things yeah
yes definitely yes Oracle is very very
much interested so talk to the product
managers and that thing so that's what
the fight is going on between Oracle and
Microsoft okay something is up here so
code Bangalore and so let me select a
teensy
extreme performance rack say next and
between how something is up and running
here so don't see my password sorry
very very tough Reno's whenever you
create the Oracle passwords you know it
will not allow so much time so always
sale
and so my password and you have the
storage how much you want you can
increase and you know you still lack the
Oh CPU here right the again you need to
understand a little bit about what it is
Oh CPU here so if you look at this one
right it comes with one CPU 7.5 GB when
the next one is goes to 2 CPU it goes to
15 GB right so they follow this some
standards you know everybody follows
this M some standards but again you know
you just blindly you know even if it is
production start with 7.5 and you can
you have a flexibility to scale up and
scale in and you feel that you saved a
20 minutes time in that compute right
instead of just creating and see here
what store 8 I don't want to show
something now so you can say none so I
don't want to take any backup because
it's a development and test instance say
say none and yeah one of the important
thing is how you log in right so you
need some private keys you know that way
it is actually secured one my
conferences deep is yes yeah public key
say enter that way you can actually log
into your boxes you know how you log in
with the public keys right in a putty
session
no it's really hard because without
internet I cannot do anything okay it's
none selected now say next so you're
gonna have a dongle but which is
actually 2 Mbps speed ok so I think at
least my messages hope you understand
different use cases here so what you to
try Oracle flowered with your code right
and make sure that you shut down your
instance once you're done so what you
need to understand as a DBA or developer
so developer so you can actually write
your code with the
infrastructure-as-a-service
sorry I infrastructure as a code you can
just spin up your instances up and
running maybe I think we are not you are
not ready at your organization's where
you know they are still used on Prem
databases and you know our standard
tools but coming to this type of
conferences you have a privilege to have
some free accounts also I'm sure because
as a users group leader I do a lot of
lecture I think this is a technology
shift please come out of your comfort
zones and try different different areas
and I think it's the best you know we we
are restarting our carriers now and you
know who actually runs faster so make
sure to pick up whatever technology you
want and just run right don't delay
everything will change okay so it's
horrible so I think iam right most of
you guys know what is a.m. so it's a
similar similar to that but I want to
show this DB database is a monitor tool
where you can actually see lot of things
like as I showing in PowerPoint
ok so what it is showing is I cannot do
it in a that's correct right I have
selected one CPU and I'm trying to
create a rack so absolutely
1cor so you need to select more so let
me select this one i'm not going to
submit anyway and otherwise all my
credits will burn in one hour because
rack it uses Exadata but if it is a
single instance that's why you remember
four options in my one of the slide it
depends on what business what option you
select depending on that it's it selects
also there are some customers I think
SBI is the first customer in India they
use a clouded clouded customer side
mission which is actually they delivered
Oracle delivered all the accelerator
missions they're using so they don't
have any problem to scale up and scale
down and again you are not owning their
systems right so Oracle whatever amount
you are paying the same amount is
charged to SBI but you can actually play
with your on-prem cloud missions
aussolas or public cloud depending on
your business case so that's why if you
remember my infrastructure as a service
on I think third or fourth slide it's
called fast connect so that's actually
the pipeline between your data center
and the public cloud so that's a fast
connect and also similar to Microsoft
Azure there they use a different words
but again it is a network between your
data centers and
that's what I'm saying you don't feel
anything it's actually running on cloud
or in non Prem because of the network
it's a fast connect and you I think
nobody knows actually you know for
example if you're not aware somebody
implemented cloud you never notice the
difference between the these two systems
it's all connects because of network
bandwidth okay this is somebody but I'm
just running two minutes again you can
see that okay
so again this is my marketing talk so
it's all India users group please we do
the similar events not free events by
the way not like Oracle we are not
really rich but the intention of
creating this users group is to come
share how many of you actually talk to
your new person here today we always I
think try to sit our colleagues but this
is the best place you talked with
different car different people that will
really help in different ways you know
one of the way you can change your jobs
so many things right so one of the thing
is I think how many of you know Andrew
oh my god how many you want to learn
about performance Oracle database
performance that's a market because your
admin stuff is gone you are only need to
focus on performance so we are running
this event in three cities in Bangalore
it is in Crowne Plaza now that name
changed to Oh Tara and these three
people are coming so they are all three
constraints all three people are going
to stand in one stage and all three are
going to present maybe confusing right
so basically they'll say this is the way
I'm going to do the performance the
other guys will say that's not correct
this is the way I'm going to do it so
they will present like that and also you
can bring your awr reports to them and
they will solve live session and also
like this session this is more of a
trapezoid Bangalore and some people
based in Hyderabad it's very easy to
attend but we are going to their cities
with a few speakers you know for example
you know how many you know canard
McDonnell who don't know I think it's
historical comm how many of you know ask
Tom
okay so we don't have Tom kite now so
it's maintained by Kenard and Chris and
Maria and other people so he is our
regular supporter he is coming
there are many or clays directors right
so we'll talk about A's directors in
offline but our clays directors or like
a lot of guys like Haruka and Jonathan
Lewis so many people they come to your
your cities and they will deliver so
please watch out - Oh dev Sierra dot in
that's the place and we charge very
minimum because what happens with if you
if you're not charging and people
actually come like this you know we have
I think 2,800 registrations you see how
many people turn up it's a free event
right that's why we charge finded rupees
and if we give that into in the form of
t-shirt okay so thank you focus on
innovation not an administration okay
forget about all the admin job focus on
innovation and that's my Twitter handle
and this is autonomous database yeah
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
