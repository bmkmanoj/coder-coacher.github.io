micro-services java java ee javascript
in that box and mobile we need cool
demos like this robotic arm gets like an
IOT workshop hands-on labs good speaker
their roots Douglas Crockford ad in the
end about Chris Richards
I'm gonna make it really big let's go
global
all around the world listen Mary Cubs
you you're a most radius and you we're
going to call this we can call developer
world now developers code or a fur coat
horrible code barcode forms of hood
Oracle code
okay so welcome everybody to the Oracle
code London event how you guys doing
good morning come on guys this is good
morning this is how I feel tomorrow okay
it's not even 10:00 a.m. what are we
doing here who work who wakes up before
8:00 a.m. here to go to work I'm so
sorry for you guys so sorry it's London
right it's a great pleasure to be here
it's the first city in Europe well I
mean sorry is the first sitting the
European continent and you're very glad
to be here with these events series
Oracle code it's a new event from Oracle
for developers most of the speakers are
engineers product managers community
speakers all of them developers and
really really happy to bring this to you
guys yep lots of cool technologies talk
about a we've a weird announcement super
now we did have an announcement so on
yesterday at Dhaka Khan we announced our
like flagship products or a code beta
base of logic Java on docker store so
you don't have to download Oracle
database anymore or WebLogic you just go
on your terminal and defy your doctor on
the Oracle database and get downloaded
from the dollar store and you have it
running in just a couple minutes after
the download finishes so one if you want
more information you can go to these
pages order products like my sequel
Oracle Linux the client for the database
and coherence are there so I hope you
like this
I know developers are crazy about docker
and they really want to play with docker
technology and I heard the line like if
it's not on docker I'm not even going to
download it so we put it over there for
you that's good are you finally out of
the business of personally packaging up
all the docker images for us yes
I'm generally later Bruno is the first
person at Oracle publishing docker
images so that's really cool yeah
so I'll be proud of those projects our
github if you want and you suggested it
if you want to take a look at the dock
and fire the source code it'll be there
cousin for the events if you haven't
already download the mobile application
this is the best way to get the agenda
for the event find out what's going on
today and it also has links to the
livestream which we're running as well
as the an extra app for the demos in the
code lounge so if you follow Oracle devs
the Twitter channel we're going to be
doing a live stream downstairs called
Oracle dev live where we'll have
interviews with all the presenters
periscope and we also have a bunch of
technology integration demos with the
Oracle cloud where you can order coffee
or cut stuff out of a CNC cutter right
from your mobile phone it sends the
order to the Oracle cloud and then
downstairs at all you'll get a nice
badge or you know a decent cup of coffee
yeah we also like to thank our sponsors
not only for Oracle code in London but
all of the other 19 cities plus London
so it's really great to see them working
with us
in bringing this event for you so we
like to introduce Adam being our first
keynote speaker thank you go welcome
perfect Seaton asked me I think a few
months ago about keynotes and my answer
was I'm not doing keynotes I'm just a
coda and the only thing I could do we
just live off the slides and code
something for you and he said yes which
was very surprising at the Oracle key
notes
I don't even have these safe harbors
right I'm freelancer so whatever I can
tell you whatever I write it may not
work so this is what I can tell you my
only slight is the HCV serve any
questions tune in Chris man of the month
and this was the last flight so I'm a
little bit cheating because what I did
I opened two browser windows the first
news everything is going the right
direction so Java in would to github so
it is like I think it happened two weeks
ago or 3x3 one week ago okay and it's
not empty for now but I'm already
following them and yeah and seeing what
happens so the first thing you have to
do is to subscribe and follow to Java
stuff why Java is important you will see
in a second so what about the buzz word
so what I'm doing I'm a freelancer
working across Europe mostly in Germany
bigger companies enterprise companies
and helping them to fix problems develop
new apps and I could actually suggest
whatever I I like and I still stick with
javi why I show you in a second on a few
minutes and what I do buzz what these
days I think - buzz words or buzz words
is already a reality micro services and
service I think I get asked over over
again what it is and why it's important
and yeah service or micro services it's
really easy to to understand what it
basically means one process same process
light weight process which communicates
with other processes usually via HTTP so
this is how micro services are defined
if you look at martin polar wikipedia
whatever and of course one team has one
microservice Conway's law and so forth
but from the technological perspective
is like you have one process with one
capability exposed via HTTP
how Fowler defined this and at the same
time Cerberus is a little bit newer and
this is the Wikipedia definition of
surveillance and what surveillance means
is by the way you can ask me questions
if you like
so this through the interactive keynote
so one of the view into ethics
interactive keynote zone and what
serverless means first you don't care
about service but you need service so a
little bit
she's of Renick I would say but and what
it means is you just care about your
business logic and particularly what's
interesting here this is more about the
business model so you don't like to to
care about the scaling and monitoring
the service you just write a static Java
function and invoke from somewhere
so everyone cares about service the
question is why so I keep up questions I
know what is the problem your enterprise
so we have scalability problems or
whatever and it turns out even the
biggest companies in Germany so they run
probably eight application server
clusters 24/7 and they can serve you
know the whole traffic of Germany and
usually you have four or two machines
and I'm also working with Freeland
freelancers producers as well but after
ups and what turns out these startups
they start with one machine and I have
to convince them in order to put AJ
Proctor Ingenix before the service
because with one server they can they
can maintain several thousands
transactions per second
so I mean so if you if you if you think
about scalability my perception is
Netflix Amazon and all the stuff is
different story what do you really find
in usual enterprises and we don't have
described ility is that this scalability
requirement of the web now start and
stop thousands of instances per minute
or per second or Netflix start in the
cloud hope so this is actually the
server list idea behind the surveillance
and of course there is a server let's
frameworks in the clouds already and
from Java perspectives more or less you
expose the gud Java function aesthetic
function and behind the function you can
do whatever we like
so I'm Adam so if you guys have
questions like key said just raise your
hands and
we'll run you a mic so you can ask them
yeah it would be nice if I have no
slides or questions are important all
that way it'll show up on the live
stream you were stretching you do the
question no okay the stream everything
is the same as questions or don't
scratch ask question right so are very
good so now I'm starting with
micro-services so now the question is
why Java is is important so I would
start a little ID doesn't matter I
usually use NetBeans but you can use
IntelliJ or whatever like and this IDE
and it will also use maven
so probably whoo-hoo laughs maybe you
see a three out of three hundred right
or four hundred so um so now change that
so a why maven is nice so what I'm doing
here I want set set up a full-blown
maven project and not the level platform
I have specific folder just for code
it's called junk and hello so this is
going to be a micro service project
let's see whether it arrives here
actually in the junk folder exactly so
Andy hello this is a micro service so
why micro service because and server
let's at the same time so what I mean by
journalist the nice story with Java EE
you only have one library and there is
no other dependencies nothing you have
to care about so actually in all my
project the idea of server list was
always there because we never cared
about the application service the
infrastructure we just focus on the
business logic of course we don't get at
the end of the time one static function
running in the client cloud what we get
is one rest endpoint running in the
cloud but the idea is still there and
this is actually what my clients really
like because there is no infrastructural
change no additional frameworks we can
just keep what we always did just deploy
the application server and a so show you
some more magic so we have here at
simple war a Java app and what we could
do you can say we can create for
instance a comm Oracle probably it's
already a top-level domain Oracle code
right
services hello resource and what I could
do
so this is float remove that so path and
I can say hello and expose JSON objects
and again whatever I do here is already
included in the Java 7 what I'm using is
actually the old Java 8 7 spec 3 years
old we get the new one and don't even
mention it right now it's Java 8 and I
can expose and JSON objects as a message
and say this is a get request return
Jason
create object Bill down that this is the
old staff and say hello London
so now this is the simplest possible
Java 8 7 app so I can build it here but
I don't don't like to use the ID right
now
so I can do it from the command line and
the nice story is it just builds in
about 2 seconds 1 1 second and because
it's mean now the question is you can
say ok Bob you know in our project Java
rebuilds forever half hour 45 minutes
whatever and the problem is no Java the
problem is you know the crucial
dependency here the Java 8 7 dependency
is completely ignored and what
developers are focusing on more on more
and more libraries putting to the war so
you have to deal with more and more
external dependencies and more technical
stuff and less the business logic so
with Java is I could say you can cover
80% of all stuff without any additional
dependency this is actually what
developers really like questions
no one scratches no questions good sign
ok or bedtime actually it's not
challenging enough properly so I'm now
what's interesting here if we look at
the size the hello is 3 K so we can
build the smallest possible Java 8 7
micro service with about 4 kilobytes now
you can ask okay what about the service
and the question and the and the answer
is it actually does not matter why not
so what I will attempt to do right now
is I build the app the first what
happens right now the worries package
unit tests are performed I don't have
unit tests now but they would be
performed and at the same time I'm going
to build a docker executable docker
image and of course what I will need to
do set up docker right so new docker
file and let's say should not matter
because the docker confirm toka Oracle
Conference so let's use white line and
then say copy copy target
hello to the work into
employment Durr so what happens right
now there is an already existing image
it could be glass which payara whatever
it is just super image of the
application server I actually don't care
what do I copy my micro service and I
know because of Nathan it resides in
that in the hello war and I deploy to
deployment there which is predefined so
um let's try that - tea is the tech name
Oh code hello so now it builds
it was it would download this and this
would be towards to slow may even clean
install and don't get built again code
hello
so what happened right now the white
cell was not even available it was not
downloaded from from the docker up it
was my my my personal image it is
available my github account code
Docklands so I have pick up Tommy
I could use a glassfish GlassFish or
WebLogic or whatever and it builds the
whole image in about what 200
milliseconds so now the question is who
cares because the application server are
they big they are not capable to run
into clauses what I hear in my clients
over and over again but the cool story
is we have to look at the images so if I
just say docker images and we look at
the contents of the images lots of
images and be a very very last one 455
make max so what I created hello world
micro servers which half a gig size you
can say okay you are crazy right so why
are doing this and so now take a look
what's inside docker history code hello
so what we see right now that I created
the first layer seven months ago and by
the way I started with dock I think two
years ago and Bruno where is Bruno
he gave me immediately and from Oracle
boon of Argos he was here a feedback for
about the dock images that he was
involved in dhaka from the beginning and
what you see here now the first image
was created seven month ago and this is
basically sent to at seven and this is
200 mix the next layer is Java is 200
mix the next layer is the whole
application server Tony plus is 60 mix
and what I did right now is about minute
ago is 4k
and the cool story is now how to cook
video client right so if you have a
container cloud and by the way the title
of my session is very generic and the
idea is in the upcoming keynotes I would
try to push to the cloud the same image
to show that actually works what you
would do in the cloud you would push the
image one to the cloud and then never
again so I only will have to rebuild my
my base infrastructure my java my
operating system my application server
on each new release or patch but I will
push the fork a 50 times a day and this
is the cool story
so with application servers per accident
what we got a clear separation or strict
separation between infrastructure and
business logic and the business logic is
jut your code and this I would say is
fairly compliant with the idea of
service I just focus on the code not
indeed from the infrastructure so not
it's not that say I cannot just deployed
one Java method but I can push it the
cloud and by the way what I did that
experiment so I pushed worse to the
clouds and the application servers like
GlassFish were capable to run on a half
CPU on AWS four-month so it is actually
there's not a resource Hawkes if you
compare the the RAM overhead it's about
60 to 90 mix of RAM what application
server consumes so ok am what's the deal
here such as well what is the enterprise
Java dot next I don't know what the
future is but this is what I'm doing in
all my clients if I show them how it
actually works they didn't expect such a
thing what people think that we will
have to package the whole application
server over over again and send it
somewhere I cannot send you know 50 half
a gig 10 times a day this doesn't work
but what you get you get a clear
separation between the layers so the
application servers only shipped once by
the way the first proposal from Bruno
was why I'm using central at seven and
not alpine if I use Alpine is smaller
and my answer to Bruno I think one or
two years ago was I don't care what they
small or not because the first layer I
just build it every five week or five
weeks is actually telling you usually
whenever I get a new Center
version or 1/2 version or whatever
version right so it really does not
matter it happens only once per server
and the questions very good question
yeah we need a mic hello
and regarding the size will JDK 9 which
is going to be released will it reduce
it the size the fact you could then you
can make it significant becomes modules
the size should be the train itself you
could shrink what I could do here that
is 455 mix it is bloated like crazy so
what I could do I could just replace to
send to us with Alpine I think then I
can save around 180 max then I could use
different JDK this was the second layer
instead of 200 mix I can shrink it to
let's say let's say I would completely
remove to 200 mix it really does not
matter because I built this JDK image
four weeks ago actually forgot why it
should be older than this and then never
again so what I will save at the end of
the day I would save two hundred Meg's
per machine I mean regardless you know
what you cannot have such business
problems in the project that they cannot
afford 200 megabytes of disk space is
not RAM its disk so what really matters
in my how dr. works all the layers are
read-only and the upper most layer is
changeable so what is what it means the
uppermost layer actually only matters
because it changes frequently whatever
happens below is in your registry any
other questions very good questions
always JDK it will shrink the size and
and and if I would use outlined Linux it
will be also smaller but I don't care
and none of my clients cared ok very
good just a quick question yeah do you
saying your Apache Tomcat deployed in
his leg so this is even even worse is
this a Pecha Tomcat with with Java 6 and
Java 7 plus functionalities the biggest
possible available Tommy yeah so if you
wanted to say
upgrade your Apache Tomcat would you
have to do the whole bill
again then I will have to build how to
organized is it is organized I'm using
an open-source project called Docklands
and what I did here there is actually
this is exactly what reflects most of my
enterprise project my client the
uppermost image is is the operating
system plus Java so if you get a new
better new a new page you will have to
rebuild this and then you can decide you
know what several would like to choose
we can use I don't know we have here all
the WebLogic I still don't know whether
it's current so this is web lodging we
have here they told me I used here so it
downloads Tommy and installs that so to
answer your question I will have to
rebuild this image and my work and in
real real world we have two pipelines
one Jenkins pipeline creates you know
the upper image with the Tommy white why
what WebLogic or whatever it is pushed
to registry and then we develop as in
the jenk in the actual Jenkins pipeline
we pull the native image from the from
the registry and run it over and over
again
50 50 times a day and the cool story is
fetch jars or open jars a lot slower
than this because we only have to build
a few kilobytes so I'm worried of of
course - we restrict - no all external
dependencies so you only are allowed to
use the Java 8 7 dependencies just kind
of surveillance I would say so don't
care about server focus on business
logic agreed very good other questions
the name was I actually forgot the name
it was cold hello as you can see it
started the image which is nice because
that's not always works with so eight
seconds ago though the image was started
so I now deployed a I think was hello
perfect this is also perfect I forgot it
Tommy actually wanted to use the
eyeglass uv5 which is available Java 8
but I forgot to pull the image so the
next time curl except application Jason
and this is her alone so what I did
right now I use stock Mabel the largest
possible Tommy I wanted to use the
largest possible right fly but it would
took too long to download the white clay
once and then create a dock image and
now we could use up from H aprox in
genetics whatever and we would have a
smoke cloud now in reality we have a
docker registry I mentioned several
times so what you would do
let's see so perfect docker run - P five
thousand and five thousand and the
registry B - so what I'm creating a
small registry here o in background - B
is detached so now it runs in background
and what I can do I can say dog attack
code hello localhost 5000 code hello
and what I did I renamed the image and
there is a actually what I did right now
we prepared to use it in the cloud so
now I can push it to whatever client
cloud you have so an Amazon new to BD
repository
I I would also get an Oracle account for
the Oracle containers will be the same
they get an OD and what can do I can now
push docket push that to the cloud and
what you can see the first time takes
forever because all layers have to be
pushed so my operating system you know
the application server the JVM or
whatever but now it's done is even too
slow on my machine so let's do something
else let's go here and say change code a
little bit hello Java EE just a little
change so we build the whole thing take
the whole thing
and cush done and this was the
simulation of the clouds what happened
the register recognized the first image
was changed for K everything remained
the same and this is actually is really
no difference whether you are working on
premise or not what's really interesting
we call it thin Wars the smaller the war
the faster the deployment and the
deployment is really what matters
because the task development cycles is
actually what in enterprise really
counts we don't like to write to wait
and the Jenkins pipeline until you're
twenty thirty max of war are built it
should be fast and immediate questions
of our so does the lifecycle so now what
we learned us we learned that
micro-services means one process exposed
via HTTP endpoint from the technical
point of view so which design
implication it has is really interesting
so what we get for free we can get rid
of all exceptions if you think about
this we don't need actually exceptions
anymore no exceptions hierarchies no
exceptions mapping why the only thing
which matters are HTTP status code right
so the only we don't even know that we
are running Java on the server we only
see the HTTP endpoint so what it
basically means so let's say you would
sometimes when you have to so
exceptional so let's say server less
hello of course someone said the first
thing you need for servlet is service so
so we have several as hello and so we
can inject a thing here
and let's make a little bit faster with
your beats no time to explain why
believe me now it runs faster no kidding
so we have this and exceptional so and I
would like to throw new illegal or
server unstable exception usually you
will design exception which is so it
would look like this
almost extends one-time exception so and
the problem is of course
so the exception will get error 500 so I
would like to skip you know the the
whole pipeline I would get an error 500
with Specter 8 which is not really
compelling so what we do in stats ok who
cares actually about this beautiful
exception what we could do we could
modify the exception a little bit so
instead of doing this we can actually
say extends web application exception
and say this is an application exception
and let's say transaction should be
rolled back but the cool story here is I
can say super and super is always good
but response status I can pick up status
and say they just thought I don't know
let's say conflict of course we can have
a conflict with additional information
with some headers status conflict with
some header reason
built so what I got for free is
exception attic so instead of you know
designing exception then catching in one
place and and trying to transform them
to HTTP status code will actually do
this so there are some no discussion
with architects because now our
exceptions are depending on web
application exception yes but we are a
micro service everything is depending
from jax-rs and and HTTP and JSON so
that's the first simplification with
this trick in Java EE apps we can delete
a lot of code via the whole exception
hierarchies in directions or whatever in
one project they even had exceptions
factories which were used to encapsulate
the creation of of exceptions I asked
them why there was of course no answer
so it is if you if you encounter
something in practice it means have
occult some someone is building
factories without knowing why so we have
this questions ok the next trick and you
have to stop me if the time is over
so then we'll be very last trick and
then we'll have hot stop okay so Jason
epic so what we are what we do let's say
we have a entity hello and the NPD hello
can have some state and now it's always
another question should you use xml jack
speech should you use a binding jackson
whatever to know how to bind a java
class to Jason because everyone expects
expect Jason so I'm a small trick with
it and it works surprisingly well I'm
not still not sure whether there are any
down down side but right now it works
pretty well what I do is the following
so I'm a constructor a constructor with
JSON object
now I can imagine the architects which I
think this like you are crazy you can do
this like why not no answer there's the
answer we can do this
so gasp gasp shriek can't get drink
let's say name and we have one method
without any interface of course
Java interfaces factories are forbidden
this is nothing to do with business
logic and not to string uh-huh
I wanted something similar Jason - Jason
I don't know whether you have here the
same program that's in Germany in
Germany for no reasons develop Allah
videos so we have entities identical
objects are called DT OS and they are
mapped back and forth without obvious
reasons so exactly the same classes back
and forth and for years and everyone is
happy
so I'm waste of time so what what we can
do and this is again Java 7
it's not even said then you were Java 8
we have create object builder add I call
it name and put it this name dot fill
now what I got is a entity which can be
a JP a entity doesn't have to be but it
is able to serialize and deserialize
itself from Jason and the cool story is
I have the complete control over the
JSON format
so I'm not restricted in any annotations
whatever and this is actually what we do
because usually we have to deliver the
Jason and rest endpoints fast for the
react angular or whatever front ends we
cannot you know play with the data bases
binding videos and wait three weeks
until the UI guys see something ok so
this is actually the way to and the JSON
object comes with Java 8 7 and this is
something like a generic video if you
look at this you will see it is a map
with drink and Jason values even somehow
typed because Jason value can also have
specific names but is completely
integrated in the platform so what did
what it means is so we would do here
something like
public please ask questions so you are
quiet a little bit no questions so far
gasps hello or fine hello would be
better you are overwhelmed with the
simply simplicity of java re' right so
this is the usual reaction new hello and
yeah and in this time I would just the
other constructor
and this would be Duke of course and
also same fellow and actually we can
decide hello not hell
so like this and then this will just
return the fine hello to JT and the nice
story is if we had an array of objects
or relation you can use Java 8 lambdas
and very easily map them to a JSON array
for instance so it's really easy to do
this and the response I get what about
refactoring Drago carry texturing is not
a problem at all so if I rename this to
my name you see what happens so the
external format remains the same
so in refactoring safe so this works
well and they say yeah but I have to
know to adhere to bright here add and
get and this is cumbersome but this is
our way less code what you summon the
project doing today invoking geta here
and setter here and d tos and
introducing object methods or dos or
whatever still everyone happy
no questions a question here so far I
will code another method and if you
already just start talking so or asking
save JSON object you can ask me hello
so you made the point at the beginning
that not everyone is Netflix but still
how does it scale if you want to respond
to spikes or something so we perform
stress tests at the beginning of the
project because otherwise I will hear
over and over again Java is too slow so
the first thing would happens the first
task in the or the first one in the
Jenkins pipeline we have a jmeter stress
test to give you this what I am doing
right now so what you can only measure
here is to serve overhead ok we actually
can measure this right so wait a second
curl so what we could do we can let's
see
apache benchmark five clients thousand
times so we get here this is nothing 400
requests per seconds this is very low
ah because of the exception it should be
four thousand around four thousand
transactions per second so i've measured
this running in dhaka running in a
bundle on my machine but usually what
you get per service at least four
thousand transactions per second and so
you don't you don't get millions but
four to seven thousand transactions per
seconds per service what we get and we
you get four or eight service so what
what it means in practice in real-world
applications of its scalability is never
the issue the problem is always a
database so if you think the database
does not scale you know the more
application servers you will start
upfront everyone will meet the back end
and this usually probably causes
problems so I don't know whether they
answer your question but to scale the
application servers what we don't use
anymore as clustering because clustering
was usually a JB remote Inc which is not
used anymore we use H a proxy or nginx
like HTTP load balancing or we have
Hardware load balancers so what were the
scalability issues I mean as extremely
fast and the feedback I get as I have
performed already several interviews
also my block if you are curious just
read but a feedback I get from startups
is it's incredibly fast faster than it's
suspected and a wide should be slow if
you think what happens where the scenes
it's a little bit the reflection of you
dynamic proxies this is what is the
applications of about is the business
logic wrapped with AOP which has
implemented usually with dynamic proxies
this is the overhead of application
service and what's what's really hits
the scalability is locking somewhere IO
waiting file this is the real problems
we have in real world never whether we
use eg B TDI or POJO it was never a
problem
agreed it not we asked did I did I
answer your question very good so I'm
not happy with the numbers here even the
response time 10 milliseconds or
whatever is way too way too high so for
the transactions per second is nothing
but yeah this is this is Tommy it's not
WebLogic obviously right
so any other questions no questions so
what I implement it here
it's just get and post and with the post
I could now do the following
hello and pass the save hello and say
new hello and part the input now um now
what's about all the micro service
patterns so I think we have still
writing it's time I think I hope it's
enough time for sequent breakup so our
circuit break in Java e is built-in and
this is the first question you know what
about these circuit breakers say okay
just implement that so our circuit
breaker is watch one of the oldest
components of java called interceptors
so and what happens behind the scenes
and this is actually java 5 what i'm
showing you right now there's nothing
new what I could do here I get I can ask
what method it is so messed up thanks a
class I see get method so I will know
which method it is and of course what I
could do I can say
or it's passive type so I can just count
arrows right how to do this try
catch
throw exception so I'm withdrawing the
exception and I'm increasing the number
count arrow count increment get so and
now I can say if arrow count get larger
than let's say to return now circuit
breaker after three times per component
the method here won't be invoke anymore
so what you could do you can say you are
now cept or intercept or secret breaker
and this is the intercept course
and class now what it means all methods
are guarded by the sequent breaker and
circuit breaker means usually you have
IO communication with our external
system and this external system can be
unstable so what it also means this
external system only access to once so
we have to change it to singleton and
what it also means or application scope
doesn't matter probably something like
this no locking and what it means right
now this circuit breaker belongs to the
server let's hello and it just gathers
these statistics or in this case just
count the arrows for all methods after
three times the circuit breaker opens
and this method will be never invoke
again
so the question I get in projects at the
beginning of the project yeah what who
closes the circuit breaker again say
okay in enterprise project we cannot do
what we clouds usually happen just like
we try no - who - to invoke the payment
system and it fails I would try to
really know the next next five minutes
and if it doesn't work next week it
doesn't work this way or what I kind of
do I cannot just use this payment
gateway gateway and it doesn't doesn't
work I take the next one
this is complete different scenario what
we usually do on arrow we escalate the
arrow so in this case if the circuit
breaker opens we throw an TD event so
there is built in event convent called
CDI event which basically wakes up the
administrator of whoever and escalate
the error and then the breaker has to be
closed manually so this is the easiest
possible strategy and I was curious and
I was asked you know the audience in
conferences here who uses actually fancy
algorithms for circuit breaker and there
was only one who had two services which
actually didn't matter
the first service service failed then
open the circuit and then redirected it
traffic to the next one so an enterprise
you don't have to be fancy and usually
if there is an algorithm we can easily
implement the algorithm here and what
you can also do easily measure time of
course so if you evoke something and
it's too slow you open the secret as
well
and because it's so easy I implemented
circuit breaker my github account are
two classes and about 2k so why ever
think is so small because no external
libraries are needed whatever we need is
on the application server any questions
no question the next pattern next line
of code just stopped me who watches the
time here in the back end so no one okay
then we have open end then more time no
problem
so the problem is of course is oh was
not that easy right so I'm the problem
is of course the next the next pattern
is called bulkheads and it's also built
in and what bulkheads means in back it
what it back heads means I would like
you know to secure my application to be
overloaded by a to slow external system
so just imagine I would call the first
system the next one the next one and if
the first system is too slow it will you
know pull all the threads allocate all
the threats and the server will stop so
what we get for free in jelly market so
how to do this how it just changes a
little bit suspended I think response
response and what this is this is I
think that Sebastian - no couldn't
explain late late a little bit this is
our way that the the server the browser
would still block for the server part
that's wet and what I get here is a JSON
object so the result here is a JSON so
we just create a method
you
and then I can say we spawned dot
supply async so a computer will complete
their future is Java 8 so not even Java
9 and I can say supply a think this yet
so what happens we build a pipeline and
this method is executed first then then
accept response let's you so now we
build asynchronous pipeline which is
with already built in bulkheads but the
bulkheads are not usable in Java context
because the buckets here is actually
Commons for current pool so we cannot
influence the amount of threads what we
got is concurrency utilities for Java EE
7 also old one was very important one
resource managed execute of service mes
and what I can do what is it is plain
execute or service but can be configured
by the application server we go open for
instance in and in glass vision WebLogic
is a nice admin console in Tommy there
is a text file in y plus xml file so we
have the managed executor service and i
can pass the executor service here and
now what happens is this pipeline is
executed by a thread pool and the thread
pool is managed by the application
server and the amount of threads is
configured by you and you can have as
many thread pose you like and this is by
definition bulkheads no external
framework needed so if we just rebuilt
our app
so we have 7k but it stills most I would
still call it sin war okay so this is
why I don't get the concept that jars
fed Wars or uber jars or whatever I
never got it
I don't get the idea so the smaller the
jar the smaller the war the faster
deployment and the questions I think I
suppose I have two minutes or two
minutes or something
two minutes two minutes for questions
no questions everyone happy I think we
have normal time for the next pattern so
what I can do a little bit more
robustness response time out is nice
today what yeah but don't take this do
then very good I try to avoid the
question so what stateless is it is
actually improving the performance here
why what it means is one threat and this
we will get one instance per threat so
if we get ten incoming threats we get
ten stateless instances and the cool
story is because the injection or end
the instances are going to be reuse
reuse means all the injection happens
only once which which has actually a
very good performance characteristics
and I did it once in a online course and
someone on github called Sam or Lee so
get up if you search for that you will
find a benchmark by him and he couldn't
believe me and then perform some tests
and it turns out the stateless was the
fastest and the status is called eg be
forgotten technology but if you put a
disaster because all the dependency
injection happens only one so did the
performance really does not matter
because this was the slowest
presentation or I ever delivered my
micro service was for on that requests
per second it was never that slow but
usually even in this case one I think
the slowest request was ten milliseconds
was it is ten or eight he usually does
not maintain enterprise if you hit the
database once we have different problems
than 10 milliseconds and what we get on
top of that stateless monitoring and
management all stateless components
application server gathers metrics and
components which are available via rest
and the console and we get this also for
free transactions or public methods are
transactional we also would get for free
this is what at stateless does if you
don't like peddlers you could leave it
off it will run a little bit slower but
you won't see the status i wit happy
very good thank you any other questions
no questions if you don't even if you
want to attend the next keynote I will
do something else in the next keynote
because yeah so you can just follow I
think it is streamed and it's going to
be recorded as well right so you can
watch the keynote afterwards so we see
the whole story later
okay thank you sorry for not having
flights but yeah I'm not about lights so
I hope I hope I answered all your
questions I will be a little bit after
the shows or you can ask me questions
outside so thank you for watching thank
you Adam
so I don't be in you can check his
website err hacks but are you there
right Adam hex that I oh you're going to
you can see what lots of YouTube videos
that he does in an airport is that right
record inside an airport in Java one all
right so on and can you just go to the
next slide please
I forgot my clicker over there so while
Adam will be on reddit tonight a p.m.
London time
it's are the reddit ask me anything
serious so uh not too many people had
questions here right Adam unusual so you
can go anonymously
I'll read it and ask anything okay so
please go and check it out so next line
we're going to have please depart Patil
from Oracle key park you can come so on
the park is from Oracle typical from
Seattle right so D Pakistan CRO he flies
every Monday to San Francisco and then
he goes back on Friday there won lots of
traveling right so I'm back in the
morning
few o'clock okay sorry about that I
already have to go back to San Francisco
like
one hour okay well safe travels I'm sure
thank you all right
please welcome deepak thank you all
right good morning is my mic on can you
hear me the back awesome
good morning everybody thank you and
welcome to the Oracle code event here in
London we really appreciate you making
time to come here and spend the day with
us my name is Deepak Patil I'm a vice
president of engineering in Oracle's
infrastructure platform engineering team
part of my day job I'm responsible for
essentially building various aspects of
our infrastructure as a service platform
working very closely with our customers
or partners our field and and really
help the company build our next
generation cloud platform I've been at
Oracle for about a year and a half now
prior to joining Oracle I was at
Microsoft for 16 years but then I left
the dark side and came out Oracle and
Irene a software developer and engineer
much of my adult life while it Microsoft
I was one of the founding members of
Microsoft Azure and that's where I was
until I joined Oracle so in many ways
are kind of grown up in the cloud over
last decade and today I will be talking
about kind of how you can harness the
power of cloud to write next generation
killer application you know every every
industry and every business in every
industry is going through a generational
transformation around cloud computing
and the way the cloud help is helping
eliminate the themes and boundaries from
innovation for developers it's just been
phenomenal and I've been very fortunate
to contribute to that and watch that up
close and personal so I'm assuming that
that the harnessing the power of cloud
to to build your next generation for
your applications is really front and
center of of most of you since the topic
and
get to it alright so before before we
get into the details let's let's really
understand where we're at in the
evolution of cloud as a default
computing paradigm there are 60 million
x86 servers being run on the planet
today out of the 60 million servers
seven percent of the servers were
shipped to public cloud vendor student
public cloud workloads that essentially
means that seven percent of words
computing workloads are running in
public clouds today so of course there's
a lot of talk about cloud and and and
the momentum around the cloud where it
is also important to understand where
we're at in the general evolution of
cloud as a computing model of course we
all know and at least I believe where
this is going and and how ubiquitous and
how transformational cloud is very fast
becoming nearly year over year the
annual shipment of x86 service is
increasing by about 35 to 45 percent
that essentially means that about five
years from now more than 40% of world
servers will be shipped to public cloud
vendors to run public cloud workloads
but it is also important important to
understand and register where we're at
in that overall evolution by 2020
besides the excess x86 servers there
will be about 50 billion devices on the
planet and those 50 billion devices will
add about 15 trillion dollars of GDP to
the world capital by 2030 so besides the
servers the the entire cloud ecosystem
will encompass all sorts of devices and
it's going to it's in the process of
unlocking unprecedented power for all of
us
there are about 10 million developers
more than a little more than 10 million
developers around the globe and I have
always believed and a lot of people
around me in Oracle I always believe
that that person has a group of people
all of you I've had more impact on the
evolution of what cloud it is cloud is
today than any other person of people so
while the transformation to the cloud is
just getting started it's the best time
ever to be a software developer and I
say that I say that for four reasons
number one is technology democratization
is happening at a faster pace than ever
before back in the Stone Age this is
about three to five years ago
most of the software software standards
data standards architecture software
package software solution decisions were
made either by the office of the CTO or
the IT department now the access to
software and software solutions is
easier and more seamless than ever the
learning curve for new software
technologies is easier and better than
ever and much of the standards and
compliance and data architecture
software standards are already met by
the software that is easily available so
the office of the CTO and the IT
department doesn't make decisions about
what software to use anymore it's the
developers the phenomenal transformation
that has happened over the last few
years
second thing that has happened is is the
significant acceleration of engineering
velocity the three things I believe have
contributed massively to that
acceleration of engineering velocity is
DevOps continuous integration continuous
delivery models and and the advent of
micro services again it all speaks to
the basic premise of really giving
software developers the capability to
focus on the innovation that they are
interested in and taking the seams and
the
the blockers away and and not make them
focus on stuff or shit that they don't
want to focus on I don't want to I hope
that word doesn't go on YouTube
the third elements to just why it's so
awesome to be a software developer is
access to global scale and reach of
software solutions as well as
development teams globally this cloud
again plays a huge role here in terms of
just making this dynamically scalable
infinitely available on-demand instant
global capacity you can decide to build
a solution and plan on provisioning and
deploying and packaging it and going
live in India China Japan and Brazil in
three four hours from now that was
unthinkable unthinkable a few years ago
bandwidth growth in 2012 the global the
total bandwidth consumption availability
was less than 100 terabytes per second
it has increased fivefold since then in
five years and it is expected to
increase fivefold from here in next ten
years
if somebody had asked me what the next
best killer app is going to be about ten
years ago I would have said I don't know
what the next best killer app is going
to be but I know for a fact that the
next best killer app is going to massive
quantities of data from point A to point
B at the most optimal efficient and
performant fashion the just the general
innovation and investments in global
bandwidth
have made that possible and and we see
the fruits of that today and then just
the general models about distributed
development and and and containerized
development and all other things like
social development around github are
again making this global scale and each
easier
sorry and the last thing is social
development just the event of social
development where where the general
embracing of open source technologies
advent and an evolution of things like
github and evolution of development
communities around the world
so Oracle is in the process of going
through a generational transformation
itself and really embracing this this
evolution of development models inside
Oracle we have more than 20,000 people
building cloud platforms our cloud
applications and really making the value
proposition of what we have to offer to
the developer community better every
single day so let's take a few minutes
to really walk through the approach we
are taking to build some of the
foundational components of our cloud
platform our core beliefs and core
approaches based on kind of this this
basic premise that for the cloud we want
to retain what she worked and we really
want to focus on modern developer and
deliver what's needed and that was also
one of the value propositions that kind
of I saw when I came over to Oracle
where we're essentially I and a lot of I
and a lot of people around me thousands
of people around me
essentially had this value proposition
hey you build large-scale cloud
providers cloud platforms over last
decade you learned a lot of lessons you
made a lot of mistakes how about an
opportunity to come over start on a
clean slate and build the first
second-generation cloud platform in the
industry there's a phenomenally
compelling value proposition that kind
of drew me to Oracle and what we are
what we have delivered over the last
several months and and the platform that
I'm going to talk about today is a
result of a lot of vision and a lot of
work that went into that belief and
making that belief happen so the things
on the left-hand side are some other
things that we all we all have come to
expect and assume as the basic kind of
fundamental premises of a cloud platform
you expect pay pay for what you use and
you expect fast just in time
provisioning and you expect yourself
self-service and high scale and all of
those things I mean if your cloud
platform doesn't have these things it's
not a cloud platform but then as as more
modern cloud native enterprise
development has started to happen around
cloud a lot of things on the right hand
side have started to evolve there's this
significant expectation around
uncompromised security and governance
from power platforms there's expectation
around flexibility and meeting the
developers where they're at instead of
locking them in a particular development
model or paradigm there's expectations
around uncompromised performance and I
will talk a bit more about what I mean
by that but we generally think about
performance in three buckets there is
peak performance
there's predictable performance and
there is price performance so creating a
very clear compelling value proposition
around the cloud platform across these
three areas is it has become a newer
expectation and requirement from modern
developers around the cloud platform
none of the cloud providers today have
done a very good job of communicating
creating and communicating the simple
intuitive developer friendly pricing for
cloud platforms so that's another
expectation that the developers have and
last to not believe fairly seamless and
complete integration across the I have a
Fastback so that there is this clarity
around the API layer and policy
architectures and configuration
management mechanics and all the
management options and so on and so
forth so a lot of this belief in terms
of retaining what's worked and what what
our developer partners have come to
expect but then delivering on solved is
newer and and more modern expectations
from cloud platform really went into us
making some core engineering decisions
around our cloud platform and I will
talk about some of those
so it our infrastructure as a service
platform it starts with our regional and
data center design each one of our
region's consists of three completely
fault independent available its domains
you can look at an available you can
look at a data center as a unit of
capacity in an availability domain so
regions essentially so different
geographies provide disaster recovery
and all of these available domains are
connected with nothing but a very fat
pipe they are in different electrical
grids they are on different fault zones
and and really provide when especially
when combined with Oracle's maximum
availability architecture really provide
a phenomenal structure overall to create
higher availability architectures as I
said this availability domains of these
data centers in each region are
connected with nothing but a very very
fat pipe that allows us to assure our
developers less than a millisecond
latency across multiple data centers
within a region so once we essentially
provision and build these these multiple
availability domains in a region
connected by a very very fat pipe the
next step we take is essentially build a
very fast
Caleb of flat predictable and flexible
network that is absolutely not
oversubscribed one of the challenges I
had in my previous life was the capacity
resource in each available domain or
each data center that we always ran out
of was netting was network ports in this
design because of the flatness of the
network we can grow up to a million
ports in each data center each
availability domain another element is
because of the flatness of the network
and because of the size of the pipe we
essentially assure less than 100
microseconds latency from any point a to
a
point B any two hosts within an
availability domain that essentially
means that you can go from a complete
you can go in two or less hops from any
computer note to any storage node or any
two storage nodes I need to compute
nodes so again we build highly available
highly scalable data center architecture
we build a physical network that is fast
predictable flexible the third thing the
third big decision that we have to make
was how do we build and design our
network there is a raging debate
generally in the cloud community about
where you want to put your Iowa's
realization most of the most if not all
of the existing the current more popular
cloud platforms put there Iowa's
realization in the hypervisor we made
significant investments in treating a
network as a platform so what we did was
we took Iowa chill ization out of the
was a hypervisor
and we put that in the network we call
it off box virtualization of the Blanca
liner that essentially means that
everything run it sister Nixon own
private virtual overlay Network what
this allows us to do is it allows us to
abstract the control plane the policy
architecture and mechanism essentially
all the processing and all the
management mechanism for our cloud
platform in the network what that allows
us to do in it when you put it all
together is it allows us to vend be very
powerful bare metal servers nvme storage
engineer systems VMs containers any
middleboxes anything with an IP address
onto this network when you think about
bare metal servers we run no software
Oracle runs no software on these bare
metal hosts you can bring any operating
system any software that you want and
run on this very
powerful bare-metal servers and on the
other end of the spectrum you can
essentially come and do your continued
application deployments on the same
network our general vision is in future
you can bring any IP address and plug
and play in this network and all the
underlying policy mechanics the general
cloudiness of the infrastructure will
remain the same this is an industry
first in terms of just the basic
architecture of the cloud platform you
have everything from bare metals really
powerful a terabyte ram pub bare metal
servers to containers and everything in
between
the general philosophy we have is we
want to give you a completely
software-defined virtual data center in
the cloud that you can look to a
seamless extension of your on-prem data
center and connect either using MPLS or
our IPSec VPN our our fast connector or
a number of such options and really
eliminate seams from your on-premise
data center on your cloud data center
experience so we build really really
highly available geo distributed data
centers as our base foundational
investment then we build a fast
predictable network on top of that then
we take some fundamentally different
decisions around how our virtualization
stack and our network architecture works
and then of course we we we put some
really really powerful machines that you
can use in these data centers as you can
see from the specs these are some of the
most powerful machines available out in
the market screaming fast and and when
you eliminate all the themes from from
Network hops and and and hypervisor
overhead and so on so forth I'll talk
about the i/o performance that you get
on these machines which is unprecedented
in the industry so when you kind of put
it all together the core of Oracle's
kind of infrastructure or service cloud
platform it it starts with essentially
you a very powerful virtual private
overlay network that comes with a range
of options from bare metal servers to
engineer systems to nvme to VM to any
middleboxes if you can bring firewalls
in the future middle whatever you want
to want with an IP address and then you
also have very high performance storage
attached to the same network another
element we made significant investments
in is a we call it Oracle cloud customer
now very few of you if anybody is going
to take everything you got all of your
applications all of your IT systems and
move it to the cloud by Friday very
unlikely so most of you are going to
remain on this this cloud journey you're
all either taking or how taken the cloud
journey are going to take the cloud job
but you're going to stay in that journey
for a while and and there will be many
of you who will be either crazy about
moving to the public cloud right away or
cannot move the public cloud either
because of data sovereignty residency
restrictions performance requirements
integration requirements of so on and so
forth so we take everything that I
described and we put it behind your
firewall and give the same cloudy
experience to you behind your firewall
banished by Oracle through this model of
Oracle cloud that customer Oracle
happens to be the only large-scale cloud
providers that is responsible for the
entire stack I have people writing
software sitting next to people who are
designing the hardware sitting next to
people who are writing the firmware
designing of software-defined networks
we are kind of one throat to choke or
one hand to shake depending on how
happier with Oracle what that has
allowed us to do is we went from concept
to general availability of cloud at
customer in 51 countries in a span of
nine months and we continue to innovate
and iterate of course with the help of
thousands of people who are working on
on making a cloud better
we continue to iterate at a very fast
pace but a public cloud deployed in in
in our global data centers in multiple
availability domains and then your
completely private and secure
instantiation of cloud at customer that
sits behind your firewall but then you
can seamlessly burst onto public cloud
essentially makes for a fairly
comprehensive set of deployment options
for for all the cloud infrastructure for
you now the key areas that we've made
investments in with respect to
differentiator of course security is big
I remember having talked to the
customers many many customers four five
years ago where security was the concern
behind moving to the cloud and security
is fast becoming a reason to move to the
cloud physical isolation of the server
the investments we are making in
auditing and anti-spoofing the
investments we made in how segregated
our network zones are and just the
general design of our network where you
don't we you can trust us but you don't
have to trust us there's a zero trust
and one mint between the cloud provider
and the cloud developer all of those
make for them make make for this
becoming an extremely secure cloud
platform second element is I talked
about performance let's talk about peak
performance as I said you if you put
this service on this super flat and
super fast network and these are some of
the most powerful machines available out
of industry with our dense IO which is
one of our more powerful shapes you get
about 4.2 million for carry die offs and
2.6 million for K right I ops that's
about 10 to 11 10 to 12 times faster
than comparable shapes of compute
capacity available in the market 10 to
12 times
with respect to predictable performance
as I said you don't have to take more
than two hops to go from point A to
point B within an availability domain so
essentially there is no hypervisor
overhead its predictable performance at
scale what are the challenges again I
had in my previous life was the was the
predictability of latency especially at
scale between a compute and a storage
node because more often than not a
compute node sat on a different network
than a storage node that won't happen
with us we will within an availability
domain you will always get less than 100
microsecond latency across I need two
nodes of course availability domains you
will get less than a millisecond latency
across across the nodes and then across
regions of course the we that's where
the the speed of light matters but we
generally assure you of less than 100
milliseconds latency and there's a ton
of stuff you can do with respect to
development and design an architecture
of your applications when you are
assured of latency at scale price
performance I think I talked about peak
performance I talked about predictable
performance it's again very important
for us to make sure that deliver all of
the superior performance at a at a very
very low price the the dense IO shape
that I talked about you get twice the
course twice the memory four times the
storage ten times the I ops at 20% less
cost than a comparable AWS shape but as
as you may have noticed the team are
bigger innovations and bigger focus has
been on network of course as you may
know of all the cloud providers you you
generally get free or very very
inexpensive ingress because everybody
wants you to put the data into the cloud
it's the egress where you get taken for
the trip when you have to take the data
out we are our 87% cheaper in Egrets
than aw
you get first 10 terabytes of egress
free every month and after that we
charge you a penny a gigabyte a month so
our kind of key areas of focus
especially around price are on network
but then again our general-purpose
computers also about 38 percent cheaper
than aw
so of course you get flexibility with
this platform with bare metal servers
you can bring any operating system you
can bring in your hypervisor we have no
Oracle software running on these boxes
but on the same with the same policy
architecture with the same UI and with
the same deployment mechanics and with
the with the same configuration
management mechanism
you also get VMs you get containers you
get engineer systems and the entire
stack for the for the entire scale of
performance requirements another area of
investment for us is this this concept
of compartments where we really kind of
handing the control of policies
resources capacity in the hands of
development teams for management of the
entire entire cloud resources this is
one of our ways essentially of really
addressing the problem of shadow IT so
when you think about our infrastructure
as a service platform and the
integration that is that has happened
across eyes and our paths capabilities
from from database cloud service to so a
cloud service to Java cloud service to
up there cloud service and then all the
all the SAS applications that
essentially have started to take
advantage of the same availability
domain architecture high performance
network high bandwidth network very very
screaming screaming lis fast servers it
makes for a fairly compelling cloud
stack
another element for that is very
important for us is to build an open and
secure cloud platform on on Oracle
marketplace you-you-you have access to
more than 700 plus open source tools and
packages and programming frameworks that
you can use to program on our cloud
platform and this is one actually are
very near and dear to a lot of us
engineering leaders in terms of
continuing to make investments in this I
always believed that multi-cloud is a
fact of life a cloud platform providers
of the world have not made a lot of
investments in really embracing the
realities around multi-cloud I want you
to put everything you got in Oracle
cloud but I also understand that that
may or that may or will not happen you
will want to have options and it is very
likely that you will / you will leverage
multiple clouds so our investments in in
really giving our developers freedom to
program with multiple languages multiple
programming frameworks essentially is is
an and evidence of our commitment to
support whatever you want to do in terms
of multi cloud approach Oracle is making
investments in four areas with respect
to the cloud beyond kind of what I just
talked about
number one is we are as I mentioned
where we have 20,000 plus developers and
engineers making the cloud platform
better on a daily basis we are investing
billions of dollars in in provisioning
data centers provisioning networks and
servers around the globe and it's a
pretty having having been doing this for
for several years now I'm going to
appreciate how daunting this endeavor is
in terms of going to newly essentially
stamping out footprints of your cloud
platform in a new country across the
globe we have plants to grow in in a new
region around the globe every quarter
and an Oracle happens to be one of the
few companies that has the capital and
the you nearing expertise and the global
partnership network to be able to do
that so all of that kind of in some ways
adds up to just the fantastic adoption
and acceleration that we are seeing
across the developer communities as well
as the customers in last year alone we
added more than 5,000 new customers to
our called platform as I mentioned we
have couple of years ago they all of
this I talked about across the eyes has
a stack we had about we had about 12
services we have 70 plus services today
and that that again is is it is a
testimony of the engineering investments
Oracle is making in the cloud we have
customers Oracle product customers in
142 different countries and on the cloud
marketplace you have more than 3000
different cloud applications that you
can use written by essentially 900 plus
different partners for Oracle and that's
another area of investment that that we
are very aggressively making speaking of
partners especially kind of near and
dear to a lot of our developer partners
these are just some of the examples of
the partnerships that we have
established over the last couple three
months alone in the big data and and no
sequel space we we just recently
announced partnerships with cueball and
data stacks and Scylla again going back
to the to the to the realities of multi
cloud where you can you can use the
terraform architecture framework for
cloud orchestration
as well as invest in Vietnam in building
your images we have about week we are
also announced partnerships with about
70 MS fees and a thousand is whist or
last three months so we continue to make
investments and and one of the one of
the histories one of the elements of
Oracle history is the very very strong
base of partners that we have across the
globe so just to underline some of the
investments we are making that space I I
would like to invite Mark Shuttleworth
to the stage Mark's the founder and CEO
of canonical that that builds Ubuntu and
marks a mark and I have fantastic
conversations a couple of times about
the opportunities for the cloud as well
as some of the work that marks company
is doing that unlocks some phenomenal
potential for for some development
opportunities for our for our global
developers so I allowed to invite mark
to the stage and take it away Thank You
Deepak and good morning everybody so I
don't know how many of you actually
really appreciate what Deepak showed you
in describing the heart of the Oracle
infrastructure because bluntly London
isn't a place where that kind of
engineering typically happens right but
what you saw there based on everything I
know about how the Facebook data centers
built how the Google data centers built
Howser is built how yuba and Netflix and
those sorts of amazing amazing tech
centric businesses engineer stuff that
most people never get to see I can tell
you that if you got a big check from a
powerful institution and got told to go
hire the smartest people who really
understand the very cutting edge of all
of that stuff not to squander money but
to deliver real real performance and
resilience you would end up with an
architecture pretty much exactly the way
Deepak described the Oracle cloud
architecture it really does represent
the state-of-the-art in proven
performance and resilience architecture
which is pretty fantastic it's one of
the reasons I'm really excited to be
here
deepak used a key phrase which is that
today is the most exciting time ever to
be a software developer and I think the
reason for that is that it is
increasingly clear to every institution
in the world that the key to their
future growth and success and survival
in some cases is to empower software
developers right you are either working
at a Silicon Valley company that wants
to own a sector whether that's
healthcare or automobiles or finance or
markets or you're working at a company
that is going to be fending off a
Silicon Valley competitor soon right so
the reality is business today is
software-defined and that's why
enterprises are essentially doing
whatever they can to unleash innovation
and so that's really the thing that gets
me out of bed in the morning I have a
great privilege of working with people
who's who define themselves not by what
they preserved effectively of the past
but but by what they created as
potential for the future and so for me
this is really what it's about it's
about enabling people to innovate around
their data right there are really other
than the architecture right and and
d-cap Deepak described here is
first-class infrastructure but they're
very compelling commercial reasons why
there is a center of gravity in the
Oracle ecosystem that will run best on
the Oracle cloud I have no doubt about
that
I think Deepak's commitment that that
ecosystem will also be open and
available to you on other clouds is
exactly right because that's what CIOs
need and want right but they're
compelling reasons to understand why
there'll be a true center of gravity for
commercial enterprise data on the Oracle
cloud so remember that infrastructure
that has that says is common to
everybody right that's not what
differentiates businesses what
differentiates your business from the
next business is the stuff that you
build that's unique to you around that
CRM or that that common enterprise
infrastructure and that's the bit that's
really exciting right what cloud really
is doing is it's about allowing people
to shift responsibility for common
infrastructural things to people who
professionalize that right and do it to
an amazing and amazing way and it lets
you totally focus on the pieces that are
different for you and different for your
business and differentiate your business
but we know that those things has to be
tightly integrated they have you know
there's a center of gravity around your
data your your innovation has to sit
right next to your your your your your
systems of record and so that's where we
see that ecosystem really being
important that's where we see the bun to
being really important you may not know
it but there is now more a bunch of in
production than any other version of
Linux in the world and that's been
achieved really by focusing on the
people who want to derive performance
and drive change and drive the future if
you're hearing about containers and
docker
80% of that is on a bun - if you're
hearing about machine learning 80% of
that is on a bun - if you're hearing
about self-driving cars or AI 80 percent
of that is on a bun - and that's really
what what what we're here to enable one
of the very exciting hot topics today is
containers Deepak
talked about docker an Oracle
infrastructure essentially available
through docker and one of the very
exciting themes in the docker ecosystem
is kubernetes we work with both docker
and Google and one of the things are
excited to do together is to bring the
canonical distribution of communities
which is essentially kubernetes straight
from upstream straight from the Google
community effectively as commodity
infrastructure that is instantly
accessible to you right next to those
systems of record on the on the Oracle
cloud so thank you very much for the
opportunity to speak it's a pleasure to
meet you when I walk through the door
someone came up and said thank you for a
good - I use it every day even though
I'm technically
allowed to and I bet there are a couple
of people who feel that way here today
and I would say this right every major
successful growth initiative in every
company that's been around for more than
ten years started with somebody who did
something that technically they weren't
allowed to do so I'm here for you and
and good luck let's do great stuff
together Thank You Deepak
thank you much it's always a pleasure
and a privilege to hear you talk so I
have a few announcements to make because
this is a very important forum for us
the Oracle developer code series of
events you are the most important
audience um I don't go to a cio
conference and say the same to them you
really are the most important audience
because of whatever I've said so far in
terms of how this group of people is
really shaping the future of cloud which
is a generational force and
transformation for our lifetime so one
of our core areas of focus especially on
the Oracle code event is to continue to
invest in this event where this becomes
the de-facto mechanism for us to share
product updates and innovations share
details of partnerships and really take
the work we are doing to all of you in
person and directly so now increasingly
as we do more of this code code events
you will see a lot of us spend a lot of
time talking about kind of some of this
core platform innovation and partnership
announcements so we we acquired this
company called worker I'm still figuring
out exactly how to pronounce on the
domestic worker last week or couple of
weeks ago thousands of users essentially
create and and and the
the deployment and packaging pipeline
use application deployment packaging
pipelines used by essentially hundreds
of actually millions of deployment and
application pipelines used by thousands
of developers on a daily basis and loud
by developers on a daily basis as
continuous application development gains
in popularity worker is the solution
that a lot of and an option that a lot
of modern developers have started to
guru for their cloud native development
and kind of going back again to driving
innovations kind of horizontally across
the entire stack of is passing stack
that vertically across the entire stack
from data centers to to continue eyes
the applications this is an example of
of the capabilities that we are adding
to the Oracle cloud platform so I'm very
excited to announce and and talk about
the acquisition of worker another thing
that we are not we another partnership
that we recently reached at is our
partnership with Pluralsight Pluralsight
is a global leader in in technical
training and cloud-based curriculums we
have been working with guru site for a
while as an as an Oracle code attendee
you get 10 days of free subscription to
Pluralsight we have a bunch of Oracle
cloud assets and we are continuing to
invest in building courses that that
will be made available on on Pluralsight
and we are continuing to invest in our
partnership with Pluralsight but but
please visit guru site check out some of
the Oracle cloud courses available there
and and we will continue to make
investments in our in our partnership
with Toro site as the de facto vehicle
for for putting cloud cloud based
training material for our platform
investments
so with that I think that's the end of
my talk again thank you very much for
all of you to come here spend the day
with us we have an exciting day planned
for you with a lot of hands-on labs and
a lot of some really cool stuff and some
really fantastic sessions
thank you again mark for for joining me
and the rest of the Oracle team and I
hope you all have a wonderful rest of
the day
Thank you Thank You Deepak so we have
just a couple more information to share
with you it should be working or maybe
not so can you go to the next slide
please and so yes we have this new
website it's been it's been online for a
while
developer or comm we announced at open
world last year we are continually
improving it you can buy hopefully by
the end of this year we're going to have
hundreds of content on each of these
section java javascript devops cloud all
of these topics like pillars of
technologies then most developers use
these days so you know what else was on
this website burner what all of you guys
in the room or actually on the website
as part of the live stream so thank you
for picking the developer website great
with fresh content yeah so um again
we're going to have Adam bian tonight 8
p.m. London time on reddit so I've back
to your questions and on mostly you can
ask all the questions which you didn't
feel comfortable standing up in front
your peers click put them on put them on
reddit you control him he loves it and
for today don't forget to download the
mobile app we also have a survey so you
can provide feedback on each session
daddy a tent and the arena's favorite
part of the day the party is on the
right there just disappear not that
other
yeah I don't I don't like blood No so
6:00 p.m. so stick around sessions to
start at 11:30 a.m. so until then you
can go downstairs in the coat lounge and
you can see all of the demos that we
have for you ping pong with cloud coffee
service clouds cnc cutter we have a
cloud powered racetrack so lots of lots
of cool stuff check it out and also I
mentioned earlier we have the live
interviews downstairs so a bunch of the
speakers will be on livestream
interviews which you can see on that
periscope channel at Oracle devs but you
guys can actually see it in person
downstairs so check out the ohm and you
can have questions not anonymously yeah
okay so less thing so yeah we have we're
going to be burly next week on Monday so
for those watching it's the first
European city that will be hitting just
going back to that okay and then yeah if
you feel like traveling go for it and
finally we're going to throw some
t-shirts selects t-shirt nobody like
very nice they don't like to shake
weight well they're gonna have to like
t-shirts you don't have to like t-shirt
but you have the opportunity to get free
t-shirt so if you go downstairs I'm
going to I'm going to heave a few at a
time so hopefully okay there we go so
one guy got T so or attribution
algorithm 2015 here okay and though go
downstairs you can get a cloud trial you
can knock a let cloud trial but you will
get a free t-shirt I'm sorry sorry it's
a soft why we're not throwing out 300
t-shirts yeah no I'll do a less lawn
over there I hope I don't hit the camera
guy okay someone like I don't want you
t-shirt okay
it was team right yeah it was him
alright saw you touching thank you guys
very much for joining the Oracle Cokie
nuts we hope you enjoy the rest of the
day today and thank you for coming to
the London Oracle code event thank you
Mike
