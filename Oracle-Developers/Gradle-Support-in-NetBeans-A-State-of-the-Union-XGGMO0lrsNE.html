netbeans State of the Union talk here at
Jalan 2016 we are from our best defense
in space doing a little space business
stuff and just to get in short
introduction yeah I'm long-standing
community member here for for java i'm
running in java user group then paying
member of the NetBeans dream team for
quite some time ma dukes choice award
like 2009 part of the java on content
committee so a lot of things going on
here for me and I my colleague marcin I
was working with me as part of my team
at the jags well it's part of the dream
team as well I we both got a associate
membership with JCP for the new JCP
membership things that are quite easy to
get to so we'll take you a bit through
the grade of things and netbeans so we i
we structured this talk into two major
parts one part is about the integration
of greater support inside NetBeans so
you can you you can build Gradle project
in sign up beans and the other part is
like building things for netbeans with
Gradle so building NetBeans extensions
plugins using Radel and a special Gradle
plug-in so first part the NetBeans
Gradle project plug-in that's done not
by me or by us it's done by atila
killerman and they were just helping out
and they trying to be loud about it and
so a big shout out to to a tiller for
its great work doing this so follow the
link to get always the latest and
greatest information about this at
github so the necrons Gradle plug-in is
about the project integration so it's
like you have maven projects or and
projects and that means now you have
Gradle projects and app beans
it's based on detection of the build
Gradle file so you don't need to run
like Bridal create netbeans project from
the command line first you just say you
just clone your your gate open up this
is a folder in netbeans and you're good
to go so everything else is done during
run time so no extra configuration
necessary it detects app projects so
it's not just like it's only taking the
major project now seeking the complete
sap project structure so multi-project
support is there as well it shows all
relevant configuration information so
for Gradle you have the possibility to
configure things in your home directory
yep all those settings Gradle files you
got the additional initialization files
for Gradle sitting in the energy in your
home directory or a global directory or
whatever and they are all picked up so I
showed in a moment in a and a demo they
all picked up so you can see all the
things that are part of your built chain
in the end yeah settings Gradle build
Grail integrales so all this picked up
yeah you get all tasks that are
discoverable in the full file as a
context menu so you can trigger them
everything from the UI so that's quite
quite comfortable and I yeah so if you
have got special a build support inside
your project not as a flagon but I say
by source it's detected as well and it's
a bill is to say like it's integrated as
a special sub-project as well so it can
open it and they edit it as well okay so
before we go there we just hop over and
look at a at the project structure so
what we have on the left hand side if
you can see I'm eight might make it a
bit bitter bigger so you can see this is
the
project the NetBeans Gradle project
there's insignificance great project you
see two sub-project the plugin and the
supporting model jar file thing and you
got the build script things there you
see we have got special boot support so
this is the source version of the of the
tooling to build NetBeans plugins using
Gradle that's part two of the story and
you can see we got settings and Bill
cradle discovered and discovered it in a
cradle from that pins home so you can
see and we can open up those kind of
thing it now can give you the overview
again so you see there are a lot of red
squiggly lines there because the parser
is unhappy because it does not know
about all things but we'll get to that
later on we get out yet before before I
forget just get back in here and you can
see you got all the tasks all the task
list did you can create custom tasks
maybe things that are not directly
visible because they're generated
dynamically so you can add them to the
build as well and call them so this is
quite quite handy alright so what's more
about it yeah we get gratified support
you just saw this in there and the demo
already so it's detecting cradle as a
mime type it's registering the groovy
support from NetBeans for opening it so
you got the groovy editor integration
for this and all the language support
that is there yeah you can have a lot of
preferences configure it so it's a
that's a global configuration and that's
a project configuration where you can
tell the the project which version do
you want of Grails or if you prefer the
greater w integration you can configure
the the naming of the project so it just
picks up the name that's originally
picked from the Gradle file but
can have different names like you can
collect prefix the folder names so if
you got SAP projects you don't have to
be like full qualified names and all
your sub projects and you still see and
the flattery correct structure and the
project tree where all the differences
are okay yeah so there's a special thing
so NetBeans knows about things like
build actions or compile actions and you
can't connect those two a special tasks
in your and your Gradle build the
default mapping is already there so if
you have something that's customized you
can add this as well and you're good to
go so this is quite flexible there's
similar likely the answer for it in and
netbeans yeah and we got defaults for
all those configuration things so you're
running out of the box you don't touch
anything it's working out of the box I
think the mayor major thing you probably
need to configure is a default Gradle
just in case gray w so working for you
so if you're an environment that's maybe
not so good connected you may probably
said okay my Gradle is sitting there
like this folder Gradle to drop 14 or
three dot one and you can pick it so
let's have a look at this thing's so
what we have here is the properties
maybe maybe zooming in the pit see can
make this a bit smaller
zoom in further for better reading back
so you can see can can select source
file encoding you can set the great at
home and you always see on the right
hand side you see this inherit so this
is inheritance from the default
configuration and they and the IDE so if
you would say okay now I want to have
something different well yeah so just a
hit this and say okay I'm going to
change this and you might say okay give
me to 13 or whatever so fix your fixer
paths you have a which platform we want
to use so which java home netbeans would
be using for the Gradle build the target
platform so do you have eight source
level or when I have mine solve level
may be here if you're already so what
and some additional in scripts just to
apply so a lot of things you can see the
those built in task I was talking about
that netbeans nails about and you can
map them to to the tasks from the build
you can you find custom to ask you can
define tar custom variables to be passed
so license header is say if you create
new source files license that is
automatically applied that's available
for for other projects as well you got
the the appearance that was about the
project naming so if you if you want to
have a special naming for your projects
and the and the tree you can select of
one of those so you can still figure out
even if you get like generic sub-project
names you can still prefix them with a
folder so you still can figure out which
one of their projects listed is which
quite handy sometimes alright and you
get formatting configuration but let's
say like D for the NetBeans
alright so and yeah so we could could
have a look let's see I can get there
and you see on the miscellaneous you're
good Gradle and this is say in principle
the same story as well you can configure
work well the default Gradle is picked
from you can select which is the default
platform you can configure something
about Gradle demon how scripting is done
how parsing is loaded so so a couple of
things and the default can be configured
it's quite quite extensive something
about debuggers the appearance again and
some some other small things all right
good
okay do them something no think look at
this let's go through this a quick
and go ahead all this I think I I know I
missed one thing original the next page
okay yeah we get advanced features so
those are all those basic things that
you expect to work in an ID so they are
all there you get run and debug so that
might be basic as well not so advanced
but a bit advanced sometimes just result
integration so if you're running unit
you have you have unit tests defined in
your greater project you see them
graphically up as a result and can
browse them this works for j unit for
spark for for testing g so everything is
picked up and looks like a ju and output
that works you guys support for code
coverage so code coverage results if
you're if you're collecting them in your
test builds or you're testing your
builds then you can visualize them on
the IDE we'll have a look at this it at
the moment one of the more interesting
or from a from a developer SPECT is very
interesting things as you can extend
that plug-in as well so all this is like
SE java SE projects so if you're looking
for for web for enterprise things you
probably more you want to see your your
web pages in a special folder so all
this structures we are we already used
from maven and not all of them are just
played by default but there's an
additional plugin we'll talk about in a
minute that starts to to add those
things especially for for web projects
so you can can do those extensions for
yourself as well yeah showing different
different roles as well and one thing I
learned was just today from former
colleague wisdom there's a nice feature
of a refactoring and a safeway code in
the IDE it's called jackpot it's a two
lengths available for very long and it
works all the box for all the projects
and humor that works for bright so
that's that's very nice so
we can have a look at them as well so
let me see where we are ik i think this
one got tests so let's just run the
tests
so not all tests agreement doesn't
matter it's good for a demo and you see
on the lower hand the resulting output
and you can just browse through this
navigate look at the problem things you
can filter out so the very very default
views from netbeans they just work now
that we have this we should be able to
look at the code coverage let's see if
it works show the report I see let's say
something I have beforehand but I'm not
quite sure why let's see probably we
should run see you on the test reporting
and now which were again
yeah there you are so you see there are
a lot of things not covered by testing
so they are they are up at the top and
green ones are further down so this view
is probably known for all the maven
users already so this works for maven
projects well on the IDE and we just
adopted it to to work for great as well
and if you're in know if you can yeah so
you can even see the coverage like green
is covered in red is not covered by
tests and you can get rid of this a by
just clearing everything and
everything's good again good so this was
a code coverage and the test integration
so yeah we were talking about the but I
need another project for this one so see
so we did I'm not sure if I still have
it here yeah okay so there's a further
say manual or automatic refactoring but
Manuel you find there is this jackpot
thing that special talk about jack port
I think it's tomorrow it's done by a
machinist amento from Brazil and you're
just defining a file a special place and
you're telling it okay so wherever you
see at it in this case java xw srs core
application replace it with
java.util.list and it shows up as a hint
and this works so if i'm going here
and you see I got that application here
i end up with the hint and up the end
let's see rewrite your java.util.list
certify if i go here and i change it to
let's say map save it go back it says we
could do map so there's a a really nice
feature and there's way more you can do
with this jackpot thing and the
interesting for me thing for me was it
was just working a little box so the
project infrastructure from NetBeans was
taking care of hooking all those things
together and we're just providing the
correct hooks and you're good to go so
very nice very nice thing like alright
so let's see take it from here okay so
one of the major pain points or problems
is Gradle is groovy that's a good thing
first it's a good thing so you get major
features for editing greater files by
just using groovy support you got syntax
highlighting I get killed folding you
got hints for fixing things I get code
completion but well not all those things
work is expected one thing is crucial
for netbeans is not complete so just
difficult thing so co completion there
are things that work things that don't
work support for trades at the moment is
missing it's maybe not so critical great
little but it's a it's a big thing and
the guru part we got a good further
things that don't work
so groovy is dynamically typed that's
one of the advantages you have on your
build.gradle files there are not so many
many statically things in there so just
just write it out ideas i was looking
like very nice but the type information
is say is a complex beast and for a good
cup completion you need to do more type
insurance than you typically do free or
you typically get four for free in a
statically typed language and I yeah and
especially more guessing so you have to
look around and try to figure out what
may this be and what may not be greater
files are groovy script so no class is
defined but just as thing by the scenes
and there is no real support for a
groovy scripts using dsl's so there are
groovy scripts but as you start using
all those TCL advanced features the
groovy is supporting the IDE shows you
for example red squiggly lines this is
all because of a things we need to fix
so we need to fix code completion so
it's really nice to use one thing you
would expect is if you have a type and
you'd give you a call a method on it and
then you don't press start and you use
completion again you expect to get a
completion well that's broken in their
pins at the moment if you're if you're
having some some type could figured say
you get a variable def a equals a string
and you expect the ID to figure out well
yeah a is a string without putting it
explicitly so yeah you have to fix this
support for trades we talked about this
journey keyboard completion so for
traits is one of the things you need
templates we still need to do it now we
need support for dsl so the major thing
is up to now the groovy support books
works in wage is figuring out how the
mime type of the file that you have open
that's groovy and then we apply the
groovy thing and you can extend all the
features by by adding new completion
providers and whatever so but they are
all applied to the same context so they
are all available if the system things
this file is a groovy file so if you
have just normal groovy file all your
completion things that would be
integrated because you want to have the
dsl like right or supported yeah you
have to either write the support in a
way that's figuring out are now that's
not a greater file even though they are
calling me or you have to from the
beginning say okay i'm figuring out the
mime type the real mind top of this
object is Gradle and for greater support
there's a special completion provider
register that's giving me support foot
for the greater the yourself and not
only for four groovy things so what we
started was to to add those things and
you get my plight base and hands with a
modification so for completion half of
default imports that's quite quite quite
quite a important the next thing is a
there's the thing that's called compiler
configuration in groovy that allows you
to to do magic things so the script
looks even more dsl like so you're
declaring the following list of 100
packages is this default reported so you
have don't write any import it more and
imports anymore so this is a one thing
that great loss very extensively next
thing is all Gradle scripts are our
inherited not from the default script
from groovy but from an enhanced script
close the editor does not know this so
you have to tell them so you need the
company's this a mime type based thing
as well for this so I think the good
thing is if once you get this dsl aware
enhancements in the IDE is way more easy
to provide dsl enhancements from plugins
like the greater support ok I was
talking about the script class already
and the default imports yeah so yeah and
there yeah and the big thing in the room
is then a ste transformations I think
Grail itself is not using it but other
dsl's like Spock they use it the
difficult thing would be to pick up that
is a Spock file sparse buck is a unit
testing framework written in groovy so
very good thing so if you're interested
in groovy stuff and a good unit testing
I can recommend checking out Spock and
Spock is a mess of iht transformation
behind the scenes so it may be
interesting to to somehow integrate this
as well so the st information is say is
picked up in a good way maybe in Spock
that's not a problem because the ast
transmissions part of the classpath not
the compiler configuration but um yeah
so that's the story yeah I one thing
that I figured out was make sure that
you have the classes available you want
to use so deposit is running on the
positives your so if the parser goes
over the source file he's looking for
four types in the classpath and if
you're using the code completion same
thing as well so it completes things
that are available from the classpath so
the Gradle build file is not part of
your project classpath system because
the class part for your project is for
your source code and not for your build
file so you have to make sure that the
bill gratify sees another class path
that has the greater files the Grail jar
files but it'll call whatever this whole
bunch of files that are there on the
classpath so on once you have this
and now we can do a before and after
again so let's see this is so you see
this like before you see all the red
lines so it does she IDE does not know
about the that a plugin is a Gradle
Gradle class so it sees some in the JDK
somewhere a class plugin from the WebKit
and things okay you could import this
and then maybe the red squiggly line
goes away know there's a default import
for the plug in class but that's part of
the configuration for the dsl for
compiler so same thing here he's not
aware that there's grail available and
same thing here so a lot of things that
are not just not available because the
configuration of the environment for the
passer it's just not complete so and now
same thing with new code that's not yet
available so it would probably will not
make it into eight dot to from NetBeans
but I'm quite confident we can get it
into the next version or an update you
see no red line anymore so it even it
even allows for completing completing
this
so it knows about the classes that are
available and as there's Gradle
available and I was like great exception
is available something it probably is
often part of your dynamic project
configuration scripting thing so
catching it or throwing it and I na and
a custom code line just in your greater
file and you always got this red line
now that works now so you see even a
things like a code completion inside
here it's not working quite nice there
are still some hiccups and thinks we're
still to have a figure out but I the
main problem so you can even see here
and that's part of the inheritance from
the base script that's used things like
apply our list is listed and let me give
somewhere else maybe here just trying to
up system works now so oh ok he thinks
we are here for an effort type
all the methods that are available over
the the project the integrated project
thing they are available as well so
everything that's mapped onto the onto
the outer world of the script it's just
showing up in the completion if you have
the right at the right position in the
script where this is usable something is
a quite good enhancement compared to
what we had before the other thing i
want to show is c so i got this a small
groovy file here just a normal GUI file
and just get rid of all this so we were
talking about a things like this
and now I'll think about you have a
method method and you would say complete
oh yeah and that works it picks it up
and if you do
that even picks up the continuation of
this so the the the challenge is as long
as you don't have static typing
activated in groovy everything you get
and the the parser is object object and
meter class protocols things so you
really have to look at things where you
know the concrete type like em in this
example and then you can go there and
say okay so what methods are known on em
let match this name and then you look at
the parameters and count like okay so
how many parameters and you try to
figure to match the method and once
you've found the method and you get the
method and it has a return type and you
can use the return type completion on
the next dot so if you're chaining this
like end times you always start for the
completion you always start on the left
to figure out the type from the last
method it's just because the part of
things everything is object and I think
this is from a groovy point of view
that's fine just from a completion point
of view this is like not very friendly
but um so this is a really good
enhancement I think that even works I a
few that was the next next thing even
this worse well it was J yeah you again
you have again to figure out the type of
a to figure out which method is called
if it's overloaded with different types
you have to figure out which one this is
so and there are a lot of more things if
you would be doing things like this I'm
pretty sure I didn't fix this yet so now
you get a binary expression and you have
to figure out the result of the binary
expression so what's the type of spring
+ string okay that should be string
right you should yeah you have to
provide this so a lot of fun so it's
like a going down the rabbit hole very
deep bellow finally getting this right
okay so um are we doing a time that's
about okay so let me get back to the
slides think we looked at this yeah we
saw all the default imports and they
think I think yeah let's let's let's
talk shot about this when that means
greater Joey plugin that's the I think
at the moment the only plugin that is
using the extension mechanism has
provided by the Gradle plug-in so the
the problem or the challenge of doing
this is sometimes for a providing better
integration and the IDE for special
project types for special advanced
features you need more dependencies so
for a great early plug-in you probably
need to access Jack Suresh things or web
integration or deploy to an application
server and and there are methods and
there are there there are hooks in the
IDE that provide all this but you have
to hook them to the to the to the to the
project so you don't want this as a
default dependency and your default
Gradle plug-in else you just can use the
Gradle plug-in if the Holy East huge is
a part of your ID and if you just want
to use small IDE well you're probably
better off when everything is to say
separate from each other so the the
Gradle plug-in is a starting point it's
not very very big at the moment but it
shows how it can be done so how this can
be used and I was trying to enhance it
by showing the jax-rs resources I have
but there seems to be a kind of kind of
hiccup with the updating of the tree so
the node is not showing up so I see it
is there you can see in the debugger
it's coming but now we still have to
figure out why it's not displayed but
you can you can do this
let's see what the cradle he plug and
provides it's a project extension yeah
that's I support for displaying souls
main web app as a note directly in the
project tree and I think this is nearly
the most of it so we can just go and
have a look I think let's see so that
process is so we got here this small
project and if i'm going back to this
build script you see I've applied the
war plugin and the greyle plugin is
looking for ah is there a war plugin
applied to the project then I'm active
and I'm supplying all the things that I
know for this project if not I'm just
quiet and do nothing so that's quite
quite interested quite quick its
mechanism so you see here is the web
pages node where you see all things that
are beneath the sauce main web app
folder in Europe in your source tree as
you would always have to go to the files
view inside the IDE but yeah you just
want to have it where it is and what I
try it was to have a did another another
folder where all the jacks test results
are listed as zero you're so show you
what I'm going to try looking here you
see there's this restful webservices
node and it's showing all the a very
short very very concise way what you
have a say rest endpoints defined and
you can just click and up there and all
this is generic this works as I like
back-end servers in the IDE you just
have to make sure that this node is
showing up and this proved to be more
difficult than expected ok good so
we got through this we get all the nice
demo parts so I think now it's a over to
marching for the second part of the
presentation so any questions so far to
what you've seen interest a feature
requests feel free to to ask or as later
on so whichever way you like okay so we
take it first from parting them oh ok
sorry for that hmm so over these second
part on on what can be done inside
cradle for netbeans especially as first
part the Gradle napping and netbeans
module plugin reading oh god I yeah I
ridhima has against a very good plugin
which allows the creation of yeah yeah
sorry which allows the creation of
NetBeans modules from
great boots there's some configuration
to do that needs to be done and those
those configurations allow you to convey
I inside a napping nvm extensions of the
greater project and there's a few things
that can be cooler can figure there
which every NetBeans module needs which
is which are in netbeans module the
possibly a install a class that has to
be run when the module is installed and
the IDE or in the innovation platform
you're running a layer 5 I want to
reduce the some some stuff your module
provides localizing bundles so that if
you're not English alright if you are if
you have non-english texts in there and
that you can have the correct
localizations for your module module and
tokens the your your module will provide
or for other modules to run or which
tokens it require student to be
installed in the application front
packages and many many things more are
possible to configure
the great lemme I'm plug-in also which
it would expect allows you to run and
debug the module and set a and that
means application basically it installs
the plugin for the father your father
Ron and you can work with they are with
your plugin inside the application so
there and the question then becomes what
is the plug-in missing that you would
want to do that that's not not there
there's three major parts there's one
thing the net-net means platform
platform applications in general in such
a way that you extend a platform at your
modules to it and can have that as a
deployable so all the modules already
installed for a runtime just extracted
install it or would whatever and run the
application that one is missing action
are currently then there's platform
suites inside of the IDE it's possible
to create platform sweet it's
essentially a grouping of NetBeans
modules that are intent that work
together inside of the group these sweet
can be cascaded and a final sweet aim a
master suite as an egg is then possible
to be run collecting all the children
parts into it
for the run time another thing platform
applications allow is the generation of
update Center files so these updates on
the files are used to update any running
application with platform with netbeans
modules available from the update center
it's also a possibility to just add
modules 2-2 a running application not
just to update the plugin portal from
from nap teens itself has a update
Center file available so any any plugin
that's available on plugins that it's
part of dark can be installed with the
update center inside of the NetBeans IDE
so
so how how can i how can go about fixing
these three parts we've we tried first
looking at the ineptness applications
because essentially it's just the
grouping and collecting collection of
NetBeans modules that have to be added
to a nap its platform that can be done
by adding a greater plugin which enables
these the build of the NetBeans applique
platform applications and it can further
it's possible if you take the
dependencies declared in in the na
Gradle project that has this platform
application plugin the project
dependencies that used the regular NB
module project can then be aggregated
and collected for use and in addition to
into a configurable net platform
installation on on the local hard drive
or retrievable via a dependency
resolution once once that is done these
groups of files a platform application
plus modules that have been discovered
can then be run and debug and debug as
well it's it then only becomes a
question of command-line arguments that
have to be added
to make it run a boo well if you then
have all these files together you can
just use those two with your application
archive if you can use for the
deployment and publishing process so
essentially zip them up and published
lost in those files just then okay
that's basically that for the platform
applications platform suites as I said
before is they are essentially groups of
NetBeans modules or above suites
together and that build on themselves
new new suites or platform application
that can be run so in that sense the
platform suites are essentially platform
can can be reused by platform
applications previously described but
without any code in the platform project
itself so just groupings of greater
projects that that group together
modules or other sweets
update Center files and then are
similarly easy because all those files
and informations of the modules and the
project structure can can be arranged to
create those files or yeah yeah that's
that yeah I i guess i can show you that
except i can't really because
unfortunately my arm my project crashed
but i can show you the a test that
applies to the plugin and tries tries to
try to add a module and runs the
application that's not exactly what i
wanted to do but it's one thing to show
badly
if you just give me a second essentially
what we've done what we've done to
accomplish this attack the module from
for the great and greatly project from
from raiding and extended to to add the
application plug-in and associated tasks
in there to get together working as we
imagined it should work if running is
agreeable to that we'll have to figure
out what we've just seen is that the
I've prepared a minimalistic NetBeans
platform application that's on the AMA
file system I indicated to my work that
Miss sure I've I've located I've located
in this folder which I indicated the
plugin and applied the deviant new
plugin we created then I'm just calling
the run application task which collects
all those files together and creates a
executable runs an executable task
inside of Gradle which then starts the
application the welcome screen I've I've
already stood the platform found some
previous user settings which had wanted
to import which I didn't want to so now
it finds some missing dependent missing
modules which I'll just skip over and I
have my minimalistic application just to
show you the
five modules quite a few I quite quite
here that's just it's not nothing not
not the least memorial to one can have
it's just close to it if if it would be
1 i'd have at have succeeded i am will
we are still trying to get that into the
official module in but it's an ongoing
process so far yeah that's that's done
my part so let's just good back okay so
there was one more more thing that was a
on the abstract of the session and yeah
jigsaws late so everything else is
probably late as well based on jigsaw so
I think cradle is say slowly getting
there besides that jigsaw is still a
moving target but I building on a moving
target that's it has a moving target
beneath it is like not very good very
effective so I think I am this will take
some more time there is support for JDK
nine modules in a jdk nine branch of
NetBeans available SI armed and maven
projects so suppose it should be
possible to to add the Gradle thing as
well so but I'm does it say where we are
at the moment so questions and answers
this was what we had to tell so now if
you get more questions we can probably
think of more things we forgot
I think so if not then I thanks for
attending the session and I enjoy your
java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
