life here at the Oracle code Seoul
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and I have
as my guest chung myung-whun
who is the consulting director of open
source consulting thank you thank you
for coming Jenna so real pleasure to
have you on
so you're you're a speaker today at the
conference and I'm very interested in it
because your subject is about DevOps you
want to give it what it what is the
title of your talk kit and carry it for
best practice in DevOps okay so yeah so
so we were talking a little bit
off-camera about your presentation so
gate is and is a source control
repository and get it is for code review
so it they sound like two twins get and
get it comes from okay so so what's the
so what are you going to be discussing
in your presentation about gate and
actually when I prepare that this
session I'm thinking which tie do I have
to choose and the reason I choose didn't
carry these I see just a few times the
discussion we're talking about git and
Garrett Michel himself because given
carries our only tool or assistant tool
for development another development
itself so in project in the certain time
of project or the web service company
many businesses they usually focus on de
belem on himself word development and
the genus but they don't spend much time
on each assistant to get work period so
I'd like to say about that that's the
first reason and kitties are in my
perspective Achilles
like her toy drone fourth generation of
open-source version control system and
it is a little bit colony bit were quite
different from previous version
subversion but usually for the people
don't understand or the study about it
in depth so I think they use or they
they told utilize its benefit many machi
so I'd like to share my experience what
is good what is bad I don't say it is
better
somebody's the worse going to say but
difference and what its benefits so I
hope to share my experience when you get
in some certain point then you can get
benefit that's my copy today and how
does get it fit into this because most
of us are familiar with get get it
sounds like I said said so talk to us a
little bit about code review complicated
process in just walk a flow because some
people think that code review is a
unnecessary process but to make the
quality solution quality software code
review is very important and one more
thing is it when we do code review then
we can share where team members can
share their knowledge to others in that
perspective carat is the one of the code
review tool and can release it very very
tightly integrated be the gift okay so
when someone use git then they they
better use carry together so that's why
I choose get it together and does this
form it becomes like an integral part of
the DevOps like to see the continuous
integration continuous deployment
pipeline it is in DevOps and
a continuous integration process you
know source repository easier to for
their containing order the source code
right and in that process the continuous
integration doesn't mean only the tools
were the technology is to just process
to make the better solution software so
in the perspective code code review is
one step can be placed between other
process like a development and test and
build so we do code review tool you can
get better quality solution quality
software and you can improve your
workflow process especially can reduce
your mistake and you can save your time
so again it's just the whole idea of
development and operations communicating
in in terms of coming out with better
products more repeatable faster pace
this just improves the quality of actual
the practical cases like her when de
belem developer create a code and store
in gift and the kid it is reviewed Avaya
carry then operation team were build a
team can refer the select the repository
and then they can also refer the code
review process so when they run into the
problem in test or build build the
process they can fact they can find is
'le finder the fix or a solution for the
problem so in the perspective code River
system and the sociopath story is very
important and it must be very easy to be
accessed yeah okay alright so sounds
like you're gonna be giving the what
time is your presentation there are 30
340 340 so if anyone is around here
please do check out chunks presentation
so it sounds very exciting
get and
so I wish you all the best thank you for
coming and see you probably at another
code event yeah thank you buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
