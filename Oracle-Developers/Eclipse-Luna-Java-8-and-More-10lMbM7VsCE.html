actual user of Eclipse technology anyone
here just to heckle we'll talk later so
I can I safely assume that most people
in the room are eclipse is a Java IDE
mindset is that kind of where you're
coming from this does anybody know what
Higgins is no okay no that's Higgs
that's something else oh very good yeah
that's run what is that higgins is
there's name oh I had no idea no what we
Higgins is actually identity management
so it's similar to card space that sort
of thing it's they actually build
plugins for firefox and browsers and
things to assert identity it's an
eclipse project
so who in the room has an eclipse
bugzilla account that's awesome only
three of you have ever encountered
problems with a clips that's awesome so
we have this new feature that we've
added into the milestone builds for our
next release and we're still trying to
decide if we're going to continue it
forward it depends on how well it goes
we release with each release we do a
number of milestone builds and those go
into the hands of hundreds or thousands
of people it's not usually usually the
millions of people that get the thread
the main downloads but this new feature
when an exception happens somewhere in
the framework it will invite you to
submit that and we have a process of
actually turning it into a bug which I
guess sort of seems like an obvious
thing to have unfortunately we have some
privacy issues that we constantly
wrestle with but anyway it's it's now in
the the milestone builds and we're
seeing a lot of a lot of return on
investment from that in terms of bug
reports so I guess what I'm saying is I
encourage you if you are looking at our
milestone builds looking at the be 4.5
Mars release of Eclipse and you see a
message box that comes up and says hey
this exception happened can you report
it if you could please that would be
awesome you don't actually have to make
an account or anything you just have to
basically say yes all right 1145 time to
go so my name is Wayne beaten I'm I've
come here from Ottawa Canada which is
the if you go canada which is where most
of the Eclipse Foundation lives and
works we have actually would think it's
about 14 we have 14 people who work in
Ottawa we have one person who works and
lives in portland oregon NE portland
oregon people oh really ok and we have
to live in Germany and two in France
it usually comes as a great surprise to
people to learn that we employ none of
the software developers who write the
Eclipse software I'll talk a little bit
more about that as we move forward my
main draw a job at the Eclipse
Foundation is director of open source
projects which basically means it's my
job to help new projects get created
help projects understand our governance
process help projects engage with our
intellectual property due diligence
process we have a very we are
effectively well we are more than
effectively we are in the most general
sense an open-source software foundation
and we have over 260 projects doing
various things many of which have to do
with Java development if you came by our
booth at all during the exhibit ha
exhibit you may have noticed that we do
a lot of Internet of Things stuff and
one of the things that I find what I
noticed this week is well of course I've
known about this for a while is
everybody comes to our booth expecting
that we are an eclipse the Eclipse IDE
that's all we do and they wonder how
does Internet of Things relate to the
IDE and the answer is it doesn't really
they're open source projects they've
come to the Eclipse Foundation because
they care about intellectual property
cleanliness they care about having a
governance model they care about having
an independent organization owning their
trademark and hosting the project we
have a lot of projects that have
absolutely nothing to do with the IDE
and everything to do with just cool
technology in fact over the last few
years we've brought in a lot of projects
that aren't even Java so we have a
number of different MQTT implementations
for example including java and c++ i
mentioned higgins a little bit before
against his identity management nothing
nothing to do with the IDE or IOT I
guess but anyway so we have a very
diverse collection of projects and it's
my job to help these
projects I onboard themselves into our
system and and be ultimately be
successful the other thing that I do and
this is something I'm expanding into is
to do more evangelism which I'm really
excited about I love evangelism because
it allows me one of the evangelism is
basically you get to play with cool
technology and tell people about it it's
like the dream job and they pay you
anyway so today I want to talk primarily
about the Eclipse IDE introduce you to
what the Luna simultaneous release
actually is and what it means to us we
will of course talk about some of the
Java 8 features actually at that point i
will probably switch and just mostly do
demo I've got some slides I'll sort of
assume that the slides are going to be
nice companion material that you can
take with you and talk about some other
HUD features if there's some time so
most people seem to think they know what
the Eclipse IDE is and most of you are
right you go to our download site and
you pick the pick one of the many
confusing options that we have on our
download site and and then you have an
eclipse ide we actually just went
through a process of trying to figure
out what the heck Eclipse standard means
and we've we've changed that the the
default package the default download
that we expect people to get now is the
Java ID it sorry the Eclipse IDE for
Java developers um that's usually what
people want if they don't know what they
want you can come to our site though and
you can get the the Eclipse IDE for PHP
developers or Java Enterprise developers
we have an eclipse ide for c and c++
developers these are all available as
downloads now some people get confused
about which one they should pick and
really just sort of pick one and you can
add whatever you need to it I think most
people are familiar with the notion of
the plug-in model so this graphic i'm
showing here is a very high level
description or a picture of what's in
the Eclipse IDE for Java developers most
of us know that we have the Java
development tools
you've probably experienced the get
tools does anybody actually use CVS
anymore it's ok we won't shame you
publicly for shame okay so most of us
are comfortable with those also in the
in the the download though you will
notice there's we may not have noticed
there's some application lifecycle
management tools of course I guess said
to get enter integration there's some
XML development tools you probably run
into those there's some maven
integration tools there's also this cool
recommendation engine that you probably
have no idea about at the heart of it
all is the platform the platform is the
the underlying foundation the framework
upon which everything works the platform
is the stackable views the editor
managed menus the whole component model
that sits underneath underneath of the
platform that manages literally hundreds
of different components and their
interactions you know the problems that
that mark was talking about in the
keynote this morning about jar files and
all that is like we solved that a long
time ago in our component model the the
platform actually the gentleman a few
rows back had mentioned that he is
building rich client platform
applications rich client platform is
some people gosh that's most been about
eight or nine years ago seven or eight
anyway some number of years ago
recognized that all of this IDE goodness
if you took away the language specific
features you have a decent application
development framework and you can build
applications desktop applications based
on top of it actually an interesting we
also have another project called the
wrap which is I'm going to get this
wrong rich application platform I think
and what that does is you can actually
build an eclipse eclipse plugins a an
application based on the Eclipse
platform and then just deploy it into a
browser it says it's very cool it's
basically using exactly the same plug in
technology that Eclipse provides but
then with a browser delivery anyway so
that the heart of all this now what's
interesting here and there's all these
arrows that are here is all of these
diff
and pieces of the IDE come from
different open source projects the
Eclipse platform project provides oddly
enough the platform the Java development
tools project JDT provides the Java
support that includes the ECJ which is
the Eclipse compiler for Java I think
this is probably common knowledge at
this point but we actually have our own
implementation of the Java compiler so
we don't use Java Sea and eclipse this
allows us to do really cool things
probably didn't notice that you can
actually run or maybe if you may have
noticed you can actually run code that
has errors in it in Eclipse right where
javis he throws up its hands and says
hey there's an error I can't run this
the Eclipse compiler will just do its
best compile it and then when you run it
if you actually encounter that error
while you're running you'll throw an
exception anyway that's sort of handy
when you're doing development you write
all your test cases and they don't all
actually have to be implemented or
correct before you can start testing
some of them for example anyway ECJ the
Eclipse compiler for job is actually
included as part of Tomcat so when
you're using jsps you're actually using
eclipse on tomcat the Eclipse compiler
for Java anyway all of that comes from
the JDT and that's a team that's been
working hard to give us the Java 8
support the m2e project maven2 just
there they've been around for a little
while because now they do maven 3 but
anyway the maven integration project
provides the maven integration code
recommenders project does this
intelligent recommendations engine which
i'm going to show you in a couple of
minutes pretty cool the web tools
project does the XML so all these
different projects are all collaborating
together and that's what's happening
when we build when we build these these
packages these downloads there be the
collaborative work of multiple projects
all working together and as I said at
the beginning I don't actually employ
any of these people these are all
projects that are created some of them
are sponsored heavily by individual
companies but many of them then mo the
most successful of them gets a great
example of a project that has upwards if
I think about 12 different organizations
contributing because they think having
get support in Eclipse is important
and they these companies these
individuals step forward and they they
do work in open source and then they
they connect with each other they
collaborate and together they build this
this wonderful piece of software it's
really a beautiful thing it's also very
frustrating because I don't have 20
developers that I can't ask on doing
something in particular my job is a lot
a lot of my job is about building
consensus and helping people to
understand that maybe if you spend a
little bit of time working on this
particular feature it's in all of our
selfish best interests it's an
interesting role and it makes me it
helps me lets me work with lots of
interesting people the other thing here
these are a couple of projects I've got
a sort of around the box here the CDT
the PDT the PHP development tools if
you're doing PHP work for stuff my my
condolences secondly if you can add that
functionality and I'm sorry I feel you I
feel your pain too because I do a lot of
PHP you can add the PHP it's just matter
of taking a plugins but those PHP
plugins are created by the PDT team
which is in the difference at different
team working together for their to build
to build that functionality so that you
can add it to your Eclipse IDE so an
eclipse ide basically is like I said the
the combination of the efforts of
multiple projects all working together
multiple teams multiple plugins I
mentioned those that so we all again we
all know that everything is a plug-in
that's literally true everything in
Eclipse is a plug-in even the platform
itself plug-in actually is because is
not probably exactly the right word
because if everything is a plug-in then
there's nothing that's you know that
everything is kind of first class it's a
I don't want it maybe not not the right
time to get into that but we by
assembling it's assembling plugins the
the platform is a bunch of plugins that
JDT is a bunch of plugins II get is a
bunch of plugins we mash all that
together and we get out of that and
Eclipse IDE so the simultaneous release
is as as you might guess having in that
case of last year's released 77
different project teams all working
together can be frankly a bit of a
nightmare
the simultaneous release was created 10
years ago to try and coordinate the
efforts of all these projects and make
it so that they're you know the the
simplest thing that happened was that
there there's development through
delivery schedules aligned so that if
you wanted the latest and greatest from
eclipse you could get it all at the same
time prior to that it was a bit of a
mess Eclipse would release the platform
would release in in June and then web
tools would be sometime in October and
the latest version of EMF would be in
July you know whatever it was all this
it was impossible to have latest and
greatest of everything and now with the
simultaneous release we have that more
important the simultaneous release gave
us a means of getting all of our project
teams to communicate together and work
work together so we have as as simple as
the simplest part of it is we have a
cross project mailing list and projects
participate in that we have they we do a
release schedule and every we do seven
milestones and a number of release
candidates over the period of a year so
the project's get practice in bringing
their bits together combining everything
making packages we push out milestones
at the community the bleeding edge
people can pick up and use one of the
very cool side re effects of that's not
a side effect it's a direct effect is
that by the time the final release comes
and we're you know we're in May and
we're looking at our june release it's
usually pretty boring for us because
we've all we've practiced this we've
practiced this everyone build your stuff
and we aggregate everything together we
mash it together make the make the make
the ides and we put them all out on the
website by time the main release comes
by time Mars comes we will have done
that 10 * 89 I can't remember something
like that so we get projects to opt in
early they participate fully in the
process and by the time the end comes
you get something that's been tested and
and again the teams are are working in
sync very well so the simultaneous
release has allowed us to do things like
reduce duplication
and you know again reduce lightly we you
know it had different versions of
different libraries we force the teams
to to pick one and work together on that
sort of thing but again the
communication is sort of the main key
and then this coordination so Luna I
said 10 I guess I meant nine anyway Luna
is our ninth formal simultaneous release
we started back in 2006 with Callisto
and we've been pushing forward ever
since something that a lot of
organizations can't claim we ship on
time every year and we and and most of
the promised features gag I'm not going
to say all the promise features get
delivered but we do have a pretty good
track record of delivering the promise
features so this actually started with
the Eclipse platform itself and the JDT
they all released an in June it was
their their habit they did it every year
and we've picked up their release
schedule and followed that drumbeat now
over time the number of projects that
have participated have has increased
like I said earlier last year we had 77
different projects now not all of those
projects wind up in the IDE up until
last year I think Eclipse link was one
eclipselink is a piece of the JPA
implementation in glassfish they decided
that joining the simultaneous release
this year didn't make any sense to them
so they dropped off but a bunch of
others others joined from we
approximated i think it was 60 million
lines of code went into the luna release
this charts obviously a little older
than i should have grabbed the most
recent one which have that actual number
so we see a steady increase we're
actually looking the lot of the projects
are gaining getting more mature so we're
seeing some of the more established
projects like platform like the Eclipse
modeling framework they're not changing
that much anymore but we're getting a
lot of new projects the Eclipse FXR EFX
ago how do we say it tomm FX clips
joined us that's some javafx support for
building javafx applications and
I'm not even to try to say cuz I'm going
to get it wrong that's Tom after so
adding new features if you've downloaded
one of the packages if you go to the
help menu which obviously makes sense if
you want to add things you go look for
help install new software it opens up
the software installer which I know like
I hate this thing but anyway work with
the Luna repository and from there you
can select the different features that
you want to install a bunch of features
are shown there you can actually filter
the list another way of getting eclipse
features is to go to the marketplace
also of course if you want to get
something from a marketplace you need to
go to the help menu and select Eclipse
marketplace and from there you have
access to much of what's in the
simultaneous release so you'll find the
CDT package in here you will find PHP
support in here but you will also find
things like Gradle support in here the
community the ecosystem provides a lot
of plugins for the for the Eclipse IDE s
and you can find them all here J rebel
here is returned anyway so we have again
the wide variety of plugins that you can
get just to the marketplace so I invite
you to explore that if you're using
Windows you can actually go to the
marketplace Eclipse org and find stuff
through the browser then just drag and
drop it onto your eclipse and it will
install it that doesn't work in linux
for reasons i haven't dug into so what
are we actually looking at in terms of
some new features which i think why most
of us are actually here a lot of little
things seemingly little things that
actually wound up being you know a lot
of work under the scenes under the scene
under the Cobb won a lot of work we have
the dark theme and split editors a lot
of people love this dark theme I don't
get it personally but that's you know
some people like that sort of thing line
numbers on by default now this is a
wonderful story that i won't labor too
long but it's amazing how religious this
argument got
the number of people who feel very very
very strongly about whether or not line
numbers should be on or off by default
will blow your mind this took a long
time to do because no because gathering
consensus was just painful and I don't
get it you it's a single option it's so
easy to change anyway I'm laboring it
more than I wanted to anyway so exciting
times I know let's dance reduced white
space in the default presentation so
they've tightened things up a little bit
that quick access bar at the top can be
you can hide it now I know exciting
times but again I think Java 8 support
is probably one of the most exciting
things for for java developers and at
this point I'm just going to switch over
to eclipse and and show off some stuff
some of which will be the Java 8 support
yeah there go ok so i've got this
workspace I've just sort of been
tinkering with a few things if you're if
you're at all familiar with how how we
named things at eclipse you'll see that
I actually have the m2e the maven
integration plugins the source of them
installed here and project umph which is
pretty cool but maybe I'll talk about
that later if I have some time but to
save a little bit of time I've just
created a simple Java class now I'm
assuming everybody understands control
space ok apparently I don't oh there we
go a main method so control space to do
content assist now that lag that
sometimes it Clips does is because we
have this component model underneath the
scenes that's trying hard to limit the
amount of memory that it uses so it's
basically as you start to use things the
component model will pull in the feature
so that first time very often you had a
little bit of a lag it should work
better from now for now now i'm not an
expert in any means with the with the
swing libraries but i decided that this
would be for some reason i decided this
would be an interesting example it will
now if you've been using eclipse for a
while no doubt you're familiar with
content assist a Gazette oh can you
actually see that I'll have to describe
what you what you should be seeing here
I honestly don't use swing very often
and you know just sort of looking for
honestly I was looking for an example
where I could use lambda is that
everybody would understand i figured
listeners would be a good way to do that
content assist generally when use
content assist is going to show you all
the things that make sense that you
could send to this particular receiver
and it's always alphabetically ordered
now you may notice that it's not
alphabetically-ordered what we did is
one of our project teams did to be
honest to be complete they scanned as
many code bases as they could find as
many Java code bases as they could find
and from that they figured out the
patterns that people were using how were
people using various api's and based on
that they've implemented an intelligent
recommendations engine now if you look
closely and unfortunately menus are a
platform specific thing that I couldn't
sort out it to make bigger but if you
look closely there's a little there's a
number beside each of these so basically
if you look at the vast number of code
bases and you find the number of times
people have made a jframe sixty-four
percent of the time the next thing they
did was went and got the content pane
why was pretty cool right content pane
all right mister so apparently after you
get the content pane that this makes no
sense I know this makes no sense I know
swing well enough to know that what I've
done is a no op but the next parish the
thing you do apparently is you said
visible most common thing and so anyway
and so this this recommendation engine
then it helps you it helps you figure
out helps you figure out like maybe what
you should be doing next so now I guess
let me just
the next thing I would usually say to a
button there's a bunch of different
options that an action listener
background clearly I must have used the
wrong constructor because most people
don't set the text with a function it
turns out i'm not sure what I need to
take from that but so maybe I should be
maybe that's what the you know the
common pattern is add an action listener
well i guess i can do a new action
listener okay so I've got that and I
guess I'll just tell the frame to
dispose and then I guess I need one like
content pane I'm going to need to do
something I'm going to need to add a
component to it so nineteen percent of
the time I guess I use the zero argument
or the I don't tell it extra information
currently I set lay out a lot anyway
neat feature so let's add that button
anyway and save and presumably if I run
actually I know exactly was going to
happen when i when i run this it's going
to make a little window that nobody can
see because i wasn't really paying
attention as much as I probably should
have to the other recommendations say
again I could use pack nine percent of
the time one would use pack that's good
for to use this one so it doesn't know
maybe that doesn't make sense to use I
don't anyway so let's try pact right now
that we're using swings out on all that
okay alright cool so anyway so we can
play with this some more but control one
we know that action listeners are now no
longer sexy sorry I'm allowed to use
that word yes
it does some of that yes honestly I'm
not sure how immediate it is a bit it
does say it integrates with Milan which
monitors what you do so if you're if
you're using certain methods those
methods will have some priority to in
the listing so clearly converting to a
lambda expression is something that we
all think is valuable important because
we're here at the conference so I can do
that control one I can I've got some
some quick fixes to help me turn that
body expression into a block so that's
that's pretty that's pretty handy and
then of course I can switch everything
back what don't get that one there we go
convert to change body to block oh
they're here thank you so so back and
forth then that that's that's pretty
cool so I'll save that now also pretty
cool is and this is kind of an
artificial example because well of
course is an artificial example only
have one example here but you may be
looking at a class and you've got a lot
of these a lot of these listeners it
while you may have old project with a
lot of these listeners installed and you
know the old style you want to convert
them all to Java 8 and the thought of
going through and converting everything
to lambda is to get the the wonderful
benefits that come with using lambdas is
a little bit time-consuming instead you
can go to the source menu and say you
want to clean up and this cleanup is
actually configurable in the in the
settings and oh
I don't think I actually do I have that
I may not have the feature turned on oh
I do oh good so what it will do is it
will walk through all of the types in
this project and as part of the cleanup
let me as part of the cleanup you have
options on what you want to do to your
code there's a number of defaults this
one's actually turned off by default so
you can do this in the preferences to
get it for the entire work stay at work
space or you can do it on a
project-by-project basis you can say
when I do a cleanup change the
functional interface instances to use
lambdas where possible and it will just
automatically go through find all the
possibilities and it will allow you to
make those changes again that's not
turned on by default you'd have to turn
it on to to get this benefit but then it
gives you a list of all the things that
it does you use lambda where possible I
didn't see that when I was looking at it
the first time oh I'm still not seeing
it this should be ok anyway whatever but
even so the ideas i can click Next if I
had more classes more things it would
this list to be far more interesting I
can actually then walk through all the
different things that it's suggesting
it's wants to do I can turn off the
things that I don't want it to do and I
click finish and it's it will go through
all the code and make all those changes
so that's pretty handy if I want to get
the benefits of the of the the lambdas
if you're doing a lot of you I work or a
lot of use of anonymous classes this
will get far more interesting example so
there's other test things if I other
recommendations that we do class my own
if I'm doing things wrong in I actually
I was doing this last night it was our
dwell is the last night I was doing the
final touches on this presentation it
occurred to me that I don't use swing
for anything so how do I know if I'm
doing it right well
it turns out the recommendation engine
just not doing what I expected hold on
what did I do oh good tell it what that
is the recommendation engine actually
gave me some confidence that maybe this
is how you use panels okay linux is a
gnome 3 is a mixed blessing anyway so
apparently people do extend jpanel and
eleven percent of the time they override
the paint component function or of that
method pardon me so we get that there
now something else that's interesting
with recommendation engine we have the
ability to do partial do text matches of
things so instead like I don't worry I
want to do I want to do an arc something
with an arc I don't want a copy art draw
arc or whatever i don't necessarily know
what the beginning of the function is
but i can start typing a part name and
it will match methods or methods that
that look close good any questions about
that pretty meeting okay alright so
another feature that oak so actually
just while I'm here while I'm in in some
Java code if you don't know about
control one you need to you need to look
at control one that's the that's the the
feature I've been using to to get this
help no suggestions available Oh control
space is help so now for getting those
converting those lambdas that's control
one that gives me all the quick quick
assists if I have errors in my code
the control one is also the the option
that I would use to help resolve those
errors in this case it's not giving me
anything helpful help change the frame
that's what I meant to say another neat
feature and you get that through control
one is frame was not the right way right
word to use I can do a rename and file
and you know as I'm changing the value
of this or the name of this field it it
will change it to rate this variable it
will change it everywhere some other
things if you know you'll know if I'm go
away all right there we go if I put my
cursor into a into a variable it'll show
me all the references to that variable
if I put it on the return type that's
know if there's no returns from here so
that's not going to work but anyway
there's a lot of assists that eclipse
will do based on where your cursor is
and then it will highlight different
aspects of the code the other thing
that's interesting is you know again if
you've ever gone through I was picking
on our help menu like of course help
means is where you go for updates but
our menu system is a little bit shall we
say cluttered if you're not sure what
you want to do control three and then
type what you want to do I want to do
blame there's no blame what am I
thinking of I was thinking get blame but
I want to do something with get so
here's all the different views that I
have that event something to do with get
there's a get perspective which I never
use there's a number of different
commands that work with get I can create
a new git repository I can open
preferences pages that have something to
do with get so control three is kind of
my gateway to the rest of the
functionality in Eclipse
so moving on I recently had a problem
with fountains found a bug in in the
maven support for eclipse I know it's a
shock but I so I decided to do something
about it I pulled in all the maven code
the maven support code and I've wound up
with a I'm jump close this gets out of
the way sure why not I wound up with a
workspace that has quite a lot of stuff
in it now a few years ago some research
was done actually great many years ago
some research was done to determine what
developers are doing and it turns out
that well anyway part of this research
was to find out how much of our time do
we spend actually writing code and it
may just a quick poll how many people
think you know that our software
developers figure that you spend about
fifty percent of your time writing code
to show of hands who figures is closer
to twenty five percent who thinks it's
closer to ten percent okay so studies
have actually shown hate to disappoint
you but studies have actually shown that
about ten percent of our development
time is actually spent writing code so
that leaves a question what are we doing
the rest of the time I think Facebook
has an answer Twitter probably has an
answer but the study showed i cant
rember the actual number but it was
something 75% eighty percent of our time
is spent browsing code looking at code
looking at what other people have done
looking what we have done I don't know
about you but if I go look at code that
I wrote six months ago it might as well
have been written by somebody else I
don't remember you know I like to think
that I do sort of a self documenting
style I try to use meaningful names but
ultimately I still need to go back and I
need to find the stuff I was working on
before and it's all just painful in time
consuming so many way this research
determined that the best way to make
developers more productive was not to
make writing code easier but to make
finding things easier make browsing code
easier so we have this project it's
called myelin is
originally called mylar the idea was to
prevent protect you from information
blindness but apparently that was a bit
of a trademark infringement so it's been
called myelin for a little while now and
what I've done with Milan is as part of
my efforts to help with the m2e the
Maven integration project I went I used
Milan to connect to their bugzilla and I
pulled in their bugs into my workstation
so first off the first thing i have is i
have a representation of my issue
tracker system our interface to my issue
tracking system right in my ID so this
is the number of bugs what they actually
say is not all that important don't
strain your eyes but these are all a bug
number and then the description of the
bug now this actually has integration
with bugzilla JIRA track fogbugz lots of
different other types of issue trackers
so I pull these issues in now what I do
is I activate one of these issues and
I've actually had a couple have been
playing with a few things already I'll
activate this this task now when I
activated that task you may have noticed
that my editor area changed a bit I
wound up with three editors open that I
didn't have open before I'll flip back
to my package a package Explorer then
you'll notice the plot the package
explorers is a little less of a mess
that's a bit more of a mess than I
expected actually what I must have been
tinkering with some other stuff but this
is what it looked like before
with the task enabled it now looks like
this now the problem here is that I
actually looked at a bunch of this stuff
and tinkering it what what Milan does is
when you activate this task it starts
paying attention to what you touch and
determines that what you touch and how
long you touch it how much you care
about it and it builds what they call a
degree of interest model and this degree
of interest model is connected to the
task when I switch tasks if I flip to a
different task and I'll pop over here
and take a different one my editor area
has now changed my package Explorer has
now changed to reflect what I cared
about the last time i was looking at
this task let that sink in for a second
so basically what's happened is that
eclipse has been paying attention to
what I care about and it remembers so
six months from now when I need to come
back and revisit some work I did on this
than this issue i reactivate the issue
and eclipse goes this is what your
workstation your workspace look like
last time we were here now even cooler
of course I can attach that context to
the issue in bugzilla we attach it to
the bug and then if you are working on
that particular feature and you call up
that issue the eclipse will go oh
someone else was working on this do you
want to pull in their context and you
say yes and then boom your workspace
looks like minded last time I was
looking at it right so what I've done is
rather than making you hunt down all the
things that I've already hunted down you
can benefit from from my work and just
get started so we save you the time of
actually going and finding stuff well I
said in the beginning that I pulled this
out of bugzilla so yes it's out well it
doesn't need to but its wake away easier
if it's connected to something shared so
you can actually make a task inside your
own workspace and work that way and
that's good but unfortunate that
requires a discipline right you decide
you going to do something you need to
make the task and then follow it through
the integration with the issue tracker
makes that pretty seamless right
somebody will create the issue may not
be
you may be as you like our Clips
committers have a discipline of creating
a bug whenever whenever something needs
to be needs to be addressed so so a
somebody can be doing a front line
support and creating bugs and those bugs
just appear in your workspace you know
triage them you pick them you say this
one's mine you can make a query inside
Eclipse it says just show me all of the
bugs make me make me a list of all the
bugs that are assigned to me you can
actually say I'm going to work on this
next week or two weeks from now and it
will categorize them based on when you
intent to work on them too and there's a
neat feature that says just give me
something to work on right just pick one
of the bugs I have assigned but by
working through an external issue
tracker you have this better ability to
work with a team and leverage that
ability and then then the discipline of
creating tasks is is not not required
but anyway so yes so you have this this
this ability to work directly with the
bugs and you'll notice let me see here
I've got to quickly I actually have a
representation of in this case the they
will the issue we clips we call them
bugs which actually I think does is a
disservice because we use the bug
tracker for new features right for
example you know calling it an issue
tracker it's probably our issues ill it
seems a little wordy but anyway so we
can actually work directly with our
issue tracking system right from the IDE
I don't have to open up a browser and
interact with it there and again the
interaction is immediate and direct I
can we can do cool content assist things
that are a little bit more difficult
than the browser implementation rather
than wait for wait for the good people
at Mozilla to upgrade bugzilla to to do
more JavaScript key things but anyway so
we have this ability that it bugs there
is also does anybody use Garrett then
what note Garrett is oh you're missing
out if you don't know Garrett is Garrett
is a review system basically Garrett
front say a git repository and if you
have a few if you want to develop a
community if you want people to be
contributing
you can anybody can pull your source
code out of get through Garrett and then
push their patches to Garrett and then
Garrett has this wonderful review of
functionality where the developers on
the team can pull in the fix this decide
whether it's a good one and then vote on
it yes this is a good fix this is not
not a good fix then you can configure
Garrett to say if we get 5 Plus Ones or
1 plus 1 or 2 plus ones whatever it is
you decide if we get so many people to
agree that this is an okay thing it just
automatically does the merge and update
your git repo and and and does all that
kind of wonderful stuff one of the ways
that we use this is we actually have
Hudson is a participant in the review so
when somebody contributes a patch to an
eclipse project through Garrett Hudson
kicks up and goes oh hey someone just
review is good just submitted something
I'll try to build it right so it tries
to build it tries to run the tests if it
passes it puts a plus one as on its
review or it'll put a minus one if it
fails Garrett was actually created by
the Android team and they use it for
their own development and we've adopted
it very heavily at Eclipse a long way to
say we actually have integration with
Garrett too so so you can talk oh do I
have a connection what do I got well
think I'm having a synchronization issue
should synchronize before the demo so
here we have a garret patch has been
submitted we have information about the
the author it's and then there's some
discussion all of this is happening this
makes contribution to the project much
very easy and I don't see the oh here
ere the review so it looks like eager
has put a minus 1 as his review he
doesn't like the patch so he's asking
the contributor to 5 we followed the
comments he's probably asking the
contributor to make some small changes
or something and then the contributor
will resubmit the patch and maybe eager
will changes change his mind
but anyway so we have this integration
normally you would have to go to a web
browser and then find out about the
garret review and then from there you'd
have to say okay well I want to pull
this into my git repo so I'll get the
the the get path to to it I'll pull it
in I'll do the get magic to pull it in
and test it it's all very paint a very
well it's not painful but it's very time
consuming instead I can directly from
here just say fetch that into my
workspace and pulls it in and then you
can you can do your do your testing and
whatnot yes this is actually not new
with Luna this is something we've had
for I think this actually came up with
our last release there's been in some
improvements in it for Luna though all
right anyway that i believe was what i
wanted to show online are there any
questions about any of this she looking
to garrett you should really look into
milan okay where was I Oh apparently I
need focus
alright apparently I've got so alright
that's the problem labour office is a
anyway nevermind all good so the
presentation i said i don't think the pd
i don't think i survived the PDF version
but there's a little video in the in the
presentation materials i showed you
clean up well that's not nice libre
office strikes again anyway taps focus
you either some some information there I
showed you briefly the intelligent
recommendations there's actually lots of
different types of completions as well
that I haven't shown you the code
completion stuffs actually been in
Eclipse for a think this last release
but they've they've improved a lot
they've added different types of of
releases the call changes is pretty
interesting it will actually do chains
that will change of method calls that
that are that are commonly commonly seen
any way that makes the the law violated
the law of Demeter but anyway moving on
maven integration I didn't actually show
any the maven integration but we do have
that and there's been some improvements
in the Luna release we're expecting some
bigger improvements in the in the Mars
release the ability to edit palms run
maven bills with from within eclipse
this is steadily improving this is I'll
be honest something that we're a little
behind on a lot of it is just to do with
the fact that we started doing Eclipse
and made some decisions on how eclipses
does building before maven came unto the
end of the Sun to the picture onto the
scene anyway we're working on it I've
actually been talking a little bit with
the Gradle people I'm hoping to work
work a little bit more with them to make
sure we have some top-notch Gradle
support actually out of curiosity who's
building with Nathan who's building with
Gradle who thinks Gradle is going to be
a big thing in the next couple of years
okay kind of what I thought
so get good integration there's been
some changes some additions the
interactive rebase view is very handy
it's there's been some improvements with
that you can now cherry-pick multiple
commits at once implemented stash
support which I like I guess and some
usability improvements more basically
putting menus menus and end commands
more in context as opposed to having to
hunt them down some other projects that
are just recently just joined with Luna
the serious project is something that
it's a probably if you are building
modeling tools if you're building tools
where you need a graphical user
interface to display a model serious
will help you do that so it provides
some some leg up to build that graphical
user interface very handy if you're
doing many one do modeling we hate
modeling in North America right
Europeans love modeling pajo joined us
this year with with Luna pajo is open in
standard messaging protocols more
pragmatically their current feature set
includes MQTT clients those are demos
with those are pretty cool uml too they
will who uses UML oh really okay cake
sorry I'm a bit of a expectation in
North America that we don't do modeling
but anyway um el a 2.5 specification now
supported the terminal we actually have
this integrated command line terminal
now in Eclipse oh you can open up a view
that is a command shell which is pretty
handy support 45 a PHP 5.5 has been
improved and we knew how we've got our
Eclipse for PHP developers package back
who uses PHP again my condolences anyway
so with Mars actually it's a shame Tom
left he knows this already though with
Mars we've added a couple of new
Jax so far and expecting more we are
opt-in date for for participation in
Mars is thinks of December twentieth so
we have a few more months before to find
out what we're going to what's going to
be there but SWT bot if you're anyone
using SWT now okay yeah of course SWT
bot is testing of the user interface
testing for SWT our CP testing tool this
a little bit of overlap there the JavaFX
support in Eclipse and of course I
mentioned earlier the error reporter
Afghan if you're using milestone builds
and Eclipse asks you to submit a stack
trace for our consideration please do
the on the horizon we are if you've come
by our booth you probably saw Orion flux
or che these are pretty exciting things
Orion has been around for a few years
now they made their 6.0 release with
with Luna and their full steam ahead on
for Mars Orion is a javascript editor
completely new technology javascript
editor runs in the browser it's built on
is still using javascript it has a
server component there's think just the
two implementations we have one
implementation of the server which is an
eclipse headless eclipse instance that
serves up the JavaScript there is also a
note j s based implementation so we
actually have the orion javascript
editor running on raspberry PI's it's
pretty pretty cool stuff the the web the
web client is very performant they
actually the the Orion team builds Orion
using Orion it has code completion it
handles 30 40 50 hundred thousand line
files which you should never do anyway
but it handles those files without
without slowing down in fact in many
ways and this was difficult for me to
understand it's actually faster than the
Eclipse editor in some cases and that's
because it's not doing quite as much
behind the scenes as the Eclipse job
editor right cliffs job editors
maintaining a Java model and indexes and
all that wonderful stuff and
doing an analytics and there's actually
a really cool demo now with the flux
what we've done is we've got a team
that's using Orion this JavaScript web
browser client to communicate with an
actual eclipse instance running java
development tool so doing java
development using the orion editor so
the web client talks to the eclipse
instance and the eclipse instance is
actually doing all the error checking
and reporting back to the web client and
there's this cool demo jomashop john r
thorne one of the developers were
showing me is a you can actually have
eclipse at yet in eclipse and then the
editing is reflected in the Orion
browser running a Ryan running in your
browser and then back and forth but as
he was typing Java in the Eclipse editor
it was appearing in the Orion editor and
little X's were pointing out the errors
in Orion before they appeared in Eclipse
right and and this is why she's more of
a difference in implementation detail a
difference in implementation the Eclipse
actually it kind of waits until you stop
before it does its checking and presents
the red x's the Orion editor is a little
bit more aggressive and it's looking for
them much more often but the idea is
that this works really well it's working
fast when you have them separated in
different different computers the
Eclipse running they've got a demo now
where the Eclipse portions are running
in a cloud service and it just works
that fast it's awesome it's still very
early days for flux but we're very
hopeful about it now che is an entirely
new effort this project was just created
and they're in the process of bringing
their code into eclipse this is an
entirely new software development
environment that does a very very good
job with Java but it does support
multiple development environment opposed
it uses a que nous plug-in model a
different plug-in model than what
Eclipse does but it allows you to do
Java editing in the browser it looks a
lot more like an IDE than that Orion
does but you can do build the
test all of that all the stuff that you
need to do all within a browser which is
frankly darn cool anyway I don't have
the ability to demonstrate demonstrate
that yet because I don't have the code
the the good people at codenvy are in
the process of contributing that you've
used any of the code Envy work this will
be this is sort of the next generation
and they've decided that it's
interesting their business model is to
open source at Eclipse and then build a
business hosting providing hosted
services anyway so che again completely
new I believe it doesn't leverage it
does leverage some eclipsed some of the
existing Eclipse technology but it's
it's not an eclipse plugin it's
something else and there's a very cool
demo we actually it was demonstrating
testing swing applications in the
browser to make heavy use of docker on
the server anyway certainly worth
watching for and pay attention watch
this space in the Mars timeframe chase
should start to be real with that the
formal part portion of the of my
presentation is complete and I thank you
for your attention are there any
questions i have lulled you to sleep
okay good thank you for for attending
i'm glad i was able to at least keep you
at most of you entertained for the for
the duration i hope you enjoyed java 1
i'm not sure what is left of the
conference but i hope that you enjoy the
rest of the conference and please safe
travels thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
