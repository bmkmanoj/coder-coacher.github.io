into the chat window and ask us
questions Adrian and myself as we are
monitoring it and then as we go through
the presentation you want to again like
I said keep it really interactive to
give you a bit of background off our
teams we are part of the database
development organization and here a
group of product managers who work in
outbound fashion with customers and
partners and when it comes to partners
we have done a lot of technology
integration with our partners as part of
the outbound activity we also interact
on like you know complex deployments and
Milton and Adrian have done a lot of
these and you know they can share your
their experience on how successful we
have been deploying the you know Oracle
database in the cloud with that let me
hand it over to Milton security tips for
you to successfully deploy your Oracle
database cloud service but let's start
with our cloud service so as a service
in the cloud things are a lot easier
provisioning is much easier we provide
best practice configuration parameters
to easily deploy your databases and we
have a number of deployment options here
for you with the Oracle database cloud
service you can deploy on anywhere from
virtual machines
configurations best binary from 1 to 16
OCP use memory and storage sides here
all the way up to X Adina so you can
deploy Oracle Exadata in the cloud as
well so quite a few options for
for customers to deploy or database
cloud service I'm going to be talking
about these a little bit later when we
do the demo but these are what we call
shapes and so you can deploy an Oracle
database on virtual machine with
different shapes of 1 to 16 of CPUs we
have configurations for a bare-metal
which are physical servers so without
the overhead of virtual machines you can
deploy the Oracle database cloud service
rack on bare metal or virtual machines
so that's available in a cloud service
and incidentally rack is not available
on any other cloud provider so it's only
available on the Oracle cloud finally
for enterprise customers who demand the
highest performance and for
mission-critical applications you can
deploy or collects data on the cloud
fairly easily through the provisioning
screens so that's our comprehensive set
of cloud offering on the Oracle cloud so
let's talk about how to successfully
deploy any one of these configurations
on the cloud and it all has to do with
networking and security so for you DBA
is out there you've got to pick up a
little bit of networking and security
knowledge ok so the topic is
understanding network security and
security rules being very successful the
base deployment in the Oracle cloud ok
so we've got a really basic diagram here
we've got the Oracle cloud and we've got
a number of regions that support Oracle
cloud and these regions consists of data
centers ok the first thing we need to do
is to be able to connect outside to the
cloud ok so anybody connecting in or out
we need to build a sure connection
through this and we get that connection
established you're the Internet gateway
okay anytime you create an Oracle cloud
Network you're provided with a subnet
where you can deploy your aura babies so
we've got an example here of the of a
subnet here okay with the range of IP
addresses starting with 10.0 that throw
that zero and we're going to deploy as
an example and also database right into
the subnet so once we do that we need to
be able to connect to that so when you
provision an Oracle database you're
going to be assigned a public IP address
and a private IP address okay so the
public one is what's could be allowing
access from outside of the Internet
itself so I've got an example here of a
device with an IP address at 145 nine
zero nine ten and I want this device to
be able to connect to this day race so
how do I go about doing that well I've
got set up a couple of security rules
okay that's what's the here okay so the
first one is a row rule and that tells
you you know that I'm going to be able
to connect from that device one point
five zero nine ten through an air main
gateway so I need that router rule
defined before I can even access the
Oracle cloud okay this allows me into
the Oracle cloud once I'm able to get in
I need to set up a security list with
inbound or ingress rule and I need to
specify for instance the IP address of
that device okay that's gonna be
connecting to my database what protocol
that device is going to be connecting in
with and what port it's going to be
connecting to so obviously with your
database we're going to be connecting
into port 1521
so this is what needs to be said for
this device in the cloud on the Internet
to the other connect
so once these rules are set up you know
we'll be able to connect through the
internet gateway and the security list
allows me to connect straight to that
database on 41521
okay so that's easier to configuration
set up say that it actually needs to be
done for this device to be able to
connect to the neighbors
okay so that's step two device
connecting container and let's look at
connecting it from another server inside
of the same inside of the cloud itself
inside the local cloud okay so I've got
an app server here and I want to connect
this app server to the data to the
normal database it's connecting it from
a different subnet which is okay but
I've got to enable us to carry a role
from within the Oracle cloud itself so
we've got protection within the Oracle
cloud so this this server does not by
default have access to this database
unless we give it security access okay
so here we have security lists and allow
this inbound traffic from this app
servers so we'll define an ingress rule
Freight and now from this IP address
10019 using this protocol again and on
port 1521 okay so this will allow this
app server to be able to connect to this
database
notice we don't have a route rule
because we're not going through the
internet gateway to a device on the
Internet
okay so once you establish this rule
will be able to connect this out server
to the database okay but so let's do a
demo let me show you what the devil is
going to show you so we can get started
enforced four easy steps to build a
database solution on your structure so
is we need to create a network so and
you want clone we call it a virtual
network so we'll be creating a virtual
cloud Network and once you create that
it will create a subnet inside of this
network so want to identify which subnet
and we want to provision your babies so
once we identify the subnet and we look
at creating the security and model rules
and allow access into that database as
we discussed just a few slides ago okay
once we set up the rules
we can then provisional the database on
something okay so that will be before
steps tonight a build secure and deploy
your babies so let's get to the demo so
I'm going to start by creating the
virtual cloud Network here create the
virtual cloud network so it's very easy
you go to the networking tab here okay
I've got any network already created but
I'm going to create another one so it's
very easy virtual cloud network press
this button and this is my dialog box to
create that network so you can see here
I can give it a name my club network I
want to create that Internet gateway
along with this network and in addition
this will automatically create some
subjects for me to deploy my database so
you can see here there's some defaults
very easy
my internet gateway is created here the
default route table let's create it so I
can go in there and easily change that
okay right now it's specifying 0.0
that 0/0 and that's allowing all IP
addresses to be able to connect through
this Internet gateway and if you need
simple whitelist for instance for that
to clear device it would specify these
specific item dangerous right there so
we can actually go in there and change
that here are the three subnets that are
created okay so we're going just create
the virtual network you can see within
seconds I've created my cloud Network
okay so let's look at that it's created
three subnets and one of which is we're
going to deploy Lady Vol babies okay so
you can see it's already created my
route rule I rotate one rule and my
security listen so we can see look
what's in there so it's saying that for
this of it I'm going to allow actions
the Internet gateway and any IP address
range so I need to edit this rule I can
I can just edit the twelve rule and
specify the specific IP address for a
device for instance in this case I'll
just leave that and so we'll be able to
connect to any device okay let's look at
the security lists these are the ingress
rules inbound rules and you'll notice
that by default we we're allowing the
tcp/ip protocol or 22 which is SSH so
we're allowing had been accessed through
SSH automatically by default and so
that's enabled for any IP address range
that's coming in and again you can
specify a specific source we'll just
leave that for now we have access for 22
okay so that's all you need and
look at the vcn and I've created the
network we've created three subnets
automatically for you so you can deploy
database in any one of these still
that's so so that one goes to the
databases tab here and I'm going to
launch a DB system select the first sub
bit so that's one and the carrier this
is the deployment type and ships and you
can select so them with virtual machines
as I indicated deployment and you can
see the different science behind us we
support one core up to 24 cores on these
beyond chips if I click on a bare metal
you'll see shapes from bare metal so
these are the physical servers this
indicates 32 cores 52 course there's a
rack configuration here the point X is
1/4 1/2 Riker for wreck ok these are the
number of course for the different size
of experience very 36 cords right there
okay we don't want to create that right
now that's the large virtual machine
small size it's like a virtual machine
with two cores ok and here you can see
you can select the Oracle database
Edition in the cloud we support for
different editions standard up to
extreme performance ok just a pry the
vision and for the size of the database
go very large or very small size that's
down here
if you subscribe to the Oracle database
cloud service you'll get licenses
included your price per dollar question
alternatively you can bring your own
license and so when you bring your
license you're only going to pay for the
compute that the database is running on
so per hour on the compute you've
already purchased your license might be
to one we're going to go ahead and
select the license included so we're
subscribing to it and we need to choose
we need to select this secure key so all
services allow access but through secure
SSH key so I need to already
pre-configured so keys all right so I've
created the setup my configuration for
the shape for the database now I need to
place the database on the network that I
just created the subnet ID I want to put
it in same name sir name for free
deviates out there these are the
different versions that we support we
now support 18.1 so that's that
call that - is a container database
syllable just go ahead and create a
database by default here get a very
strong password for you if you click so
all the tooling is configured and
supports automatic backups so we do a
full backup weekly incremental backups
daily for your workload you can select
either LTP or and we're healthy ESS so
we'll set up the correct parameters so
that your database is configured
perfectly for either one of these two
environments that's that's pretty much
all you need to do so the key thing is
you know I'm selecting your shape the
size of your your database whether it's
virtual machine or a bare metal
environment or it's data and then
selecting the network in the subnet
where you want to place this database so
so there it is it's going to be
permitted it'll take a few minutes to be
ready and that's all you need to do the
provisional database I've already got
more than 30 setup here so we're going
to just show you how to commit to it and
I need to get back to this network here
because I turn off one of the rules but
I'm going to get to this let's let's try
to connect so here's the public IP
address create your session
that's authentic aid with the correct
key here that has to match the India
they Public Enemy provision the database
with I won't be able to connect here
because I turned it off one of the
security rules the wrong rule earlier so
it will timeout right here and it shows
you the security settings that are to be
enabled for you to connect to the Oracle
database so it's going to timeout right
here but the rule that I disable this
year test Network looking at the default
round table security rule we don't have
one so without that we're not going to
be able to get into this database from
the internet because the rule has not
been defined to go through the end of a
gateway so select a range from any
device so let's go back yep so
originally it didn't connect because
they didn't have their own but not
included in there let's see if I can my
prompt and now connected to that
instance that's hosting my database so
you can see how security plays a big
role in they were fouled by turning on
and off certain rules and allow we're
not allow access to your database from
outside the internet or even from within
the cell for instance from a natural
very strong security and least two
objects the route table would rule and
the security lists are key to enabling
secure access to your oral database okay
with that that's a very short demo on
secure access to an Oracle database we
can open it up for for Q&amp;amp;A
okay hey Milton thank you so much for
going for this demo I think especially
like you mentioned for DBAs who are
getting into the realm of moving their
databases into the cloud we see a lot of
questions from them about how to
configure the networking how to
configure the security with these
environments so I think the details that
you went through are gonna be you know
very useful in that regard maybe if you
can briefly talk about you know the
customer situation we had or the
customer we helped recently where you
know the DBAs were very comfortable with
debugging issues and networking and
storage on Prem but they were very
concerned about how they do it in the
cloud and I think it might help the
audience if we can briefly talk about
you know the suggestions we had for them
very few very simple things that they
need to configure in order to be able to
get access it all has to do with these
two rules here
very few things that you need to do in
the Oracle cloud and the two most
important ones are listed here is the
route rule so anytime you're trying to
get to the Oracle database from the
internet from any device you need to set
up a route rule and
that allows this device to access
through an Internet gateway in the orbit
specify that and then the IP address of
that device were we're range of devices
so it allows access into the Oracle
cloud Network the Internet gateway and
then secondly very important is to be
able to access the database itself
through the proper port using the right
protocol and again from the IP address
needs access to this database so very
very basic two rules that you need and
once once the DBA understands this they
can get in a database something ranked
fairly quickly on the Oracle cloud okay
you know thank you with that I guess
yeah the bottom of the are unless there
are other questions we should just wrap
it up again in the thanks everybody for
attending and thanks Milton Adrienne for
supporting this section ok thank you
