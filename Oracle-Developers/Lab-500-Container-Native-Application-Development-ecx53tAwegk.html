negative application development
workshop in this lab we're going to
extend our existing application with a
serverless function to do this we're
going to assume the persona of Derrick
and we want install F in on our local
machine and test the function locally
then we'll install FN on kubernetes
making use of helm so let's get started
to begin with we're going to go out an
issue an FM start command that will
start F in on our local server
there it goes it looks like it started
next
go out to our browser and just confirm
that everything is up and running
and we can see here with the hello world
result that it is now that it's up and
running we're gonna go out and actually
clone down a function from github that
will resize images and we'll deploy that
function to our local install of FN once
deployed we'll execute a curl command to
just simply test to make sure a function
is up and running correctly in our local
environment and when it completes we can
actually open both of our JPEGs to see
the original image and the resized image
after the function ran next we're going
to go into our helm directory and
specify the version of helm that we want
to run for this particular project
and then upgrade on our local client
bill to make sure all over to
in place
and then we'll begin issuing a series of
coups ETL commands by default we don't
have an account on this particular box
that can access our cluster so we'll
create a new system user cart called
tiller we'll go ahead and add tiller to
the cluster and then issue a helm
upgrade under the account tiller so we
can begin next we'll install helm
and once installed we'll gonna issue a
Kubb CTL command here to check the load
balancer now when I first starts you'll
see a status of pending meaning that the
provisioning is taking place on the
cluster but once you can see the
external IP you know that it's up and
running now that it's up and running
we'll go back out to or kubernetes
cluster and inside our kubernetes
cluster we can see that our install is
there along with the same external URL
we just saw at the command line now back
on the command line we're going to
export some variables to make the
commands well issue here a little bit
easier one of which is that external
endpoint that we just saw next we'll go
into our image resize directory and
we're gonna export of a variable for our
docker hub name since we are using an
external FM's server we'll use docker
hub to store our container moving
forward we'll log into docker hub and go
ahead and push this image up to docker
hub itself
next was your curl command against our
kubernetes install hub of the FM server
to make sure the function is working
correctly and then we can open the
converted thumbnail
with everything in order we'll go out to
our website
- click on the Browse button and then
upload the higher resolution image of
our stapler we'll see the conversion
take place and then place the lower
resolution version of the stapler on the
website itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
