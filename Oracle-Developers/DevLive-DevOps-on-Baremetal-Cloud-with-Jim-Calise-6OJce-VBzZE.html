in the heart of the city
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and we here
with the article dev lives into being
one of the speakers with Jim Jim where
you go with James Kelly's it's it's Jam
yes Jim yeah okay but Jim Kelly who's a
senior physical product manager
that's correct so Jim you're going to be
talking later today
Jana gives us give a brief overview and
then we can kind of delve into a little
bit of what you're going to be
discussing sure today we're going to be
talking about DevOps okay and
specifically DevOps
on bare metal cloud so so trying to get
the school closer to you yeah okay so is
that better now all right you did pretty
good of the sound check this think I was
holding it look I get you got it yeah
just hold after now okay so it just
rotates actually it should go towards
okay all right let's just go with that
all right all right it's not having too
much luck with it
sure go ahead I'll try to speak up okay
so it's it's dead out some bare metal
clouds okay so so our modern cloud
infrastructure that we've we just
released this past open world is the the
hottest topic for customers right now
talking about how they can deliver their
applications natively on infrastructure
and from a bare metal cloud standpoint
we offer bare metal servers VMs
containers and a whole host of
associated infrastructure related
services and and the big question that I
get a lot in in my time that I spend
with customers is well how do I automate
the delivery of the infrastructure my
application on the infrastructure and do
it in an automated fashion so
that is the lead-in I mean that's what
that's where the focus is so I've looked
at a set of tools I'm going to talk
about you know some recommendations
around tools that I think fit I'm going
to give some insight into where we're
going with the product and from a
developer perspective and some of the
new things that we will have available
to you to move the DevOps experience
even easier are we talking about a
developer cloud service I I will talk
about it at a high level I forget I
don't have it in the demo just yet okay
this is a I'll discuss sort of okay when
I talk about build automation today in
the demo it's going to be Jenkins space
okay where I have Jenkins running within
my own virtual cloud network on a server
that I'm managing myself let's talk
about pros and cons right so so why
would you want to go a dead sea s versus
doing on your own well number one doing
it on my own I had to spend all morning
worrying about making sure my dev server
my dev appserver was up with a any
issues with it you'll see in the demo
that it's telling me that I need to
upgrade it there's more work for me to
do where if I was relying on the service
who it would you know take care of all
of the legal and care of all that for me
so we'll talk about that today you know
just you know asking the question you
know the decision points in the process
that will guide you down one path or
another
okay so DevOps is about two things I
guess I guess there's about a lot of
things depending on who you're talking
about
it's about business models it's about
automating whatever you can it's about
changing culture okay I mean what are
your thoughts I mean obviously you know
you've got everything from you know this
code repositories like git and as you
mentioning the the continuous build
continuous deploy all of those kind of
things I mean it's great that all of
these tools are available but in the end
how do you get these groups that are
kind of normally at 180 degrees from in
terms of what they want to accomplish to
kind of a coordinator as around these
tools or work with these tools and
that's a that's the million dollar
question because nothing and that's what
I that's what I see every time I talk to
a customer is that the devops from a
tools perspective is pretty well defined
that's what we'll focus today is on the
tools but internally for for to adopt
this it's fundamentally a question
around change management they it's about
changing behaviors changing practices so
I think you know the the first step in
that change is is really looking at
cloud as being the enabler so as as
customers are adopting more and more
cloud providers you know fair metal
cloud is at the example today the
services that we can provide as Oracle
in terms of making it API driven
providing integration into the broader
ecosystem of tools around DevOps you
know having the hooks into third-party
providers like terraform you'll see
today around orchestration management
and services the more that we can
provide in that area from from a cloud
perspective I think it
Greece's the skids for adoption because
that that's been the hindrance on
premises is that for customers today
running on Prem they need to go ahead
like you know the debt the the build
server question they have to build and
manage all these api's on their own you
know the historically right it started
with we're going to we're going to run
private cloud and we're going to put
OpenStack in place well it became a
year-plus project to get their private
cloud up and running in the level of
success that they got with it well maybe
wasn't didn't achieve a hundred percent
and ultimately that hindered downstream
these DevOps projects and these these
changes that were going on
organizationally to adopt infrastructure
and think about the services in a new
way so my perspective is that from a
cloud providers view we can we can set
this to set the customers up for success
we provide the right tools we provide
the right capabilities from an API
standpoint to enable all of this
automation and will allow the customer
to focus on okay internally how do we
change
you know how can we how can we
reorganize our groups and teams and put
the right people in place because the
tools are there look at this demo that
you're going to see today how easy it is
to you know provision a docker based
application on bare metal you know it's
the benefits of going with bare metal
are just a fact that if you're thinking
a whole environment over it can you've
got full flexibility in terms of
bringing over everything or I mean the
big benefit from from my view is is the
is the fact that the bare metal cloud
offers you an api across all of our
services and we offer you the
fundamental primitives to build an
entire application from the ground up
those primitives are you know a virtual
cloud network right so you need a
network to run your application in to
run your servers in no one to bring it
up so we can define fully define the
network the security rules the gateways
to get traffic in and out of our are out
of that network in the client then it's
a matter of defining the servers the
storage do we want to use a load
balancer or not database as a service
and then when you look holistically as
we bring more more platform services
onto the bare metal cloud it's all part
of that same ecosystem so now you can
really start describing your
applications end-to-end from from all
perspectives right it's it's the
infrastructure it's the platforms that
are it's the vcn so we're giving you the
right foundation to start I believe with
within their metal cloud to drive a
DevOps practice and and you need those
primitives in place fundamentally so
that when we see today in the demo its
DevOps is in when we talk about
continuous delivery of an application
right we're making rapid changes and
what happens when we want to AV test our
application in the cloud so we already
have production up and running we're
pushing changes and we want to bring up
a like-for-like environment right beside
that same production environment maybe
not send traffic there but internally
we're going to test and validate before
will will flip the switch at the DNS or
a load balancer level well we need all
those primitives
right you'll see today where that will
with the network with our storage with
our load balancer service we can bring
up these like-for-like network so right
for like platforms or environments
rapidly side-by-side make changes and
drive that lifecycle forward great well
it sounds like a very interesting
presentation I wish I could attend it
but I'm going to be here but just for
the benefit of the the listeners or the
viewers out there what time is your
presentation on I started to 10 p.m. I'm
not sure which room now okay but to 10
p.m. Greenwich Meridian time yes is that
the right term so Jim thank you so much
for coming down
you're watching guys that the articles
have live here at the article called
London so all the best of the
presentation is thanks for dropping by
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
