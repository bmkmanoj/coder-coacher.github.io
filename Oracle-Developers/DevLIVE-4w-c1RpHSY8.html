plus-minus
you want it to be longer shorter shorter
shorter yeah but we we see we see it
just depends we'll just see how the
conversation goes all right so Lord are
you good okay
so this is all about VirtualBox okay
got ya sure
got development I'm moving to the cloud
okay thank you
all right welcome to another session of
dev life I'm your host Javed Mohammed
here at open world 2017 and I have as my
guest today Simon Carter Simon welcome
to the show and Simon is the director of
product management for which VirtualBox
is a boxer and a knocko VM so Simon I
think last time we met was in we were
just talking Moscow
yeah Moscow it's been a it's been a
while and here we are on the the back
home yeah home for me yeah for you
it's a how's the weather in Italy yeah
the weather now is becoming colder you
know it's autumn right so we're gonna
talk about a VirtualBox let's just first
of all this talk of at a very elementary
level for the folks so for the
developers out there who may not know
about it just give us like a elevator
pitch in 30 seconds one minute overview
what is VirtualBox yes all beautiful
boxes desktop virtualization solution
that you can really really easily
install on any desktop operating system
so it can run Windows Linux Mac OS ok
cool yeah all on the own on all the
Linux distribution and so on all let me
say the main x86 platforms at the end
and thanks to these desktop utilization
solution you have the option to have on
top of little box any x86 operating
system running on a single harbor on a
single system so it's a sort of very
interesting solution
mostly for developers because if you are
going for example to build your own
application able to run on many
different platforms you can still
continue to work on your laptop for
example because thanks to virtual box
you can test don't run your application
differently you don't need three
different platforms develop you don't
need one system with Microsoft Windows
and other Linux another Mac OS and so on
you only need one and on top of it you
can build your own games
virtual machines I ran your application
you can also develop your application
and the cool part is that when you
completed your software your solution on
top of this VM the Symbian can be easily
migrated to the cloud and when I say to
the cloud it can be the private cloud
like for example Oracle VM server
private cloud appliance or your co
public cloud and on these we also work
it a lot so lately we had the release
candidate one for Victor box 5.2 and one
of the main targets each of these
release had been the creation of a
breach between VirtualBox and the Oracle
cloud in fact now Internet the next
release of visible box five to two you
will be able to export the VM into the
format that Oracle public cloud would
like to have okay have we made public
when VM box 5.2 will be coming so we are
working to to have it available as soon
as possible our target is to have it
available by the end of the month
actually everyone can already download
and install the 530 release candidate
one so if either to release candidate
one is already available on public
website you can download it you can test
it you can work with it and then the
cool thing about it is free yeah
obviously VirtualBox beautiful box is
free so you can use for free on your own
desktop laptop environment is
open-source totally open source the
VirtualBox base package is totally
open-source GPL version 2 code and so
you can install you can modify the code
you can redistribute if you want so it's
totally open so who says the best things
in life aren't free yeah all right so
one thing so what I'm just thinking
obviously the the benefits of it are
very obvious instead of requiring
multiple types of hardware you've got
one platform what about from a
performance standpoint can you just
speak to that because usually when you
talk about virtualization there's a
overhead involved so can use to speak a
little bit to that yeah sure because
that may be a concern
into the latest 5.1 release that is
actually a release for VirtualBox we
already work it to improve as much as
possible all the performance is mostly
related to the i/o and that's it
another important thing to know is that
on top of a VM you can also install the
guest addition guest Edition is a
package able to bring you the best
performance is possible on top of a VM
running on VirtualBox this guest Edition
are available for all x86 platforms and
so thanks to this piece of software that
you can install on the VM you can also
query you can also have very good
performances from a CPU memory i/o and
also Network point of view well it
sounds like a very very exciting thing
people should go and check it out if
they want more details where do they go
is there URL beautiful box the talk is
our main website which of all the
communities war uh-huh but obviously you
you can find also many many interesting
things like documentation white paper
how to to get things also on our Oracle
technology website so on OTN ok all
right and I'll put that URL in the
description when I post it also sure
Simon always a pleasure talking to you
thank you so much for coming my pleasure
my pleasure of it thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
