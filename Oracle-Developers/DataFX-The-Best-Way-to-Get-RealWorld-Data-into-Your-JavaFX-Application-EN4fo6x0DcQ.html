way to get we were data into your Java
fix application and the first absolutely
awesome announcement we have is that we
have a logo yeah
maybe you've seen the the tech keynote
and data fix was mentioned and it was
only plain text there was no yoga so we
said okay we need a yoga absolutely and
okay I will give to John thanks Hank for
creating the logo and for many other
things of course so what's the mission
statement of this session we will see
how you can develop real-world
enterprise applications that use
real-world services and data I will show
how the data effects framework the one
that we will present today can help you
with the process of getting the data
parsing the data and rendering the UI
components so about us you see two
people here my colleague Hendrik Evers
and myself we also added the logos of
our companies because they sponsor our
trips there's actually a third person
which is Jonathan Charles from the
Oracle Java vex controls team who
couldn't make it because he's expecting
him a baby at least I think his wife is
expecting a baby
never know for sure of course so that's
a bit the history of of data effects we
actually started two years ago Jonathan
and myself presented at JavaOne the
first version of data effects and last
year I couldn't be here because I was
having a baby at least in my case it was
my wife having a baby so this year
Jonathan is not gonna be here because
he's having a baby so we hired Hendrik
to do all the work but maybe next year
he's not gonna be here because he might
be having a day
so definitely I have to give credit
because I told a few jokes now only
about my co-presenters and not about the
audience that's one thing I learned from
Jim Weaver was typically one of my
co-presenters and he told me never make
jokes about the audience so if you see
Jim leaving soon it means that I made
the joke about him and he doesn't like
me anymore okay so what is data effects
it's it's as you can see in the logo and
I hope I have the right interpretation
it's it contains different building
blocks we actually started with the cell
factories because that was what Jonathan
was doing for Oracle so the first
version of data effects contained cell
factories that were extensions of the
standard Java vex cell factories now the
good thing is most of those were
incorporated in I think if in Java 2.2
and more of them will be in Java FX 8 so
in the official Java VEX distribution
the other part that was there from the
beginning is the data sources part we
will explain that of course in detail
but the data sources make sure that you
can connect to any external data source
be it a rest service a database
connection a file system and that you
can grab the data in a Java FX safe way
we also added support for WebSockets
we're not going to talk about this today
but the repository is open so you can
you can have a look at it and we will we
will put more samples online and then
Hendrik added the concept of flow
context scope and for for facilitating
the process of moving between different
views or still maintaining the context
in this will be part of the presentation
so you probably saw at a technical
keynote or strategy keynote someone
needs to tell me the difference this
slide which is actually the I think the
architecture oh those a question okay
all right
that guy yes yes it's Jim he always
asked something I wasn't thinking
particularly at you but yeah go ahead
okay so it really takes the JavaFX
evangelist to explain that a technical
keynote talks about technical stuff and
strategy keno talks about strategy stuff
that's right
now I really understand why orgo need
evangelists so what did we see in this
slide at one of those keynotes we saw an
end-to-end architecture and I think that
that's important because if JavaFX
is used in real-world applications it's
more than just demos its end-to-end
which means that you will have a client
that talks to a back-end system and what
you see in this case the client was
talking both via web sockets as via
checks RS to back-end systems they were
using e gb through the two at the at the
backend so we we also had a similar
representation on how we see each other
vaccine the enterprise and what you
typically have in enterprise
applications is the multi-layered
approach where at the bottom you have
persistency and then you have the
business layer and then you have some
presentation layer what you see in most
web applications is that the browser
talks to the back end and the back end
has some sort of web framework with for
example JavaServer faces can be wicked
or whatever framework but what you also
see is that there are many desktop
applications now and even mobile
applications that use the rest protocol
to communicate with a back-end actually
even the browser if you use for example
angular you can also use rest to
communicate with the backend so this
rest abstraction is something that we
think is gonna be more important in Java
effects so in many cases if you need to
develop a client application in some
cases you might control the backend as
well but in many cases you don't control
the backend and you just have to take
what is there so you cannot plug in an
additional component in the backend and
maintain some state there so no you
really have to do with what the backend
supplies you
and now I will give it to a Henrique
he's going to talk about concurrency one
of the users that we needed to to make
sure the data effects is compliant with
the Java vex behaviors okay so in Dahlia
fix one there was all those data sources
and West api's and because of then you
can easily access West in your data in
your Java fix application and don't need
to think about motifs wedding for
example and there was a lot of moody
sweating stuff in data fix one in the
first version and for the second version
for data fix - we took others moody
sweating and congruence stuff into yeah
it's its own package so we have a
congruence your ever API in Dallas X
that we can use for our api's and that
you can use for your IP is okay why do
you need it so Java X is a single
sweated toolkit and yeah if you do some
operations that we'll talk a long time
you will block this single sweat that
you have is using for rendering for
example and yeah Wes code for example
may took some time so you will freeze
the application if you do rest cards
inside the application sweat so don't do
this at home and yeah we've done some
things with them you can handle all the
stuff I have some examples the first is
the data X executor
it's and JavaFX executors as this based
on the executor API from yeah Java is e
it's absolutely normal
Java is executor as you can see here but
the benefit of the data fix executor
it's an observable executor so by using
the data executor you can observe all
your tasks and all your sweats and all
the stuff and you can have a look at
them have a look at the progress have a
look at the title have a look what they
are doing actually so you can bind all
the sweats to you
to your view for example and maybe you
can show them in a list and henna or
your sweat analyst and show what these
sweats are doing actually because the
title is supported you can set messages
to a sweat and even in the sweat you can
change the message
what's the sweat is actually doing you
can yeah maybe you can create something
like this the sweat view in Eclipse when
you're in debugging mode and data fix
that have X executors supports all
concurrency tasks and classes that are
supported by the default Java is execute
a guy can run away and corner it and it
supports the Java fix concurrency
classes to like service or tasks and
additionally you can cancel all these
sweats and execute her stuff and even by
the UI because we offer a cancer method
and again are aware you can see ok a
Renata forests where you can render
those sweats and you can cancel them if
you want to okay
another thing is maybe you know invoke
and wait and from swing from the swing
utilities it's actually not part of the
open API from Java fix so in data fix
we've added this one and rate method to
our conclusion see users so that you can
yeah put one Everts
to the Java FX application sweat and
wait for them and we support whenever
and call away at the moment so we
support more than actually soon was
doing here yeah another great thing in
that fx8 too is that we have a lambda
support so I think everybody know we and
us that will come with JDK 8 it's
absolutely awesome and there's a stream
RP is absolutely quiet and you can map
and you use all your corrections and
filter them and do all the stuff and
yeah that's one problem if you have a
correction and you want to filter it and
I don't know we'd use it and you can use
and parallel there's a lot of moody
sweating stuff there's a special sweat
pool for the stream API and it's hard to
get this back to Java fix and to the
Java fix application sweat so we created
the stream FX API it's yeah it's a
wrapper around a normal stream a lambda
stream and by using the stream ethics
API you can put the data of the stream
back to the Java 6 applications but here
are two examples maybe we have a stream
it comes from a list maybe and then you
can easily publish them to an observable
list and there will be other to run by
one to this observable list in the java
application thread and so you can add
listeners and all the stuff we actually
know it from Java 6 ok now I will get
give back to John and he will talk about
data sources but before we're gonna do
that maybe we can show we created a demo
application and we can show that
application the reason we created it is
we wanted to eat our own dog food and we
wanted to make sure that what we were
doing is useful in practice so we have a
Java FX client for a Java vex community
so I will show it to you okay this is oh
this is not this is a client maybe I
could say some words about the kind
you're honest written this grant
completely and you know you're on this
sub tech guy he's not the UI guy and it
looked horrible to me and after I did
lots of effort I think I spent 10
percent of the time in the technical
stuff and 90% of the time in the user
interface and I wanted to show that user
interface but I didn't get clearance
from not from Hendrick from Jonathan
from Oracle from the Hilton from Oracle
OpenWorld and so what I did here is
maybe you are in my in my accordance CSS
session we've created a style for Java
Fiera and we skin this application loose
weather and this was for me a very
positive sign that you can really
absolutely good skin java application
even if they look absolutely bad before
so okay that's enough about the UI off
secure and you're on will tell you more
so he learned as well only make fun
about your co-presenters even my
applications can with minor
modifications can become much nicer
that's good news for java vex and for
developers like me maybe if you can very
briefly show this application is a java
vex community where people can log in
and enter at content they can comment on
our content but maybe you first need to
log in of course before you can add
content or well maybe i'm heinrich if
you click on add content you'll probably
get the nice information that you need
to be logged in so you can log in we
support a Twitter login don't you hate
it that every time you need to test
something you need to create a new
account you need to remember your
password it's sent by email it's it's in
your spam folder so you don't find when
you find it back it's expired so we
don't do that you use your regular just
begin again it's you had it your Twitter
session was expired okay yeah maybe the
Wi-Fi you get me started again yeah
maybe let me see
is that the problem I only have one son
aboard and I can use the screen or the
Ethernet so I need Wi-Fi here hope it's
working maybe you miss type your
password can you spell it out again okay
wait so users are content users users so
these are the users that are currently
in the system this is open source we
will show you the link at the end and we
invite you to download it run it and it
will automatically be connected to it as
well so now Android is logged in and you
can add content so maybe you want to
show that it's all going to a back-end
system that talks rest and that will
accept content that will list the
content and that's that's actually the
use case that we used in developing the
data sources to add a few categories
because I don't know you can you can add
some comment as well yeah you can add
comments
you're writing a new article now but
that's okay you can you can sort all
articles by votes because you can also
vote cf5 up for zero down vote so lots
of things that you can do with it and
the main thing is you can use this is
actually all of the data effects samples
we have them what this is actually our
uber example so if you want to see how
to use it in practice you can look at
the code and we will briefly show one
method at the end of the talk so okay
enough fun back to slides it's an orican
friends after all so the data sources
what's the goal of the data source
sources we want to obtain data from a
variety of sources in a variety of
formats that's a difficult order for
variety and we want to make sure that
the data can be used in observables and
observable lists so we want to leverage
the Java vex observable capabilities so
the variety of sources that means that
can we have enough we have a class that
abstracts all these sources the data
reader and a variety of formats we have
a converter abstracting this so the
architecture is that somewhere there is
data can be on a file system can be a
rest source can be a JDBC and at the
bottom you want to have this data in
your Java FX controls in an observable
or observable list the data is a fight
the data is processed by a data reader
converted by the converter and fit into
the data provider so the data razor is a
very simple interface it has only two
methods so it's a added generic type T
and you can get the next piece of data
and you can also ask if they're still
data available we provide three
implementations of data Reader which is
the rest source the file source and the
JDBC source but you are free to add your
own implementations so how do you use it
we have two approaches we provide the
regular approach and also the Builder
approach so we had internal discussions
about this because you probably know
that builders were the way to go in Java
vex till a couple of months ago and out
there no go anymore so but it's I think
it depends on your own choice do you
want to use the fluent API with builder
then you can use it if you don't want
you don't have to use it the static
footprint is minimal maybe just go so
the the if you don't use the builder
pattern you have to you create the rest
source and then you set all the
properties of that rest source manually
so you set the host where did the data
come from
you said you specify the converter more
on that later
you set the path and you set additional
query parameters header parameters in
this case we set the consumer key and
consumer secret that's because we
support all out and if you want to
encrypt your if you want to use or out
for the data authentication part you can
you can do that you can achieve the same
with the fluent API so it's really up to
you what you like so we have the data
reader which will provide the data as an
object of type T but we have we also
need to convert because data is coming
in from a different format it's not
coming it's mostly not coming in as a
Java object it's coming in as an input
stream or the JDBC source or something
so it need to be converted and therefore
we have the converter converter is also
an interface that can be initialized
first and then it's going to be called
by the data reader and get an next of
the data reader are mapped to the
converter we provide a few
out-of-the-box converters for example a
JSON converter that will map an input
stream onto JSON objects and an input
string remember can be a file input
stream can be a network source for
example if you have a rest service the
input stream will come from over the
network and the JSON converter or the
sibel converter will convert the data on
the input stream to a native java object
and if you want to create your custom
converters or custom data sources it's a
great benefit of data fixes that we have
those interfaces and if you implement
them you don't need to thing about
motivating or congruence you can just
write down your code and data fix will
handle all the stuff to fit it into the
java 6 application stream
sweat all right and that's because the
that stuff is taken care by the data
provider so the data providers will make
sure that the data that they retrieve
from the data reader and that's
converted with the converter is feed it
into the observable or observable list
instances and we make sure that it's all
that this only happens at the JavaFX
application threat because your user
interface might depend on some
observable list or observer value that
you still need to complete the retrieval
of this data isn't done in a background
thread as a Henrique explained that's
why we need the concurrency u2's
ourselves and that is manageable via an
executor pool and that's quite important
that it's a manageable via an executor
pool because what what I what happened
when I was working on the Java VEX
community client is I was getting all
the information of all the articles and
an article also has votes but the rest
back-end requires a separate call for
getting the votes of the articles so
there was one call for retrieving all
content which was in experiments and
maybe 10,000 contents and then I did
10,000 calls for just getting how many
votes does this content has and that
actually blew up my system because I was
trying to do 10,000 threats so each
request was in a separate threat and
10,000 threads that not manageable
anymore so if you use the executor pool
you can create and manage that we made a
distinction between object data provider
and list data provider we had some
internal discuss
about it but still in JavaFX an object
is treated different than a list and
rather than to abstract this into one
single data provider we have support for
object data providers and list data
providers again we provide builder
builder implementations and regular
implementations whatever you like so how
do you populate an observable o with the
retrieved value via the data provider we
actually support three ways of doing
this and that might not be the best
because developers typically want to
know what is the single best way to do
this but we don't know what a single
best way is so we provide three ways and
maybe in future versions we might
deprecated two of those ways but because
Java effects an especially Java vaccine
the enterprise is pretty new we don't
know yet what developers will like what
are the patterns that that are going to
emerge so we support three ways first of
all the data provider has a method to
get data and that will give you the
observable value data you don't know if
that value is already retrieved is it
field it's still being field you don't
know that but that's why it's an
observable value also the data provider
has the retrieve method which returned
the worker the worker process that's
used for retrieving the data and if you
call the gate value on this worker you
will get the value as well and you can
add listeners to this worker in order to
get notified when everything is done the
last approach and that's the one that I
use most often and that hendrik uses
less so that's why he wants to skip that
from the slides okay what I what I most
of the time do is I first create the
observable or the observable list and
then I pass it to the data provider and
I use a set result object property
method and then I don't care any more
about it I know that the data provider
will once it has a value it will it will
set that value so the difference between
the first and the third approach is that
in the first approach
you The Observer value is created by
data effects and in the dirt approach
the observer Bavaria is part of your
application and you just pass it to
dative X and it will fill it for you and
that's really fun effect I always do it
the like the first way so absolutely I
did it too when I was young so they
effect before I had a kid so data
providers we it's quite important this
is not just a framework for Java because
if this were a framework for java they
would probably be already a question
from the audience why don't you use
jax-rs
that's still a valid question or by the
way you can ask questions please ask
questions now because I have another
session at the 10:00 a.m. in the other
hotel so I have to run so interrupt me
and ask questions so we want to leverage
the additions of java effects over java
one of the important additions is java
VEX provides us with observable an
observable list another thing is the
threading system we have to make sure
that only the java VEX thread escape is
allowed to change the user interface so
that's why we can't use standard jax-rs
although the syntax are a bit similar
and maybe we will end up with
implementing the chacras client
specification but then in a java VEX way
so the list data provider and that's
actually one of the favorite things that
I like it will add entities to the
observable list result that you retrieve
we are one of the three methods shown
before and it will populate it while
it's retrieving data from the reader so
if you have a very long string of data
for example you want to to read all
tweets from a from from a long time it's
going to take a while but your
observable list will be filled gradually
as soon as data comes in so you can
already show the first pieces of data
while the other parts are retrieved
so this this you can use this for having
a very responsive application and well
or for example another example is that
on the mountain lists you you want to
see the 10 most important items first
and if you scroll down you want to see
them the other important the less
important items this is something that
we plan to support in on the API in a
cleaner way we call it on-demand support
but you can already do it now
by asking a list to the backend and ask
it to be sorted from important to less
important and it will be populated with
the most important first and less
important later right back support
that's something new so that's something
that we only added a few months ago we
got lots of questions for is for this
and what we actually mean is that until
now what we saw is that the backend
contains data and we want to retrieve
the data and we want to show it but what
then happened is that people said yeah
ok I also want to change the data
locally and then I want to send that
back to the backend so that's what we
call right back support that's not
possible in data of x2 there are some
some challenges though because you don't
want to write back all changes imagine
that you have a financial application
and you retrieve all the information
from the stocks and you want to do some
simulation so you said what if I buy
this and this and this and this now you
don't want that going back to to Wall
Street and automatically change the
price of the stock I also don't think
they allow this but it it would be a bad
thing to to automatically change
everything that's that's on a back-end
system and in many cases back writing
stuff back is more complicated than
reading because I think it works we they
have authentication they probably don't
allow anyone to change all the all the
quality information the granularity is
also different
sometimes you retrieve data in big
chunks and if you want to change
something you know do it in smaller
pieces so there are some challenges
so how this data FX allows this we edit
a an interface the right back Handler
and on the object data provider you can
call the set right back Handler and then
you provide your own white back handler
on the list data provider you can also
have the right back handler but
additionally you can add a set at entry
handler now what data effects will do is
when data is changed internally in your
user interface or in your application it
will call this right back handler when
data is added to a list that this has
been retrieved it will call the right
back handler provided by you how does it
have this right back handler okay so
this is actually how you do it
in code and I will immediately show how
we do it in the Java vector community
application but this is a how we we just
call the list object data provided set
by back Handler and then we create a new
right back Handler and an example of
such a right back handler is here this
is a JDBC example so we treat data over
JDBC from a database and we want to
change some data locally and put it back
this sample is part of the repository so
you can download data examples and this
is in this is in there so if we change
something in the user interface what
that effects will do is it will see oh
but this data is candidate for write
back support and I will call the right
back handler I will call the create data
source on this write back Handler and I
will pass the object that has been
changed and this piece of code is
something that you have to write because
data X doesn't know the protocol of your
application so you still need to write
the the protocol of how information can
be changed on your back-end
but you don't need to to track what has
been changed because that's part to you
this method is only called when
information has been changed and you
don't need to keep track of
was changing what we already implemented
this white back support in the rest
source and the JDBC source and we use
the same trading mechanism as in the
case of the data reader so you also can
be sure if that well this is something
to be honest that I forgot in the first
implementations so all right back
support happened on the JavaFX
application thread and it took a while
before I noticed it but every time I was
in the Java community application and I
voted on content user interface which
was raising for a few seconds
milliseconds but that was because it
happened in the application thread but
by using the same traveling mechanism
you don't care about it anymore because
it's all happening in the background if
you don't want all your data to to be
written back to the to the back end you
can mark some filters write transient
and then if you change them they're not
going to be changed in the back end if
you don't want to use this feature no
problem then you just don't provide the
right right back handler so I think
maybe I will show one one method that
illustrates this and you're free to
discover how we did it in the in the
demo application because we're gonna
allow the URL at the end
I'm typically developing in Linux
but this laptop has only HDMI support
and I couldn't get that working in Linux
so I mean Windows now and it's working
didn't expect that so this is a the
method get articles in the Java vex
community example where we retrieve all
the all the articles from the back end
so you see what were the first two all
the articles are in a model class did
did some of you attend adam beans
session yesterday on the enterprise
things i think what he does more or less
maps to what we are doing mean we use
more or less the same the same concepts
the only thing is he gives names to them
and that's actually a good thing so that
everyone knows what what what what
they're talking about so model think i
forgot the name but so that's where the
are all the articles are stored so what
i first wish i clear the observable list
then we create the json converter
because our articles are coming as json
data separated by attack adjacent the
field that the name of the json entity
is called data and we want to convert
everything to instances of article we
will then here we use the build of
approach so we create a rest source
builder we supply the converter that we
created the api is at some host name /
content slash list query parameter we
want to talk about articles we want to
sort them by creation date and order is
descending then we create the the list
data provider and here's what i what i
always do the the result observable it
should go to model table get articles so
i don't do anything with the result of
the list object data provider i know
that the articles will get populated
once they are retrieved and then we add
two handlers one is the write-back
handler
and the other one here is the at entry
handler so maybe very briefly how does
the at entry hundred worth we support we
provide an instance of white back
handler clause and we have to implement
the create data source this method will
be called by data effects when we add
one our client an article to the
observable list that's not yet
persistent in the backend and we create
again a new arrests orse
with again a json converter we supply
the form parameters that are required
for creating an article on the back end
and we return we'll return the rest
source that that we created rest source
as I mentioned implements data
writer question yeah that's a good
question so a number of options we could
have set remove entry handler so that we
have a separate handler for this and
then the article that has been removed
before it's really removed from the form
the list can be can be tracked data
effects notice because it's it listens
to all changes to the observable lists
so we got notified on on a removed sub
list so we could do that in theory it's
not set at hand and we handler can act
she also be used for articles that are
being removed if we call it set yeah
least changed handler so that way we
could map the list the changes to the
observer blissed to a back-end but i
think set remove and three Henry's it's
probably more convenient the reason we
don't have it in here is we didn't have
a use case for it yet but the way we
create data effects is by having people
asking for use cases giving scenarios
discussing about it so I think that's
quite interesting
absolutely
yes it's a very very use case now this
is only here for I think three months so
we don't have everything yet but that's
that's definitely a good use case and I
can almost guarantee that it's gonna be
there in a next version or if you want
to contribute you're very welcome to do
so we provide the information at the end
but we will think that it will fit into
this API by doing all those who sent us
to simply I don't we move vendor yeah
it's I think there's there's clear
complimentary fit so if this I will hand
it over to a Hendrick who is going to
talk about the controller API so this
was in a nutshell and maybe it was a bit
too fast too much information but I'm
gonna talk to stefan's in the the
content organizer to have one because I
think next year we can use it
data effects track because there's so
much to tell it didn't fit in a single
session but we can have a separate track
that would be that would be appreciated
okay so I want to show you the
controller NPI and the controller a P is
an absolutely new part of data fx2 okay
in Java X the default Java fix API when
you create views you most we will use
XML to define your web view and normally
you will have a controller it's a
controller class that is linked to your
ethics Ameri you you see an example yeah
it's a very very simple XML file and
yeah the main component is an each box
and there you have this FX controller
that is linked to my gum GUI gosh my
controller class and this controller is
used forces F XML file so in this
control as you is then you can access
the buttons of the FX ml5 or the text
fields and do some stuff and this is how
it's normally done in
JavaFX to create yeah
model-view-controller saying you know
and for data a fix we've taken this api
and yeah maybe changed it a little bit
we do some inversion of control because
i have a program versus with this code
at the bottom
first of all those java class as a
string so if you do a factoring the
class for example in Eclipse yeah you
have here a class that isn't anymore in
this package for example another thing
is if you maybe a create company and you
have designers for example or gay
artists who do all this F XML and CSS
stuff they don't don't know any Java
classes and so they don't know what the
controller and what's to it here so we
made a inversion of control and say okay
we're Java developers we create a
controller and want to add an ethics and
air fight so a view to this controller
because in the controller you know okay
I need this and this and this buttons
because there are action handles on this
buttons for example and then a designer
can create the ethics ml and yeah this
can then fit to the controller and okay
here's a very short example how this
looks we have to this detail view
controller for example and yes there's
an annotation called ethics an air
controller and in this con in this
annotation you can set the name of the
ethics and air files that will be used
by this controller you can use all those
ethics m/l annotations that you use
before and yeah if you don't have such a
fix an air controller annotation this
will work too because it uses
vention of a configuration as mentioned
on the bottom of the slide and then it
will look for a detail view dot F XML in
the same package SS controller is
additionally in the controller API we
have support of default you have
annotations like the post construct
annotation which is part of Java SE and
you can use it for an init method for
example to yeah do some initial stuff
yeah and as you see this is a ethics ml
file that fits to this controller and in
this effect Samantha there's absolutely
no and from a Java information just yet
do you don't see the controller class
and all the stuff so you can easily do
all the stuff with the scene builder for
example designer can do it and then
offers this way out to the development
team you can say ok now we have the
sensors in this button so our controller
may look like this one in data fix we
provide a factory to create all the
stuff so you only need to post the
controller class to this Factory and you
will receive yeah the controller and the
view and all the stuff yeah and you can
simply inject all your notes by for
example F XML in your controllers
another thing that we've added is a view
context maybe you know this from Java EE
where you have context like the
persistence context where you simply can
inject data providers for example in
your controller classes or in your yeah
business classes and with a controller
API of data f6 we support two different
contexts it's the application context
and the view context and you can write
in Java EE you can simply inject
contexts by using annotations and you
know what you can do is contacts as you
can we give store your data model
or your data fix data sources for
examples - in context yeah here's an
example where we have a controller we
have this textview that is injected by
the ethics and error notation and now we
have this effect some view context and
notation and this is a view context
forces controller and in the init method
I use a view context to get to receive
my data model from the view context and
then I can for example bind my text
field to the data model so if the
directed part in the data model changes
my text read will change automatically
and the great thing is that you can set
the data model from outside because I
said we have to factory where everything
is created reactor controller and the
view and other stuff and you can add
data or data model to the context from
outside of the views so it can inject
easily your data model and your business
logic to the controller so that you have
a separation between the view the
controller and he has a business data
model okay so you can create your views
with a fixham air you can use a todos or
the data of X data sources for your
model you need a controller class and
unit then you can bind all the stuff by
using annotations and yes then you're
done and you have a very lightweight
model view controller concept and yeah
we created this mostly because we wanted
to this so now comes the the floor API
and the floor API is to create floors to
create view flaws in your java
application because we suppose a
controller API you can simply create one
single view with the view the controller
and the model and in a business
application you must
have different views for the things the
simple example is a master detail view
wherever a way of a mass W with maybe a
table and if you want to change data you
click on a role in the table and you
come to the detail view and there you
can change all the aspects of this one
wine in the table and go back to the
master view for example and that's what
the floor up API will provide you so as
I said the controller API is good for
one view but what if you want to do this
you have different views or different
different model view controller packages
for one view and you want to link
between all those different views and to
do this in Java ethics even if you have
ethics impaired and other stuff it's not
not really easy yeah you need to create
action is enough on the buttons and then
here we move the current view and add a
new who you create the view do all the
stuff and we try to do this more easily
for developers to develop yeah business
applications so I have an example it's a
master detail you I already taught it
will have an master view and a detail
view and we want to use F XML and switch
between this two views maybe delete data
on the detail view on the master view
and very important to decouple all the
stuff because maybe sometimes you have a
third view that you want to add to this
view floor and it must be very easy to
add new views to the slow or to remove a
view for example ok so this is how it
looks you as a master view you won't go
to the details view by maybe King a
button or something you were going to go
back to the master view and in the
master view you want to delete a row in
the table for example so by using the
controller API every uu has its effects
ml5 and its controller class as it's
normally in
JavaFX and now is using data fix flow
you can create yeah through your views
for all your views here's an example you
can simply say if XML three of you must
have you its
FX M f12 you create and then the
controller class and then this will do
all the stuff this will create the
controller this will create the view
based on ethics and as we create all the
context of where you can add data it's
then you can say master view dot get
view context dot at my data model for
example okay when you created this both
views you need to bind them and here's
an example how you can bind two views
it's it's a back example you can say
okay detail view will change view action
and then we have a name it's called back
it's a new nickname and the master view
because whenever the back actually
happens we want to go back to the master
view another example is a delete action
in the master view because the you don't
want to have another view so we only
said okay we have says delete it's a new
nickname it's the action name and then
we can add the delete action class that
will handle the delete stuff yeah I you
can use a controller API to create all
the views and then you can define floor
views for each of the views and then you
can link the views by adding this
actions and you can add custom actions
to to your view all so and now it's a
question how can I use this action to
access link actions or those custom
actions that are created that's very
easy you can see it for the back button
it's a yeah it's injected by the ethics
and err annotation and there's a new
annotation called flow action and you
can simply add this annotation to button
for example and then you say okay my
action lettuce in the flow has a name
back so we add the flow action
back to the button and whenever you
press this button the view will change
and who will go back to the master view
from the detail view automatically
without doing anything and for the floor
we we added some more annotations which
are Java SE default annotations react
for example pre destroy so if you switch
between the views in the floor this post
construct and pre destroy methods will
be yeah called so for example to
deregister something in the view or to I
don't know to clean up your data model
want to views closed for example okay
and to share your data between this use
we've added a third context to the floor
API so yes this view context and the
application context in the controller
API and now we have this view floor
context for through all in this view for
your context s and scopes that is yet
the view for context we've over one
through all so everything that you
inject in a view floor context you can
use in the complete flow for example
your data model in the master detail
view you will have a master detail you
will use the same data model so you can
inject this data model to your view
floor context and use it in every view
of this flow you don't need to you know
detail view dot set data model or
something like that from the master view
because by using this flow the master
view don't know the detail view and the
detail view don't know the master view
sir only thing that links between these
two views this is for actually
annotation and that's only a string
caught back so the detail view never
knows the master view and you can simply
add views between them or we move a view
without any pain and you can share share
your business logic or your data model
by using the view floor context yeah as
I said by using this API you don't have
dependencies between the views and you
can we
all those views and you can reuse all
the actions and you can configure
everything by using annotations the
controller API and in the fuel API okay
so this was a very first look at this
flow and controller API and yeah it's
not enough time to show it in in deep
are there any questions for this topic
okay okay yeah I understand the question
the question was if I use this a fix an
air controller annotation does yeah yeah
does I have the controller properties to
in scene builder right at the point you
could add the control annotation to the
FX and air so if you want you can edit
there - but if it's wrong it it the
controller API won't use it but simply i
can use it if it's there so it will be
ignored by the controller api yeah but
we're out of time and we have three
months right so maybe if there are other
questions for the flow and the
controller IP you can ask me after the
session you can ask him questions about
the data sources as well yeah absolutely
okay so we have some more stuff that we
couldn't show you today yeah for example
the cell API that's the part that
Jonathan was doing but he's not here and
we don't dare to answer questions about
that because the typical questions about
the cell factories or more to do with
the official JavaFX thing and we don't
have to say we can't answer anything but
it's a the important thing is it's part
of data of X and it's
it makes it even easier because we now
ended with populating observable lists
and so but how can you change the
appearance of an entry in the list view
for example that's that's what's done in
the cellar API the web socket API is
something that we didn't discuss here
but I want to order some people
interested in having this web socket API
in data effects okay because we want we
also really want to know what should we
add to date effects file source is also
something that we didn't discuss it's
something that I heavily use for our
source and restores are two data readers
so you can easily swap between them
during development I use a file so that
then contains JSON or XML static and
when we go to production or when we have
internet connection when the backend is
finally working you use the XML source
or sorry the rest source so there's
plenty of other things that we plan to
do but that we didn't do yet and with a
fire sauce for example you can do more
than just using JSON or XML you can
create images you can direct your images
from the file system by using the file
data source and the image converter for
example so it will heat the file and
yeah when it's done you have the image
and if it's and I don't know for gig
image for example it will take some time
so it was that I fix it's no problem you
will it will be in the observable object
once the tweet and all your applications
that never yeah freeze so if you have
more if you want to ask more questions
or if you have remarks you can go to the
website Java vex data org the code is
now in a bit bucket you can read it here
that's the data of Xcode and the code
for the Java community and oak is adding
them I think immediately after the
session absolutely absolutely
it's actually not that the repo is there
but the code is not in the way people
cause I had some network problems here
and on the Java fix data side we don't
link to this bit packet or data fix dot
F X we Poe actually because we created
it I don't
two weeks or something ago and the ring
in the Java fix data talk it goes to
java.net and this is our auto repo
so the bitbucket Dada fix that I fix
it's the white one better website will
be updated once Jonathan is awake the
the issue if Jonathan he's a Kiwi so he
the time difference between Jonathan and
us is 12 hours
that gives interesting conversations on
sky and any if you want to contact us
you have the contact information of
right one and we're walking around at
the conference I unfortunately well
fortunately because if you want to know
more about the backend of the Java
community application that's what I will
now explain in a park 55 mission session
yeah that this is a pathway I have
absolutely no idea about the backend of
the genetics community application so as
you want if you want to know more about
this thank you all for coming and thanks
