here at the developer week in Oakland
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and I have
as my guest today Caroline Wong who is
the VP of strategy and security at
Cobalt Caroline welcome thank you so
much for having me thank you for coming
double handshake that's so nice well so
so you gave your presentation yesterday
about perhaps we can just touch on some
of the highlights sounds great
so what did you talk about so my talk is
called why does security matter for
DevOps
okay I've been working in the
information security field now for 13
years and I'm actually always interested
in why security matters because of
course if an organization chooses to
invest in security that means they're
choosing not to spend that money in
investment somewhere else so DevOps
happened and it changed the world for
security people in the past in a good
way or a bad way I think it's in a good
way uh-huh I think that it's a I think
it's a natural effect of any change that
folks who are used to doing it in the
traditional way they get a little shook
up and and at the same time I think
there are some tremendous benefits and
and and actually I would argue that the
traditional way the old way maybe it
never really worked that well in the
first place
okay so when you've got a waterfall
software developed methodologies of
course when you're releasing code every
year every two years there's time to put
gates in between each phase of
development and each gate gives the
security team an opportunity to do a
security review excellent now that
changes with agile and that really
changes with
DevOps and so the focus has actually
changed in the past there had been a
focus on network security protecting the
perimeter trying to keep the breaches
out today vendor security matters a
great deal
every organization relies on vendors in
order to make their software happen
mm-hmm and by working with those vendors
also take on whatever security risk is
involved and there's a lot more open
source that's out there now - is that
correct right so it's it's not only
third-party components but also open
source code so there's a lot of
dependencies on other people for the
code that makes up any given
organization's products and services and
on the flip side most software companies
are also vendor themselves who serve a
customer which is curious about their
security so now that everyone is so
dependent on everyone else
security actually becomes a driver for
sales because an organization decides
they want to buy some software product
or service from another organization and
in the sales process there is a question
what are you doing about your security
and in particular what are you doing
about your application security because
a lot of organizations are using the
cloud and so there's a focus much more
on applications and api's than there is
on the network which traditionally had
been a focus okay is this new is this
the DevOps ech is that what we different
yeah so DevOps is a thing dev sec ops or
the circles that folks use to describe
it okay and and in these conversations
there's a lot of talk about automation
of course automation is a huge part of
what makes DevOps successful I actually
think that automation can only get you
so far when it comes to security there
are entire classes of security
vulnerabilities which cannot be detected
automatically and so I actually
recommend
a high-touch approach to security
testing meaning that for example
penetration testing teams should be
actively engaged with the development
teams who are producing applications
that they're trying to secure mmm
I encourage a really collaborative
approach to securing applications it's
very interesting that you're actually
talking but even though the whole of one
of the key philosophies behind DevOps is
about automation but I really find it
interesting that you're talking about
whereas automation is usually low touch
you're you are advocating the opposite
which is my touch approach yes that's
correct and it is you know maybe it's
not a popular opinion even if we take
security out of the picture and we just
talk about software development there
are certain types of tests which are
more easily automated than others
obviously unit and component test
integration test performance tests these
are the sort of things that can be
automated easily but any sort of story
level test usability testing really any
sort of test that requires human input
or human opinion of course cannot be
easily automated and when you think
about security the people who are trying
to attack these systems yes they may be
using some automated things to help them
out but at the end of the day what
they're really using is their brains and
their creativity and their intelligence
and on the security side we've got to
find and fix and prevent security
vulnerabilities again using our brains
and not just rely on technology and
think that an over reliance on
automation you know simply results in
missing something yeah when you're
talking about testing it kind of reminds
me way back when I used to be an
engineer in the age of the dinosaurs
testing and I remember a lot of the
issues that we will come up with it
wasn't like in basic simulation or test
it would be obviously it's kind of like
boundary conditions and I'm just kind of
curious is that is that there's
automation help there is that really
more where the manual and
the high pitch approach can it works
yeah so there's this concept of misuse
and abuse cases many developers are used
to thinking about applications
functioning the way they are intended to
function it is a different way of
thinking to consider how might something
be either accidentally misused more
intentionally abused and of course you
know there exists security technology
that can look for some patterns to
determine if you know some very obvious
things are out of place but a mistake in
business logic for example an
application that has a workflow that is
my forgot my password flow or or an
employee or an encryption implementation
these are the types of security mistakes
that are that can be much more difficult
to determine simply by automated means
okay well this is a fascinating
conversation cover
I think obviously we've been a lot of
the conversation has just been about the
basics of DevOps so it's interesting
that the conversation is taking good
going to the other movement is going to
the navlab next level taking security
and getting you know dev sack ops so
just as a kind of concluding thing where
is it at as a movement the dev sack that
we still kind of like it very much in
the early stages of adoption or where do
you see it
so DevOps in of itself according to
puppet who publishes the state of DevOps
report they've been doing this for four
years according to them only 27 percent
of organizations surveyed are even doing
DevOps well and then you consider
security that being said in the security
community there's a lot of talk about it
and so I think there is an openness to
try and embrace the new way of doing an
awareness yeah it's early it's ages you
know I don't know that a lot of folks
have it figured out but there are people
who have done it and they are sharing
their stories so that the rest of the
community
can learn well Caroline it's been a real
pleasure having you over and a
fascinating conversation and perhaps at
future events we can do a follow up I
would like that very much thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
