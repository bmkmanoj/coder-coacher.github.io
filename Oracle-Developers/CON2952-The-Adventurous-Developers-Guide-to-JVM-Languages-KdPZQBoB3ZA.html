session and develop the adventurous
developers guide to JVM languages the
bit about me before we start I'm Simon
maple SJ maple i work 40 company called
zero turn around I've actually got a
booth here today if you wanted some some
cool swag I'm a dell evangelist at zero
turn around but I've been working there
for maybe about three years now before
zero turn around I worked for IBM as a
developer on websphere application
server for about 12 years any Webster
uses a couple of happy people
see I worked on from about version for
up to about 8.5 a little bit about me
then I created something called the
virtual jug has anyone heard of the
virtual jug here quite a few cool cool
virtual jug is an entirely online java
user group so we get the top speakers
from around the world and to present on
the virtual jug people like james
gosling people like arun gupta Simon
Ritter Joshua Bloch loads know the
really top speakers and they come and
present you can ask them questions you
can interact with them and we were
almost about 5,000 members now have only
been going a couple of years so do do
feel free to check that out entirely
free run by myself so virtual jog calm
for that I also run the London jug with
Martine Verburg and Barry cranford I'm a
java champion a Java one rock star and
also rebel labs offer so I do a lot of
writing on rebel labs which is content
site from zero turn around so feel free
to go check out the reports and blogs we
do there as well so that's a little bit
about me I forgot about this bit this is
a fun bit so I just gonna do a quick
poll of of the audience today and what
we're going to do is we're going out
we're going to work out who has heard of
each of these languages before we start
and who has used each of the language
any language developers themselves here
by me yeah a few oh no not not as in
developing in these but actually
creating the language no all developers
okay cook so I'm going to assume that
everyone's heard of Java hair here in
the wrong conference any dotnet uses it
I'm loving the mask I'm gonna assume or
shall I seen that has anyone not use
Java the cameraman has paid his hand up
that's where he that's very amazing
who's heard anyone not heard of groovy
just one right up at ninety nine percent
who's anyone not used groovy probably
about sixty percent
I say 33-percent have used who's anyone
not heard of Scala okay back 99 let's
change it this time just to keep on your
toes who's used Scala before I say that
like it's a drug he's used fifteen
percent who's heard of Kotlin care about
15 again who's used Kotlin that makes me
sad who's heard of salon or sale on it's
good for about a tenth and who's used
sale on no one who's heard of extend few
people and used extend or pretty good
fan some of the others will leave them
for now so let's hit play so this is
this is actually very very common when I
give this session that the top three
pretty much everyone has heard of the
Groovies the scholars the the job is not
obviously just because they're very very
popular but also because they have
actually been around for quite a number
of years some of the newer languages the
extends the salons the Cotton's that's
very very regular as well people people
haven't either heard of them and very
few people have actually used them what
we're going to do today is we can
actually go through all of those
languages that we discussed we're going
to look at what makes them popular what
kind of makes them different to Java now
here's a quote most people talk about
Java the language this may sound odd
coming from me but I could hardly care
less I don't want to guess who's
actually a quite a well-known maybe
comment anyone know who said that
Gosling has james gosling who said that
back in some date we might see in later
in the slide actually that was they go
2011 that was actually a little a little
snippet of what he said what he actually
said at the end which is very key is
that at the core of Java the core of the
Java ecosystem is the JVM the most
important thing about Java isn't Java
the language that is so crucial it's the
JVM the thing that made Java popular is
the JVM not java java is just a syntax
it's just your the way you communicate
with the jvm is just a syntax so really
what we're talking about here is the JVM
rather than just Java so let's look up
how popular the JVM is these are all
languages that were built for the JVM so
there will no there were no languages
like this outside of the JVM first that
were ported across these language was
these languages have been specifically
developed for the JVM if we actually
look at this next slide which is even
more impressive we have more languages
that have been ported over to the JVM
and this is to use you know huge amounts
of stuff like obviously things like the
memory management things like the
performance which is which has grown
over the 20 years the JVM has been
around and you know there's things like
garbage collectors there's huge amounts
of value in the JVM would which many
languages who have come across to use
there's a rebel labs reports which I
wrote all about is called the
adventurous developers guide to JVM
languages which is where this session
came from and this is one of the images
from this what we did was we actually
developed an HTTP server so we wanted to
do something a little bit more complex
than just hello world we developed an
HTTP server and in in all of these
languages they also notice phantom and
closure in here and what we wanted to do
is just see how easy it was from
literary documentation and learning to
actually trying to do some interesting
things things with byte arrays things
you know these kind of things that you
always you know need to get a little bit
deeper for and we're going to look at
each of these apart from phantom
enclosure for time reasons and we're
going to we're going to see our
implementations of them a couple we
won't most of them we will now if we
look at the dates we have Java around
1995-96 scala 2001 groovy 2003 you know
all these languages have already passed
the 10-year date this is this is very
very crucial for a language and it's
because it has great contributors but
also the ecosystem round it not just the
ecosystem but the community and its
importance massively important for
languages too as they grow to have that
community you
also notice salon Kotlin and extend the
ones at the bottom fairly young but you
know four or five years old already
these are kind of there's a lot of
innovation in some of these languages as
well as we'll see the differences
through there's also a lot there learnt
from some of the older languages it's
very crucial for me to point out here
that I believe Java wouldn't be where it
is today if it wasn't for some of these
new languages or even scholar and groovy
pushing Java if what you know when you
don't have competition you tend just to
you know believe it's okay to meander
through life but when you have the likes
of scarlet the likes of groovy but
actually taking from the from you know
the members of the java community
because people will move across whether
it's foreclosures for anything like that
then then that's where jar actually
thinks well maybe we should add you know
lambdas or streamed or whatever into our
language so i think personally i don't
think we would have lambdas here today
if it wasn't for many of these languages
okay so we're going to talk about a
little bit about Java 8 first now I'm
going to take you through lambdas and
streams job rates are really quite old
now and i'm sure you've probably seen it
already today from from some other
sessions but one thing i am going to
talk to you about is one thing that
makes java very very different so many
of the other languages on the JVM first
of all because it's a very established
language but second because it is very
very widely used in massive enterprise
organizations and this is the fact about
backwards compatibility there are three
kind of unwritten rules which are very
very important when Oracle or you know
will the J openjdk release newer
versions of Java first of all don't
break binary compatibility secondly
avoid introducing source incompatibility
say things still need to link things
still need to be able to compile in the
newer versions and three manage your
behavioral changes so just because
everything links just because everything
compiles in the newer versions you don't
expect behavioral changes you don't
expect your application to behave
differently as a result and this is
crucial and this is where Java actually
differs from scholar quite considerably
because
garla when scholar versions come out
they don't really mind breaking these
compatibilities so sometimes you might
have to recompile sometimes you may need
to really these are these are things
which could very easily happen in Java
because you don't get this enterprise's
a very very you know wilt more more
willing to upgrade that version because
they know they don't have to do too much
their application they know they don't
have to recompile a bunch of libraries
that their application depends on but
it's not easy to do this and we're going
to look at a couple potentially of the
problems which we have seen in Java
right now which which because we've had
to adhere to these to these rules we've
had to kind of Bend away which we've
implemented some of the new features so
I'm going to pop over to eclipse okay so
the first thing obviously and I know
many of you are going to have seen this
plenty of times before so I won't go too
deep into it and the first part of a
lambda let's go to a lander example for
instance cuz part of lambda allowing us
obviously there to encapsulate some some
behavior some some some logic so for
example where we would have a runnable
with a run method and a bunch of
information we'd normally pre-job eight
encapsulate that as an anonymous in a
class in Java 8 we would just have a
lambda which would effectively implement
that run method it would be the behavior
in that run method and and we could just
pass that in and that would be that you
know rather than having to instantiate
an anonymous inner class we can actually
pass that behavior around we can do the
same with comparators for example and
other things but the one of the key
parts of the lander is is about the Sam
type that it that it effectively
implements a Sam type is a single
abstract method SI m and single abstract
method effectively just means one
unimplemented method on an interface in
this case this is clearly a Sam type it
has 11 abstract method called run
we also have this functional interface
which is just a kind of flag to tell the
compiler when you compile please make
sure that this interface adheres to a
SAM type if we wanted to use that for
example in an execute method here what
I'm gonna do we have a method called
execute which takes this action
interface that Sam type as a parameter
if I wanted to call that let's say pre
Java 7 so I pre java 8 i would i would
call execute i would create a new in a
class in that in a class i would
override the run and let's just say all
i'm going to do is when this gets cooled
with a string what i'm going to do is a
sisal assists out and let's print out
that name very very straightforward my
as a developer advocate I don't code
that much but let's let's see hello java
one so i'm sorry i'm still a developer
look hello java one so take fairly
straightforward but they know there's a
lot of lines there there's a lot of
additional boilerplate that we don't
need well we what we could actually do
is rather than actually create this
anonymous inner class because the type
that is the parameter in execute is a
Sam type we could actually just pass in
a lambda so here I might actually just
say sister ow whoops out and just user
just use a method handle print lane' hit
save if I run that again we get hello
job one so much much simplified and it's
much much easier to read much much
easier to maintain sometimes it's
obviously a little bit more complex than
that but but very very straightforward
now let's say I'm just a developer I've
written my executor my execute class I
am using this action interface and this
action to face has actually been
delivered by some third party let's say
that third-party is marked that
interfaces version one they can't change
that interface because if they change
that interface you know my my my code
won't work anymore I would need to
recompile I would
actually use it as a as a as an in-depth
as a land anymore it's not a Sam type if
this was a if this was a Java class the
the the interface was a Java interface
Oracle wouldn't get it wouldn't bear to
change that so what Oracle did was let's
create a stock method rather than rather
than have to unimplemented or abstract
methods on that interface they used the
key word default and as soon as I oops
as soon as I soon as I hit that that
keyword default in there all of a sudden
this is now a functional interface again
it works as a functional interface it's
a single abstract method interface and
the reason it's a single abstract method
is because i have an implementation so i
have added behavior and implementation
into a interface method the reason why
it's a default method and we can use
that that isn't a new keyword that's
actually a keyword that has existed in
java before so for example you know if i
had a previous a previous class that run
on a previous version and that was
called that was called default if I if
in job right they brought out a new
keyword we might already have those
words existing in previous versions of
Java code so we can't just introduced a
new keyword we have to have an existing
keyword in Java um so yeah just just
simply by adding that means we means we
can we can have that behavior again so
why is that important well it's it's
important to be able to have that that
default method because it means we can
use lambdas in existing in existing
collections and that's that's the key
part of of what's happened so let's go
to a example collection let's go to a
list just an ArrayList Java 1 2015 as
three values and that previously if I
wanted to extract that
do a print linen each one of those
values I'd need a for loop to go around
than a system outdoor printing on it
each time I iterated through the for
loop but because list I think is
actually on iterable has a new default
method called for each I can maybe just
say system.out.print learn if I run that
we get java 1 2015 so this is the value
in being able to being able to add this
default method is that we can we can now
apply it to existing classes in the jar
in the java runtime without needing to
force the users to recompile their
classes which have either implemented or
extended those original java classes
anything that extends list or anything
that extends iterable will now have that
for each method you don't need to
recompile with your own for each
implementation because we have added
implementation into the interface so
that's great but the problem and all
those all those hoops were really
because we didn't want to break
backwards compatibility but what does it
actually mean now to the language well
if I was to give you an interface that
had 10 methods and each of those methods
had an implementation so in other words
there were no abstract methods at all
every single method had an
implementation and someone implemented
that what does that sound like to you
just an interface with full
implementation an abstract class what if
I was to create an abstract class that
was full of 10 abstract methods what
does that sound like to you an interface
so we're getting now we're getting
really really blurred ok when do I
create an abstract class when do I use
an interface we can effectively use them
both together ok an abstract class can
have state but because we're trying to
reach this interoperability this
backwards compatibility through java
we've had to have had to jump through
these hoops but I'm going to talk about
java 8 too much because it's kind of
well though its recent history is kind
of history the man people are talking
about it so let's move on to another JVM
language next we'll talk about Scarlett
how many Scarlett users to be have here
scholarly users okay so one of the big
things about scala is that static
there's a lot of people who probably
don't like using static stuff scala
doesn't allow you to have static keep
doesn't largely use the static keyword
within you know your class if you want
to use statics if you want to associate
things with the class you need to use a
companion class so you effectively have
all your instant stuff on one and your
companion class with all your statics if
you want to use that you have to import
it so it gives you that nice separation
other things there's no final key word a
lot of people say Java is very very
verbose scholar is one of the languages
which actually removes a lot of
verbosity we use Val and var how many
people in any java developers here will
when they when they write code will
always add a final to their variables
okay quite a few is very very that's
very common to see that kind of number
it is it's very important to write tight
code and one of the one of the ways of
doing that is to always start with a
value always start always starting with
something that's immutable until you
need to rewrite it it makes it makes the
code a lot lot tighter and one year sure
yeah this needs to be rewritten this
needs to be reassigned then turn it into
into a Val it's over now this is so much
easier in in many other JVM languages
because you don't have an additional
keyword you either have to have Val over
so you always start with Val always
start with Val and as and when you need
to switch it to a var and it's a lot lot
easier like that case class so there's a
there's a specific class you can choose
to use if you want to if you want to run
switch statements it's a lot stronger
when it comes to things like pattern
matching and that kind of thing
one other thing at the bottom here the
this status you'll notice this is an
instantiation of a new class you don't
have the new keyword but the more
important thing is this when we're
actually creating the class and we are
passing parameters into this constructor
we don't just have an into string we
then have a little bit more we have
title equals string body equals stuff
and this is called parameter naming and
for me this is something that should be
in every single language it's being able
to state the name of the parameter with
the value when you invoke a method this
is really useful because I'm sure
everyone in this room has seen this
you've looked at a piece of code which
is a method invocation that takes ten
billions and you look at the implication
goes call this method true false false
true true false false true true false
true false and you think right I need to
change one thing I need to change the
seventh true to false 1 2 3 4 1st is it
it's very very hard to maintain its much
much easier if you actually have these
names so you can see the seventh yeah I
just need to turn off I need to switch
off retries so I just I just switched
that question yeah I realized I realize
that should be a string good spot
yeah yeah that would be bad wouldn't if
you could write HTML in scarlet quite
like that but yeah you know it's really
really crucial for maintaining their
ease of use and it's just saves me
counting strings multi-line strings so
so cool why don't we have this in job 33
double quotes and this little s which I
believe stands for substitutional
scarlet substitution the multi-line
string part the three double quotes just
allows you to when you hit a carriage
return you can just carry on writing
there's no need for a closing double
quote only for a catenation what you see
is what you get this is what's actually
going to come out the substitution part
means i can add this a little dollar
sign some curly braces new date I don't
need to close off my string concatenate
another call I don't need to do the same
with variables it's just much much
easier to read no so you'll find that
different languages on the JVM will
handle null in different ways and this
can be quite contentious as to whether
people want to see their nulls or want
to kind of hide them away and ignore
them Scarlett chooses to use this option
type many of you are probably familiar
with Java 8 optional type sounds similar
actually is similar an option type is is
a superclass of both the some type and
the nun type the some type means it is
an entity which has a value in it and
none type is effectively just this this
type that says I have been returned
nothing please do something with me you
can't access this file inside the option
type directly you have to then say I
think it's option get something get
value or something like that and then
you get the file out then you do
something with it so this is telling a
caller of this method that you believe
null can be returned and you need it's
it's a special case that you need to be
aware of you'll also notice there's no
return out of this this function no
return because everything is everything
is a statement everything is an
expression in Scala so the last item we
run through depending on which way we go
through this if else with it we they're
going to
some file or none so that's the type
that we are returning because it's the
last statement complexity in Scala
everyone says Skyler's really complex
you can write beautiful scarlet codon
it's not complex at all as maybe an
imperative programmer you can write
amazing functional code and it'll be
absolutely beautiful you can write a mix
there's no there's no there's no one
common type of scarlet programmer that
writes the same code as the next scarlet
programmer and it's hard enough to read
other people's code sometimes when
you're both coding imperative but when
there's a mix different people are going
to favor different things it's one
reason why there's you know additional
complexity anyone heard of SPT here not
sure if it's called the simple build
tool or the Scarlet built or if it was
the simple built or it's the most ironic
build tool named you have ever seen you
don't write them from scratch you copy
paste another SPT file there there's a
whole bunch of things including this
tweet which I saw a while back I think I
don't if there's a date there this is a
while back this guy's saying is this
normal scarlet code it's actually you
can see from the URL actually it's
Carla's this is the kind of code you
definitely need a coffee before looking
up and then after that coffee grab
another coffee because it gets worse
this is this is this is code that if
someone looks at this because you know
if you want if you had a team of 20 it's
going to be one smart ass that thinks
I'm gonna write some scholars code I'm
going to put that I'm going to check
that in but they don't realize is the
other 19 people have to support it and
and this is you know these are potential
reasons why why people perceive scholar
as being complex but you can write
simple scale code but not everyone else
will find it simple ok groovy everyone
likes adding things to their CVS yeah
makes us look really cool right just me
if you're a Java developer you're also a
groovy developer how cool is that so add
that to your CV any Java code you write
will also be compiled by a gravy
compiler so we're all gravy developers
how
done groovy many people say groovy is
Java supercharged it's actually way way
more similar to java than scholar is if
you wanted to move from Java you moved
to scala there's a much steeper learning
curve than moving to go to groovy there
are a number of night really nice things
that groovy does for example null you
could choose you could choose to
dereference your your variables much
much easier with a knowledge about
whether that value is a null or not so
here we have a very comical it's called
actually it's a it's effectively just a
safe null call what we're doing is we're
dereferencing address from user we're
dereferencing street from address
actually if you didn't have these
question marks if this was Java you know
if you've got a null pointer you won't
be surprised but you'd have to be very
defensive and your coding if these could
be null in groovy what you can do is you
can add this ? here and it makes this a
safety reference because what we're
saying is only dereference address if
user is non-null so if user was null
we're actually this entire statement
would actually return null rather than
throwing a null pointer exception this
is a point of contention some people
would prefer to get a
nullpointerexception I don't know why
these people would prefer that but some
people do prefer other people other
people prefer to continue processing
forward knowing one of these values was
known again here if we do successfully
dereference address if address is
non-null then we dereference street
straight from that again otherwise we
return null and keep processing forward
Elvis operators username ? Cole on
anonymous what this would typically be
in Java would be just username ? user
name colon anonymous so basically this
is the tertiary operator that says if
username exists then return username
otherwise return this string called
anonymous so it makes things less
verbose very very quickly
closures very very easy to define square
equals embraces I it times it it it
refers to an item so the numbers of the
item that we're dealing with next and
we'll see that in this collection here
we have one two three four wrapped up in
a collection and we're going to we're
going to call the square closure hooks
which we just defined upon that
collection so we take each item at a
time we take item one first we put it
through this function this closure 1
times 1 we get one returned we do the
same with 22 x 24 and we continue
through that through that through that
list so this is you know effectively
very very similar to running a lambda
across a stream perhaps in Java now so
these are the kind of similar things
which darbar is now taking on
collections we here we have a collection
of four names it's very very easy to
print those names and get get some nice
use of readable responses from it we can
also perform a filter across the across
those names so we might say that the
collection short names is equal to the
collection of the full collection of
names so long as this this expression
remains true and this this closure is
saying for each item check the size is
less than or equal to 3 if it is you can
pass that back to the to the small names
collection short names collection if we
then pass another closure across each of
them this is called each very similar to
for each then we get this printed so we
have lost the four letter name Fred
through this filter and then when we
bring that out we you see the new list
so very very straightforward very easy
to use dynastic this is a name I created
which will never take off but groovy
previously previous to version 20 was a
dynamic language so for example if we
had this code where we have a method
called some method spelled correctly
another method called test which cools
some method which has an extra m and an
extra e we would actually get a runtime
exception a
attic language would of course that
would fail compilation unless this this
mist typo'd method would conveniently
exist in 20 we have this type checked
annotation which we can which we can
apply which will mean that now we will
actually get a compilation error the
this this isn't a fully this type checks
annotation doesn't work fully in the
same way that it will in in you know
you'll get this nice type checking in
Java doesn't work for certain parameters
and stuff like that but but it goes some
distance okay this guy well most of this
person just the head really is as CEO of
zero turn around and he he wrote a tool
called jareb and for all three languages
that we've seen so far there's there's a
big problem and the problem is classes
cannot be reloaded once you once you
have created them j rebel is the tool
which you can use to live reload your
classes into run time without needing to
restart the JVM or your application no
redeploys this basically pays my flight
to java one so everyone going by jareb
yeah we save lives because as of I think
two years ago or so we calculated that
over 80 years of developer time has been
saved cumulatively that's about it
developers life so yeah we're we're kind
of the lifeguard of java community made
okay so let's move on to salon now so
long anyone know who write salon Red Hat
yeah do you work for red hat no
excellent so ready a red hat wrote salon
and red hat is a very modular language
it's modular because when you start
writing it you have to decide what your
module name is what your version name is
people are familiar with osgi it's kind
of a little bit similar in terms of
modules for that it's based upon
something called jboss modules if you're
not familiar of jboss modules is
actually the technology which makes
jboss the application server modular so
so you know the modules in jboss which
you can dynamically bring in bring
takeout that's the same thing which is
used here so let's take a quick look
we're going to jump into eclipse again
and here's some salon code so with salon
the first thing we're going to have a
look is and source we've got some salon
files here we're going to look at the
module salon now in the module salon we
have a module name comb ziti and a
module version 10 so if people want to
use anything in this module they have to
reference us we can also import other
modules so here we import the salon
interop java version 110 and also the
java base version eight so Java base is
the ability to use to use all the api's
and things in Java and Java is the type
matching between salon and Java and it's
extremely important to have this
interoperability because one of the
things don't forget the Java isn't the
most important thing Java is just as
syntax but over the years because Java
has been around 20 years has a massive
ecosystem that is surrounded it loads of
frameworks loads of libraries so it's
extremely important to be able to
interoperate with Java and all the
libraries and trusted ap is that we live
with so that we can use those api's from
salon so you can sweep you know we don't
just have to use salon we can still call
out into Java api's and this is
absolutely crucial for any JVM language
that is that is new that wants to be the
next java language okay so where can I
where can i grab these these these
modules from well if i go to let's open
a view show view there's something
called the salon repository explorer and
this this actually explores something
called the salon heard so if i just hit
return there that's interesting
two modules oh okay I'm not connected to
the Internet the sir this salon heard is
an online repository whereby if I was
connected to the internet that would
give me a whole list of modules which I
can choose import and bring into my
bring into my project so it's done in a
very modular way and it's done in a way
that you can share so you can submit to
the repository you can submit to the
hood and other people will also use your
code ok so we've sinned there are four
and then let me just get rid of this
we've sinned there are 4 items here
classes salon module salon package at
salon and run dot salon we've seen what
module does classes and run our code you
can see that from the little sees that
means it's salon code now whereas in
Java when we do a compilation hour
compilation will typically map one get
one but Java file to one classes file
unless we do things like you know
anonymous inner types and stuff like
that so lon is very different if I was
to go into the into the modules into the
comms et 100 into the metal oops into
the meta introductory we have this
mapping dot txt if I cat mapping dot txt
we can see four things now what this is
doing this is effectively telling
telling you that our there's a comp
enters a more complex mapping between
our salon source files and asks along
classes or salon class files here so
here we can see that package underscored
class has packaged salon but
interestingly run doc class comes from
one duck salon port class comes from run
dot salon so we don't know where pork
comes from you let's have a look
basically there isn't a single mapping
also class HTTP server class goes to
classes salon so on the right-hand side
classes dot salon this is our source on
the left hand side this is the
compilation artifact that
that has been created for us so let's
actually have a look let's go into the
let's go into the run okay so in the run
we see a couple of things we see a port
global variable a poor instance we're on
that well just a just a global variable
sorry and we'll just do a run method now
what salon does is it will produce a
rudder it will produce a class a dot
class artifact for every global variable
and every method that exists in that
module so your your methods and your
your global variables need to be named
with that in mind as a you know result
it's not it's not that important you
just have to learn that you're going to
get a different mapping we've got
imports importing from Java Java
packages and listing the classes that
you want to import in each of the
packages also in a number in line six
here we have void run there's no need
for a class here so we haven't created a
class so this is just this is just
offensively like a function that we're
calling what else can we see here to do
here what we've got here is note that
there's there's no concatenation at all
on the on the string creation so as
we're creating the string we just have
almost like an escape and then we we're
calling their support variable other
things there's no new keyword here when
we're creating this HTTP server this is
actually creating a new instance of a
class and similarly with this thread if
we go into the HTTP server will notice
this is in classes Salam so you don't
need to have you can have multiple
classes in the same salon file you don't
need to have the class name to be the
same name as that as the salon file
okay so on this line we have something
called value on this line here we have
something called variable this is
exactly the same as the volunteer
decided they want that wanted that to be
a little bit longer on line 13 as well
what we have is value bufferedreader
equals effective via instantiating a new
bufferedreader class what's that missing
anyone see what that's missing from Java
second sorry i couldnt hear that was
that try and catch no not yet the type
and this is this is type inference
normally if we were in Java we would
have something like a bufferedreader
bufferedreader like that so you have you
have the to say it's a value this is the
type this is my variable name this is
what I'm assigning to but salon
effectively just says I know this is a
bufferedreader you're passing me a
bufferedreader I'm just going to assume
what is on the left hand side is a
bufferedreader you can if you want say
you know this web root is of type file
if you choose if you wanted to make that
yes yes
sure yeah so I mean scholar scholar has
that I don't think groovy does Scala has
that and it probably be better if Id
that as we go forward and see them but a
lot of the I'll go through them a lot of
the things that that we that we will see
some of the new things Scarlett also has
so so for example when I was talking
about the fact that you didn't have that
concatenation earlier for for for the
port Scala has that as well things like
that so moving on one other thing this
is this is something which is kind of
unique to salon this is a union type now
a union type is effectively a
combination of multiple types in this
case because we have a question mark
what we're actually saying this is a
special type of union type this is
saying this this this this input type
can be of type string or it can be of
type null I could actually make I could
actually put that there and that would
still compile so you can Union type as
much as you want so I could I could
equally Union type that with file for
example and I could just say this
variable could be any number of these
things and so you could actually create
a list of lots of different types
because we're using union types if you
wanted to then use that beyond you would
actually have to then narrow the type
down at runtime so for example if I
remove this type and we just have a
union between string and null when we
want to use it we're actually saying if
exists input so at runtime or even a
compilation time what we're assuming is
that everything in this in this in this
brace is going to assume that input is
of type string rather than type not yeah
question
correct yes that's correct yeah yeah um
okay so that's that salon how we doing
for time sure
you've got
so that was just an example that file
but let's say let's say you had a for
example if you if you had a list which
you're going to take your gonna take a
variation of numbers there you might
want to just accept floats some knowles
and if you wanted to do something on
that afterwards you can then narrow it
down and process forward but you only
needed what you would only need one
collection for that that's that's a
classic is on yeah they're up there are
parent types it's salon you can you can
extend in salon in a similar way with a
class you can do that because because
you don't necessarily a union type don't
don't necessarily need to be even
related in any way so you could like I'd
showed them with a string of the file
two completely unrelated types that you
could say this is this is a one of
either of those okay so let's move on to
what's next let's have a look Kotlin
project Kotlin so colin is a language
which was developed by the guys at
jetbrains JetBrains very very commonly
known for the IntelliJ platform the
IntelliJ IDE as a result the best way to
develop Kotlin is of course in IntelliJ
so I saw I don't know why they didn't
make Eclipse their main IDE but let's go
to the HTTP server so Kotlin first thing
you'll see straight away no no need for
semicolons straight afterwards inputs we
look at the imports very very similar to
java no need to actually do anything
different to salon one other thing again
we see type inference very very very
very common across a lot of the
languages similar to the previous
language test along again similar to to
scarlet 02 groovy thousand VAR c always
start with a vowel if he wanted to be
mutable you change
to a VAR one interesting thing here is
on this function on line 35 we see the
return type is is unit and this is this
is quite similar to some of the older
languages where you have variable name
colon then type so we'll do that here
for example where this this value web
root is of type type and this is the
assignment this is what this is very
very similar to how we would do it in in
functions unit is exactly is effectively
the same as void in Java so if you want
if you were just going to return null
you just say I'm returning unit only if
you want if you wants to return a type
you return to type if you wanted to
return null or if you had no return
should I say then you then you return
unit if you if you notice the same the
same as you can't leave void out in in a
in a java method on page 48 here we go
line 48 49 50 and 51 we have we have a
nice friendly parameter naming this is
this is this is common in in in I think
I I'm not sure if you can do in group I
think you can but you you can do this in
Scala you can do this in some of the
some of the other languages that will
check as well so you have much much
nicer to read much much nicer to to
maintain okay one other thing here this
function socket let's just get rid of
this actually this function socket as a
non called send HTTP response on a
socket knows because it doesn't exist
I've given this giving the session so
many times I'm really hoping someone can
say yeah I've called that all the time
and like it but no one ever does so send
HTTP response what we're actually doing
here is we're extending the socket class
with a new method this is something that
not many languages do what we're
effectively saying is in the scope of
this class I am going to add this send
HTTP response method 2
this socket as a result this
implementation can be run of socket dot
send HTTP response so for example
another one is send file this is also on
a on a socket this isn't actually on the
socket class files to click on that
you'll see socket send file so we can we
can by doing this what you can
effectively do is make your code more
readable because I as I as I write it I
can read it I'm doing sockets and far
i'm sending file on this particular
socket so it makes it a little bit more
readable one other thing just here we
have multi-line strings so triple double
quotes and here we also have the ability
to substitute your variables or even
calls to other methods inside this say
it's much much easier to read because
you effectively see what you're writing
if you have to do something that in Java
it'll look pretty awful if you do it
like this and you know most languages
groovy you can do it in scarlet you can
do it in cortland salon you're able to
actually read it much much clearer yes
that's a great question question was
what's the performance like I can't you
answer that I've not I've not done any
performance metrics on that but I mean I
don't think it would expect it
effectively just you know the
performance here is going to be in the
compilation rather than the runtime so I
don't think that's I mean yeah it's fair
to be going to turn into bytecode and
you're going to have the the usual
escape characters for carriage return
and stuff like that and you're in your
bike code so perform it to run time it
won't be any different
okay one other thing we have here is in
this in this function definition we have
a variable a palm to name file of type
file a parameter name net method of type
string parameter name is retry of type
boolean and this is really interesting
we have a default value for this here's
another example of something that you've
all probably seen where you have a
massively overridden method each one
taking one extra parameter that's
because there are no default values in
Java if you have a default value like
this what we're saying is if you just
pass file and string but don't pass in
is retry then we will assume is retries
false if you actually pass it in is
retry with true you probably could put
it in with false as well but there's no
need if you pass in is retry parameter
as true it'll override this default
value the benefit is you don't then have
a second method like this whereby one
method calls the second method with
false as a default when you're doing
this of course and you do need to use
method prayer parameter naming if you
don't have parameter names and you have
multiple billions for example let's say
you have two billions together both of
which I have default values and you only
pass one in the compiler won't know
which one you're passing in which is why
parameter naming is very very important
for this let's have a look at those if
we can see any being used so here's one
send file we're passing in a file we're
passing in a method string no value as
the as there is retry so this is
considered as false yes
if say you had wanted to make a call and
use several defaults and then passed by
it had only only if it's so the question
is if you have multiple defaults would
you have to pass in a method name for
for some of the other values it you need
to you need to make it unambiguous so if
you have if it's if the compiler can
understand that that final method that
final parameter is always going to be
because it's a file or something
entirely different different type is
always going to be you know that that
value then it will work it out it's only
when it's ambiguous call the compiler
complain okay a couple of other things i
want to show you a little bit about null
safety here yes scarlet oh that's a
great question yeah I think I believe
Scala does scholar does I don't think
Ruby does yeah okay so here we have a
function we have a variable string my
string of type string 1 2 3 4 5 and all
we're doing is print lining the the
length of that if I run that we get the
value 5 because there are five
characters in there if I was to do
something like let's say I'm gonna hit ?
at the top what we're effectively saying
this is exactly the same as things like
Kotlin what we're saying is string could
either be of Tring or it might be null
this is slightly different to what we
saw in salon because in salon you could
have other types here all we're saying
is this is potentially a nullable
inaudible value so in that case what
we're actually seeing now is an error
here because we're trying to dereference
something which could potentially be not
there are two ways I can deal with this
I can either have a add in a safe call
so I could hurt a question mark that
will compile if I was now run that
we get a 5 back because my string isn't
know if I was to set my string to be
null it's save and run that now we get
no we haven't got an exception we
haven't got a nullpointerexception we
get null because when we try and
dereference this because my string is
null we actually return null meaning we
just print out null we don't actually
throw an exception what else could I do
well what if I say actually I'm going to
add this this double ? this is something
which which baffles me slightly over and
let me do that oh yes of course I need
to put a double ? there this is
effectively saying yes i know my string
could be null I don't care just continue
to run this we're not doing a safe null
dereference here if I was to run this
now we'll get a Kotlin kotla
nullpointerexception so if you still
really want to be driven you know a
nullpointerexception then you can you
can do that if you want not sure why
you'd want to but there we go some
people
if I was too if I was to do that here no
you can't you oh yes you would be able
to do that here well the question might
know I can't do that so I it would say
no cannot be a value of a non-null type
so if you if you if you have a type and
you state that type cannot be null you
cannot initialize no you cannot assign
it to know you can't do anything like
that at all one thing that is
interesting of course is when you
actually invoke into existing Java
libraries because of course Java doesn't
have this so very often when you call
into an existing Java library you the
very often the only thing that you can
assign it to is the type which the java
method is going to return and then a
question mark because there's nothing to
say that java method isn't going to
return not ok the other thing I want to
show you is this this data class now a
data class is really cool basically we
have this class here called customer
Kotlin in this we're effectively going
to what by doing this we're essentially
creating the definition of a class and a
constructor for that class and we're
saying in the constructor I want to
string I want an email and I want a
country these are these are the these
are the three variables which I can have
in this data class by caught by making
this a data class we get Kotlin when it
compiles it will give us a number of
things for free including things like an
equals method including things like a
two-string method and it will provide
that very very nicely so if I was to if
I was to create let's create a let's
create Val customer 1 equals customer
Kotlin and as part of this i'm going to
add myself
I email address and around calm and my
was a country of residence country so
i'll say UK ok so i can i can create
that if i was to then do a print print
learn of customer one let's run that
ah
we go
are there people he's in there select
you always have
you know you don't have to but it will
be you will get defaults for non non
types so you know types will be you'll
obviously get a kind of so for example
here if I do that it'll it'll say it
needs to be initialized because we're
using it we're saying it's not null if I
do that then we're saying that's
interesting I thought you could do that
just so ya know let me go back to know
nuttin else safety customer cotton so if
I was to print this out now yep we get
this this is we're now using the two
string of which has been generated for
us by the Kotlin compiler so we're
getting name equals Simon rather than
just some some horrible value which is
defining the object other things that we
could do let's say I created let's say I
want to create customer too and let's
leave everything the same if I wanted to
say let's do a print linen let's say if
customer 1 equals customer too then
we'll do a print whoops and we'll do a
print Lin just saying same class same
object if I hit save their what we're
actually going to be doing rather than a
rather than an object comparison if it's
the same object we're actually doing a
more intelligent data comparison so the
cotton compiler has added an equals
method which is checking if the if the
data points of the same is checking is
checking the the name is the same is
checking the email is the same and so
forth so we get that intelligence
that's calling as calling that's calling
the object equals yep yeah no that's
always the case yep Scarlett does have
similar to that yeah yeah you can
override it if you chose yeah no not
that I've seen if you wanted to do that
you just effectively override the to
override the equals and then put your
implementation straight in yeah one
other nice thing if we wanted to say
something like let's say let's do a
print Lin of customer one copy we can
effectively make a new instance of a new
instance of customer but change certain
values so let's say yeah let's get rid
of this we're in san francisco now so
let's say copy what does it country
country equals san francisco and we're
going to print that out once we make
that copy let's run that and what we get
as just run that in regular run modes
you didn't get the other stuff so
customer cotton we still get named simon
we still get email because we've done a
copy and we're copying the data from the
other class but what we're now getting
is the updated san francisco so we're
doing a copy with just a minor change
this is really really useful if you have
data objects with with many many fields
in okay that's Kotlin we have one more
to get through and very very quickly
just realized I'm running out of time
okay the last one I want to talk through
is yet its extend extend is actually a
rather than a separate JVM language it's
actually a what's the best way it's an
interpretation it's an interpretive kind
of thing on on Java so rather than
having rather than having just a single
extend fall we have an extend we also
have a java file if i look at extend we
have vowels and vars very very nice we
have this is obviously a string on the
right hand side we have type inference
this is going to be a web root string
here what else do we have have a look
through type inference there
okay here we don't have their note there
are no Landers and streams there will be
obviously in from the version eight
equivalent but what we have here on 47
we have socket send HTML response very
very similar to how Kotlin did it except
if you actually go and whoops if you
actually go and look at it here what
extent does and that's what by by name
extend this is the big thing that this
language does is it effectively when you
actually create a function the very very
first parameter in that function is
going to be is going to be the type
which you are actually extending so in
this case our first parameter is socket
so we extend socket with this method so
it's very very important on the
placement of the very first parameter
obviously other things that we have here
is multiplied strings we also have the
ability to substitute this is a very
interesting character which I isn't on
anyone's keyboards I don't know why they
use this but interestingly I there is a
key combination that didn't work on my
laptop or on the plug-in so I actually
had to copy and paste this from their
documentation which kind of pissed me
off what one thing since then I have fun
as if you control space it'll actually
add it automatically I didn't realize
that when i was doing this sadly but but
yeah there we go it looks very very nice
it's just if effectively just a very
light facial on top of java if you
actually do look at their generated
version then we see that this
interpretation has taken things like you
know this vowel and it's actually turned
it into a final variable final mutable
immutable variable we also have other
things like if I was to scroll down you
can see some nice underscores happening
there's a sneaky throw happening here
you can effectively see you know all
this generated code you don't want you
don't want to edit the generated code
you can do if you want but if you try
it'll just give you a warning on that
all so far as to scroll down to where we
actually do call one of our extended
methods all we're doing is just calling
it on the on this and we're passing in
the socket so it's just a way of way of
doing that this is actually a big unit
test for a long way tool called X text
which allows you to write language
grammars and create new languages so I'm
already over so I just skip through the
last few slides quick summary functions
our first-class citizens virtually all
Jovian languages will have this kind of
thing Java is actually very very late to
the game on this everyone syntax sucks
and that's why new land that's very
often why new languages appears but
syntax just sucks to someone else okay
everyone has different opinions on what
they want to see the only thing we can
agree on is Comic Sans sucks for
everyone the JVM is awesome so do be
adventurous you are now one hour later
you have heard of all these languages so
please do on your next hobby project
check it out the docs are very very good
on a lot of the languages you can very
very easily get up to speed on these
languages a whole bunch of resources if
you wanted to to look at some of the
code that with that we've looked at if
you want some free stuff take a photo of
this slide these these URLs will
actually take you to some to some some
pages where if you do it if you do a a
free trial of either ex-rebel orge
arable will send you some t-shirts in
fact this is the x rebel one so everyone
wants one i'm sure i'll leave that on
just cuz i see a few phones
and that's pretty much it thank you very
very much for attending and I hope it
was beneficial yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
