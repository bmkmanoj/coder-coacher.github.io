of this oracle code online event and
also thanks for joining my session on
winning hearts and minds with user
experience
my name is Shakib raman and i'm the
design lead for Oracle application
Express or Oracle apex apex is a web
application development platform on the
Oracle database that lets you build apps
using gesture web browser if you're
active on Twitter you can catch me there
and see what I'm up to by following me
at Shakib so let's get started now this
is an online presentation so it's a
little difficult to get user feedback
but I want you to think about who you
are as developers the questions to keep
in mind are what type of developer are
you are you a front-end developer
back-end full stack low code business
developer do you consider yourself a
designer do you find yourself coding
screens that your end users will be
using do you write in the HTML markup or
style components using CSS do you write
JavaScript for any kind of client
interactions I'm often surprised but a
number of developers that actually work
with user experience while not being in
a strictly user experience or design
role today's presentation will focus on
two things understanding the psychology
behind what makes good user experience
and then how we can apply the same
principles to our own products so we can
have a great user experience for our
users as well so let's get started
everything I talked about today can be
applied to any platform or any
technology regardless the vendor however
the demo is that I'll show in the
examples that I show will be from Oracle
apex if you don't know a pixie's you
know you can go to Apex or comp and
learn all about it you can get a free
workspace we've been running this free
service for over 14 years and you're
more than welcome to give it a shot
let's get started with user experience
if I was to Google user experience I
would get this definition it's a noun
and it's the overall experience of a
person or it's the overall experience of
a person using a product such as a
website or a computer application
especially in terms of how easy or
pleasing it is to use I want to
highlight a few things in here it's the
overall experience and the second part
is how easy or pleasing it is to use
now we typically don't think of our
products and how easy or pleasing they
are to use we think of products and do
they solve the business need do they
solve the problem that our customers
have but user experience is actually a
step back it looks into the overall
experience
how can we make this experience how can
we make using our application as easy as
painless as possible in fact how can we
make it so that the user actually wants
to use it
I want to show this comment because I
think it kind of really encapsulates
what I see a lot in industries or what I
use to see a lot your user requirements
include 400 features do you realize that
no human would be able to use a product
with that level of complexity ah good
point I'd better add easy-to-use to the
list it just doesn't work that way
feature functionality was enough for
business associate and even thrive in
the past however now more than ever
before software must also be easy to use
it must be intuitive it must be modern
fast responsive and above anything else
it must provide a great user experience
how do you solve a technology problem
well you throw more technology at it but
we can't do that anymore with user
experience these are technical problems
as much as they are usability challenges
where we are dealing with people and
that's why there's a huge area of study
called human-computer interaction now
the title of my presentation is called
winning hearts and minds typically this
phrase is used entire in times of
conflict for in terms of war we want to
make sure that we win the hearts and
minds of the people that we are in in a
war against and typically this is
possible by making an emotional or
intellectual appeal to sway supporters
of the other side what we want to do in
our case is make an emotional or
intellectual appeal to our end users to
make them continue to use our products
to make them want to use our products
and in doing so we can have happier
users
Donald Norman of the Nielsen Norman
group is a very prominent figure in this
field of user experience in his book
emotional design he finds that users
find aesthetically pleasing products
easier to use
now the Nielsen Norman group is one of
the pioneers in this field and they've
intensely studied user experience they
find that just by having an
aesthetically pleasing product in other
words it brought the looks good
people think it's easier to use these
visceral reactions can take seconds to
reach or a conscious thought right when
you look at something we immediately
have a reaction do we like it do we not
like it is it good is bad but at a pre
conscious level they make users sorry
they find that users are predisposed to
find beautiful things easier to use an
effect that lingers long after we've
actually processed it in our rational
thinking kicks in what this means is
that when things are a little bit easier
to look at we tend to deal with them a
little bit longer the effort required to
use them is a little bit less taking
this into account I'll show you another
quote this from Aaron Walter - director
of user experience at MailChimp now mill
chimp has been the largest email
marketing services and in his book
designing for emotion he finds that
designing for emotion makes your users
want to continue to use your product
wouldn't it be nice if we could build
applications that our users actually
want to use there are so many poorly
written applications out there with
terrible user experiences slow
performance on responsive designs and if
you're an employee that has to deal with
these applications or if you're if
you're a user that has to deal with
these applications daily that you're
forced to use that you're not having a
very good user experience and in fact
you probably don't want to use a
software any longer
this brings me to my next point
tech is no longer for techies it's for
everybody in the past technology was
really for Knology enthusiasts like
ourselves for developers for engineers
for people that want the latest and
greatest technology but now technology
is all around us it's part of all of our
lives we all have smartphones we all you
know hail ride-sharing services like
uber or lyft everyone has been made
clear to the benefits of technology and
everybody is adopting it so in that
sense when we're building applications
we're no longer building them just for
the technologists out there just for the
people that are technical out there it's
really for everybody if I look at some
of top applications in the App Store or
the Google Play Store here's what people
are downloading right
people are getting apps like snapchat
facebook Messenger in uber and Gmail and
so on and these applications have
pioneered user experience this is why
they're in the top 20 s or top 10 lists
of applications downloaded what happens
is normal users go and if you look at
their smartphone once you've seen these
applications and then you take a same
user and you put them into a business
setting and they're forced to deal with
these enterprise applications now the
users are the same people it's the same
people that are on one side on the
consumer side coddled by consumer apps
are fast designed to engage your emotion
invoke positive feelings and they come
into the office and they have to deal
with these legacy systems these poorly
written applications that aren't taking
into account in ease-of-use they aren't
taking tech accessibility and what
happens is they bring these same demands
that they get from their consumer sides
their cover their personal lives into
the office and they make decisions
purchasing decisions based on this
something else I want to share with you
is a famous quote attributed to Steve
Jobs and it goes something like this
design is not just what it looks like
and feels like design is how it works so
design is a lot deeper than just the
aesthetic appeal that is important but
on top of that it's about providing a
good user experience it's about how the
entire system works it's not just about
colors or logos or visual design we're
talking about workflow and navigation
information structure performance this
using standardized interaction controls
all of this together is what makes a
product a good provide a good user
experience so at this point we have a
road ahead of us
how do we as developers design something
for emotion how do we design
applications that our users will enjoy
will find productive and will have a
great user experience but
so we're going to code ourselves to a
better user experience just kidding but
I do want to show this snippet of CSS it
is a developer event after all miss
little five lines of sorry six lines of
CSS are very simple but they do
something very interesting many times in
the document you have a link and you
might hide the underlined
right you might have a link that looks
like a button or styled neither way so
you say text-decoration:none well you
might have links they don't have any
classes aren't really styled but you
still want to make them somehow appear
as links if you hover over them well
line four
what you're doing is if you're finding
any anchor that doesn't have a class
attribute and then if you hover over
that hey give it a underline it's a very
simple piece of code but it can do
really really cool things so now they've
got the code out of the way let's get
into design patterns so there are five
things on a cover in this presentation
we'll start off with design patterns so
what are design patterns these are the
patterns for everything what you're
seeing the screen is a bunch of traffic
signs from Europe and you can see that a
lot of these are standardized right when
someone sees them they immediately know
what sign they're looking at it's
instant familiarity and if you follow
these patterns as close as you can then
you reduce the time that someone needs
to take to learn how to use your
application they instantly know how to
use it they're instantly familiar with
it in fact you instantly building a
rapport with your users they will know
how to use your application without ever
requiring any kind of training and you
don't need to reinvent the wheel so let
me show you a few common examples of UI
patterns from apex but these patterns
can be applicable to any platform
you can actually go to you I - patterns
calm and see all design patterns up
there I highly recommend this resource
here's a few patterns that you might see
there for example a calendar picker a
modal dialog notifications breadcrumbs
dashboards all of these patterns have
been done again again and again and
users when they come across them they
are instantly familiar so the first
pattern I want to talk about it's
probably the most important for your
application and this is about navigation
navigation decides how your users flow
through your application in this example
screenshots there are two types of
navigation you can have for an
application in Apex but you have these
examples all over the place you can have
a side navigation typically like a
hamburger menu that comes out or you can
have a tab based or menu based
navigation if you're looking at Oracle
jet for example the same type of
navigation patterns exist there as well
you have a tree navigation or side
navigation and tab based navigations you
see these patterns all over the Internet
and when you use them your users are
instantly familiar with them they know
how to use this the second thing I want
to talk about is wizards now wizards are
commonly used when you have a multi-step
process and you want to break down the
steps into multiple smaller steps in
this example is very clear exactly what
you're doing you finish step one you
have a nice green check mark you're on
step two it's blue step three you
haven't gotten there yet that's why it's
grayed out you have a next button
positioned and the direction you want to
go you want to go forward the back and
Castle button on the bottom left there's
no way you can confuse cancelling this
form which is going forward
the next interface pattern I want to
talk about is carousels you see these
all over the Internet
for home pages or dashboards and it's
very common component for many many
things it has very common UI controls
for indicating position navigating to
next in previous slides when do you use
a carousel well you have a large number
of items to show but you want to let the
user focus on one thing at a time when
you want to tease a user but I didn't
know there are more things available
then are currently shown when you don't
have enough space to show all the
content when you have very highly visual
items such as movie posters or album
covers your really nice photography the
next pattern I show up is cards now
cards are a pattern which has been just
crazy popular over the last few years
it's basically information in a small
container small block it might have a
graphic and icon some text typically
there's a link or you can click on the
entire card and it's made popular for
websites such as Pinterest where you
want to see something absorb a piece of
information and move on to the next
thing so where do you show cards you can
use them to display content composed of
many different components you can show
them to showcase given items for example
in the google play store this is how you
browse through all of the applications
that they have there's a small card for
each it's really easy to navigate around
you see a large icon for the graphic
some basic information and that's it
that's a card
it's chunks of information so you can
dissect it easier
here's an example in Pinterest I typed
in Iceland I see really nice kind of
floating cards with a nice graphic some
information below it and what I do is
when I see this page my I can quickly
jump from card to card to card the next
thing we want to talk about is visual
hierarchy now design is communication to
be an effective designer you have to be
able to clearly communicate your ideas
to your viewers otherwise they'll lose
attention in this screen I have a lot of
text describing this UI framework and
application Express however when you see
this it just looks like a lot of text
it's hard to read
there's no headings there's no
delineation between what's important and
what's not there is no visual hierarchy
or there's no information priority now
here's the exact same content exact same
text but now I've added a little bit of
visual hierarchy I've made the heading
stand out I've added some white space
I've added some color components to
emphasize the two key principle three
key principles and now when you look at
this it's much easier to read so before
after before after
much easier to process and consume and
this takes me to a court grouping
similar visual elements and organizing
them into meaningful patterns is as
inherent to human nature as eating or
drinking
people aren't what you call equal
opportunity seers right we don't look at
everything and process it the same way
rather than taking visual information
processing it evenly what we do is we
see things in terms of visual
relationships when we see a single tree
we say oh that's a tree when we see a
whole bunch of trees we say hey that's a
forest that's not one tree and another
tree and another tree and another tree
by grouping components together and
applying visual hierarchy we can make a
complex screen like this a lot easier to
consume so here's an example of a page
which has a number of different visual
hierarchy components applied the first
thing we see the text that's the largest
on the screen is the most important text
this is the name of the opportunity in
this case then we have some buttons
associated with that opportunity we can
close it or we can edit it next we see
some common attributes and actually if I
were to scroll in this page the common
attributes hide behind the title and I
can proceed with the page and continue
scrolling down and if I were to scroll
back up again the content the attributes
are always there so there are a number
of ways how you can add visual heart to
your applications the first thing is you
can use the color right you use color to
emphasize them to make it more important
if you have a delete button for example
you may make it red so it really stands
out another way to add a visual
hierarchy is by size you increase the
size of a component or decrease the size
of some
if you have a really important alert
message or some content you want to
display you might make that looked
larger if you have a heading you make
your headings larger if you have a
button you want the user to click you
make that button a little bit larger
another thing is contrast just like
color can be used to give something more
priority so it can contrast you may go
to a page which has headings which are
slightly darker than the rest of the
text so that way you glance at it first
you can also add a visual hierarchy by
grouping things together for example all
of your cards may be together which are
then divided by a heading so a heading
plus cards that's a group the next group
is another set of headings and cards and
now when you see that page you instantly
group them as oh there's two pieces of
information the first set and the second
set you can also use style to add visual
hierarchy for example you can have two
different types of text right one that's
italics and one it's not one that's
using serif and non serif fonts and
clearly you can differentiate between
them you could also use similarity you
have a lot of things that are similar
together for example if you're showing a
chart from hot to cold you can move all
the hot things together and all the cold
things together and now you see them as
groups because you're grouping similar
things together now I love this example
of showing the importance of visual
hierarchy this is a blog post on medium
by Benjamin banister and it really
highlights why visual hierarchy and
typography are so important so for those
that don't know and the Oscars in 2017
there was a mixup with the best picture
award the wrong card was handed to the
presenters which they read aloud and
mistakenly awarded the Oscar to the
wrong movie here's what the card looked
like so the first thing you see on the
card is the Oscars then Emma Stone
in quotes la-la-land and a line and in
very small text the best actors so this
is the card for the best actress award
applying the techniques of visual
hierarchy here's the exact same
information presented a little bit more
and presented a little bit more
meaningful manner now when you see this
the first thing you see is Best Actress
so you immediately know what award this
is for then you see in larger text who
is a recipient of this award finally
which movie they won the award for at
the very end oh this is the Oscars so
just by making a simple change before
after they could have avoided this
entire mix-up just goes to show you how
important visual hierarchy is now the
next thing I want to talk about is
displaying data now similar to visual
hierarchy where you must be careful of
information density and how we display
data and how we display information to
our users now the first thing I talk
about is tables a lot of our
applications have tables of data so in
this exercise I'm going to show you how
we have a table of data like this and
just by making a few small tweaks we can
make this a lot easier to understand so
here's a very basic table of employees
and they're a job and Department and
salaries so the first thing I'm gonna do
is just hide some of the columns we
don't need don't it's showing point
number
let's make name the most important thing
next I see the apartment numbers is 1 to
1 I don't know what that means let's
actually make it human readable oh the
department's management or development
right not only that but I've also
updated the alignment so previously the
headings were Center aligned and salary
was left aligned now it's properly line
numbers are right aligned so you can
easily compare them and everything
is left-aligned now let's add some
headers to distinguish headers let's add
some alternating colors for the row so
it's easier to scan between lines
we've also appropriately sized the
column so you're not rapping unless you
absolutely have to
this is far easier to read here's how we
start it off and here's where we are now
finally if you're building an
application you can go one step further
and add a search bar in case you have a
lot of employees and quickly search
something and here's an example of the
same techniques and a real application
but reports aren't the only way to see
data for example in this screen there's
a whole lot of data a lot of columns I
could go and summarize its information
and fewer columns that make sense but
also not everything has to be a table
there are alternative displays of
information sometimes cards and other
patterns are better for representing it
as simple a better than just tabular
reports
think about this how many consumer apps
do you see that use reports as their
primary UI for displaying data not many
so here's the opportunity tracker
application and this is showing cards
for each opportunity
here's Craigslist if I wanted to buy a
Mini Cooper like typing Mini Cooper
search and here's how I see the data now
this isn't very engaging I just see a
list I see the price everything is one
line I have to scan the entire row to
see anything whether I like it or not
here's the exact same information
displayed with a thumbnail so now I can
quickly see the color of the car whether
I like it or not then price of the car
is listed below
and finally here's another view of the
same exact information again same exact
cars but now I see a larger image and I
can quickly glance through them right
same exact information we run from table
to a thumbnail view to a card view if I
go to cars.com which is another very
popular website to buy cars you can see
they do something a little bit different
they have a large image you know the
most important information is the
largest so the price is the largest
thing you see on this page and the far
right you have all the actions you can
take I want to talk to you about the
picture superiority effect what this
means is that humans are far more
receptive to pictures than they are for
words concepts are learned and
understood better as pictures than
viewing or reading their written
counterparts with the we've known this
for a very very long time and this is
true not only for recognition but also
for recollection so recognizing
something and recalling it you're able
to do better with pictures
and how do we apply this to our own
applications well we can use charts and
visualizations
to represent data it's a lot less
cognitive node and we're much better at
processing graphical data than America
later anyway so for example here is a
chart showing some salaries for the
employees from the previous employee
table and if I just sort this
information by highest low salary I
already have a better understanding of
this data right I know immediately
richard is paid the most then Erlich
Jared Dinesh and Gilfoyle now what if I
go one step further first of all I don't
think we need to have colors there's no
difference here right they're all
employees are all peers so let's remove
the colors and now it's even simpler
it's only one piece of revision to
process here how tall is a bar and that
indicates you know how much someone gets
paid it's not the color that's
meaningless information I want to show
you a good example of a pie chart here
are three different pie charts that have
very different values for each of those
slices but if I was to look at them or
if anyone was look at them you'd be
hard-pressed to figure out what's what
it's hard to tell is blue bigger in the
first pie or the second pirate third pie
it's very unclear
here's a pie that makes it really easy
here's an example of pie chart a donut
chart which has maybe enough 14
different items that is trying to show
and then it shows a percent of the color
percent of the pine that the value takes
out but it's a very difficult pie chart
to read not all charts are the same
right
it's a terrible example of a pie chart
should be has way too many slices it's
hard to tell just by looking at it how
big a certain slice is we don't label
half of them overall there's a lack of
clarity what if we used a bar chart
instead to display the same information
and now it's super clear what has the
most value and which has the least next
I want to move on to forms and data
entry a lot of enterprise applications
and a lot of business application work
with data and data input the first thing
we can do is minimize user input so I
want to show you a very brief video of
how we've minimize user input when
building an application and apex so I
typed my application name I click on add
page the page name is already
pre-populated I can add some features I
can pick some colors and user interface
options and I click on create
application and now I've built my
application right so very fairly complex
process to build an application but
because we've reduced a number of steps
we've minimized user input we've made
that a lot we've made that process a lot
faster
something else we can do a lot of forms
ask for the address of the user or where
they are what we could do is use the
geolocation API of html5 to grab that
information immediately so now if I have
an application but I need to get the
users location of any purpose rather
than asking them to fill in their
address or zip code or city or state I
can just grab this directly from the
user the next thing is that field order
matters
whenever you're doing data entry the
order in which the fields are presented
matters a great deal first we can align
all form items to the right and then
arrange the fields from most important
to least important so in this example
there are three piece information that
are the most important the milestone
name the start date and the due date
after that you just fill the form down
and as you fill it down you get closer
and closer to the add milestone button
the next thing and this is fairly a
simple one but it is very important to
mark required fields as such and using a
red asterisk is the easiest way to do
this it is globally understood that a
red star next to a label means that this
field is required it's just the best
convention now a lot of applications
have large forms right forms a lot of
items in them
here's an example of a profile form that
has you know your name some password
some address information and here's how
we can simplify this from one long form
to three smaller forms and now when we
see this smaller form we don't see one
large set of fields where to fill out we
see oh these are three manageable forms
that can easily fix that I can easily
enter data so all we're doing is using
the principles of visual hierarchy
applying them to a form grouping
components together and now you see it
as three chunks rather than one very
large form now finally if I wanted to go
a step further I could also use wizards
right I can break up that long form into
multiple steps so here's an example
where I create a project and it's fairly
simple I put my project name everything
is defaulted here I go next I can pick a
status for my project click Next and
create my project right it could have
asked for 20 different fields but you
only had user input for a few of them
and you're quickly able to create that
project finally I want to talk about in
graceful error handling and validations
so the good thing is we have a built-in
way to do client-side net validation
using our html5 API to perform data
validation a study by Luke Wroblewski
who does a lot of research and user
experience and UI design found that
instant validation results and so many
factors of improved user experience just
by having a form which has instant
validation as opposed to a full page
reload caused a 2% increase in success
rates a 31% increase in satisfaction and
a almost 50% decrease in number of a
fixations
when you sign in to Apex we apply the
same principles here the moment you put
some information in we show you a green
checkmark saying hey this is a valid
input for this field
here's a comic that best illustrates
this point the ID of the record does not
match with the ID on the server do you
really want to save it it could cause
harm and corrupt your data press ok
we've seen this all too often when you
make a error message too technical it
doesn't mean it it doesn't have any
meaning for its end users so let's make
our for matters more assuring things we
should avoid oops something isn't right
there's errors here's a few negative
words to avoid when crafting your error
form messages and finally let's talk a
little bit about designing for mobile
this topic itself could be an entire
presentation but I want to boil it down
to just the core essence let's take a
moment to see how people actually
interact it before mobile devices or a
commonplace now this is from a report
called design in tech which comes out
every year and this is especially astute
for what I want to show you before we
had a TV with surround and desk
and we you know communicate after we had
the TV everyone can sit around the TV
and communicate that way once we had our
pcs and laptops
well we communicate and work on our
laptops individually now in the age of
mobile but we are walking around we're
no longer tied to a desk we're doing all
these different things right the best
way to summarize this I think this quote
has a great job is we want to do in our
palm while walking what we used to do on
a big screen while sitting down with
desk user experience and now more
important ever before because of mobile
right it's mobile let's bring technology
to everyone and ensuring that we have
the best user experience the target is
users
now here's just a few charts on a show
they're a few years old but they still
get the point across
here's smartphone ownership by age right
from 2012 2015 and you can see that
every single age group from our youngest
through our eldest they are all
increasing their smartphone ownership in
fact for millions of people the Internet
is mobile there is no other internet for
countries like India in China most
people skip the jump from having a
laptop or a desktop and venema before
they jump straight to mobile phones
something else on our show how do we
design for the next ten years right and
this in this chart it shows what people
rated as their most important device for
connecting to the internet again it's a
few years old but the general trends are
still applicable today it shows that
smart phones are being written more and
more important as the most important
devices at the Internet
whereas laptops are going down
smartphones and tablets are both going
up but laptops and tablets are
decreasing in their importance now let's
think about this as we build our
applications today we may still be using
applications that were developed five
years ago ten years ago fifteen years
ago how do we ensure that the
applications we built today can still
work you know five years ten years from
now and the only way we can do this is
to build for mobile build for
applications that work across at Fried
variety of devices and this brings me to
this quote web design is responsive
design responsive design is web design
done right
responsive design is going to become a
term like web 2.0 because everything
will be responsive it has to be in order
for it to work on all these different
devices and screen size that we have and
finally I want to talk about how mobile
is accelerating our technology adoption
as I said earlier technology is no
longer for the techies Mobile is bring
technology to everyone and I'm gonna end
off and I want to end with this amazing
tweet by Carol Nichols in 1998 don't get
in strangers cars don't meet people from
the internet 2016 literally summon
strangers from the internet and get in
their car just to sum everything out the
first thing you can do in your
applications is to follow design
patterns there's a design pattern for
practically every use case there is
second let's build a visual hierarchy
use the principles official hierarchy to
arrange your applications in such a way
that they are intuitive display your
data correctly in a matter that makes
sense
simplify your user input and finally
design for mobile users design for the
next 10 years of your applications life
thank you very much for attending this
