and you gotta go right then
welcome to the dev life here at the open
world 2017 I'm your host Javed Mohammed
and I have as my guest today Maria
Mercedes Alvarez yes yeah so just tell
you the volume here so we met last in
Sydney oh yes
so it's a great meeting back on the
other side of the Pacific oh yeah so so
you based in Guatemala how was how was
your flight over what was really good it
fast this year I just made 10 hours
flying only 10 hours only 10 hours yes
at which city do you come from
I need to make a scale in Mexico City
Mexico says and then Mexico San
Francisco nice ok so last time we spoke
I don't you mentioned actually just off
camera that you had given two
presentations one on Sunday one
yesterday what were they about well what
a few more on Sunday I have two talks
and I spoke with Hillary Kuna now go
Hamamoto from the JCP about how juju can
a state involvement in the JCP process
and what connectivities you can do will
you dukes and in the afternoon I have a
technical session that was the same one
that I have at Oracle cold in Sydney
these development services with Play
Framework and at a level security using
JSON web tokens yesterday in Monday
morning I have a workshop in the hacker
garden about JSON web tokens okay yes so
I don't know too much about Jason and
some of those things let's talk about I
guess the the rest restful api sand okay
yeah give us a little the high-level
overview of what you were you spoke to
okay well restful a services is a
architecture
signing for transport information
between a client and a server side is
base ed in the HTTP protocols so you can
make the only Nita a nori and can
consume it like a pose get or something
then the interesting part is that is
really a strongest related with Jason's
and Jason is a standard protocol for a
exchange information between your client
and your server side so but it's whoa
JSON web tokens is a few different is
based on JSON but it's for make
authorization process the idea to a stop
to use a session or cookies in a web
client is a stopping and we're starting
to use JSON web token for me that
process so when you try to make a
logging when a web server so you sent
your username and your password so but
what happened after you made a login how
make it the server side that have
managed all the information that is do
that one that is asking for information
so in the past we saves on information
in our cookies or in our say session in
the client side
say this is not precisely more secure
this is not understand that anyone is
making everything so they create JSON
web token so when you make that JSON web
tokens WebSocket web tokens talking's
yes you know when you have a back ok as
usually they say you know we will add an
extra security and you will need to end
your username your password and there a
talking it's like a special so you make
a login and your server inside returns
you a token a JSON web token I mean
every request that you made you will
send that as an authorization key and
the server side we verified if you are
the right person at not and the
interesting thing is that every token is
sign it we not a special key so this key
only the server side has that key so if
someone modified that jacinth
information
jaesuk talking or something that
server-side will know that someone
modified it or that is an invalid json
web token that sounds very exciting so I
definitely get the point that it
requires it provides a lot more security
exactly um doesn't it also require a lot
more bandwidth and / or overhead to
transfer all this additional tokens and
information no no no no okay so from an
Oracle perspective what's kind of the
important thing for for the people who
are maybe not had the chance to visit
your presentation what is it they should
know about what you presented okay why
don't know how can additionally
importance come right well this is
something that is starting to be use it
have kept a few years make then but
right now is that we are having more in
taking more importance in make secure
apps because we have a many developers
or people that we develop products that
doesn't take care about our security
aspects so it is important that we start
to take care about those ones so people
want to get more information about this
where should they go well well we are at
out serial technologies have a website
that is JWT dot a I oh okay yes all
right but if you can share that with me
I'll post it when I posted oh yes you
yes exactly we can show that yes and we
have the red this is a website when you
can in there they put your tokens on
validate they see if there are validated
you can see a set of libraries from any
programming language if you want to use
JSON web tokens and we have guides of
JSON web tokens from zero they explained
you every things and we have two a
handbook that is for free when people
can read about JSON web tokens another
JSON web technologies because the screen
exists JSON web encryption for example
if you want send encrypted information
so yes people can see in the out zero
web site about information Maria this
sounds very exciting and I
you know the the viewers out there will
get a chance to actually learn kind of
more about this mental check your
presentations out also so thank you so
much for coming down and just as a kind
of oh by the way I was trying to look up
your background I googled you Maria
Mercedes Alvarez and I thought I just
see one person but it sounds like you
have a very part I thought was is that
you have a very popular name oh really
so there are a lot of impersonators out
there so all the security you're
providing is gonna be very useful okay
buddy yeah thank you so much for coming
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
