women and technology lunch we actually
inaugurated this woman in technology
session at our first coat event this
year which was in Los Angeles so this is
the third so my name is Martha house and
I'm with the Oracle developer community
team and as a team that's dedicated to
supporting technical communities and
also advocacy programs talk a bit about
Africa's advocacy programs in a bit so
in this how we're really excited to have
a group of women to talk about women in
technology challenges and as we go
through it I'll go so far as to say the
opportunities that really come with
these challenges so we have I'll start
you know just by introducing who's here
on the panel today so we have Mary Bri
cholesky to my left who's a Technical
Architect on the web and mobile team at
Chicago Bass US Cellular the next to her
we have Susan Jane who is senior
technical team lead with Oracle
University then we have at the far end
Michelle Melcher who's security
architect with extremes scale solutions
thank you for joining us so would you
introduce yourselves and a little bit
more depth and then just talk about why
you're here so I'll start with you Mary
yeah so my name is Mary Greg Leske I've
been working in the field since 1988
when I graduated I first started more in
like UNIX and C and that was like before
the internet time and then slowly
getting to Java in the 2000 timeframe
and then since then I've been kind of so
to speak like writing the tech wave I've
been always been very passionate about
software although like getting into
working in two different companies you
find that you are not just doing coding
you're actually also learning the
business too and writing you know write
it so to speak like you know
really applying what you know to the
business and how I got here is because
to my engagement with the Chicago Java
uses group I'm currently on the board
and also running the meetings so I got
to know folks at Oracle and your line
and Mota and that's how I got invited
here to share my experience with you so
thank you I'm Susan Chang I'm 18 Lee
with Oracle University I've been with
Oracle my entire work life so I started
as a developer and then I moved into
consulting and with consulting it really
provided me a way to meet the needs of
what the customers can do so I'm there
to facilitate and meet their needs and
moving into education it really provided
me a way to share the knowledge and
experiences that I've been so blessed to
obtain through two years a specific you
know University role for me is a team
lead and what I've learned is as a team
lead I'm really trying to anticipate the
needs of my customers I'm really honored
and privileged because it allows me to
be on as my director would say the
bleeding edge of technology and really
understand what it can do not only for
myself and my technical growth but what
it can do to our my customers success so
I'm privileged and honored to share and
I I'm Michele Maul sure I'm now doing
more security for data and database
security and application security I
started off on the business side
actually people laugh when I tell them I
actually was a stock broker before talk
about women in financial areas that's a
tough field to be in as well but then I
moved over to database development
database administration I even designed
some apex apps it go apex
and now I'm focused on making sure that
we're having secure environments I am
here because this is the best way to
learn grow network and and I'm a little
bit passionate about security it's it's
also my hobby so I enjoy sharing with
others great thank you
so we also have a couple of women in the
audience I believe that you invited yes
so I think we may have Ashley
Anita Lynette would you wave your hand
okay great so we may draw on you you
know as the hour goes by okay all right
so I'll set up you know what we're gonna
do on the panel so generally you know we
go to conferences to really learn the
hard skills needed to do our jobs but
for this group in particular women in
technology this session is about taking
the time to really share some of the
challenges that come with being a woman
in technology so I'm gonna I'm gonna
start by introducing topics to the
panelists around things like speaking at
conferences so I was speaking with a few
women at the developer lounge because
really there were few women you know
that there were a lot of men very few
women that some of the other coda
bounced you know I noticed more women
but in general we're here because
there's an under-representation of women
in technology and very interesting to me
is I've been working on the topic is
that in the u.s. we have a
representation of around 20 20 some
percent in the low twenties I'm working
on the events that we're going to have
an India the coat events in India the
representation is double you know in
India so it really varies country to
country but here we have an under
representation and that under
representation means that women speak a
lot less at conferences so for these
pota vents were constantly in search of
women's speakers
so I'm actually gonna start with the
panel with that topic which is speaking
at conferences and as time goes on you
know speaking at conferences really goes
into the area of taking a risk you know
what what does that mean to women we'll
discuss that a little bit and then I'll
move into the seventh second topic which
is really around attributes and explain
that a bit more in a bit if we have time
we'll move into mentoring which is a big
topic you know for women women and
technology just as you're developing
your career and if you have had a full
career yet you know are you doing
anything to help others with theirs so
we may move into that but what I will do
is I'll close the session with something
that comes up quite a bit which is you
know what is your superpower
and I'll explain as we get to the end
you know why I have chosen that so this
session is for you
meaning the women in the audience I'm
really glad to see so many men in the
audience and I thank you for being here
but I'm inviting you to actively
participate and we welcome your
participation so feel free to be open so
I'm going to start out as I said with
the topic of women speakers at
conferences and the lack of it and what
may cause that so I talked about the
under-representation and the reticence
you know of women to speak so I just
finished Sheryl Sandberg's book you know
the lean in book and she talks she
spends a lot of time in her book talking
about the lack of confidence if you can
believe it when you look at her you know
as as the presence that she's in
technology in general and being a woman
in technology she talks a lot about her
journey and the lack of confidence that
she has felt at different points in her
journey
and how bias and perception even within
her own family life as she was growing
up what what part that played she had a
brother she's a sister and a brother and
even though her parents you know really
educated her there was still a
perception that more was expected of her
brother so she talks a lot about her
lack of confidence and she speaks really
beautifully to how she has noticed it
and what she does to correct it so all
of these women speak at conferences in
different forms so I know that you know
Mary I met you at up Nexus you know
Michelle you know I met you and I know
that you spoken and Susan is a colleague
she's spoken at open-world but the
question is were you intimidated
initially when you were asked to speak
and how did you overcome it so Muriel's
I'll start with you sure actually for me
I never even thought I would be doing
public speaking I grew up in an
environment or my family - they're not
really speakers and kind of you know the
culture where I came from was always
being I was always being told you know
you had style you do go work kind of do
your work and you'll be taken care of
so it's kind of not natural for me but
then I did go to a school that actually
though some encouragement that that I
actually was also in the student council
and then doing various things and but
still like then coming over to the u.s.
from Hong Kong where I'm originally from
I was kind of intimidated at obviously
and in English I was speaking it's more
textbook was more textbook than it is
like you know kind of like
conversational so over time I kind of
have overcome that and when I first got
into the industry - I was more thinking
okay I'm just gonna be a hard-working
developer just heads down code and code
and code but as time goes on and I'm
maturing I'm realizing that that's not
just the coding part it's it's there are
many more things to it there's life
there's the interaction and the social
aspect that I need to really be kind of
getting you know
more comfortable with it and then over
time I basically have to kind of give a
lot of credit to Chicago Java use the
scoop because I started going to the
Java users group in 2013 maybe and then
started talking with the folks there and
there's such a wonderful group and they
are encouraging me to come out I first
started with lightning talks and then
once I started doing that I realized oh
I actually can actually do talks too and
then I realized that this aspect of me
that wasn't being encouraged before it's
now actually surfacing and now it almost
becomes kind of like a natural calling
that I should really come out and talk
not so much about getting in the
limelight as it is really sharing my
experience and with a lot of other women
too especially and people who are kind
of scare about talking and and so yeah
so I think that's how my journey have
kind of helped me in this and basically
it's like what gate has opened then I'm
like speaking more and more and I feel
more and more confident too and it's
just nice to be able to talk and then
also meet other speakers and other
people too and so it's it's actually
it's a very good experience I encourage
everybody to kind of overcome that this
barrier of you have it to kind of come
home and talk and exchange ideas so it
was a lot about risk-taking that's right
you had to take a risk in order to get
out there and do it so Susan I know you
spoke in an open world you're an
instructor what was your journey through
yes
thank you so I think my journey started
in terms of and I always call it
information sharing being a consultant I
work with customers and it was my way to
explain to the customer what I have
designed and developed for them but in
doing that I realized what I'm really
doing is sharing information and I found
that to be a passion as well as an
enjoyment in three two years I realized
I not only have been provided up at that
opportunity but there are times I need
to prove to others when I'm not given
that opportunity that I can
and one of the things I realized in my
life there are times you need to have
that dividing line between aggressive
and assertive you don't want to be
aggressive and for lack of better words
in somebody's face but you want to be
assertive to say I'm here I can do it
and let me show you I can do it and as
I've done that with each and every one
of my projects and within each of every
one of my speaking opportunities and
very similar to what Mary said my
confidence not only my confidence bill
but I find the passion has grown even
more and more so I really thank Martha
for this opportunity to share with you
guys it's the same thing never be afraid
you but always be prepared there is a
phrase of that so if you know if you
want to say give me that opportunity and
let me show you be prepared but never be
afraid because you know you're prepared
just do it
that's wonderful so as I was reading the
Sheryl Sandberg book in the first
chapter where she sort of lays out the
book the subtext and the chapter is what
would you do if you weren't afraid and
that's a question that I've always loved
in my life so thank you so much for
bringing that up Susan because it's a
really key question you know one fear
can really hold us back so thanks so
much for bringing that up and how you
can turn this challenge into a great
opportunity for your career so Michele
yeah so coming from the financial world
you normally had to prove yourself first
the great news technology you can
actually be hands down and prove
yourself through your code or through
things you're doing and what's what's
great about speaking is if you want to
really learn something offer to talk on
that topic there are so many topics that
I've learned just by you know being
around and saying oh I've played with
that I'd like to learn more and they
said great you can present on that next
conference or next user group and you
really learn more when you actually
present on it and it's stuff that you
also need for your job and
since it's technology since it's things
that we're doing it's very easy to prove
that we know what we're doing in that
sense I've had the opportunity to speak
around the world I'm actually one of
nine now I think there was an
announcement it's now nine so there's
there's a about a hundred and fifty five
Oracle ace directors and it's a
destination that lori is going to
explain maybe later but there's only
nine women that are in the ACE directors
because there are certain things you
have to do you have to speak you have to
go to different user groups different
conferences and it's viewed that you
actually have to travel I had that
opportunity to go and talk on security
because I'm very passionate about it so
if there's a topic or something a
problem that you solved you become very
passionate and you want to share like
these ladies had just talked about and
it's something that I wanted to share
because I wanted my data secured thank
you for not stealing all my credentials
so that's something that I was able to
talk about unfortunately I'm not able to
travel as much right now but I have
other opportunities and I'm going to
just dive into that a little bit too
because it's not necessarily presenting
it's it's another way to get involved in
that is you know a blog post reading an
article commenting on it writing an
article we all are involved in user
group activities they are starving for
information from you or problem that you
solved and discussing that either on an
online forum in an article blog post
tweet about it
and those are things that you don't even
have to get up and talk about what's
really nice is I've mentored a couple of
new speakers so I don't have to talk on
topics anymore I just say hey why don't
you come and help me out and talk on
these things so you're not left alone to
talk when you first have that
opportunity so
and being able to step back and not
travel as much there's several other
things I can do so and the Oracle ace
program really allows for you to do
these different things right I know this
is scary topic too but right books
I never thought I would write a book my
English is terrible but my technical
skills are good so writing books tech
editing those types of things you get
that credibility built up that you can
actually do things and find other ways
and then the presenting comes from that
naturally from she Merkel's advocacy
programs the ACE program just came up
and what I'll do is I'm gonna have my
colleague Laurie you Laurie all if you
could if you could get up without him
you don't have a microphone right okay
use that and chill shield spend like
just a couple of minutes talking about
the advocacy programs okay hi everyone
so I work with Martha on the Oracle
developer community team and we support
three advocacy groups we have the Java
champions and I think all of you know
Yolanda then we have the Oracle ace
program which Michelle like she just
said is an ace director and that really
Awards people for all their
contributions back to Oracle community
and then we have a new program called
the Oracle developer champion program
and we have two women in that program
and it's a brand new program and we're
really looking to grow it so we're just
trying to grow our numbers so if you
want to get involved and want to learn
more about the programs just come see me
okay excellent thank you Laurie
so we'll be around after so let's move
on thank you
for that let's move on to the next topic
so we just had International Women's Day
on March 8th and there was so much you
know online about that day different
companies posting different things and I
was telling Mary about this beautiful
write-up you know that Lulu
and actually put out that when I was
quite taken with the hashtag is hashtag
worth 100 visit it yet you know and see
what I mean but the theme of it was is
know your worth you know for women I
think that is so very relevant and you
know the write up is a lot about some of
the attributes that women have that that
actually are the source of strength and
power for women but then write
subsequent to that because life works in
funny ways is I was reading an article
that really backed that up and it was
about research done by Google so the
conventional wisdom you know we're all
here because of STEM skills is that
students really need to master stem and
of course that's true that's where the
jobs are coding you know it's a big deal
today but it turns out that this is
really a gross simplification of what we
need to know and be able to do and it's
from a very surprising source because
the founders of Google Sergey Brin and
Larry Page they founded it on the
conviction that technologists you know
really have to understand technology but
they decided you know like they're so
successful you know because they
challenged themselves they they decided
to test their hiring hypothesis by
crunching every bit of hiring firing and
promotion data since the company's
incorporation in 1998 so that's a lot of
data the project look it up is called
project oxygen and it shocked everybody
by concluding that among the 8 most
important qualities of Google employees
STEM expertise came last
so what were the top seven
characteristics of this study being a
good coach communicating and listening
well possessing insights into others
having empathy and being supportive
being a good critical thinker and
problem solver and being able to make
connections across complex ideas so as
we go through this I don't want I don't
want to give the impression or that
stereotypes around women you know that
it's all about coaching listening
empathy it is a lot that's the source of
our strength because in my career I have
been challenged by my management now and
then that I'm very direct in my
communication and to tone it down a
little bit and you know anybody that's
successful you know you're you're driven
you're ambitious you're focused yet you
know that exists in all of us but in
fact you know I thought that this was
very related very directly to the
qualities that women are very good at so
what I wanted to do is really start with
the panel and talk about some of this
and Susan I'm going to start with you
because I've talked to Susan about about
this in particular about how some of
these qualities because Susan you know
she impressed me when I first met her
because she's very confident technically
she goes in she jumps into what she has
to do and it's like just get out of my
way you know she does it very well but
you have that side of you
you know where when working with your
clients you really pull into some of
this other stuff
you're very kind Thank You Martha as I
shared I started with consulting and now
with education so I have a lot of
opportunities to meet with customers and
one of the things at the end of day I
realized it's meeting with the customers
it's not about my needs is what I can do
to help them be successful and one of
the things as being a manager I remember
being learning training manager training
there's something to be said why you
know we have two years
two eyes but only one mouth and it's
very important to hear listen and learn
what are the needs of your customers so
when you're doing that in your business
understand what they need as I can say I
can easily share with them being with
Oracle what our Oracle products and all
what are the features I don't want to
feel like pushing the product and the
features to the customers but I find
what is much more receptive is what is
it what is your business and what are
your business needs and then
anticipating it
so understanding their business need and
listening to what they need and then
being more concerning and nurturing and
saying I understand what are your
challenges if you're going to implement
this particular feature in whatever so
let me help you and I find that to be
very receptive with many of my customers
in helping them grow their business so
it's an opportunity to share with the
customers and it's all for me it's all
back to sharing with the customers what
they need to know what they need to do
for the success of their business but it
all starts with understanding what they
need and part of it is really starting
listening to them first what is it about
your business what is it about your
business need that I need to understand
before I can even tell you what I want
to tell you you should learn and what
you should do but qualities really work
for you thank you the end the show
yeah so all of us do code reviews right
through my developers yes we all do no
no with a great part about that is
there's no one way to code things there
might be a proper syntax or something
but we might think of a problem a
different way and you know partly you
know the communication understanding the
best way to do some code reviews is to
actually ask questions and to understand
what they were trying to solve for and
understand those types of things
the other thing that I think we get sort
of protective and sort of you know we
don't want to everything just crush us
because it hurts sometimes to get some
criticism about our code right don't be
afraid if you start if you actually go
and ask someone to review something it's
actually a form of flattery that the you
know you're asking me to review this
this is great you have an opportunity to
learn from them
you know sometimes insecurity I'm the
only one there you know and I wish I had
ideas someone to bounce ideas off of and
a user community or you know this group
here that we're networking with was a
great way to not be afraid and ask those
questions and really that's a perfect
way to communicate by asking those
questions first and understanding and
also allowing other people to see what
what you're doing and in those types of
things so that's one of those things
that is a soft skill that is not always
because you can come down and say oh
this is all wrong or this is not how I
would do it and it's really there's
different opportunities to learn there
okay Thank You Michelle
how about you Mary yeah yeah that's
right so I do feel that it's developers
to it like well when I was more doing
development we tend to just focus on
solving the problem and how to do it and
getting it perfect or how you know to do
our algorithms but there's a larger
business problem that we are solving
we're all here most of us I guarantee or
I guess you are all doing this is level
computing is your work is going to be
contributing to a business so yeah
that's very important and business
itself is really a social setting kind
of thing so it's a lot of communications
that needs to happen and and things can
be lost in translation so we we do need
to try to take the time and understand
what the needs are like Susan said and
and Vishal also said to so we need to
understand what the intentions are
before we actually criticize other or
something that you know we we basically
don't want to tell the other people
especially your customers that they are
wrong but you really want to understand
them take their time and sometimes I
have made the same mistake too that I
thought right away when they say
something that I saw oh I know what it
is and then I go and implement something
then realize oops it's actually
completely different so sometimes to
that this kind of thought process will
take time too
so keep asking questions like Michelle
says and we just have to keep asking
questions and get to the bottom of what
is needed and then develop what is
needed by the customer rather than
deciding okay this is what they do like
so basically we want to make sure that
we're meeting what the demand is and
then that way you essentially - in some
ways is you get more funding - in that
case I hear if you get what you know
what they want and then they like it and
they will give you more funding right
before for your work - so that's a very
important thing to remember I think
great good okay so it looks like we have
time for one more topic before we close
before I go into the last the last thing
that we'll talk about so
I think maybe we could hit the topic of
mentorship yeah okay I'd like to I'd
like to touch on that because mentorship
was tremendously important to me in my
career when I was young having people to
come in take an interest in my career
and I think we can comment on what it
has meant to us as individuals and I
could open it up you know to people that
have questions of the panel of myself
around some best practices around
mentorship so I actually am it marry a
deaf Nexus and this was talked about a
bit you know the whole idea of
mentorship was actually talked at that
lunchtime thing at DEP Nexus it was not
about women and technology as much as it
was just generally you know the idea of
mentorship and it was it was both sides
which was for people that are seeking
mentorship you know how do you go about
it and I heard one really excellent
suggestion by somebody that was find
somebody that you want to be like don't
be afraid of approaching them go to them
you know and seek to be mentored the
other side of the coin for those of us
that have been around for a while is
what are you doing yeah you know I was
approached
you know to be mentored I didn't even
need to ask for that and I benefited so
much by people taking an interest to
just sit down and have an open
conversation with no consequences to
what you asked it would never get told
to my management you know so it was a
great sort of informal mentorship
program so let's just start that was my
experience with mentorship how much I
benefited because I was so lucky to be
surrounded by executives who are perfect
role models you know I'll put it that
way there were just great role models in
their capabilities and the way that they
worked with people
and actually reached out to mentor me so
I'll hand it over first of all to you
Mary what your experience has been with
mentorship are you mentoring others um
so far I actually have not really had
like one single mentor I think my
experience have been like at different
companies or places where I've worked
that I tend to have like a collection of
people that I knew who I should be going
to to ask for certain types of questions
and I do find that I'm learning a lot
just by going around and asking people
and knowing what their strengths are and
talking with them and getting the help
that I need and in terms of myself being
a mentor I have been in those situations
too and again somewhat informal too
because in a work setting - I like
lately I become more senior so so then I
have something like junior people coming
in so I have had a chance to work with
junior folks - and I do find that it's
actually it's a good experience it's not
just me mentoring but in some ways - I'm
also learning from them because they are
recent graduates they came in with some
new ideas which I actually you know
didn't know what bowed or wasn't aware
and then they would be telling me about
some things so I feel it's really like a
bi-directional it's not just like one
direction and there's always something
to learn and that's why I love this
field that it's just never-ending you
know there's always something new and
you never get bored so I think it's a
really good healthy thing to have
mentorship so great Mary thank you - how
about you I think I have a very similar
scenario I really didn't have one
particular person but again I've been
very fortunate and blessed with
opportunities that I've encountered many
management who are good leaders and I
look at every day of my life and as the
phrase goes you know life is a lesson
it's a lesson learned I take away from
looking at certain people or looking to
certain people of what they've done and
how they've achieved and you know make a
note of that that that's good and like
anything in life you look at some people
who may not have been as successful it's
note to self maybe don't take that
particular approach but every day is its
it's a learning opportunity and I look
at really people around me and each and
every person I've had the opportunity to
meet and encounter I've always learned
something from every person my customers
my own colleagues there's always
something to learn look to that person
and see how well you know what that
person is doing how well they're doing
that's what I want to be it's not any
one person but all the various
characteristics of it many many
individuals that's really my life
lessons I've had now the opportunity as
a team lead to provide that same and I
think Mary said it very well as a team
lead I'm sort of helping others to sort
of grow in their field and I'm very very
flattered to have that opportunity but I
think mary said it very well I'm in the
same situation when I am with somebody I
never want to feel that I am of
authority and you know listen to me look
at me I always tell people I've been
blessed with opportunities and I'm
sharing with you my perspective but I
want to see what you are going to get
out of it and there are times and when
they share with me their thoughts just
like what Mary said I was like I never
thought of it from that perspective
thank you I now have a different way of
seeing things and approaching things so
when you look at your day when you look
at life every day is a learning
opportunity to not only grow personally
but also grow professionally
just real quickly sometimes in work
unless you have a formal mentorship
program it might be difficult because
your boss may be a man you may have
people underneath you that our men and
stuff like that so it may not be
appropriate but there's you know unless
there's that formal mentorship program
that's available to you there's nothing
wrong with mentoring you know different
people in that sense but the user group
community might offer that in a
different way a lot of my mentors
actually come from the user group
community some of the you know
viii community that I'm in our mentors
and we rub off each other and stuff
right here meet someone in this room
hello perfect opportunity but the user
group community in the Java user group
the Oracle independent user group which
probably user group all those
opportunities are available to you to
meet someone
and you don't necessarily have that
reporting structure I found the
reporting structure very hard unless it
was a formal mentorship program so one
thing that I did learn well we went to
death Nexus is to be more forward right
be more forward you know if you feel
that you want to be mentored asks for it
so I and I you know that relates to a
lot in life but but I I thought that
that was just excellent advice and then
just as I said earlier give you know if
you've been around for a while
reach out to somebody and say you know
if you would like to be mentored we can
have this informal here the boundaries
you know we can have this informal
relationship you know where what you say
is safe because I think that's really
important so at this point are there any
questions from the audience and we have
Ashley in the minute and Lynette in the
audience
any anything that you would like to add
or any questions
you know
exactly anybody else are there yes sir
all of these people in the audience
panelists now opportunities you know I
look at it and and the communication
back
I feel places where I have left I have
left because I didn't get any good or
positive good or bad feedback if I would
have gotten something to improve upon
great I would have taken that if I would
have gotten positive feedback I'd have
taken that but opportunities to grow and
feedback good or bad Susan I'm apologize
one of the things for me sent I'm sorry
it's okay would you like a mic ma'am
I couldn't hear you okay would you like
a mic you want to come in suit yeah
yes why don't you come up that way you
can share
[Laughter]
so attractive women the workplace must
have no communication between and
thank you did you guys hear that in the
back so basically the intro to answer
your excellent question I think we're
back to though I always see the
opportunity to work with other females
and to grow as Martha mentioned I always
look at the my colleagues regardless
male or female it's the ability and
we've been saying it it's the
communication so very well said by the
young lady I would I would like to know
provide me the opportunity to share with
you my thoughts and sometimes my ideas
as I tell my team you know hairbrained
ideas I don't know what I was thinking
at the moment I thought of it I thought
it was a great idea and the only person
who thought it was a great idea was whom
hold on me so okay I have my moments but
I'm very fortunate of the management
team that I've been reporting to majorem
has been very supportive I mean they may
say something and I can tell from the
tone we hear we like thank you for your
suggestions so we hear you but you need
to understand given the situation etc
and I respect that
one of the things that Martha and I
share with is understanding when things
don't go quite your way I wouldn't call
it a failure but I've had my moments
I've had my moments of success where I
was excited and there are moments I
didn't do as well the outcome was not as
positive I look at each and it's back to
my lessons learned in life am I happy
the outcome was not positive absolutely
I'm a human being I'm disappointed I'm
sad but it's a lifeless lesson what did
what did I do that was not that
basically did not provide that positive
outcome note that it's a lesson learned
I don't want it to be my stumbling block
or my hindering because then I don't
want to sit and just wallow in my
disappointment and said oh my goodness I
fail I did I failed
I'm a human being what didn't I do that
made it successful note that and take it
on forward to the next project don't
repeat the same mistake and don't do the
same thing then that's not a failure
then I'm not being very bright but note
what is appropriate what's not what's
good and what's not and take that to the
next I think the opportunity from not
any one employer but providing me as a
human being the opportunity to show you
what I can do for your business is what
I am very appreciative of right Larry
yes I don't have too much to add to I
think they hurt Michelle and Susan
already said most of the stuff that
opportunity you know it's really
interesting because that's something I
gained from reading lean in with
opportunity yet you know that women are
looking for opportunity you know you use
an interesting expression that came up
in this book also which is the idea of
work life so she brought up a book
something I never realized which is when
we use that expression that we're using
it like work and life are in opposition
to each other you know when actually
work is a part of life and it should be
integrated into your life you know there
isn't work and there isn't life you know
there's work is part of life so that was
an excellent question thank you very
much is there another one another
question another point hi
so a lot of times the difference between
men and women are that some men get
promoted based on potential whereas
women need to show evidence of so you
could have the potential but it's not
really transferable to the next job or
it doesn't really help you get the
promotion you need you need somebody to
advocate or sponsor you to get on the
projects to give you the evidence that
you can do the job yeah so we've talked
about asserting ourselves and trying to
make that space for people to see the
potential in us but how do we get people
to one acknowledge that they are judging
us based on evidence whereas they may
judge someone's based on potential so if
I if I heard you right because it was a
little hard to hear you
this actually is something that I have
read that men they get ahead based on
their potential and women have to show
I'm trying to play both sides of the
fence here so some people look at some
men do you experience you know some of
the things setbacks but in very specific
instances of my life which may not be
representative of other people's I had
noticed and I've learned that people
need to see hard evidence that I can do
something before I've given the
opportunity whereas I see some people
see the potential or see themselves in
someone else and then they give them the
opportunities so I don't want to make a
blanket assumption but I'm starting to
believe that maybe like the thing and
I've heard it so to quote Yoda do or do
not there is no try
I'm sorry I love Star Wars geek but we
impose that on ourselves a lot of times
and what we just talked about here and
being confident and even in the fact of
that feedback with the interview it's
not going to hurt us to go and try
something and not get that but also
understand why what other skills we need
to develop right and I and I think we do
that in in the sense that I I've tried
for I've tried first yes overalls
knowing that I'm not qualified yet for
that but I wanted the experience to go
out there and try to do that and there's
other things that I think we actually
learn quicker on some of these things
and we sometimes you know like talk
about it that presentation where you're
going to learn more but by offering to
do a presentation about it even though
you didn't completely know it and
understand it it was something you
wanted to learn I think those types of
skills you can start to build up and
then that builds you up for that next
move and yet you had to follow up on
that
saying is like let's say I come in with
managerial experience just a year not a
lot and let's say I work for NASA and
let's say I have the same degree as my
counterpart and my boss blatantly tells
me that I'm not as good as he or she is
in that I wouldn't be able to manage a
project like I know like I think as
women a lot of times we put and you can
only control yourself we put a lot of it
on that's like okay what can we do
better but I would like some skills to
address people or to make the space to
say hey I can quantify it I am on the
same level or above and I want to show
you that you're judging me differently
than the next person
you just answered your own question with
quantify it right and thank you I was
just going to lead into that remember a
little while ago I said you know you you
want to be aggressive you know you don't
want to be you want to be assertive you
don't want to be aggressive in your face
but I've been through that myself so I
know how you feel I did my best I think
I put my best foot forward
and then I would get very lukewarm
responses so one of the things and I'm
not trying to put that person on the
spot but for lack of better words I
wanted to ask the person very similar I
did this did you think my the outcome or
the outcome of my result is it
acceptable what would you tell me to
help me change and if the answer is
nothing then comes my follow-up question
given that I did this
that other person did the same what is
it that my result is different than that
other person I want to know I don't want
the confrontational well you chose that
person over me and that's not fair
never do that help me understand what is
it about the result of my work that is
comparable to that other person what
made that other person's work better
than mine what can I do to improve
you'll be surprised with your answer it
might be so a sincere desire to
understand right no confrontations but
like a real sincere desire tell yourself
you brought me to understand so Laurie
do you want to start that process with
excellent okay
so we're supposed to be out of here by
2:00 so I'm gonna start with the last
the last point that we're gonna make and
thank you so much for the questions I
really appreciate it so you know I
talked about super power so the question
comes up a lot of you were a superhero
you know what is your superpower and
that's always to me it seemed like a
very fanciful idea I don't have kids and
so I thought well it seems sort of
VanSickle not real yet you know so but I
looked the question up because I really
wanted to understand it it comes up a
lot and it comes up a lot from people
that I really respect so I found an
article about a woman by the name of
Tina Roth Eisenberg you know gave me a
lot of insight and she runs a popular
design blog and she's done some amazing
things and according to her this is a
very simple question but one that gives
her a lot of focus and clarity and the
reason is that what she says is that
she's met some successful people that
can answer this question immediately
because I really couldn't answer it you
know to myself so she cited John Maeda
you know who led the MIT Media Lab yes
oh really
yeah we have until 2:00 oh they're
waiting okay well let me just finish
this one point I'll just finish reading
this and then we'll leave place so he
leads the MIT Media Lab and who
responded for him is curiosity
okay so Ken again we're not talking
about STEM skills he said curiosity
Mariya Popova who curates the popular
brain pickings blog she reads 12 to 15
bucks a week for this blog she cited
doggedness Eisenberg's on superpower
enthusiasm so just in closing you know
to just leave and just think about this
you know to say this is my
differentiating factor you know what is
my superpower what do I bring ya you
know to my work thank you so much for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
