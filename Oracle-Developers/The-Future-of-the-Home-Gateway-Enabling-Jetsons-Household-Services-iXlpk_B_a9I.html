before we actually had finished a
project so I'm going to tell you a
little bit more about a infrastructure
that secures service delivery for the
Internet of Things and among many other
things it also addresses the concerns
and needs of at home gateway but it's
really an overall overview of a secure
service delivery infrastructure and the
gateways that you need to roll out those
services when you look at the internet
of things you see a lot of pictures that
are generic high level glossy pictures
that just talking generalities smart
cities smart highways smart health but
it doesn't really tell you what's inside
of it there is fuzzyness I was thinking
about why is there a lot of fuzziness
and I was traveling through Ashley he
was traveling through Korea a while back
and they started with those same short
of pitchers that m2m is all about those
glossy pictures and then they showed a
happy person with a tablet who was
turning stuff on and off in his house
and they went on to say with the picture
that they had the implication was that
your tablet is the gateway for your
house and is the center of universe and
then there is your smartphone in another
thing was a happy lady who was running
around and doing similar type of stuff
and I realized okay then the definition
of Internet of Things from a telco
operator is it's your tablet and cell
phone will be the center of universe and
then I got on my board on board the
flight and I turned off actually my
phone for a while and then I brought it
up and put it on a airplane mode and
then I started thinking back about that
commercial if my tablet was the center
of universe why
I was flying my doors would be open
because their electronic control at some
point of time and my electricity will be
shut off and everything else that this
tablet was controlling it either stays
in one settings and nothing happens or
in essence your host then I started
studying the view that portrayed that
and it was the cellular centric view of
the world to me if you want to solve a
problem that most important part of it
is not applying your intelligence for
the solution it's actually problem
statement how do you formulate that
problem statement and if you don't
formulate the right problem statement
you'll know how come you're not going to
come up with the right solution so
cellular real of the world is everything
is going to get connected and it's going
to go through their pipes now why do
they portray that I'm I started thinking
about so other side of my brain how do
you evaluate somebody's a stock prices
it's the current earning followed by
your future earning potential so anytime
you advertise that there is this huge
Sam huge market that's going to be
available to me in the future your stock
price is going to go up because you're
portraying a lot of opportunities in the
future so it's rational why the cellular
guy will come and say Internet of Things
is all about cellular infrastructure in
reality we think Internet of Things is a
lot more than a cellular centric view of
the world from a technology perspective
there is connectivity and a variety of
different connectivity that is okay
there is embedded processing and lots of
sensors standard software and
application software feeding a whole
universe of services in fact it became
after a while of analyzing this it
became clear to me what's the litmus
test between m2m and IOT m2m you're
getting one widget talking to another
visit IOT is the concept of service
delivery on the top of it is there a
service provider sitting somewhere
rolling out whatever that is that's
happening and it's more than
machine-to-machine IOT is about machine
to infrastructure it's tiny little
sensors that sit on the side of a bridge
measuring the temperature is it too cold
it was snowing is it too cold should I
contact Department of Transportation and
say send the snow plot and divert the
traffic how about the aging
infrastructure we have how many times
last summer you guys heard news about
collapsing bridges there was Kentucky
there was many Astrid Minneapolis which
was a big bridge right I just just last
summer there was about three of them in
North America right and there are a lot
of them elsewhere these are tiny little
and it's so easy to do it by the way
it's got my tiny little microphones with
seismic sensors a little bit of
algorithm and you can actually predict
the life of the bridge and structural
integrity is there or not so every half
a day you wake up you send it aha it's
still good go to the Gateway communicate
to the cloud and tell do t this is still
ok or once every hour whatever the
policy maybe it's and well I know by the
way look in case of an emergency what is
the force of the water underneath this
bridge what's the pressure how high is
it all of that automatically
communicated and see if the
infrastructure is safe or not it's
machine to nature you know how much
money gets wasted by people who are
going out of the way to water whether
it's in agriculture big agro whether
it's at home in my own home
because just in case I don't want my
plan to get stressed tiny little
moisture sensors don't cost anything asp
s today are less than two dollars the
actual bill of material is significantly
smaller tiny little moisture sensors
that can sense the moisture in the soil
and says you don't really you don't need
any water or at least in this part of
the field you don't need any water save
the environment and then machine to
human this is the part that I'm
extremely excited about it's personal to
me and it's biometric sensors whether
it's disposable patches whether it's
wearable category you guys have seen
nike and jawbone and everybody on their
cousin now coming up with watches with
bands it's things if you look at the
bill of material in there guys the
actual sensors in there are less than
250 today now you pay a hundred dollars
for it for a lot of reasons good reasons
on that probably but the actual
biometric sensors is really cheap so if
you look at it from our view of the
world I'm just picking up a couple of
those categories we had highlighted
smart home and smart health you can have
the person having small biometric
devices almost all of these things are
battery operated the examples that I was
giving you on the field they need to be
out there for eight to ten years when I
OT by the way we need to change the
category of cost to total cost of
ownership if you're rolling out stuff in
the field if you send a service
technician it once every six months to
change those batteries very expensive so
eight to ten years of operation should
be the standard mode of operation now I
don't know about your cell phones you
may have them better than me but mine
don't last the batteries even if I don't
do anything with them it doesn't last
more than two days so eight to ten years
in the field is
it's a different universe and you can
see why I when I look at the cellular
centric view of the world i'm not very
excited about it so these use pan ban
personal area network body area network
type of connectivity this is Bluetooth
Low Energy this is zigbee this is Wi-Fi
communicating to that hub up there or
the gateways sitting up there there are
also other types of gadgets that are
communicating with that gateway and then
the gateway will choose what's the best
cheapest most effective way of going to
the cloud is it via wired internet dsl
what's plugged into the wall is it power
line communication or is it cellular or
is it something else down the road
things that are sub gigahertz weightless
type best path to get there not i'm
selling hammers there for everything in
the world looks like nails to me know
what's the right tool to use for the
right situation that's all if i break
down that view to functional blocks view
of it you end up with edge products that
they have sensors processors these are
typically tiny little imps you use with
embedded flash you need non-volatile
they have energy sources and then they
have short-range connectivity they are
communicating with hierarchical gateways
and then they go from there you choose
the wide area network access mean and
then you go to the cloud for category of
wearables your gateway is going to be
your your smartphone because Bluetooth
Low End low energy or Bluetooth smart is
getting integrated to most of the
wearable devices they use your
smartphone as the Gateway to go to the
cloud smartphones will all have
bluetooth 40 and that's going to be
available on all
all of them by 2015 so it works and that
category is going to take off most of
the time though that boxes are going to
look like this they're actually a box
some of them are going to have heads and
meaning display some of them are
headless but it's a box and then it goes
to the cloud and you get into the
servers in the data centers and big data
analytics so if i look at your home
today I these are the guys that I have
at home I have the triple play guy I
have a my mobile phone is different
provider I have a security guy I have a
separate electric separate water and
separate gasps and these are the service
providers that each of them has got a
box in my home some of them are inside
of my home like the ISP provider it's a
box that sits inside of my home or the
security from adt sits in the master
bedrooms closet it's a box again inside
of my home but the water electric etc
all of those ones are boxes that are
sitting outside of my house but in the
future they're all supposed to be ipv6
so realistically you just need one box
with one box you can pretty much satisfy
the need for all of these guys in the
future I talked about the service
provision service providers in the
future you're going to have new
generations a service providers coming
to the table and that's really important
think about your cell phones in year two
thousand and one for those of you who
have smart phones back then who had less
than 10 apps on it really raise your
hands who has less than 10 apps on it if
you had a smartphone and then Apple came
and opened it up a little bit and it
became more and in 2008 Google came up
and opened up Android and now there is
about a hundred and twenty-six thousand
26,000 who's counting apps out there
on Android platform I'm not saying you
need 126,000 service provider for your
home but one telco guy is just too
little right you need the elderly
monitoring service the home health the
remote education guide that all the
other types of services that I OT is
supposed to be all about so you need an
infrastructure that supports that
delivery of service for the little guys
to the consumer the same thing then that
happened to your smartphone I I came
from cellular industry by the way my
background so I remember the days that I
used to look at the curves on how do you
price a phone based on the display a
multimedia functionality and we used to
predict smartphones are going to be are
not going to get any more than fifteen
to twenty percent of the market and then
you had the low end phones and the
featured phones were actually growing
chewing into smartphone and low end
phones featured for mid to your stuff
here comes the apps delivery system from
smartphones and now they're just
shrinking feature phones are going away
why because they invited little guys to
come to the table innovate and get
people excited provide things that when
I when I look at a lot of the apps on my
wife's phone I don't have a lot of it
that I use but she does have a lot of it
and when I asked her you know five years
ago did you think you need this she had
no idea five years ago such a thing
could be done so she had never thought
about it but now she's hooked on it
there are services that are not over
there that guess what when you open up
the platform the guy shows up and
innovates there are services over there
that are not over there that you're
going to get hooked on it wouldn't that
be nice in terms of forget about Jetsons
jet sounds had I think that the thing
that I liked about was the automatic
Buffon generator and then the other
thing was the machined
depressed and it generated pizza or
macaroni and whatever food you want it
but then it broke down and that's why
they hired Rosie in a junkyard they
found her or you know low end shop for
for Rosie type of robots but didn't have
any of these other stuff that we can do
today bring in an open platform that you
can bring in service providers to the
table and you can do a lot more than
what the Jetsons did so when I talk
about the Gateway now this is an
alphabet soup of different stuff but
really let's look at if you're talking
about an open gateway what are the
different types of functionality that
you need to have on that cake way first
some of the things that people are
talking about about when it comes to
internet of things that it's not going
to happen some of the objections or some
of the challenges are about standards it
is true there are a lot of standards
there are about close to 40 different
connectivity standards um yeah at some
point of time it's probably going to
come down to seven or eight and there
are going to be new standards out there
but it doesn't mean that you're going to
put your hands together and say I'm not
going to do anything how about
supporting coexistence while new
standards are coming to the table be
modular enough that you can support
existing standards but also allow for
additional standards when they show up
the new generation of gateways the
existing telco ones they do what they do
switching and routing and data
aggregations but they are not very smart
their functionality is like a pipe you
combine stuff you pass it on you receive
stuff you pass it on the new generation
of gateway for IOT needs to have onboard
processing you actually receive stuff
you need to process it and say ok I
received from this thermostat the data
and the thermostat said
the temperature is 76 and my policy says
it needs to be between 72 and 76 so I'm
telling the thermostat it's okay go and
send me another data and it goes on 76
76 76 someone or time is at 77 and in
say I'll go and turn on the air
conditioning you don't need to send all
of that data to the cloud right and I
know by the way most of this data is to
Kate of data that comes and says you
look at look at what information is in
there these are tiny little data that
you're collecting from these sensors it
doesn't matter what category of devices
unless you have a video camera for
security everything else these are tiny
itsy-bitsy data once every so many
minutes they receive in the gateway
gateway processes it and says okay fine
I take note of it and I'm going to store
the events so I'm going to have
additional storage than today's gateways
are going to have now at some point of
time it says you know all of a sudden
oven from 76 to 90 ah something is wrong
maybe we're catching fire what is the
smoke alarm says smoke alarm says I'm
detecting some co tues ok now this
exception needs to get reported
immediately to emergency units and to
the home automation service provider and
enter the neighbor's house to come and
get the pets and I'm going to you know
now open up the doors to that house
because while I was keeping them close
to keep the house protected I'm going to
open him up because EMF guys I don't
want them to break the house down I just
want them to give them access to come
and put the fire out so it's a that the
box is going to start processing data on
thinking when it gets to now I need to
transfer the stuff to the cloud you need
to also a scale ibly pick the right
topology that's available again ethernet
plug it into the wall if you need
satellite you'll be satellite it all
depends on where you live and what
access you have if its cellular its
cellular if it's weightless it's
weightless it doesn't matter you
need to be able to support it and let me
see this place so you can program it
here you can program it remotely so now
all of this description that i'm giving
you about the box processing stuff what
does that mean that means a lot of the
data center functionality is going to
move from where to work from the cloud
to the gateway box right so that's one
implication and as a result of that do
you see gobbles of data traveling from
the gateway box to the cloud or no
there's going to be some but when people
telling you that Internet of Things is
going to enable and you're going to pass
this massive amount of data to the cloud
not really you're going to deliver some
it's true but majority of it is going to
be processed here majority of the status
quo stuff doesn't need to be processed
anywhere else the commits the
communication standards if you're in the
home setting consumer setting it's your
Bluetooth and zigbee and Wi-Fi and stuff
you're familiar with when you go into
industrial application then you're in
the territorial wireless heart and is a
100 and eat or cat and different
category of connectivity but these are
short-range connectivity there's just
more deterministic and there there are
more real-time they've got real time
applications your delays that they can
tolerate an industrial for a factory
automation and whatnot is sub micro
second as opposed to milliseconds and
they're driving towards a lot of
ethernet different flavors of ethernet
industry for our all auto germany is all
about internet but different flavors of
ethernet and pushing determinism that's
it that's a gateway there isn't anything
magical about this from the physical
infrastructure you don't need a lot of
things that you already don't
have available today so you don't need
to wait for Internet of Things because
the technologies aren't available know
all of these things that are havill with
it they're available today hardware and
software I mentioned the topology that
there are hierarchical gateways so just
tiny little example if you're in a home
you got one of these boxes if you're an
apartment you got apartment level and
build you know floor level and building
level and neighborhood level probably
before you go to the gateway box same
thing applies if you're a smart group in
a smart road or infrastructure setting
there is you know a box next to the
bridge and a box next to a bunch of
traffic lights and a box next to a bunch
of sensors on the road they aggregate
together at some point of time and they
go to department of transportation or
any other service provider that's
involved processing density so I was
telling you guys about telcos
involvement sand their portrayal of
Internet of Things I look at my house I
got it's me my daughter and my two
daughters and my wife collectively at
the moment I think they got four smart
devices now by the time my kids get
older okay five years from now that's
going to be eight that's going to be 10
okay now we have gadgets hanging all
over us now I've done the analysis on
these edge node devices these sensors
that send the data to the gateway box
inside of my house I got between 68 to a
hundred possibilities doors windows
smoke detectors sprinkler head zones you
name them 68 to a hundred so the
ultimate consumer device which is your
smart device right the ultimate consumer
device everybody says if you're in that
market you're doing well volumes are
really high that gets dwarfed by the
volumes of the edge node devices for the
Internet of Things and now you can see
also from the economies of why do I need
to make it
all about this all about the smart
devices is also from a volume
perspective volumes are a little bit
different and requirements so whether
it's number of nodes whether it's
related to vertical markets low latency
and real-time control versus delay
tolerance as well as field of use all of
that needs to be accounted for in the
Gateway box and finally I talked about
the coexistence before flexible memories
scheme to offload and then the addition
of some of the additional functionality
is this last one is a big excuse me data
analytics locally on the box is a biggie
it's a huge one it's quantifying you and
your habits or your home locally so you
have data analytics locally inside of
your home and you have data analytics in
the cloud to come compare you against
the mass population so this is a big one
this is java's event processing engine
gateway poured it to the gateways and
the size of shrunk that's how you build
the rolls so too so it's basically a
very complex rules engine with a
time-based associated to it allows you
to look at historical data and then make
an action based on what that you know
predetermined set of historical events
was made and yeah so the language cql is
based on SQL and they bridget to program
it in that win that way
ok and then overlapping functions
ability to look at the sensor data
discern the sensor data for multiple
service providers the same sensor data
about temperature 72 or whatever example
was we talked about maybe it's
interesting to your health care provider
it would be interesting for your home
automation provider for sure because he
wants to change the temperature but also
for your health care provider if it's an
elderly monitoring system say one could
be interested to Home Energy person who
wants to look at the energy consumption
in your home and half and your air
conditioning comes in maybe there's
something broken in it so ability to
discern the information from different
sensors and specifically transmit the
right set of sensor information to the
right set of service providers and
provision it on the box simultaneously
is also really important I talked about
a lot of that but in so the view that I
had earlier if you try to say ok I'm
going to develop a based on open
standards i'm going to develop a
platform that supports all the standards
that i just talked about this is by the
way not all of them this is just six or
seven of them in the same product it
looks something like that and it's not
very cost effective but that's the
complexity you're dealing with from
layer 1 through 4 right and it's going
to be a lot more complex above that so
you need to approach this modular Li
literally self-contained modules the is
the ions that you plug in to the
platform right so if you only want
internet and I you you only need
internet and zigbee and Wi-Fi here are
the three things that get plugged into
the platform and nothing else so as you
add to it it doesn't mean that you need
to make the system more calm
located in fact the approach for you
engineers is in my first network
synthesis class my teacher told me hey
you're an engineer how do you eat an
elephant and I said I don't know I've
never had the elephant such that one
bite at a time so break it down into
simple one bite at a time and then
combine them together and build a module
early the other thing that modularity
does is allows you to bring additional
members of ecosystem to the table today
when you talk about Internet of Things
there are two kool-aid factories in the
market one is in santa clara and one of
them is in Southern California in San
Diego what the cooler factories provide
is the message that one person can
provide everything for the Internet of
Things one company is a one-stop shop
for providing everything for the
Internet of Things no that's the wrong
message Internet of Things is so complex
and wide the only way it's going to
happen is if you build it in a way that
all members of ecosystem can plug in
that's part of the attraction of Java
and the Java partnership when we started
talking you need standard platform that
you can bring in everybody to the table
if you're a service provider plug in
your service if you're building little
gadgets on the other side build the
little gadget on the other side on open
platform and plug it in you don't need
to be a massive company to build things
with the internet of things you can be a
one-person company but you need the
infrastructure open infrastructure
available you to do that so from a
hardware and software perspective this
is what we have today we announced they
I think it's called the one box and it's
and a demo grounds at Oracle booth and
arm booth it's at the moment it supports
home automation and smart home within a
actually supports four verticals even as
we're speaking but two of them are being
shown here
within a month you'll see an additional
four three and then for the spring we're
adding another three in the industrial
side of it but it stay what I call they
I consider the blueprint of what the
Internet of Things is going to be it
runs java SE as is no modifications on
the box gateway box that communicates on
with the MC use the edge node devices
with java and me and co-op wrappers it
has java's event processing engine
running on the top of it it's a
modularized architecture when I was
telling you about the category of edge
no devices that are running on battery
operations these are primarily MC use
you look at the MC use for the last I
guess last year we shipped about the
industry shift as a whole about 15
million devices if you look at the
collectively how many devices have been
shipped the last 10 20 years it's about
150 to 200 million and these are
anything that you look at your tote from
your toaster oven if it's got a display
two doors to toys to whatever you look
at the brain of those little stuff is MC
use their very cheap they you can
program them really easily they got
embedded flash but they've never been
networked before so the competency that
you guys have on the network site or
smart devices from networking things
together that was never there for the MC
use and amcu market the last couple of
years they're being connected but again
connectivity and networking are two
different animals one is this first step
toward
networking so it is not as sophisticated
and not as secure as things that are
happening on the gateway or bigger
devices or in the cloud so how do you
bring security and ease of use and the
common framework across the entire
system again another part of why this
secure service infrastructure across the
whole thing was exciting to us so let me
go back to the picture that we had shown
and I'm going to come back again so the
secure service delivery infrastructure
providing those services it's sort of
going across the board from the core of
the network and the data center all the
way to these tiny little products
providing a standard framework standard
development environment security more
than anything else and making it
available to the masses small guys go
and innovate as well as big guys come
and leverage it that's the attraction on
a java-based serve secure service
delivery infrastructure versus a lot of
the gateway boxes converge boxes that
may be available today in fact there are
a lot of convergence rate boxes but how
many of them are based on open
architecture how many of them have this
secure service delivery infrastructure
that's a key and there are demos out
there but there is no platform that
provides enterprise-grade security and
networking on the top of this whole
thing
okay I'm going to go forward this is can
I just mention one thing on the job
slide going back one and I think I just
want to make one things it was part the
article keynotes as well I mean we've
talked about a bit about the one box
here but it's actually the system so
it's the one walks being the gateway
with the center mode initially kinetis
k70 what we're trying to do within
article obviously is standardized bitten
program in Java you're not programming
for java SE and you're not forgiven for
java me so well when we get to java late
there's a lot more comrades between the
two so we want to be able to see you
forwarding applications you will need
protect you on the gateway box or
further down to the edge know depending
on what's required so you're going to
see a lot of commonality in the language
there's used between the job at it is
really affecting your job i meet today
and you're betting on the gateway i
think that very point in to make sure
people reuse and get full value out of
application and one of the things that
they actually announced is as i
mentioned that this little ms use have
never been networked in it so how do you
leverage java and me for those little
limp see you so there is work to be done
to make Java ME friendlier to these
little devices in fact that's the new
horizon for you guys that that's the new
area to get in to develop gadgets for
the Internet of Things so how do you
make Java ME friendlier to these
resource constraint devices and so we
joined JCP to work with the other
partners to influence the direction of
Java ME when it comes to resource
constraint devices we also joined the
committee for javafx to influence the
direction from an API perspective as
well as running java effects and our
apps processors so a lot of work and
common part of our partnership thats
related to the internet of things but
also tangibly will influence and make it
easier for you developers to go and open
up this new hole
aizen not just smart devices but these
little gadgets that's where a lot of the
innovation now needs to come to these
little gadgets i I'm a while I'm excited
about this more than anything else by
the way is with this guy the event
processing engine is my diabetic I once
and I have very good care great
insurance company if I go to doctor once
a week for this diabetes they'll pay for
it so that's the definition of really
good care in the United States it's not
practical so I'll go once every three
months and they do my blood work and
everything else and you know they take a
snapshot of three to five minutes of my
life and then my doctor passes a
judgment against the rest of my life now
you heard about the category of
wearables you've heard about you know
disposable pages all these type of
biometric sensors that are becoming
available again we're in the sensor
business these are sup five dollars
stuff but yet the impact is amazing
instead of my doctor looking at my blood
sugar in death between minute period in
passage Iseman about the rest of my life
how about if he he or she could have
access to all of that data once every
five minutes and not just that data once
every five minutes but what time of day
it was what kind of activity did I have
how much should I asleep how much did I
sleep two nights before that what's
what's my mood at the time that My Blood
factories am i angry at something is it
because i'm at work versus home is it
this particular person you know at
eleven-thirty your blood just spiked i
had a meeting with my boss that explains
it it's context how about correlation
with the context and everything else
that then provides insight do you think
they can cure it i also have a six and a
half year old who's got cancer I shave
my head solidarity with my six and a
half year old you spent if you're a
gadget guy I am
gadget guy I look at different widgets
of Technology how you can tie them
together and what can you do I spent two
weeks in the children cancer ward
earlier this year and you look at the
way things are done today and you look
at what information you can become
available and then the role of data
analytics on extracting real tangible
actionable information for prevention
not just cure but prevention and then
something that the Ashley experience my
the doctors wanted to keep my daughter
there for another week and it was like
well what are you doing here for what do
we do here for another week well we just
want to monitor her monitor or what her
biometrics so you're not sending her out
of the hospital just because you want
these stuff to be hooked up to her for
another week and they mean the meantime
the hospital what does wants to do what
push her out the door because the line
is pretty big people want to get in now
if you had that box available to the
hospital and you had those biometrics
portable they're really cheap do you
think that hospital will give it to my
daughter and say you know hook this up
and go home and plug this in the wall
into your Roadrunner cable box via
ethernet and let us monitor you do you
think that would do that right or do you
need to waste at hospitals time for
another week just because once a day
they want to show off for five minutes
and look at some data you see the power
of it so I'm excited and passionate
actually about this when it comes to
health care I believe data analytics and
combination of a lot of biometrics data
context and data analytics is going to
revolutionize the health care so I'm
going to get into the part of this which
is Roberts territory
well I'm concerned about time and I'm
wondering whether we kind of open it up
to some questions okay its various
different I mean there's lots of
different communication stats involved
in this lots of different standards
involved in this we can talk a little
bit above a bit more about the Javas
within the one box if that's what's
interests I mean it'd be quite good
typing up to questions now thinking
because of the timing yeah what are we
going to go answer okay so keep it blew
me off to help you yeah okay go thank
you really like all this overview one of
the central things that issues I still
see with the Internet of Things is it's
really the people that are the issue
you're looking at this architecture are
the two of you guys to hear entities
working on this for example take the
medical example it's not so much the
issue of getting the biometrics so
factory having a champion on a medical
side in training the whole series of
doctors to accept that information that
they don't accept that it will not be
used so you know if you think about the
greater go to market for these kinds of
things where you're having people look
at this are you starting to implement
your
you know the size and the other guys
that you don't actually educate and
train people to use the information from
the question I'll stock up on some I
mean the first thing I concerned back
which is genuine into their thing is is
the value I mean we can't hold some
great wacky ideas but I but often people
come up with things that don't on its
own and don't necessarily by the cost of
the infrastructure so there's a couple
of verticals that will if I like say
phase one which is kind of siloed
approach which is you know health care
logistics you can justify talking to
people about the value and white boys
invest making and and that it's quite
easy at that point to engage their size
and engage very end because it's quick
and easy revenue in circular to it the
next thing which i think is more
interesting but harder to get to it when
those those if you like silos are
deployed how do you make them open up so
now they can become more of a mesh
network and that's what we want to do is
welcome the destructive point of view so
we are the moment what we're doing is
you know we are creating a partner
partner program and talking Oh JP I
where we're trying to support multiple
different people along the value chain
so that could be you know osgi
manufacturer you know suppliers and it
could be the operators and with what
we're looking to do is look at the
actual complete supply chain and make
sure that we've got different partners
to actually fill the gaps I mean that
they're the key things that we're doing
at the moment no that's actually if it's
there are verticals that the value
proposition is there so bringing in let
me give you an example actually it's
sayin I heard about a case that there
were these biometrics that talking to
one of the analysts that it was supposed
to be in UK it's a it's a national
health and and there is there were these
biometrics that were supposed to be
distributed to distribute it to
everybody and so that was the way to
lower down the cost and you know they
got ready and then they pulled the plot
they pulled it back and there were
discussions about a lot of arm twisting
by the major drug manufacturer
companies over there that they said no
we don't want to reduce the number of
diseases we don't want to reduce the
number of sick people because it's not a
lot of drugs and we get paid for it so
that's actually to me is scary now I was
a part of this gig own get together in
Austin and one of the people who
participated was actually our own
insurance company was the CEO of Aetna
which is our insurance company and I am
in a panel and the German was there in
actually sitting in the audience there
was a start-up who was also in the same
panel and he had funded him and I
approached him after this then their
startup basically has data analytics
engine and looks exactly as that it
works with individuals from a self
quantification perspective you self
quantify yourself they extract up data
and they say well your lifestyle changes
need to be going this way or that way or
you're going to lead up end up having
whatever that is and it's funded by
aetna and I asked to see all that now
well I thought this is not a good thing
for insurance companies you're going to
you know cut into your profits and he
laughed that he said you're pretty blunt
but that's true but he said the health
care cost is so astronomical now that he
can't contain it anymore should there
needs to be something done so that's an
example of Etna and he said actually
he's colleagues a lot of them think the
same way that they need to do things
different because the cost of care is
rising faster than they can address it
and contain it so that's my personal
experience of interaction and I think
you had fun yeah you talk
security in the one box and all that
how about security on these edge devices
I'm going to
biometric Sydney and I walk into
somebody else's house to these there
go to point absolutely lawn sprinklers
has many fur going to pick up my you
know absolutely so i can again the
challenge is not as much on the box
itself the challenge is now you guys are
going to dealing with MC use which are
very resource constraint devices think
battery operation Thank limited amount
of memory think not everybody has
state-of-the-art so far as a free scalar
I can tell you how have you been
supplying secured processor for members
of our government for years that's the
motorola heritage that we've had so say
we have a security center of competence
rmc use our best-in-class security but
to be honest not everybody that has
access to the resources or on arms to
use uses it it's a just a fact that's
just that that market now you it's not
just a question of hardware or software
it's the question of system as a whole
again part of the attraction related to
java me and going to clap at route
collapse with this is the respect from
oma OMA this is the stuff that runs
security is DDT la sitting on the top of
UDP as opposed to thousand TLA itself
sitting on tcp/ip but the combination of
the two and then the system for the
framework based on java enterprise great
java is what's attractive here if it's
good enough for some people in the
security agencies at least for us it's
good enough for me for the moment now
this is really scary who knows about
show then okay so you know the
possibilities I let me put it this way
then you follow white hats or black hats
or def con people they'll tell you
ninety nine percent of the Internet as
is it's insecure where does a whole
is an insecure medium Internet of Things
the stakes are our wish it was your
sprinklers home it's a you know you can
shut off traffic lights I can tell you
when the traffic went when it starts
raining in certain traffic lights in
austin texas where I'm from it just goes
into blinking it causes you know
everything goes south from there and
it's just tiny little going from from
regular thing to blinking what if
everything got shut off right somebody
hacked into it and everything got shut
off right to an area of the city what
happens what happens if the great gets
shut off so it stakes are significantly
higher so it needs to be drastically
more secure and when I say secure some
of it is also not software and hardware
and standards right it's best practices
and as an industry and we are
implementing some of that in our user
guide and whatever when we picked this
out but as an industry we need to come
together and come up with best practices
it's let me give you an example let's
say I just had a discussion with with a
member of our ecosystem who provides NFC
and we were talking about this it's the
same gateway box is you guys are
familiar with Google and when they were
taking pictures and the vans were
driving around and systematically they
were breaking into people's boxes now
they were not after your credit card
number they just wanted it all your
habits because Google really really
really likes you of wants to get to know
you I look at Google as an ad agency
most people look at them as a search
engine they're the same it's there's no
difference so now for the internet of
things you don't want that van driver to
hacking to your box and now he can open
up the back door to your house this is
in your surfing habits anymore this is
the back door to your house ok now let's
set a policy that says that box inside
of the house some of the function
are protected and you can only do it
when you're at the box itself so you
enter the house you're standing next to
it I'm going to put my biometric
fingerprint followed by a NFC thing from
my cell phone right next to it and
authenticate that I'm really who I say I
am and it can't happen remotely it can
only happen when I'm next to it and then
I can override some of these policies
that's the best practice it's not
hardware it's not something for it's got
nothing to do with standards it's just
the best practice but we need to come up
with a lot of those best practices to
make internet of things happen and I
think just like that because you know
you've obviously got to care about what
piva see more security you've got to
look at the way swimming boobs up so the
secure boot in the waist trusted and
where the keys are kept as well for
Verity encryption things but i think you
know using job is some form of noah
sandbox or you can cover visualization
or whatever you know it it limits
effectively the areas of vulnerability
and I'm actually the way you can deploy
to that as well so being able to over
the air you know we blow the firmware we
blow the vm or we blow just application
on the top it's all part of the whole
how do i maintain security right because
if you do have a knack at least you've
gotta have something in the field of it
you can be able to upgrade and make sure
you close a whole one so I think these
part of that applies maintaining it
going forward over a lot over ten years
is something nice to look at okay and
it's helped too that's who
pushing
um so if you if you fundamentally look
at a lot of these type of services and
applications units remote command and
control its monitoring something so you
look at the amount of data exchanges is
on the live on the live on the line
temperature is this temperature is this
temperature is this biometric number is
that done and then you've set policies
that says exceptions are if it goes
above this or below that those are the
kind of stuff that you can handle in a
gateway very easily now when you want to
send things for the cloud actually any
communication system it's not just a
message itself it's the payload there's
a lot of data that gets added to wrap it
around for a particular standard and
then transmit it you don't need that's
the whole point is you don't need to
congest the flow of information to the
cloud for these kind of services these
are the kind of services that require
that now some of those services may
require that if you're at video cameras
and it's monitoring something absolutely
you can send that right so that's the
whole point of by the way modularity
after this and having it in mind and the
fact that one size will never fit all
going to bring in different types of
technologies different members of
ecosystem to the table for one day I
think that you know and I do believe
everything that people are going to do
both right and in fact they'll have
probably the same app winning in both
places where you make a quick and dirty
decision quite close to the edge because
that's important because the
communication channel costs money but
actually later on I've got more time I
can do some heavier photos I think of
the server side maybe it is to make a
you know a different decision in a
difference
you know and it really depends what your
time basis but I also think there's a
security side of this as well actually
if you is probably more sense with a lot
of cases to have the unique identifying
various other things sitting on the
gateway bulbs potentially sitting in the
server side because obviously if you
gave way Bob does get hacked then that's
the one gateway box it's the one area
walls they're going to the sauce where
there's a collection of unique
identifies and something you can have
under gateway boxes so you know how you
distribute at your talents going for
ponts a good perspective the rock did
you have one backing them up Claire
where does the elderly population a lot
of trouble
believe in my age that these devices can
be trustworthy I can't get people to
take bill how are they going to accept
and maintain devices they where r 2 I
personally couldn't handle it microsoft
pushed out the three updates I couldn't
figure out with four years experience
how to stop the thing for bugging I'm
never going to convince my mother-in-law
I can't get a turn your computer on so
is that that's a significant part of the
health care problem is people that need
not only can't believe it constant
potentially turn this back dance
background so not cut it so that's a
very human gastric but the computers
won't do that what do we do to get that
segment of the population which is a
huge amount of
what do we do to get them to accept this
how can we get them to trust they read a
bit of hands it's okay it's okay it will
work no one's going to send a signal
that's good stop your heart so it's
gonna work so I remember I told you
about the service part of this you need
to have a service provider um it
actually on the elderly monitoring
system I know of a couple of companies
we own in Texas who are it's a it's a
low-tech version of view of the future
but similar idea it's companies that
they come and why are your home with
cameras and they have a biometric and
they actually also it's a it's a
conference sink camera yeah there's
actually a nurse who literally sits and
you're viewing and she eats her salad at
the time you know your mom and dad are
eating their dinner and they talk
because conversation ultra matters then
there are some dead zones that they're
timed out with sensors when the person
wants to go and change their clothes it
triggers and it says AHA somebody went
over there and it's after three minutes
microphone comes and say are you okay
but after whatever it is and if it's not
makes the neighbor or the significant
other hey gene has gone to this zone for
more than five minutes now go and check
on it but there is a service provision
and now that nurse says that you went
and press the yellow button over there
because they're upgrading order
servicing the box you see what you see
what I'm saying it's that service
provision and that interaction of the
trust needs to be there for it to happen
for the other import I think those are
items with Oxford University in the UK
on this and it was largely doing with
the NHS and you're dead right the key to
is the feedback because once they start
so make it simple actually if it's
simple they'll start using it and as
long as they get the feedback then
they'll continue using it via your
rights is making sure that you set
something in place that has some
interaction and big
you're just expecting to do it do it do
it and eventually get bored we all get a
bit bored of it but knowing someone
patch on the back and says actually you
did that last week well done keep going
the actual results in our trial at the
Oxford University was quite fantastic in
terms of I I expected a much bigger
dropout rate than what we actually saw
at the time you know because we hear
these things that you know get that with
if it you know simplify the keys you
know big smiley faces on that you know
you I I know exactly but it really works
and the feet that the feedback is really
part of that must be for naught okay I'm
concerned about time everyone's got to
get off but hopefully it was of interest
today and then please take your feedback
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
