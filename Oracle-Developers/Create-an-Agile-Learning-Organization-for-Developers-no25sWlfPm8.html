agile organization so if you're up for
another session this would be a good
time to leave the room so my name is
Mattias Coulson and I'm from Stockholm
Sweden I have been doing a couple of
different things during my professional
life I worked as a developer and
architect I used to be a manager manager
for a couple of years and I also had a
role as a CTO for a short while for
mobile startup I like to snowboard
I like to ride my motorcycle I like the
Hangout hang around with my family and
my children yeah so as part of this
presentation is real that one of my core
values is the importance of sharing
knowledge and I guess that is why many
of you is here too to be at the
conference I also run a Java user group
in Stockholm and be doing that for
almost 10 years that eventually led to a
conference another conference called Jay
focus so it's a yearly conference you're
welcome to come to Sweden in February
and it's great nice weather and it's not
cold at all it's about 1,500 people's
six parallel tracks we get pretty good
content and good speakers like here I
guess so but this is not why we're here
we're here to talk a little bit about
how we do things at King so my current
role is an agile coach at King so how
many know actually know about King a few
ok we'll go back that Sam
so we'll do a short introduction about
King and I will talk a little bit how we
got there where we are right now we'll
talk a bit about the culture and I will
talk a little bit about things that we
actually do to continue to have this
culture that we think is good I will end
this session with you actually so you
can start thinking
so if you have ideas and things you do
in your organization I would like to
hear them at the end of this session so
about Kingman so we are doing games
casual games mainly and we have about
hundred and ninety games out there on
something called royal games we have
studios in Stockholm Barcelona London
and we also have an office here in in
San Francisco this is some of the games
that we produce
so candy might be one of the more famous
one of them and we also have formed
Bobby which so how many of you in the
room actually have played one of those
games
fewer than expected actually else and
you can start now your kids play ok
that's good maybe not so we think that
we make great games so we have one point
two you need to get the numbers right
right billion average daily games played
we have 350 between almost 350 million
average monthly users that means that we
have more players on a monthly basis and
people live in US and US citizens since
this is a Java conference I would like
to share this video as well so this is
some of the backend stuff that we have
to deal with so on a daily basis we have
about 250,000 incoming requests or
back-end servers but that is another
talk a very interesting talk about our
scalable architecture and that will be
for another session another time
so King has been around for 10 years
many people think that this is you know
one-hit wonder and we just started up
but we've been around for 10 years doing
casual games sometime around 2009 there
was something called Facebook and people
are becoming a bit more social on
internet
then we kind of decided that we wanted
to launch a couple of games on this
platform so we did that in 2011 a game
call we also introduced the saga format
that we still are the profiting ones or
that thing that you use so if you look
at kind of day
what happened when we lost on Facebook
that we had a huge traction and we had
many more users starting to playing our
games of that platform so we continued
and developed a couple of other games
and up to May 2012 when we actually
introduced candy crush saga then
something else happened the mobile right
smartphones huge uptake and I guess a
few of you have seen this picture before
so this is you know the change that we
have seen in a very short while so the
2005 and 2013 the pictures taken on
photos is taken at the same place when
was a new pope announced in Vatican City
so cannabis Lord change in behavior of
people so then we have to start running
again the other direction and we wanted
to be on this platform too
so this lost our first mobile game in
2012 and since then we have been
releasing a few more games on this
platform so bubble with chaga and candy
crush and it traded and try to improve
over time and we will get back to that
in the presentation later that can
resulted in a hat trick so we were a
number one game on all major platforms
boson on Apple App Store Google Play and
Facebook so of course this kind of of
course it was some technical challenges
but also within the organization so if
you look at the number of MPs we have
so get in the winking started out we
worry about 10 in Stockholm and now we
are more than 950 in several studios
around the world so to make this work we
believe that culture is a very important
thing this is the time when you're
supposed to think about your own company
culture so do you have a company culture
where you work so what is that in that
case what kind of defines your company
culture and we thought that it was more
important to actually be a bit explicit
rather than implicit about this so we
kind of decided what we wanted to be and
we came up with a number of values we
think that values is important for
Kingdom so we have this passion and
performance meaning that we really try
our hardest and to recruit the best at
all times we try to be fast and fluent
fluent so we can keep up with the
changes like we've already seen a couple
of changes from from our own platform to
Facebook and then to mobile and we need
to be able to shift focus over time we
also think it's really important to be
open and humble so we take care of each
other within the company and show each
other trust and respect and fun and
friendly it's kind of important if
you're in the gaming company so it's
it's probably a bit easier to create fun
games if you're in a fun environment and
I truly believe that even for everything
else if you're in a fun environment it's
you're more creative and you do a better
job we try to be agile we try to be
innovative and we try to be transparent
about things that we do we also believe
this so many companies is is
transforming to agile and doing scrum
and Kanban and
of different processes we do that to
different teams work differently and we
think that is okay but many teams work
in a scrum mesh way because it kind of
suits the way we develop games but
values and principles are more important
than processes and that is not always
the case when you get a union and you
and you add your coach or a consultant
into the company that try to teach you
how to work so failure so raise your
hand in the room now how many in this
room like to fail like to fail badly
it's a kind of a hard question a couple
of rapey prayer so most people don't
like failing I mean here I was I'm
actually quite nervous for this
presentation and I don't like to fail
but if you never fail then there may not
be a good learning experiences and this
is something that is important when you
develop games because it's more likely
that the game will fail then it will
succeed so we need to deal with this all
the time so I've got a big back to you
accountable if you look at this company
culture so many companies that I have
been to before always trying to find
somebody to blame whose fault was it
something was done went down in
production or there was something else
that didn't work and that kind of
creates an atmosphere where people
dislike to work so we think that
learning is more important than
accountability so when something happens
we look at it and see what we can learn
oh I'm sorry I'm standing in your way if
there's something that we could improve
and I would say that it
there are things that you could be
accountable for and that means that I
truly believe that you shouldn't be
accountable for errors that you make in
your work but you could be accountable
if you don't ask for help and you can be
accountable if you don't help another
person or help another in your team that
needs help that you can be accountable
for this kind of way of working goes
into the GD games that we develop so we
have an idea and when we do prototyping
on that and when we think that we have
an idea that could work
we probably develop it in a game yeah
game jam session or a game day to try to
blues and test out the format of the
game and after that we move over the
games to this website called royale
games we will have more than 180 games
and we try them out there Nate it's
fairly good platform so we have a few
users are really dedicated and try out
our games and play a lot and then we can
see which games have potential to work
on other platforms and to grow so we
pick it up and after that we iterate and
iterate and eventually move it over to
mobile and and our other website called
King Kong and for Facebook and if it
continues to grow there and be
successful we move them over to other
platforms other social networks so this
is something that you really could do on
your own as well so instead of doing a
heavy processes up front and do a big
design up front start working instead
and go as fast as you can and try
different things and then you iterate
and iterate and improve and and don't be
afraid to fail
where could continuous improvement and
fast feedback loops so this is also
something that I haven't seen working
that well as a former compass I've
worked for meaning that do you actually
have a feedback loop so do you feedback
do you get feedback from your users what
you know most of many many function in a
new web application may not be used do
you actually know that which functions
people use in your application a good
thing is to find out either by just
watching them or actually measuring it
so King has really data-driven in that
sense it means that we we measure
everything and get it back and we never
we rarely get into in a discussion about
if we're going to do a or B if you go
into this kind of the game level or
another game level we do them both and
then we measure and see what works and
that is something that at least has
worked well for us the we should talk a
little bit how we are organized as well
and so this is mainly how the studio in
Stockholm is organized
other studios may have a slightly
different organization but it's
typically something that you probably
have seen before so we have a team kind
of a scrum team and the team is
autonomous so they can make their own
decision they are also teams that have
all competencies needed to develop
whatever they develop end to end when
games grow and getting more popular we
add teams and then we have a kind of
multiple teams in a studio multiple
product owners that needs to work
together to figure out how to build this
stuff the interesting part of this is
that the person or that are a product
owner is not the manager of the team so
the product owner is only supposed to
focus on
what not how so we have a line
organization that goes right through
this with a development manager and your
closest manager if you're a developer in
this organization is actually another
developer so that person is somebody
that's supposed to know how it is to
work and eight percent or four days a
week is actually in the team producing
code and print 20% of the time is a line
manager and help other developers and
coaching them so typically we do this
around competences and so we have you
know line manager for Java developer is
a Java developer line manager for C++
developer is a C++ developer and so on
we also have something called guilds and
guilds it a bit broader and it bits more
fluffy and flexible it's something that
we do around interest so it could be
around agile ornithologists or something
else and pretty much anybody could join
for this guild sing different guilds do
things very differently but the idea is
is to have some kind of shared interest
so things that we do then around this is
one of the cooler things that we
actually do that I have never ever seen
before if we do open space conferences
so meaning normally when were out what I
have done before when you go to company
and tour and will come from somewhere
you go for a day or you go for two days
and then you do kind of workshops or
mostly you listen to whatever the
management team is c-level things you
should you should hear they talk about
product strategy they talk about finance
they talk about competitors think I
don't know and then it's kind of a
passive thing right what we do instead
is we meet up and put this entire
company so we do this twice a year now
with like the last time I don't remember
me
700 people we take IDs or challenges and
people can choose themselves what they
want to work with so they form small
groups so you do a big grooming thing
and then they form small groups to work
on that particular problem and for ideas
or problems that are usually several
groups that are working with it
so everybody is is on on this and work
with it and are really really active and
then we feed this back to the
organization and sea level and other
managers up things actually do change
when we do do is things really do
improve and it could be anything it
could be about product strategy it could
be how we create a more fun environment
at work and it could be many different
things this might be something is hard
for you to change when you get back on
Monday to work so you can try it out in
a smaller scale so we also do summits so
we do some with off-site with the
Guild's so like Java developers see each
other for a day and do whatever they
want to do this is a picture taken from
an off-site summit we did that we did
with everybody that was interested in
agile scrum Kanban and this is something
that you probably could get away with
with your company so just adjust that
you want to bring together a team of
people that have shared a common
interest and try to do a full day of
learning somebody needs to take action
of course that could be you somebody in
this room could just start this it's not
that hard at this particular meeting we
used meeting format that I really think
helps a lot I would like to talk a bit
about so we did this as a lean coffee
format
so lien coffee is a way of doing a
structure meeting with more of a
democratic process on what to discuss
many cases maybe somebody called you for
an hour meeting or to our meeting or a
halfway workshop and this person has
decided upfront what - what is important
and what you should discuss and I also
have done many you know hours 1 hour
meetings with with my small team and
after the hour it's still things that we
need to talk about we never managed to
cover everything that is important in
the 1 hour but if you use this format
things that actually are most important
to the group will be discussed first
it's fairly simple everybody that needs
that wants to discuss about a topic
write a topic on a post-it note or some
kind of card so one topic per card after
everybody has done that so just couple
of minutes then you do go to everybody
has to do an elevator pitch so I write
the topic and then I get you know a
couple of sentences to just explain what
I want to talk about when everybody is
done with that and and all everybody in
the group has heard everybody else
suggestions then you go into Doc voting
and this is a very simple process to
actually do prioritization for a group
right meaning that I really really think
that the topic tree is the most
important thing to me but apparently not
to the group and if I'm a a person that
likes to be on stage and talk to a lot
of people then in a normal group I might
get away with just talking about topic
tree this case I actually cannot the
group will decide after they dock voting
thing just move it into different
columns like to discuss discussing and
done simple scrum board then you add a
timer
please like five to eight minutes and
after eight minutes
the time has bling and then everybody in
the group just votes thumbs up to
continue the discussion thumbs down to
em the discussion meaning that most of
the group will at most of science be
engaged
otherwise people tend to check out when
they are you know done with the subject
so if you vote down
you just pick you just move it the topic
to done and hopefully you had done some
documentation then you move the next
topic into discussion this got thing and
continue like that not that hard
we also do our for our version of 20%
time called sugar Fridays so sugar
Friday is something a couple of teams
doing in Stockholm so it's a it's like
thanks God its own it's sugar Friday
let's not do some innovation so that is
when the team actually can decide what
they would like to work on only it's not
this is a day when the product owner
doesn't decide the backlog this is the
day when individuals and the team
decides what they want to work on so
it's a monthly open space day well you
can discover and innovate on your own
ideas maybe have it have an idea that
you want to try out in the game but you
didn't manage to convince the product
owner this way you may convince at least
a few of your teammates we also kind of
do this with cross-pollination between
teams so you can recruit anybody from
another team to be part of your idea so
that way we can strengthen the team
collaboration so like I said it it's a
full day so we typically do one Friday
per month work in smaller groups
and what they should be working on
itself defined so it sort up on Thursday
night or Thursday evening with a
grooming session when you try to sell
your idea to the rest of the team and
recruit team members and then they used
to start working for it and you're
supposed to deliver something in the
days of work but is it kind of the
context if you are managed to get a team
of five on Friday afternoon there will
be a demo so whatever you take on make
sure that you at least think that you
will be able to deliver something or we
are not on just a day of work code
reviews you like code reviews a lot of
people have a different opinions about
this so usually the reason why you want
to do code reviews is to increase
quality and remove the effects right and
I think that needs to shift because if
this is the purpose of the code review
it would probably fail and you got into
this kind of a this anti pattern that I
call Architects review everything
meaning the senior people in your team
are supposed to judge you on the code
you've written and that kind of it's
obviously that will fail eventually for
a number of reasons people with we felt
hurt and at least the OSHA tech will be
the bottleneck for it so change goal for
it to be sharing knowledge instead so
it's not about you it's about the code
and it's about the team so a way to
actually so what you do so the way to do
this is you just do one hour meeting try
to fix the day per week or something
like that and do it really really
informal you know brown-bag lunch time
just spit up have somebody present the
code and the code should be well
prepared before you do this so you don't
want to get into discussion if the curly
brackets should be on a new line or on
the same line
you have to move away from that and just
you know have a code convention checked
by to make sure the code is tested in
working follows whatever definition of
dong you have decided in your team just
walk through the code make sure you have
a moderator somebody that can kill us
any discussion I've been doing this when
I actually throw people out of the room
so you know the general rule is you have
to be polite you have to be nice you
have to be constructive and if you're
not and you never start to be sarcastic
and you just ask people to leave and
that kind of behavior stops rather
quickly make sure that you have somebody
that are actually an expert in your team
they are usually better off finding
things but make sure you have somebody
that is newly graduated from school as
well because things have changed they
might have fresh knowledge of things
that you haven't had time to read up on
so a new framework or new way to do this
like I said before it really needs to be
open respectful and you need to be in a
constructive and collaborative mood a
way you're actually shooting with this
is not to make comments at all there's a
simplest way of coaching ask questions
so if you ask questions could you
explain to me I don't really understand
what happens when you throw this
exception and then the the person who
are on the review actually tries to
explain it it's might be likely they
actually discovers the error he made on
his own otherwise you could ask a couple
of more questions unless and hopefully
that person will figure it out and of
course watch out for for hurt feelings
the undo button I have to contribute
meaning that somebody makes a comment or
ask a question and then the next person
in the room needs to repeat that because
I need to say something to be
constructive in this me
and don't point out spelling errors or
other things that are not really that
important because it only can ruin the
mood and remember it's all about sharing
knowledge so if you want to do this you
think that you have are in a team that
are not mature enough to actually talk
about each other's code find an
open-source project then you can review
someone else code there are not in the
team and then you can start at least
talking about the code and sharing
knowledge and see how other team members
thinks about the code the thing that we
do at King that I think is is the
easiest one and probably the most
important one for for transparency
within the company and it's something
that we call breakfast presentation and
that has been ongoing for a long time so
three days a week Monday Wednesday in
Friday's we have breakfast at office but
also somebody presents something and it
could be anything it could be TDD it
could be a new game it could be if
something that has failed somewhere and
it could be somebody from marketing it
it could be somebody from finance it's
just a way of spreading knowledge on
what people do with the company and we
also do this across studios so we have a
conference system so we do this together
with Berlin and London and Barcelona so
sometimes we do breakfast in Stockholm
and then we watch this dream
presentation from somebody in Barcelona
and I think this is a great way for
transparency and this also might be
something that is hard for you to change
when you get back to work but you can do
it in a smaller scale just invite your
operations for breakfast and ask them to
present something so maybe a fault or an
error that my
application cost in production last
weekend they can kind of present why and
then you can do the same just meet each
other over boundaries and divisions in
the company we do a lot of other things
most of this you probably have heard of
we do lunch-and-learn for brown bag
sessions it's a way to to share
knowledge too so you can do that
differently you could either discuss
things at your company or you can find a
recorded presentation from a from the
conference and you can watch that and
then they cast it afterwards hopefully
you will be able to get your company to
pay for lunch at least and if you don't
want to do it at lunch you can do it at
fee cap or a coffee break
in the afternoon if you don't want to
use the lunch for this we also support
user groups so we have user groups
coming in to use our facilities so that
way we can share knowledge between
companies in Stockholm we were kind of
vibrant community there and that's kind
of what I wanted to talk about that
things like video but this is supposed
to be a learning experience right so
what do you do so is there anybody in
the room that has the guts to come up on
stage and present and you are here
that's something that I haven't talked
about maybe I think you need to come up
because I think you need to use the
microphone
hey welcome sir
so who are you my name is John scatter
grid I work for Navis is an Oakland
based company here yeah so I am more of
a question we do a lot of brown bag
lunches where we encourage a lot of kind
of learning environment for
presentations I was trying to get a
sense of what the difference was between
your breakfast presentations in kind of
a normal lunch and learner Brown Bag
session so I think for us the main
difference may be that at the luncheon
world we have an hour and it's really
kind of a collaborative thing in the
morning presentation is really like 15
minutes presentation on what we have
done since last presentation or whatever
so it's more of a face forward saying
when you present to the entire company
ok great
one more question up I didn't see any
kind of talk of retrospectives or any
kind of learning post-mortems of russia
failures or anything like that we do
that as well on both smaller scale and
larger scale of course so it's one of
the big things where we fail to do
retrospectives and see what we can learn
from it so we work a lot of interest
perspectives to you anybody else that
has something that they want to share I
would like to learn something yes
so my question is you've got many teams
in your organization 950 people do they
have do you have extensive dependencies
from one team on to another team and and
how do you manage that in an agile way
yes of course we do and we struggle with
it all the time to have you know how to
set up the organization with you know
the difference between game teams and
supporting teams and and it's not that
easy when you grow i kind of agree that
but i think that we try to to have the
company work more as a community the
meaning that we really foster a culture
where people could talk to each other
directly rather than go to a manager's
they talk to managers that then goes
back down so so developers talk directly
to developers over the entire
organization but of course we struggle
sometimes with you know because we you
want to have team to be as autonomous as
possible but at some cases many teams
need to work together and i don't have a
good answer to that actually more than
we try to work in it as a community
based company more I'm sorry okay truth
so my next question is you know there's
lots and lots of different activities
going on - do people get sort of
fatigued with all of this or breakfast
lunch off sites you know thank God it's
Friday I think that some do most of this
is of course volunteer so if we do like
sugar Friday if you rather not do it and
just you know keep working on your
backlog you're more than willing to do
that
it's a course of violence and sometimes
it could be too much so you need to have
some kind of ballast and then just you
do you retrospectives like you said and
ask the organization what they want to
do so we don't move it over do this
there was hoping that somebody should
have at least some new thing that they
do to share knowledge and create a
learning organization you're great first
time for something at yo one yes first
time at JavaOne yeah there you go
my name is Eric I worked with GE
healthcare which is quite a bit larger
than King yeah one thing that we are
starting to do within healthcare is
we've started a development network of
excellence and we have brought in
speakers such as bob martin and matt
feathers on-site and also we will WebEx
that so that people that remote sites
can participate and listen in and see
the presentation so that's one thing
that we've been doing and we're also
starting a TDD community of practice
kind of similar to some of the sugar
Friday account ideas where people will
get together and just practice TDD for
an hour on some random project so they
can practice their skills because TDD
and agile something we're introducing
into our culture that hasn't been there
in the past so it's great then I have a
question yeah so why do you bring in
like Bob Uncle Bob Martin and people
like why don't you use somebody else in
your own organization because like I
said you were quite larger conversation
I'm not the one to decide but these are
you know notable people within the
industry that have a lot of knowledge
and cachet do you think that people in
your organization could grow if they
could be part of your oh yeah we
our network of excellence is open to
anybody within GE healthcare so we have
over 500 members worldwide yeah that's
part of it we have a social jive site
where people can post ideas and get
feedback from other developers and stuff
so if we find different articles that
are of interest on Sadie's own Deb's own
or what-have-you we can post links to
there and say hey what do you guys think
about this and I'm having to so we do
polls and that kind of thing on the
different solvers right great thank you
okay and we had one more over there
right and I think that will be it would
be last and I would kind of finish this
up a bit early I was actually thinking
I'm going to be late that was hello my
name is Ron and back-end engineering at
tweeks we have a similar thing of guilds
and what we do at tweeks is our
developers actually work four days a
week and on the guild day every Thursday
we have a guild a and what we did is
gamified this day so and what we do is
basically people get points for every
knowledge sharing activities that they
do so if you give a Tech Talk if you
help someone on the one-on-one sessions
developers can justify a man and if I'm
an expert on TDD it can call on someone
okay I'm gonna sit with you for a half a
day or a whole day and just do the
one-on-one sessions we do pairing up so
we have a task list of things that
people want to develop that can improve
their productivity or framework or
something that on their day to day job
the tasks they don't have time to do it
because there is a future day
so on the guild day we have time to do
what developers action you want to do
research something or they want to to
help improve our own framework so they
pair up from people from different teams
of infants from different locations they
pair up and for every such activity they
get points and we get the score board
and that's alright just so what could
you do with the points you get the power
of the clinic you're breaking points
okay bragging points and the more you
share basically when things come up like
okay who's gonna go to just one
convention for instance so the people
with more points have more chance to go
to something that can enrich them and
share knowledge with other okay it's all
about sharing knowledge
thank you okay
you never get hit by by creating a bit
early right so I just want to end this
session with team autonomy which I
really think is the most important thing
for us at King
so when people and the team can decide
on these things so team decides what to
ship how to ship it when to ship it and
they also always take care of it eff
afterwards in production so this creates
an environment where people are and
teams are proud of what they do they
don't hand over badly things to
production so you develop it you improve
it you tweak it and then you live with
it we think that really is good and that
kind that creates passion for the team
since they're really proud of of the
games that they are doing this leads to
happy developer and happy toy makers and
happy developers make great and fun and
high-quality games that's it for me
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
