Anzio and we are at Oracle code in
Hyderabad India and I'm here with Venkat
Subramanyam okay welcome thank you and
you just came off the keynote stage a
few minutes ago and we had a pretty good
turnout here today it's about five six
hundred people in that audience obvious
one very good very good
okay you gave a really interesting talk
about simplicity and writing code that
is high-quality and simple I don't want
to be minimized actually using that term
simple but I want you to explain the
actually actually what you mean by
simple what does it mean to write simple
code and you started off by actually
quoting Confucius philosopher thousands
of years ago so what does he have to say
about simplicity in code so so one of
the things that we have to deal with
every single day is ourselves humans we
are very smart very creative we come up
with solutions we can't explain why we
come up with solutions the spur of the
moment we also have to deal with our own
emotions we get into analysis paralysis
our ego kicks in we want to make things
look smarter because we want to be
looked at as smart people if you don't
mind me sharing something from 2530
years ago somebody said when you were a
walk into this room when you find this
person you will never guess who this
person is because this person would look
totally simple and I was had an
appointment with this person to meet him
I'm sitting there and it saw somebody a
ridiculously simple walked by and looked
at him for a minute actually felt sorry
for him and it occurred to me it's him
and that that incidence just stuck to my
mind forever you know no cloud around
nothing fancy
very few people are actually like that
and you know that that's what we do as
human beings we we have this you know
two things to fight one is our
creativity our ability to innovate the
other is our
you know desire to make things simplex
to me simplicity is it's quite a number
of things that put together if I don't
have to fight to make a change to
something that is simple they it has a
direct impact on economy economic impact
of quality comes through simplicity
something that's more complex is
something that's going to take more time
effort money to maintain in the long run
it takes money time effort to create
something simple to burn more time in
effort more time in effort
ok so that's probably one of the reasons
why it's harder to do something that's
simple and yes but the saying pay me now
or pay me twice later I think that's
what it really comes down to we all say
that but yet we default to writing the
complex things and why I think I think
it comes to maturity you know in my own
life I've realized this there was a time
when I was a person who would be sitting
at the desk all the time I mean let's be
honest we all love working and and I've
loved working too and the more I did
that my health really went down and then
I started paying more on doctor visits
and the quality of life just goes down
and and so I went to the doctor and the
doctor said and here are some pills take
it and I did and I went back in this
doctor said so I looked into medical
records I mean from Mr item that tests
urine tests to various tests has been
done he said I'm looking at a you know
medical record of a healthy person you
have nothing wrong with you
I gave you the best pills for your
muzzle pain you're gonna tell me you're
fine now I said nothing could be further
from the truth
I'm still hurting and he said you're not
going to believe what I'm gonna say the
pills are not going to cure you you need
to get out of your desk and it was a
wake-up call for me because amount of
travel I was doing I would come home at
1:00 a.m. 2:00 a.m. in pain and I
realized that the only way this is gonna
improve is if I you know change the way
I do things
and and that really went a little deeper
than held for me because it made me
realize there's a similarity between our
health the human health and the health
of the code we write and when I write
books when I write articles when I write
software for code I maintain today I put
in more time more money more effort to
write quality code and I'm proud to say
that I've not spent time debugging them
I have not spent time so fixing concept
works the concept works really well but
it requires opportunity
it requires maturity it requires the
will the courage and also it requires to
a certain extent maybe I was a little
fortunate the managers have had the
people have worked with I could always
speak to them rather than being
submissive and challenge them and they
were okay with it and we could we could
have a healthy discussion and and decide
what what is the right thing to do and
and that kind of helped me to really you
know forge through better practices over
time I've made my mistakes as well like
anybody else has but but having the
right set of people has helped me as
well to really do the right things over
time so okay so you learn those lessons
early and you adapted and you changed
right so but but you know so you say
maturity someone like a young coder
still has to work within an organization
they still have to work with managers
yelling at them because that you know
something has to ship in today's world
everything has to ship now right and it
has to be perfect
juggle those two things at the same time
but the need to writing if you're
writing something that's complex you
need to actually spend time you need to
focus you need to go deep you need to
allow the connections you need you need
to allow the connections you know minds
all to you take place so you can write
something that's of quality but that
takes a little bit of time upfront how
do you deal with the pressure from the
organization or just the world several
things I think that the first thing is
we are so so stepping back for a minute
I think developers have a systemic
problem I think if you come to me and
ask me how much time I need to do
something I'm going to think about it
and say well if I tell him it's gonna
take two months is it gonna be happy so
I'm trying to deal with emotion and try
to figure out what would sell rather
than being you know brutally honest if
it's gonna take two months to do this
quality work it's gonna take two months
to do quality work to be able to stand
up and say that should be okay so that's
the maturity power coming and you first
be able to say you're able to say that
the second thing is we're doing way too
much than we should one of the
principles I thoroughly like as the
principal called the yagna principle -
what Yagnik yeah you're not gonna need
it and time and again I see developers
writing code that's totally not needed
not me okay if I can avoid writing code
I don't need to write that's time safe
to write better quality code of what I
should be writing so so almost
constantly asking the question should I
be doing this one of the things that we
tend to forget sometimes is as a
programmer I get excited about doing
stuff but I should stop and ask the
question what value does this have for
the product if it has a 5% percent value
for the customer if I'm spending 50
percent of my effort developing it it
doesn't make any sense
the other thing that really woke me up
as I was working with it for a client
and they had a feature in the current
product and they were developing a newer
version of the product and I asked them
the question why are you doing this
and the first answer is we're doing it
because the old product does it I said
well that's one answer but why are we
doing it why is the old product doing it
but it came to a point where that
developers got really angry and said
it's needed we do it what's wrong with
that why are you so stuck about it but
it was the president of the company who
was sitting in the meeting and said no I
want you to answer the question and then
he said you don't maybe know this but
60% of the support call we get is on
that one feature I didn't know this
because I'm the stranger in the company
I'm a consultant from the outside I
didn't know this but it felt wrong to me
to be doing this and when he said that
everybody's like oh well and then we
found out that the feature that has zero
value that a customer but it's there
because the company wanted to collect
some data and this was a pain for the
users because they were forced to go
through steps that doesn't give it give
them any value at all and he took a
pencil put a little box around that
feature but I accent said this will
never be done in the future and then he
put a line around it amount of time
spent in developing the feature and
amount of support they are spending
every week answering calls to people put
the cost together that's something you
don't have to do I work with
organizations where they have massive
70% of the code I'm not even kidding
70% of the code to solve a problem that
wasn't necessary wasn't necessary and
they called me to come and fix it when I
went there I'll be honest I had all this
vision of how wonderful I can I'm gonna
fix this problem for them and when I
went there when I started asking the
questions I found out they don't have
this problem at all
so we had to remove the code rather than
solving the problem and and this is just
an
you know common in the industry all the
time and effort we put in to solve
problems that doesn't exist if we can
save the time and money we can create
better quality code with the time in
mind the third is to really get
critiqued this is one of the things that
I honestly it's like what Newton said
I'm seeing farther because I'm standing
in the shoulders of the giant the man is
brilliant but something has left us to
think about every one of us benefit from
being critiqued when I create concept of
a code review code review is one but not
just code review it also but just a
general awareness am i doing some stuff
that I should be doing is this a good
priority right code is definitely code
review is important that's one part of
what we do so this is just a mindset
then always having in mind that you need
to expose yourself to critical review
the critical review and and just to be
questioned even when somebody's why are
you doing it because oh okay maybe I
shouldn't be doing this we get tangled
up so quickly in solving a problem given
to us which is our human nature right we
are we are these people like solving
puzzles right but at some point we our
task isn't the right puzzle to solve is
to is to keep constantly challenging
each other I think is a very important
that's a mindset that's a mindset that's
where you have to actually stop and
reflect a little bit on is this the
right way to go it's a mindset bit is
not so culture we can bring the it's a
it's a culture that comes out of that
mindset because in organizations that
work then it was perfectly okay to walk
up to somebody and critique them it's
perfectly okay to invite them to
critique you I've also been in
organizations where you're like you stay
away you do your stuff I do my stuff and
then they work in these silos
I think this openness to be critiqued so
that's a corporate culture but you also
have real culture like different
countries and different nationalities
and then it's a different way of
interacting it is but surprisingly
though I would walk across the eighth
floor of a company and from one end of
the corridor to another I would have
seen two three cultures already there is
also team culture with the team there is
a way that people were
across the team and also within a team
itself as an example one of the things I
normally do when I teach classes is I
expect you know people to pair up with
each other I was surprised because in
one company these two programmers who
are pairing up they could have been a
married couple they were fighting so
hard and then when this lab was over I
shuffle pair for every lab and they both
went and paired with somebody else and
they were just getting along just fine
and I just said look at you you were
fighting you know an hour ago and now
you both are just so happy working with
other people like I hate him I hate him
and that's something important to keep
in mind as well some people can get
along really well but that just the same
people may not be able to get along so
well with somebody else right chemistry
is important right and and we need to
find the right kind of people you know
one of the things I always say is you
know in agile manifesto they say
face-to-face interaction is the best
form of communication I totally disagree
I disagree I'll tell you why when all
else is equal face-to-face communication
is the best but all else is never equal
I have worked with people honestly so
extremely well that I've never met in
person four years ten years running I
have a wonderful relationship with
somebody that I work with them every
week but I've never met them it's the
attitude it is a chemistry we have that
going we don't have to meet but if the
person next to me is somebody who I
don't really get along with it doesn't
matter that we have a face-to-face
conversation away from each other right
so so to me it's the attitude it's the
chemistry it is the willingness to work
together is the most important when when
I have the ability to take your
critiques as not an insult but as an way
to improve myself that changes the whole
thing right I think that's very critical
so how many engineers are developers
young yeah actually particularly young
developers realize how
humaneness is involved in writing code
and all these principles you just talked
about they're just human okay
there's human interactions how many of
these young people are aware that that
these are the principles that they need
to internalize to really write great
code one of the reasons why they maybe
are not as aware is we have worked in a
in a in the world in the societies where
we have methodically told them that's
not important right and we learn from a
lot of other people when we do this if
I'm writing code and you tell me as an
example to say don't worry about quality
nobody cares I'll give you an example of
this I had a speaker that I was
interacting with in a conference very
nice gentleman a little older than me
and and I know being a programmer he
said he has been teaching his son to
write quality code and he's a person who
writes books on better sort of quality
as well his son goes to college and
first semester who takes computer
programming course writes code three
factors a thousand three factors that
got a thousand times goes to the
professor and says here's the code cross
F gives a hundred and the student goes
to the professor and says excuse me you
gave me a hundred and it's like you're
not happy with a hundred like no but you
never critique the code I wrote and the
person go away the program works no need
to really look at it and and the student
is like but my dad asked me to rewrite
the code a thousand chapters and here
you are saying you don't care about it
and the professor is like we don't care
about it go away nobody cares how the
code looks as long as it works we're
fine
so elegance and style and efficiency and
these can't leap out of the door well
the problem is we can make the code so
so when it's easy to make the code work
the problem is making the code continue
to work we have to evolve the code you
have to make changes to it so the cost
is not in writing the cost is in
rewriting the cost isn't coming and
making changes to the code and all
so in that stage there might be somebody
else working with that code one of the
one of the one of the things I recently
was asked to write a foreword for a book
it you know when he when he asked to
write a foreword for a book you're in a
strain of a shock first of all ski what
do I write so sad back and talk a
thought about it and it occurred to me
something that we can't ignore and and
here's what I wrote as I in forward when
you walk through the door for those of
us who live in a you know culture
civilized society ever so gently as you
opened the door and walk you know
unconsciously these days you hold that
momentarily look a little behind because
you want to make sure you don't shut the
door on the person behind you
so that's humanity right you're thinking
about the person behind you when you
write code there is always a person
behind and and and that is what we need
to really think about right
so as I'm writing the code I am focused
on myself but if I think about the
person coming after me then I'm not
gonna focus on therefore to write it I'm
gonna focus on therefore to rewrite it
I'm gonna ask the question should I hold
the door for the person next coming over
it's good analogy how could I create a
variable name so that it doesn't slam on
the face of the person coming behind
yeah yeah you spoke about variable names
I thought that was really interesting
you want to love your variable names or
something like that
it's professionalism right so to me I
care about professionalism if you and I
don't care about what we do right nobody
does right and to me if you if you hire
a plumber the quality of a plumber is he
leaves leaving no mess behind he doesn't
have a leak on the floor is not left a
red carpet you go to a really good
restaurant you see the chef doing the
work these are professionals but you
know I travel a lot so which means just
getting a few hours ago didn't you I
threw the streets late in the night
because I would go to dinner I would sit
and work usually that's my habit of
working in restaurants
eating meal and doing my work and by the
time they finish up my work
let's arms begin to close and one thing
just just was striking to me as I walked
through in the evening I see these
restaurants busy people heating having
good time and then late in the night I
walk back in the reverse direction the
restrooms are empty the seats are
toppled up on the top of the desk right
and I always look at this and say
dentists clean up the restaurants clean
up
we programmers leave the debugger and
running in the night with pizza next to
the table pretty bored wouldn't that be
nice if we have the shift where we clean
up and then come back and start the next
day
to me that's professionalism right so we
get tangled up so much with the Colbert
writing that we lose sight of the big
picture of what we are doing and when we
do I think we need to slow down to gain
speed thank you slow down yeah you know
slow down to gain speed and and we're
not doing that enough and I think that's
one of the biggest challenges there
there's so much we need to do as a
profession to get better at what we do
right and and and there and the good
news is there are people who care about
this but but I think there's not enough
of them and and that's one of the things
if we can actually you know this is one
thing I tell my children every single
day you know I always use this face we
need more good people in this world and
that's what I say in our profession - we
need more professionals in our in our
field we we just cannot afford to
continue at the pace we are excellent
this is a really important issue I'm
very interested in it so let's leave it
at that
thank you very much thank you thanks
thanks so much and I see the room here
is filled with a couple hundred people
the developer lounge is filling up and
come back again and we'll have some more
interviews this is Jin Gore's anzio
we'll see you soon
Thanks thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
