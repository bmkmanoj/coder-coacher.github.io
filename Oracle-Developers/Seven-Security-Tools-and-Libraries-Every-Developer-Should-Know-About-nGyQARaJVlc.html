security tools on lips every developer
should know about my name is Dominic
shadow and I'm a senior consultant at
preaching IT in Germany and I develop
all kinds of java based web applications
from smaller ones larger ones and I care
about security and especially I care
about security and development security
so but every developer can do in his or
her daily life to improve the security
of java web applications so when we talk
about security it's it's a complex topic
and lately we've realized maybe need
security in any web application or
especially in any application so we need
to Kate take care of it much much more
and need to develop the Q applications
I've from the beginning but now security
and complexity they don't go that well
together and we have to be at a lid of
the complexity as Java developers so
that even new trauma developers can
develop secure applications hideaway so
let's get use complexity with lips and
tools and of course in a Java
environment we have a unique community
with literally thousands of lips are
there the questions of course which one
is the right one so even when we limit
ourselves to secure little security lips
and security frameworks we have a lot of
possibilities we can choose from and the
question of causes which one is the best
one to solve my particular problem and
I'm not able to present a general
solution today because audio problems
all your applications are relatively
unique but there are some general lips
that help us in
a lot of situations and make our
development and our applications much
more secure with tools it's a little bit
different because when we focus on tools
that help us to improve security to test
security and we use tools that are
especially designed for developers stand
too many available the important thing
here is we as developers we need to test
our applications we need to do security
testing after we've decided to create or
develop a secure application so these
are the seven security tools and lips
I'm going to talk about today tools it's
microsoft read more link tool overstep
direct security analyzer and ubers
dependency check and lips it's a west
java encoder tragedy and kisses are
maybe your to the one you're looking for
is not on the list and maybe some tools
or some lips don't help you in your
certain situation so please feel free to
talk to me afterwards i'm always
interested in getting to know new lips
so let's start developing a new java
application and of course what chums
into one mind is much about the big
yogonda frameworks like spring security
apache sheilo i'm sure you all have
heard about but they are all round off
frameworks and they are well known so
i'm not going to talk about them today
and i have that complex frameworks you
can fill a whole session or even ten
sessions with content for these
frameworks so yes use them and use them
or use the lips i'm going to present as
an addition to that because they work
well together
when we start to develop a new web
application it's important to want to
think about the architecture to think
about the past participating systems
because what we need to know is what we
need to identify the ingham incoming and
outgoing data at first we need to know
which systems are participating or
interacting with our web application
especially our user input is coming from
and that this data is going to displayed
at the problem it often ends already you
think about the users inputting data and
nobody else but there are certain
databases web services you are consuming
that's the stuff a lot of developers
tend to forget this potentially
dangerous data coming from other systems
so it's not only the user and it's not
only the browser we are going to display
the data so we need some kind of threat
modeling and in my eyes perfect or
relatively good tool for that is
microsoft said modeling tool which was
recently released in the new version
2014 it may sound strange at first
because chama microsoft yeah this tool
doesn't care about a book claiming
language so the only thing you have to
decide here is about you design your
system its modeling all the
participating systems databases web
servers other applications your your web
application is going to talk to and you
model the requests and responses
traveling between these systems and you
create boundaries stool offers many more
possibilities you can Microsoft proposes
some threats that are common to web
applications so you can decide whether
you have to mitigate them or not you
have to talk and document how you're
going to mitigate them
still really has only one downside it's
microsoft windows only and since i'm
running a mac and i won't be displaying
its otay in a live demo so i'm only
talking about it but well it's enough
time to fire up a windows vm at home and
then model your education there so when
we talk about microsoft and i'm sure you
all have heard about the secure
development life cycle which brings us
to stride which is closely related to
microsoft threat modeling and you can
model all these feds that are
potentially harmful to your web
application and decide whether or not
you have to mitigate them or not this is
a bigger step you have to take the
important first step in my eyes is to
model our participating systems and
tomorrow boundaries and at these
boundaries we can see in the red lines
here you have to validate data and you
have to escape any outgoing data so data
endowing entering your system has to be
validated at these boundaries and of
course modeling doesn't validate you
data you have to implement that later
but you have to decide which points on
which regress potentially harmful data
is entering new system so do validation
at these points and the other way around
you have to escape your data leaving
your system before it is going to be
displayed in your browser so this is
what you should always take away from a
diagram like that but don't overdo it at
first don't this don't decide to address
all threads and wants to input
validation and output escaping it first
and care about it step by step
so microsoft said modeling tool has a
lot more features than that but the main
thing is you have participating systems
and your boundaries and then you can
decide how you mitigate these heads the
tool provides it serves some issue
tracking integration that you can
generate reports which you architect or
other developers made like to see and
after that well now we know all data
that's entering and leaving our system
so the next step would be to implement
validation and to implement output
escaping validation is not that much of
an interesting topic in minutes
hibernate validate or anything else like
that which is very unique to your
application and what valid data is in
your application but output is caving is
an important part who view is aware of
course I'd scripting xss of course to ok
but not too many upper de skating is
well one famous example is the dialog
box you can see on the right side the
data that leads to this output or to
this dialog box is the one on the top
script alert so in case neta inputs this
data are successful in our system and
our application returns exactly this
data or this code it is going to be
executed in the power zone and that's
cosine scripting so an attacker inject
JavaScript code the server returns it
and it's going to be executed in the
users parcel of course this dialog is
just assembly because no attacker can
make any use of an alert dialog like
that but he's interested mainly in your
session ID so he's going to take your
session or the session ID he can achieve
and use it and pretend to be that huge
against system
so what we as developers have to do we
have to mitigate that set and we have to
do output is taping and what output is
caping dances but the code you can see
on the bottom it takes the angle
brackets and escapes them LT and GT so
the Browse is going to display this data
instead of executing it as code and what
you can see as well as there are three
different contacts on the slide HTML CSS
XML and you can see that it is Kate data
looks different and this is important
when we escape output data we have to
select the context carefully because
otherwise is caping the encoding will be
incomplete and the power might still
execute it and only save us from half of
the dangerous input so select the proper
context generally it's HTML because
you're going to display the user input
in an HTML page but sometimes it might
be CSS it might be JavaScript it might
be part of a URI so you have to be
careful what context the data is going
to be used and the lip you should use
for that is a west java in quran OS Java
in cooler is a great lip to do output
escaping it's easy to use and it offers
2025 output is caving methods for
different contexts so you only have to
input your potentially dangerous data
and return the value is Kate and say for
display now yeah as I said about 25
different contexts so select them
carefully if you're using jsps you can
even do that directly inside your JSP
file before returning it to the user and
there's even at a clip you can use which
offers the same methods for outputting
coding
at this point a little warning because
when you think about HTML encoding well
what comes in the world mind is yeah
let's escape the angle brackets so
that's the only thing we have to escape
in order for the power to display the
data instead of executing it this is
dangerous because an attacker often
doesn't simply serve an angle bracket he
escapes it himself using some encoding
some masking possibilities and then you
will miss it so never ever do any
escaping yourself use a lip use almost
travel encoder and by now it's time to
do some hacking in this case a cursor
first this expression was is well known
by toy hunt and it simple means we as
developers we have to hack or attack our
own applications before an attacker
Bassett so yeah we are developing secure
applications so let's test it and
testing yours into hacking in this case
and what we need to do is we have to
test our validation and we have taught
it that has no escaping boundaries and
this is a little change in mind because
we don't only test validated input we
have to test unvalidated input so what
we need to do is we have to bypass
funded validation and test the bag and
validation how does our bag and react to
invalidate it data and the next step of
causes work how does our fondant react
to an escaped output the bag and expects
data to be validated fondant expects
data to be escaped so let's change that
and attacker will do exactly that and we
should do that before him in order to
have a chance to fix our application
before we deliver it
the problem of causes yeah we have
funded validation in place maybe we have
bacon validation in place we do output
is keeping you back end so how do we
test an escape data how do we test and
validate it input never deactivate your
validation or you are police kept in
trust for testing using intercepting
proxy so this intercepting boxee sits
between your web application and you
also you can intercept any League West
leaving your browser and intercept any
requests leaving your web server before
it is going to be displayed in your path
again the important thing here is your
application this is hacking so be
careful you have to have the permission
to test your application like that don't
attack other web applications only your
own heck yourself and the tool must
already mentioned a couple of times
today / SAP said attack proxy is a nice
tool for developers and for pen testers
to intercept incoming and outgoing data
or requests and responses together with
foxy boxing in as a Firefox add-on you
can use this relatively easy to
intercept these requests and responses
almost sap is a much bigger tool that
I'm going to talk about today so I'm
sketching on the surface here Simon
Bennett's the project leader for web
said will give a talk about it advanced
features tomorrow so what I'm going to
focus is really on the intercepting
proxy part because well over set
features it contains a lot of attack
functionality like scanners and force
pausing and fastening and spiders and
again here warning the especially
fastening and spider
it very recognized as an attack on your
application so if you have fit
administrators in your company they will
notice you are going to attack an
amplification I will look like an attack
so make sure you have the permission to
do it I've said before that we should
test our application in order to deliver
an escape data back to the fondant so
the back end is kate's the data which
will be displayed in the fondant an
intercepting box the intercept and
response and makes this data or converts
back to code so the power would execute
it again and now you might ask yourself
who is going to stop that from exit
being executed well the browser can
defense in depth the browser can be part
of our security strategy of our secure
web application and can help us to
protect our web application from being
attacked so in order to do that we need
security headers security at us tell you
how your web application should behave
in the fondant so you can tell your
browser don't display the data don't
execute it don't connect to other
domains and execute JavaScript from
there that's the content security policy
I'm talking about there are several
other headers which will make your
application more secure so you have to
add these headers to your response I'm
not going into detail on these headers
I'm talking about that on Wednesday but
instead i'm focusing on the content
security policy and what a Content
security policy does is you define which
systems or which domains can be part of
your web application so you create a
white list of URLs
of systems but you can use JavaScript or
images from for example and content
security policy prevents inline scripts
from being executed in a puzzle and in
line remember that a javascript dialogue
from before that's an inline script when
you inject it in a text box and it's
going to be displayed on your page
that's inline JavaScript and the content
security policy prevents that from being
executed and that's exactly what we want
to mitigate cosine scripting so yeah
bishop or we deliver these headers as
part of our response and we have of
course to make sure that they are
actually contained in our response which
can and should do for example manually
check it with Firebug or any other
puzzle plug-in you like to make sure
they are contained in the header and
what I recommend as well is that
executed here analyze a plug-in this is
an add-on for comb it's not available
for Firefox so in this case you have to
use Chrome for development and what is
tool does it checks the response headers
of the egg times response and it gives
you these nice little green check marks
and tells you hey everything is fine you
had us our correctly set or it gives you
a yellow exclamation mark or that course
in case there's something wrong and you
get some minor tips about how to fix
that so this is a perfect extension to
make sure all your headers are set
correctly and with that it's time for
some demo and a little coat I've
prepared a simple java web application
which i'm going to show you at first
and what I've prepared as well as
whatsapp this is how sub you looks like
who've us you said before okay only a
few of you what's app does is when you
add it as proxy is well it intercepts
all requests to localhost and that's
basically all I have done here which
makes us app already happy and as you
can see it collects all data and all the
quests are traveling full set at this
point and this is the typical cause I'd
scripting example we have an unprotected
inbox so the user can input anything in
here consume a little bit more and of
course this is going to be executed and
in this case and alert dialog pops up
with my session ID in this case and what
an attacker in real life would do he
would attach this session ID for example
to an image pointing to his server and
he would know the session ID at this
point so he can pretend to be me when he
delivers that session ID with us the
rest so we have two problems here
actually my session ID is exposed and
the input that an attack of all rights
is executed the first stuff you'd
normally do it but you do some input
validation so here as you can see have
implemented some simple fondant
validation which encode
looks really simple because it's simply
a pattern up here so it's only fondant
validation and then any attacker would
be happy to figure that out because but
at the moment he's and her unable to
send this data so what you as a
developer or an attacker should do is ma
you SAP intercept the request this up
here creates a break point for LDV quest
so when I click on send sabes
intercepting and as you can see this is
the input I've created as well add
content so what is a new job as a
developer is now well replace it with
them dangerous content and it's like in
any IDE click on continue for a break
point and it's going to be executed as
well this is intercepting requests and
that's what you should do if you have
some funded validation implies because
this is the only way to test your back
and validation and potentially harmful
data so i should have turned it off the
next step of causes well let's bring
some output escaping in place and
there's no input i turn the input
validation off in this field and if you
click on send that's a Busta Java
encoder which takes care of escaping
this data so it's only displayed and not
executed and if you look at that in code
it's done in a servlet and what I'm
using here's I'm encoding it for HTML
cuzn for example which would be wrong at
this position because it's only HTML
which is valid here and
summer and the return response well it's
escaped now what would happen if we
intercepted response so when you click
on send the response is intercepted and
as you can see here it is escape so it
will not be executed in a browser and of
course you can change that as well and
let the bars i execute it again and this
is what you should do in all your
applications sorry
and of course the blouse is going to
execute it and the only thing that can
save you here in this case is now turn
it off its content security policy at
this one here is interesting because
it's different than before and if we
intercept this response you will see
that it's not as Kate so the code is
active in here and normally the possible
of course execute this so if you click
continue we would expect a dialog to pop
up but it's not there and that's because
of the content security policy that you
can see in here and to swim in this is
the content security policy that's
active at this point and prevents the
output from being executed and if we do
that again sorry
you can see that the Basel actually
reports a violation I'm afraid it's in
German because I fer a German and it's
gone already a German browser but it
simply tells us ada passed blocked this
air resource from being executed the
inline script because of content
security policy so the next thing to i
will show you is the security head up in
in the rec security analyzer I've
prepared another application for that
and if you look at that you can see it
as a violation creeper that's how our
comb solves it and you can see that's
like security analyzed in action so you
can see ok the response header content
security policy looks fine in this case
X content have options and others slick
Transport Security is yellow because i'm
not using https cache-control has a
warning and the others are clean asthma
so this is how you can verify that your
head us actually do work and do that you
are on the right track fixing that
problem
okay so that was the first half and I've
prepared some other lips if you keep
dragging there are some lips left and
there are some tools left we have to
talk about and one big problem in
application security and secure
development often is cryptography
cryptography is even more complexed and
secure development at least that's what
everybody thinks and one problem is yeah
we are not using the right lips to do it
so if you talk about passwords and
applications well it's not only user
passwords that we have to hash and store
them in the database but its data source
passwords for example that are used
together with spring or hibernate
configuration or any other configuration
so what happens awfulness but this
sample is a data source configuration
with spring and at first it looks really
good there's no plaintext password in
this code we have username and password
and yet it points to properties file and
if we have a close look at the
properties file we can see the password
in plain text and every attacker is
happy about that operations doesn't like
it because there's a plaintext password
on disk nobody wants that the question
is how do we replace it how can we make
it secure charset is the answer gossiped
is a lip and it's it contains some
command line tools but jazak does is
what it encrypts your password with
another password and this sounds strange
at first because you replace one
password with another pen spot and you
still have the problem of storing get
password we will talk about that in a
second
but first of all it's important that
your database password your data source
password isn't plain text anymore it's
encrypted and it is one to one ratio one
password and one password encryption
password it sounds strange but often you
have five or ten passwords you have to
angle it and you can use the same
password or you can use different
passwords so maybe you have a five to
one relation ratio or ten to one which
makes more sense and what you do with
the command line is well you enter your
plaintext password in my case that's
sent the password I just select the
password to enter to this password
between spring transcript in this
example and you select an algorithm and
the output you can see at the bottom is
the encrypted password and this is what
ends up in your spring properties file
in your other properties file whatever
you do use you highlight that isn't that
is an encrypted password by putting it
in brackets and using a keyboard ank and
that's it you have to do a little bit
more in code I will show you that later
but one problem remains what are we
going to do with the encryption password
don't store it on disk this would lead
to the same beside us before a general
recommendation here is to set up an
environment variable so you create an
environment variable password you start
your server the server reads this
encryption password decrypt the data
source password and everything works
fine and afterwards you have to delete
that environment variable and this might
be a problem because the next time you
start up you serve or you have to
restart it you have to remember to
creating this environment variable at
first so if it's in the middle of the
night an automatic restart we
work that's something you have to deal
with you mean during startup so that it
asked for your password
okay yeah okay it's not limited and so
the question was but you can use it in
any application server and it's correct
you're not limited to spring a tomcat or
anything you can use it with trailers
and stuff like that the other
possibility is you can create a servlet
which is launched you and start up and
ask for your password to encrypt these
are the passwords it's another positive
ability but you still will be asked for
your password that's you cannot avoid
that so that's one part of cryptography
in charm and well cryptography is a
bigger field than that and often we have
to encrypt sensitive user data and
sensitive user data has to be encrypted
in a proper way the problem with java is
here we have lots of algorithms and we
have a difficult implementation and a
lot of problems on using it so the
easier question ovnis to get which
algorithm do you want to use but it is a
symmetric or asymmetric so most of the
time it's a yes or RSA that's the easy
choice the next question then is which
mode AES contains several modes easy bc
bc c FB FBC TR and so on which one would
you choose and the correct mode has
demand is impact on how secure your
encryption is every encrypted data looks
like encrypted data and no matter which
mode you choose but in cryptography
expert it can analyze this data so it
selecting the correct mode is quite
important then we have padding we have
key size and all the key management
trouble so encrypting data I was trauma
is too hard the next problem is key
management yeah we should swap our keys
regularly
change passwords frequently every three
months and we half year or every year
but how often do you change keys most of
the time you are happy with their blades
and everything works fine and everybody
has the correct key to enter up the data
so your small keys or you think about
changing them but there's a data breach
that's too late ki sazaa is a lip that
helps us solve this problem keys a sound
one side makes it easy for us developers
to use cryptography to use encryption
because what kisses are does is well it
offers some defaults and it limits
itself so with kisses are you are
limited to aes d SI h megan our
algorithms and you have key for key
length you have default modes so the
only thing you have to select this
whether you want a es d sh make a now
say and these are for very well known
algorithms that I use most frequently
even when use Java so let ki sazaa do
that for you kisses are contains its own
command line tool kisses are tool so you
have a different tool for key management
which works a little bit different then
Java key tool you might be aware of
drama Keystone chamakita will are really
impressive tools a Cherokee store can
saw anything somatic SME turkeys
certificates even passwords with travel
and the key tool is powerful for that as
well as Jesus eyes limiting you as the
developer on cryptography usage but the
keys assault rule is simpler as well so
you have only a subset of commands you
can execute the important thing to
remember here is
cha marquee tool and key store kisses
are true and key set a key set is
different to a keystore each key set is
limited to one purpose it is a sign or
encrypt and it is symmetric is symmetric
so you have a specialized key set which
can contain many key versions of the
same type so let's say you create a key
set for RSA encryption it's as a metric
this key set can only contain us a kiss
and only one of these keys in there can
be the primary key the primary key will
be used when you don't specify any
specific version and now you create in
your key because you want to blaze it so
you put a new key in that key set and
set it to primary the old one will still
be there it's still active but it can
only be used in a passive mode so you
can use it today decrypt or you can use
it to verify a signature but you cannot
use it active anymore and that's key
management so ki sazaa makes key
management really easy it makes it
really easy to swap keys where you lie
there's one down side or am I no
downside let's put it that way and Jesus
I uses chasing format the sun's strange
at first because when you think about
cryptography you think about arbitrary
characters and not something you can
read easily but chasing you can read it
easily and as I will show you later you
can even make sense a little bit of
these keys the problem is there's no di
chasing support in Java keystore but you
can use an interchange format p.m. to
export and import keys between keystore
Cherokees to and kisses are so let's
have a look at the
cryptography part as i said before as
this for the spring application for
gossiped in order to work you have to
integrate a little bit more this is my
encrypted password it looks more or less
the same as a normal spring
configuration and you have to replace
your property configure with one form
transit which takes care of encrypting
the encrypted part and Moses is the ID
an encrypted part like user name and URL
as the default this is the only thing
you have to do except well storing the
password to encrypt this data and since
this is a demo project I have an easy
job and what I've done here is I've
created a system property with my
encryption password so during service
that this would take care of decrypting
the data source passport and in a
typical production environment you would
have to do that as an environment
variable the keys is our part is the
more interesting here and
now these are my key sets here I can
zoom in and as you can see I've created
two key sets for encrypting and one
facet signing and every key set is
stored in its own directory because
every key set contains a meet half I
like that and this meter file contains
information about the depository so
that's a human readable name that's of
no meaning anymore decrypt an anklet is
the purpose of this key set it's ours a
and it contains one version as you can
see here one is the key name and which
is of course primary so this deck I've
keep the primary sewing or the active
one and the somatic one looks very
similar to that except a diversion to is
active and the primary is still
diversion one and the key looks like
that so everything isn't chasing in here
you have the key size you have two key
and everything is readable that's the
setup are the key management part which
is for developer not that much of an
interest the the funny part begins here
because this is everything you have to
do to encode data with kisses are the
only thing you have to specify is the
key set path it points to symmetric so
it's a yes in my example and then you
have a crypto which contains the key set
pathway you tell them to input the
initial text and cipher text is the
output if you want to decrypt it it's
the same cripta and the decrypt
operation and that's it
and the extremely nice part is when you
compare it to alize so we switch from
symmetric to estimate again corruption
the code is the same the only difference
here is key set path is pointing to a
symmetric there's a good price before
the anchor method and adequate method
and compare that to a normal trauma
encryption and decryption operation
which is much more difficult so using
that is really easy and as you can see
it works this is my encrypted text and
it's quite long because its estimate
again coaching and if you look at a
signature sample it looks very similar
again the key set path points to
assigning get set he had the objects
they are named a little bit different
because we have a signer here used to
sign we have a verifier here you used to
verify but it looks very similar to the
tryptophan before so trapped ography
gets really easy using kisses are
so cryptography is easy output escaping
is easy if you use the nine lips and the
problem is with lips and chama but they
get outdated they get replaced by a new
version and every now and then these new
versions contain security fixes and we
have to take care that we are using yet
not vulnerable versions the problem with
these bites by libraries is yeah well if
an attack is known in the wild a lot of
applications are vulnerable so we as
developers we have the responsibility to
update our systems and as a normal
develop ability you create your maven
configuration at projects are you put in
some new version numbers and then you
develop and from time to time you think
about hey there's a new version
available maybe I should update my maven
configuration and test my application
with the new version but how often does
that happen and the boredom is of course
here you have to know that there's a new
version available and if you take a
typical java application which contains
twenty or thirty different lips it's
hard to keep track of that but on the
other side we have to be fail I mean lip
developers they make mistakes as we do
so they should have the chance to fix
their lips and we have to replace them
in our applications and one tool to do
that is a vast dependency check OST
penalty check is on once i had a
command-line tool which scans you Lib
folder for your application checks what
lips are contained in there and compares
these lips against the National
vulnerability database nvd and figures
out hey there's a security report on
that I puts that into a report so this
is done on command line on every
developer machine you simply download a
bus dependency check char
you executed it takes a while during the
first start because it has to download
the nvidia database about 250 megabytes
and it updates this one frequently
automatically and what you can see if
after that is a report like that this
report lists your dependencies so your
lips contained in web in flip folder or
wherever you are wherever they are and
it lists vulnerabilities be aware that
not every reported vulnerability in here
may affect your application so you still
have to be careful and I think about it
but often it's the first indicator that
it's time to exchange those lips even if
it's and expecially when it's an exposed
one like spring for example the next
step of course boot would be to
integrate this tool into Jenkins and
this one takes care of executing this
free part of this dependency check after
every successful build so you specify
which directors to scan you get a report
and you get this nice little chart at
the bottom and this chart is especially
useful for other developers that don't
care about security yet because they
will ask if the spire raises and what
you can do as well as well you can set
limits let's say you have five critical
vulnerabilities in your web application
the build can fail if you set the limit
of five I don't recommend doing that
because when other developers will get
angry about up failing build just
because of security so better educate
them on how to exchange or change these
lips and don't let the build fail
automatically the banerjee check can be
executed as maven plugin a small you can
use it in your art command line of
Champions so it's easy to execute this
all the time and that's what you should
do
not every month but we'd have with every
build do you have to be aware of the
fact that yeah only publicly disclosed
vulnerabilities are listed in there of
course if the NBD doesn't know about
vulnerability there's no chance to
report it so even if we thought is clean
and clean um there might be a vulnerable
lip india which hasn't been publicly
disclosed so far and what the penalty
Jake brings you to as well it makes you
think about your lip usage in your
application because often we create
million configurations we copy them from
other projects we use default templates
and we don't really care what lips and
what dependencies are listed in there
just ship it and if one liability check
or dependency check reports of violation
a critical vulnerability but you might
think about do I really need this
library in there or can i replace it do
I need it at all so dependency Jake may
clean up your mail in configuration a
little bit or your main dependencies so
even with one little web lips or
frameworks yeah use them I mean I have
talked about three lips today you should
use them don't reinvent the wheel the
important thing is keep your lips up to
date and don't use vulnerable and
outdated applicator lips in your
application and the next step we as
developers have to do we have to test
and hack our own applications frequently
don't wait for the penthouse us to do
that and don't made for attackers to do
that and with that well thank you very
much for your attention and have fun
with secure development
