freescale semiconductor and renew
motwani here with with Oracle and today
we're going to talk about Java on
kinetis microcontroller so turn to the
to the agenda here today first of all I
realized that this is a java conference
and not a microcontroller conference so
we'll start with a general overview of
microcontrollers just to make sure that
we all have the same the same baseline
so that when I'm when I'm talking about
mark controllers you'll know you know
basically what I'm what I'm trying to
say about them then we'll take a look at
the the Internet of Things and talk
about how the market controller market
is going to enter into influence the the
Internet of Things and then we'll take a
quick look at a free scales kinetis
product line of microcontrollers and
again how that can relate to to Java
embedded and the Internet of Things and
renew will then take us into a deeper
dive of Java ME embedded and how that
could enable some different devices and
applications on on microcontrollers so
maybe we could do a quick survey and to
see how many of you have worked with
microcontrollers before a few okay great
yeah that's like fifty percent almost of
it and in Java ME embedded yeah okay
great so a pretty good pretty I think
we're speaking to the right people here
and so let me start out with with a
quick look at a modern micro controller
so this is actually a free scale kinetis
what we call a case 70 microcontroller
so and I'll talk a little bit more about
some of the different kindest families
so this is a very high end of my
controller at least for free scale I'd
like to start in the top left there with
the core architecture the freescale
kinetics line is is based on the arm
course so this particular one is a as an
arm m4 cortex m4 you've probably heard
of the court the cortex-m products those
are the microcontrollers there's a
cortex are those are some of the
time controls and cortex a for
application processing and I don't know
if it was arms intention but with the
cortex a and RM they conveniently spell
arm so it's kind of easy to remember so
we're here focused primarily on the
cortex m-class and then the m4 core you
see this this particular product runs up
to about 150 megahertz it has a optional
floating-point unit which which is built
into the k70 but that you can see this
is a very comprehensive system on a chip
highly integrated and what makes this
microcontroller is really the the types
of memories that are embedded in in this
SOC so when I when I talk about a
microcontroller what I what I really
mean is an SOC that has non-volatile
memory built into it so this has flash
in this particular case up to a megabyte
of flash it also has some onship ram
with in this case up to 128 k bytes of
SRAM and this particular device has a
small amount of caches and as a ddr
controller so you can actually wire up a
large amount of external RAM and an
external bus interface so access to
traditional nor flash type devices so
external non non volatile memories
integrated clocks as well security and
integration another another key thing
for microcontrollers especially when we
start talking about the the Internet of
Things this particular device has a
cryptographic acceleration unit and some
CRC and some tamper detection and things
which make it nice for metering markets
point of sale type applications and then
you come to the analog so really talking
to external sensors collecting data from
the real world around it digitizing that
and then using that cortex m4 and the
processing power to process it and then
lots of communication interfaces here I
squared C spy spy uart canbus things
meant to talk to various onboard
peripherals as well as communication
peripheral so through those type of
interfaces you could wire up a Wi-Fi for
example or an 802 15 for radio
so let's take a look then at the
microcontroller market in general this
is a chart that shows the trend over the
past say 14 years or so or 20 20 some
odd years sorry and the important thing
to note here is that it's one it's a
very large market microcontrollers in
general 15 billion dollar market that
includes automotive and smart cards if
you exclude automotive and smart cards
it's about a seven billion dollar market
so things to note here is that 32 bits
is it gain dominance it's outpacing the
8 and 16-bit microcontrollers and arm
has become the dominant architecture in
32-bit microcontrollers a couple of
important trends to note here is this
the importance of connectivity and
security and ease of use and system
solutions so it's not just about you
know that that block diagram we looked
at that system on a chip it's really
about all of the software the
development environments the the SDKs
everything that wraps around that that's
what our customers want they don't want
a piece of silicon they want a solution
and that's where Java ME embedded can
can really come into play here so here's
a quick look at it some of the range of
applications that you might see a
microcontroller controlling so and all
of these freescale kinetis has is
embedded in these various applications
so from the top left medical device
they're an insulin pump consumer spaces
with professional cameras also the GoPro
you know cameras quite popular as well
featuring kinetis appliances with washer
and dryers small appliances espresso
machines we've got a couple of those in
our office there one of the perks of
having kinetis embedded as we get some
of these products to use here and in our
own office another perk the xbox gaming
equipment also built with some kinetis
microcontrollers so lots of different
devices some of them you'll see with
smart in the name so smart watch my
controllers are really what put the the
smart in these
in these various devices a few a few
other trends to note on this slide again
the ease of use but really the the
scalable portfolios our customers don't
want to build one washing machine they
want to build a whole line of washing
machines and so they need my controllers
and software solutions that can help
them scale from an entry level you know
washing machine basic unit all the way
up to the high end that's got the fancy
graphical interfaces and and
connectivity so another important trend
in the marketplace faster time-to-market
and connectivity and security again very
very important and a look at some of the
resources required for some of these
applications on the x-axis there you see
embedded flash memory requirements all
the way from 32 k bytes up to 2
megabytes and on the y axis relatively a
relative performance there shown in
megahertz so from 50 megahertz up to 200
megahertz so from the previous examples
we have some appliances here not taking
too many resources for your basic level
appliance but blood glucose meters all
the way up to point of sale and
wearables consuming more and more
resources and in this space today we're
where Java ME embedded can play in the
microcontroller market so how our
microcontroller is influencing the
landscape of of the IOT so I love this
slide is sort of the water cycle view of
the Internet of Things so the Internet
of Things is really different to
everybody it's different services it's
different different technologies and it
all means different things to different
people so sort of on the outer branches
of the tree there you see some buzz
words like smart energy smart home smart
parking smart health smart lighting even
smart cars but what's really going to
enable all that is is services and
infrastructure and the underlying
technology that technology is sensors so
collecting data from the
real world accelerometers gyroscopes
magnetometers pressure sensors
altimeters etc and then processing power
microcontrollers microprocessor is all
the way up to high-end networking
processors to build out some of that
network infrastructure and then
connectivity Wi-Fi of course a Bluetooth
Low Energy becoming very popular the
cellular network what a lot of people
think of when they think Internet of
Things is really machine a machine over
cellular so I OT is a bit more than that
but also including 6lowpan zigbee other
protocols over the 80 to 15 for network
and that feeding up through software and
software services into this vibrant
ecosystem of various services and that's
really where the the Internet of Things
is going to be defined and that's the
area for Java embedded applications
developers to really make a name for
themselves and building out that
infrastructure and building out the
services and those applications that
make things smart and NS secure and of
course the the growth in this area is
going to drive other requirements it's
going to feed back into the technology
requirements so more processing power
and my controllers advances in in a
non-volatile memory so all of these
things sort of creating a cycle for for
the Internet of Things so let's take a
quick look at a few examples of your
categories of Internet of Things so the
first one being remote monitoring and
control so this is really humans
interacting with with things so you've
got your tablet or your smartphone and
you're able to monitor devices inside
your home so you have a DVR this is a
one thing that I actually make use of
quite a bit I've got DVR in my house and
it's it's got a web front-end I can call
that up on my phone and I can schedule
different recordings I could actually
watch recordings that my DVR is recorded
on my smartphone so me interacting with
that nanny cams or security systems as
well so humans interacting
those smart devices a telehealth another
good example there so using devices in
your home that take your statistics your
vitals etc store that information and
push it up to a doctor or a hospital to
help monitor other categories where no
human interaction is is required at all
so things like the smart grid so the
ability of the grid to monitor its usage
in balance accordingly traffic
congestion vehicle to vehicle
communication to to help avoid or reduce
traffic congestion smart agriculture
another very interesting application so
very selective irrigation controls or
micro climate changes with again no
human interaction all based on sensors
and and the data being collected and
processed in the things themselves smart
lighting another good example and in
that same category of requiring no human
interaction intelligent transportation
smart highways so bridges that are able
to monitor themselves and detect
structural integrity issues and you know
send that data back up into the cloud or
patient monitoring and drug delivery
another controversial the topic sensors
collecting data and monitoring and
adjusting medication levels without any
human interaction whatsoever and then of
course we see this a lot with the with
the Google cars etc so vehicles
communicating with each other avoiding
collisions again helping to avoid
traffic congestion so here's here's a
look at how some of those categories
break down at the actual device level so
on the far left there you have the the
edge nodes of the end products so that's
where the sensors are the initial
processing and collecting of that data
and then the communication of that data
back up to hubs or layers of
of gateways etc so then on the on the
far right you have the cloud the remote
processing of all of that data and
that's again leading to the two sort of
classes of IOT applications there so
user interacting with that with that
data or maybe some of that data being
processed in the in some of those nodes
and control or actuation happening based
on the decisions that are driven by that
data and then of course you have just a
huge amount of data that's going to come
out of these of these devices right and
so data analytics or big data so there's
a lot of areas of innovation there if
you can process all that data in a
meaningful way make intelligent business
decisions or other decisions based on
all of that data that's coming in off of
these edge nodes so microcontrollers are
really what's driving this this edge
these edge nodes here today their
ability to connect up to sensors to
process that data to have connectivity
up to gateways and other layers of
networking through a variety of
different communication mediums it's
really what's going to drive the IOT so
here's an example of a blood glucose
meter communicating with a Ford SYNC and
again some some networking and data
centers so let's like take a look at how
freescale's product offerings map into
some of those different devices that fit
into those categories of the of the
Internet of Things on the far right hand
side here you have the core IQ
processors so these are very high-end
arm-based becoming arm-based devices
that are really driving that
infrastructure of networking so the
cloud computing the you know the Cisco's
of the world building these into a lot
of the networking infrastructure and
then in the in the center of where we
saw the the gateways in the hubs that's
really where the item X applications
processors in our new line of vibrant
control processors come
to play so these are again arm-based
cortex a perhaps so the applications
processing so again hubs or very
sophisticated edge nodes will be based
on these type of devices and then the
far left the actual kinetis
microcontrollers that were there here
primarily to talk about today so these
are very scalable low powers that
there's a full range of kinetis families
but these are what's driving innovations
in the edge nodes today the growth in
onboard flash memory and the sensor
technology that they're able to hook up
to so as you can see this is a very wide
range of products that that freescale
can offer and it's really the the
broadest and most scalable portfolio and
we think it's really going to drive the
the Internet of Things along with you
know the software and services that that
Java and the embedded can can provide so
again looking at the kinetis case series
and and there are very there are several
families within kinetis the case series
being the one most tailored for Java ME
and I won't bore you with with all the
details of the various product families
but this case 70 device you can see here
in this blue scales all the way up to 2
megabytes of a flash and these are just
the various pin packages to give you an
idea of how these things can scale up
and down all these different products
within a single pin compatible package
and so up up in this area is where we'll
find Java ME embedded coming into play
here in the in a very near term in fact
just this week we've created the first
look at a demo that's running in the
demo area over at the Hilton with Java
ME embedded running on a kinetis k70 so
I'd encourage you all to go over there
and take a look at that it's in the
smart home yeah the smart home demo
within the Oracle Oracle demo area so
that's that's a bit of look at the
software I'm sorry the hardware
of the the IOT in microcontroller so
I'll touch on a few slides here on the
software before handing it off to renew
to dive directly into Java ME embedded
but we looked at the trends of
microcontrollers and so here's sort of a
simplified depiction of the trends of
software over over the past 20 years in
microcontroller so on the far left
inside there you see what would be a
typical eight or even a 16-bit
application from as recently as ten
years ago and in some cases these are
still in production today applications
going out into the market today still
have software structures look very much
like this you have direct registers and
peripheral access is directly talking to
the hardware no abstraction layers and
then you have customer applications that
may even be in assembly language or
sometimes see sitting right on top of
that so very little scalability and this
type of a software architecture each
device you know changes require lots of
intensive software and if the engineer
who created that software happens to
leave the company then good luck to the
next guy trying to figure out what was
going on there to make any any minor
changes so today things are a bit better
you're starting to see some
standardization in hardware abstraction
in the arm space there's something
called cm sis cortex-m software
integration standards which is driving
some standardization into this
marketplace but it's not it's not
predominant it's it's not by any means
that the default standard but there are
some starting to emerge then a lot of
semiconductor vendors will put out their
own peripheral drivers and board
configuration to to aid in the
development of software on their
microcontrollers as part of their you
know ease-of-use offerings real-time
operating systems are used quite quite
heavily now as well as lots of
middleware so USB stacks connectivity
stacks motor control libraries digital
power conversion
your things that feed into the various
markets again sitting on top of what may
or may not be as a standard abstraction
and then a customer application code on
top of that so it's still a bit
fragmented still primarily based in c
and c++ if you go look at some of the
embedded surveys c is by far the
predominant language of development here
which is totally different from you know
the surveys on programming languages in
general we're daba java is once again
dominant and so here's how we think
things will change obviously this this
isn't going to to scale well as we get
into you know the Internet of Things
were those services you know in the
outer branches of the tree have to be
smart have to be secure and have to
scale across lots of different segments
so a huge opportunity here for for for
Java to come into play and really drive
these applications and really drive the
Internet of Things and so we're starting
to see some again like I said some
interesting abstractions here
freescale's driving some standards in
that space and we're working very
closely with Oracle to to get Java ME
runtime onto the kinetis
microcontrollers so that they can be a
dominant force into the IOT and of
course that's where you as Java
applications developers come in to
really drive these customer applications
and finally just uh since we're not all
microcontroller developers here i
thought i'd give you a quick glimpse set
just market controller application
development so we can contrast that with
how a java application development
happens so on the far left-hand side
there you see a couple of evaluation
systems that the freescale produces for
the caddis specifically for the kinetics
microcontroller family with the
freescale at our system which is
evaluation system we're running in the
in the demo lab there with the kinetic
k70 and Java ME embedded and the
lower-cost development platform that one
you see on the lower left cost twelve
dollars and ninety-five cents so if you
ever want to become a microcontroller
application developer it's pretty low
cost of entry but so
our customers typically pick up one of
those evaluation systems from us or from
a distributor and use that to kick the
tires very quickly out of box demos etc
but those don't go very far into the
evaluation so they have to download an
integrated development environment and
that may come from anyone of an arm
ecosystem partner so and I are a green
hills Kyle arm which is an arm company
Tolec organ ooh right so lots of
different development environments
summer eclipse-based some of them are
proprietary some of them use canoe as
the underlying compiler some of them are
proprietary and so again pretty
fragmented development environments they
have to you know write that code build
that code debug directly on the target
usually with a direct connection from
say their development pc laptop over a
special debug interface cable that plugs
directly into this board do you download
the application run it use some run
control breakpoints that sort of thing
running directly on the target so
depending on the size of the application
can be a very slow process right so very
different i think from what you know the
java application developer expects with
the the ease of use of being able to
virtualize run things on on the
development environment you know get a
get that runtime down on the target and
and just dump the finished product or
nearly finished product down on to the
the actual runtime so again lots of
opportunity for Java to come into this
environment and simplify things and
really again drive some innovation let
let the application developer worry
about application development and not
you know bringing up some of those
middle middle layers and debugging on on
the actual hardware so with that I'll
turn it over to a Renault to talk about
Java ME embedded
hey
great thanks Michael and before we get
started I would check if there are any
questions on specifically the
microcontroller introduction that we
provided and how its influencing the
landscape of Internet of Things sure
in our fire
conscious specialized centers
try cutting and emulators
we remembered it because the onion on
the invaders
the hardware emulation of the
specialized devices oh so you see the
opportunities as an expression so
let me just as a really a question
job
the door
EMS is out
very
yeah and just to add to it Java is not
to be perceived as a replacement for the
real-time operating system or any OS in
general running on a device it is to be
looked at as a complementary solution
which can enable other higher level
value-added services and works in tandem
with the functionality that OS can
expose so in this case it's the
real-time capabilities of the OS plus
the additional functionality that Java
ME or any flavor of Java running on the
device would provide which will help the
developers or the application providers
choose the functionality that they could
expose on those devices
sure please
I see like in your party only have a
great but let's say I have
and with that new project provided
there are your question about interfaces
yes
which
hi
absolutely those adoption i right
certainly
one thing I'd like all of you to bear in
mind as you hear through the rest of the
information here is we talked about the
different verticals that
microcontrollers have a role to play in
we will talk about the functionality
that Java can expose on microcontroller
based devices but as a device
manufacturer or as an application or a
service provider what are those
additional services that you think you
can enable on these devices using the
functionality that Java exposes so
that's one of the things that I'd be
interested in discussing with you post
this session and getting more feedback
and your inputs on on what you see as
additional possibilities beyond what is
being enabled today and before I get
started with the functionality of Java
I'd say don't just yet lose the sight of
this picture here that Michael showed
you because I would come back to it when
I contrast the application development
in the traditional way and how Java can
enable when put on microcontrollers so
with that I would get started on what
Java has to offer for embedded devices
to start with embedded devices in
general and then I would drill down on
these specifics of the flavor of Java
which is suitable for microcontrollers
so these are some of the things to bear
in mind not just as the value adds of
Java or the value proposition of Java
but specifically why it's now more
important for embedded devices all these
words highlighted here in blue such as
highly productive virtualization
environment or write once and run any
time these are not new for Java these
are the things that we've been talking
about as the value proposition that Java
offers to developers or device
manufacturers but now in the context of
embedded devices it becomes or in the
context of embedded programming it
becomes even more important and here's
why because when you are talking about
development on embedded devices these
are the devices which stay in the market
which have a long life for Italy
five to ten years and once they are in
the market once they are out in the
field it's very difficult to control
those devices or to be able to update
the applications or make changes in the
software which was already embedded or
flashed on those when they got out of
the factory so with Java enabling an
environment in which developers could
easily write those applications and at
the same time have an easy way of update
and deploy applications and services
when those devices are already in the
field is the biggest plus point besides
if you look at the fact that with a java
application you really don't have to
worry about making changes down to the
hardware level if you have to use that
same application for a different type of
a platform or a different type of a
device so the value that we talked about
the portability of Java applications is
even more important for embedded devices
which are so much more fragmented than a
typical desktop like environment where
you might have one OS or at max two or
three OSS or platforms that you
consolidate on but here in the case of
variety of different artists or a
variety of different kinds of hardware
that application developers might want
to cater to it becomes even more
important that this virtualized
environment can be enabled by the
application environment and lastly
whether it's for device manufacturers or
for application developers the fact that
you are not logged in to a vendor
because you have written your
applications or you've embedded the
functionality in your application
specific to a certain type of hardware
or some proprietary protocols that the
vendor implemented makes you make your
work or make your applications and
services be even more valuable so that
being the fundamental ground as why Java
is more suitable for embedded devices
let's take a look at what we have in
terms of the embedded product portfolio
of Java and remember the chart that
Michael
showed where you had the flash on one
axis the size of the flash on one axis
and the processing speed on the other
axis we talked about 32 kb two up 22 mb
of flash embedded flash memory as the
suitable size or the range of memory for
microcontrollers here the range is wider
because we are not just talking about
Java that caters to microcontrollers but
to a wider set of embedded devices but
if you are talking about what is
suitable for micro controller type of
devices we are talking about Java ME
embedded which typically requires flash
memory in the range of one Meg to 2 Meg
and that means in the graph that Michael
showed us we are talking about the
higher end of microcontrollers the upper
spectrum and if you think about it
intuitively those are the kinds of
microcontrollers which are being put on
devices which are expected to be open
and are expected to benefit from
services and applications which will run
over and beyond the applications which
are embedded in them when they get out
of the market get out in the market so
for that range of microcontrollers which
typically have one make to 2 Meg of
memory and in this particular case if we
look at also the size of the devices we
are talking about this range here small
to medium type of devices and in the
range of one mech to 10 meg which Java
ME caters to and which overlaps with the
Java ME for microcontroller reach so
what really is Java ME embedded some of
you are very familiar with Java ME
embedded some of you here I see in the
room are the ones who are the engineers
behind Java ME embedded and others
who've already worked with it so a lot
of these things might not be new to you
but if I were to describe in one
sentence what Java ME has to offer for
microcontrollers it's the Gateway for
creating intelligent applications on top
of your devices or as we mentioned
earlier my
controllers are behind making devices
smart and on top of that smartness
additional value add that developers
could provide or creating an open
platform is what Java ME embedded can
enable so look at it as an embedded
application development platform and
look at it as some reference
implementations that we already have
available for some standard platforms
that we believe when I say we which
Oracle believes the market is going to
consolidate towards and we can name
these standard platforms and we have
reference implementations available for
those so if you look up for any embedded
details on Oracle technology Network
website you will find that we have
binaries available for Raspberry Pi
which is the most common development
platform for developers we have a binary
available for Qualcomm's platform we
have binary for free scales kinetis
platform and as michael was mentioning
earlier you would see a demo of it in
the demo grounds and very soon you'll
get access to it through our Oracle
technology Network website so these are
the kinds of reference implementations I
am referring to or the standard
platforms that we see market is going to
consolidate with just like a typical
cycle that you see with any new
technology where we start with a lot of
different options but eventually based
on the market dynamics and the
preference of the developers and the
device manufacturers there is a
consolidation two to three or a max of a
handful of different platforms that
standardizes the market and lastly I
would say when you talk about Java ME
embedded don't just look at it as an
application platform but also as a set
of complementary tools which are
available to enable application
development and to expect the same
behavior from your applications when you
actually put them on the commercial
devices so we have the same emulator
which powers the Java ME SDK which is
the development environment that we
offer for writing applications to run on
the ME embedded platform so the idea
here is when a developer creates an
application and sees a certain behavior
using Java ME SDK the developer can be
sure to have almost the same behavior on
the actual device as well which is
powered by Java ME embedded so now the
important question Michael showed us the
chart the graph where he said how the
software has evolved on microcontrollers
we saw that in the past or even today
primarily the application development or
the custom applications on top of the
real-time operating system are written
in C and C++ and on the same graph we
saw a stack for tomorrow where we
included ME embedded or expect the
custom applications to be written in
Java so the key question is why would it
be Java going forward what was what is
it that will help us move from C to Java
and in addition to the key points I
highlighted about the value of Java
specifically for any embedded which is
the flavor for small devices it adds
intelligence to these small devices it
adds the ability to access a wide set of
peripheral so when we talk about
peripherals there is a broad range of
peripherals and the interfaces in the
form of GPIO spi i square C mmio ADC DAC
and a whole lot which are not
necessarily all implemented on all
devices so Java introducing an
abstraction layer for those peripherals
takes away that burden from the
developer to worry about what interfaces
are implemented on a device versus not
and have that same uniform experience
enabled to the end user so this is what
makes Java ME embedded useful and make
and enable it to make these small
devices more valuable other than that
Java ME embedded implements the
specifications of Java ME so
needless to mention these are all open
standards based on the j srs
standardized through JCP so it's all
based on open standards and lastly as i
mentioned earlier it's also about the
ease of development and the time that a
developer and a device manufacturer can
cut down on prototyping and actually
deploying these services and
applications on the end devices this is
what I believe is the reason for Java ME
embedded powering small devices or
making microcontroller based devices
more intelligent here is an inside-out
look at the Java ME embedded
architecture I won't get into the
specifics of each and every box here
I'll talk about these at a high level in
the next few slides but the key message
that I'm trying to drive from this stack
here is what is being highlighted here
in the legend there are some standard
components in the form of the GSR s such
as for xml or location messaging file
i/o Saksa for security which are being
implemented as the standard components
of this product and at the same time
there are these boxes in green which is
oracle unique functionality or the
secret source of oracle to make a Java
ME implementation more valuable for
embedded devices and what are these
unique features I talked about the
excess to peripherals or the abstraction
layer that we provide this is provided
through device success AP ice then there
are certain api's which enable finding
out a network and easy configuration in
case there are multiple networks or
multiple multiple access points
available in a certain area there are
additional api's for developers to be
able to better debug their applications
in the form of logging api's there is an
AMS which is an application management
system which enables taking control of
your applications remotely such as
starting stopping installing deploying
those applications remotely and then we
have some extension api's for device
jurors which enables them to integrate
their own API switch they might have
created for maybe to tailor to their
ecosystem or some additional value added
functionality that some device
manufacturers provide for their devices
so we have a framework in which the OEMs
can plug in their own api's so this
combination of the blue boxes the
functionality available as standard java
api is and the functionality available
in the form of oracle unique
functionality is what makes this stack
useful product for embedded devices
besides you should also take a note of
this sporting layer here as you can see
this is a very modular architecture
which enables us to create different
kinds of these runtime for different
targeted underlying OSS and hardware
architectures and again how it
translates for the developers is that
they don't have to worry about any
underlying hardware capabilities it's
all being taken care of in the product
without any changes to the upper stack
but essentially only only in the
sporting layer which is customized for a
specific type of device or the platform
and on the right side here you see a
stack for tools and additional services
which complement the Java ME embedded
application environment and makes me
call it a more complete platform rather
than just a runtime with that let me
talk about the various boxes that you
saw on the previous slide at a very high
level as what functionality is available
for developers or what are the kind of
api's which are available for creating
value added applications on top so we
have api's again these are all standard
API is on this slide I'm talking about
standard GS RS which would be available
in a Java ME implementation so we have
API is for jsr 75 which is for file i/o
we have capability for enabling wireless
messaging so
as an example if you have a sensor which
is being used as a tele health sensor
and in addition to capturing patient
information if you are also looking at
using that device for sending alerts or
notifications sending some messages then
these kinds of api's come and play there
where as soon as the remote dr. senses
some anomaly and wants to warn the
patient there is a way to trigger a
message on the device itself because
that device has been enabled by Java ME
and these api's are available to capture
that kind of a notification or a message
from the remote service provider then we
have api is for enabling web services
and security services in the form of jsr
172 and 177 a specification
implementation and also api is for
enabling location functionality and also
enhanced XML processing I can talk about
additional value added services that can
make a sensor more useful other than
just being used in a specific location
or be used only for a particular use
case that it might be used for in the
absence of these kinds of api's as an
example I would take the same example
that I cited earlier you have a sensor
which is say used for used in a device
which is taking the blood pressure of a
patient and the doctor in addition to
finding out those statistics is also
interested in finding out if there is an
anomaly what are those environmental
conditions which trigger that anomaly or
which triggers the increase in the blood
pressure of the patient and at that time
information about the location of that
device becomes very essential so if you
have a way of enabling an application to
capture location information or write
some application to take some action
based on the location of the device
that's where these api scum in the play
then in addition to those standard api's
we have a bunch of different Oracle
unique functionality that I talked about
on the Oracle Java ME embedded stack
that we saw and I would touch upon a few
of these just to highlight although all
of these are important for the kind of
functionality that's expected of the
embedded devices but specifically let me
pick on a few just to highlight why it's
important for small devices and one of
these would be the AMS lifecycle
notifications or application auto start
or restart for embedded devices once
they are out in the field it becomes
very important to be able to remotely
update them or have a way to monitor
them 24 by 7 and this is not just
particularly true for the device itself
but also these services which run on
them and these kinds of AMS api's enable
remote monitoring and remote update
ability of services on those devices
then one of the other categories that I
would pick here is this is now in a
different dimension that I am trying to
highlight that is important for
developers which is memory monitoring
and network monitoring functionality and
this is particularly important for
developers during the process of
development where they would want to
identify how their application is
hogging the memory or is using the
resources available in the network so
the detailed information that we provide
through these through this functionality
is what makes it useful for developers
to use or develop applications targeted
for this environment so I would leave
this information with you as what are
the additional embedded specific
features which make this product more
useful for an embedded application
development environment but I would
switch gears and come back to what we
talked about earlier about the
application development for a
microcontroller based environment and
here I would want to contrast it with
the traditional or two
be fair the most commonly used method
that's used today which is embedded
development in C and C++ so if you look
at it it's not that I am trying to
highlight the superiority of Java ME
embedded by saying that it's superior on
all of these fronts whether it's the
cross-platform portability or the
security sandbox environment that Java
ME offers versus what's not available
through C or C++ but you have to keep in
mind the reason behind having this kind
of a superior behavior from Java which
is the virtual environment that is
enabled by the JVM it's essentially this
virtual environment which offers that
security sandbox which can prevent any
kind of malicious code from directly
running into the hardware which is what
C or C++ can allow and at the same time
it's this virtualized environment which
enables portability across one platform
to another platform or from one device
to another device so the fundamental
reason behind this superior behavior is
really the Java VM and the multitasking
or multithreading capability that's
highlighted here which we say for a C
C++ kind of an environment its platform
specific because for the native code you
expect that functionality to be provided
by the underlying OS versus in case of a
vm this inherently comes as a part of
the VM and we allow the user or the
device manufacturer to switch from one
mode to another based on the actual
requirement or the use case for that for
which that device is being used and as
far as performance is concerned you
might have heard that one of the key
advantages of using a native embedded
environment over java would be the
performance that C C++ applications can
offer and I would contend that by saying
if it's an ace programmer yes you can
get better performance
but if it's an average programmer then
it's very likely that you might not get
as much of a performance as you would be
able to buy directly working with the
hardware or instead work with Java in
which case you might get compatible
performance plus the other additional
capabilities such as the security the
multitasking capabilities or the
portability that come along with a Java
environment so what I'm trying to say
here is the only real advantage of using
the traditional application development
model could be just the performance and
that also is vary depending on the
capabilities of the programmer or the
way that application or services being
implemented but at some point in time if
that is okay to be compromised then the
other functionality that you get as the
superiority of Java takes over and makes
this a more complete environment not in
terms of the application or services
usefulness but also the tools and the
resources available through the
developer community and look at it also
from the point of view of what an
application would have to do once that
leaves the development environment and
once it is deployed in the actual
production environment if some change
has to be made in a traditional
environment there is a lot of back and
forth where the changes have to be made
the application will have to be
recompiled and redeployment and it can
make the overall experience much more
cumbersome than cumbersome than having a
unified experience that a java
application can offer from one platform
to another so those are the value adds
the important features that I would
highlight here as the takeaways for why
Java aiming is important for
microcontroller based devices or small
devices and how this has the potential
of changing the landscape which
microcontrollers are enabling in the
broader Internet of Things and
reemphasize on the question that I
raised earlier as you are thinking
through these things even when you leave
the room
think about the additional value added
applications that java on
microcontrollers can enable through this
functionality that you learned about
which is available as a part of this
environment and what microcontrollers as
hardware's are capable of providing and
with that I would open up to any
questions that you might have plus
please I'm sorry we do have that
compiler and as I was mentioning for
other features if the device
manufacturer wants to turn it off then
that's also a possibility that the
configurability that we provide in the
vm and you got a big yes from or leg
he's our VM lead here and any specifics
about vm or anything that we have to
talk about how this VM is superior to a
traditional environment he can talk at
Great Lengths
don't
if you want to say footprint for example
it is easy for you you I would better
use ahead of time compiler because you
don't need to have a compiler own device
a compiler code memory for compilation
and if you use a dynamic compiler and
its original compiler has no connection
with the code spot at all and never had
actually it's still dizzy compiler but
if you can play a performance of a big
hot spot and this compiler on pretty
powerful device is this compiler
generates cause it took two times slower
than big full-blown hot spot and if you
look at slower devices because what code
even slower than us because we are can
be optimized for different conditions
it's it's a completely different dynamic
company has no connection because it is
it has connections with it's actually
show the c compiler yes but if you
compare performance with big big hot
spot on device one both can run this
smaller compiler performance is just two
times slower the full-blown hot spot and
if you look at slower devices low-end
devices we are faster hot spot because
we are optimized for those slow advice
ok
they were differently they're going
there were certain improvements but I
wouldn't say it's a radically different
it's same a single pass compiler no I
are used and it's pretty responsive we
compile essentially on second invocation
of a method not about tens of thousands
like big hot spot changes we did
announce sure and we did announce a dc-8
earlier today and early access version
of an implantation for cldc it is now
available and this is as you can even
see from the version numbers a big jump
from one dot 128 and the key
functionality or the additional new
features are alignment in terms of
language api and improved performance
from what you have today and alignment
with the new API is that will be
available as a zillion m8 so to your
question yes yeah yes that's what I'm
clear yeah that's also i'm trying to get
that so if you're looking for an already
released version and trying to compare
it with five years from or five or four
years from today maybe you would not see
a major dramatic difference but with the
early access release that we have today
you would see changes that you might be
expecting
yes in the form of an implementation of
any eight so when you go to Oracle
technology Network website you will find
the information yes
so we have an implementation for cortex
m3 m4 we have an implementation for QSC
which is Qualcomm's 60 to 70 chipset
witches and arm9 based processor we very
soon we'll have the implementation for
kinetis 70 we talked about freescale's
conatus 70k 70 processor and we have a
demo on Java ME running on k70 in the
demo grounds if you go on the smartphone
smart home booth you would see that demo
so it's a way of telling you that we are
also working on this additional
implementation which will get it so sum
total we have implementation for cortex
m3 m4 9 in the form of QSC 60 to 70
which is actually a modem we have an
implementation for Raspberry Pi which is
an arm 11 based processor and we will
have an implementation for k70 also
shortly yes we are looking at exploiting
the additional power functionality the
superiority of k70 in the java runtime
which will be available for that
platform we're talking a lot about
Cassie
first demonstration platform network
nine pitch of the hardware abstraction
freescale is trying to drive operating
system instruction instead of the work
freescale's collaborating not only with
oracle but frisk is also collaborated
with arm to drive some standards there
and we expected the standards that we
provide there will scale across kinetis
and allow the java venue platform to
scale across them as well so not only do
one the single point solution but also
to be able to manage of that scalability
on the high end of kinetics processors
you truly get a ringing to process or to
not just a single point right just to
add to it yeah I'll come back to you but
just to add to it I have been saying k70
because that's the implementation that
will have available shortly but going
forward we are looking at making one
single binary available for the whole
family of a certain type of chipsets
rather than saying that we support a
particular chipset which is so and so
based on so-and-so ARM architecture but
instead if we say that we are able to
support this arm architecture then all
the chipsets in that family in that
range of product line are being
supported by the same binary so you will
see all of those developments not in a
matter of years but in a matter of
months
just in case one director JDM can sleep
if no threads I active and can deeply
sleep if there are no events if it
doesn't just wait for any events in near
future it's it will save power so not
necessarily Java ME but if you again I'm
referring to this smart home boot in the
demo grounds if you go and take a look
at look there we already have an
implementation and an osgi stack sitting
on top of Java embedded suite which is
the we just say an umbrella product
which encapsulate java SE a web
container and a database and the reason
i'm highlighting that verse is saying
that will have an osgi stack
implementation as a part of this runtime
is because if you're talking about osgi
based implementations their usefulness
is for the kind of devices for which
java SE is more suitable than Java ME
yes our demonstration today
stop racism complimentary today we just
have the port running on top of mqx but
it is possible for us to run and pair
metal as well you had a question back
there
any other questions any parting just
again
standards are we driving together here
and also to visit the demo and a lot of
information that i provided about our
binary those being planned their early
access versions Oracle technology
Network website otn and thanks for
spending time here with us and listening
to what we believe is going to
revolutionize the way going forward
