call me gpaw people call me g pas the G
is short for grandpa I have nine
grandchildren and the sad truth of the
matter is that one of their fathers and
I were drinking one night and we went to
a website that gave up your pimp named
and so he started calling me big daddy
gpaw and all the grandkids grew up
calling me that and now most people call
me that but you can also call me Hill or
Michael I have been an independent
professional geek since I was 18 years
old I have been extraordinarily lucky
white American male computer geek born
in nineteen sixty life is good you know
I've been coaching software teams for
about 15 years now maybe maybe more like
17 I was a very early adopter of extreme
programming back in those days there
were giants hung out at a place called
see to calm also known as the Portland
pattern repository some of you have
probably already even maybe check that
out once or twice in your lives it still
runs today it is the very first wiki
ever in the world it was written and
shipped by my friend Ward Cunningham and
back then all these patterns guys hung
out together and they were all at this
site and extreme programming kind of
came alarm bling out of that as a
response to the sort of
overly regulated command and control
uselessness that was our best attempts
at that time to actually ship software
on time and under budget and it didn't
work course and so extreme programming
grew up around that and extreme
programming eventually kind of became
what is now called agile I'll tell you
that though that I don't actually call
myself an agile coach anymore the reason
is because what I do now is coach
software development teams okay and
agile module right the teams that I work
with our teams that are not having fun
and they're not shipping code and
they're not making their companies happy
and what I do to help them is whatever
needs to be done and sometimes that
means adopting different pieces of the
agile Oh thing and all the times it
means you know basic kindergarten work
well did you tell her you weren't going
to ship it today right I'm sure
everybody in this room has done any sort
of leadership in a software development
team has had these experiences you know
here take a mint
so um but it is still important for us
to talk about where where we come from
and this is where I come from I call
these the three blobby things i call
them blobbies because i don't like um
well suspect all systems suspect all
systems you know what some of the stuff
that I'm going to talk about is going to
sound kind of systemic today resist that
temptation because systems are crap if
there were systems that could write
software not only would none of you have
jobs but none of the other tens of
thousands of people at this conference
and in this city and its surrounds would
have jobs either because believe me they
would prefer it strongly if software was
not a human enterprise okay so suspect
all systems what I coach is excellence
in software development and I don't know
for sure I don't know everything that is
required to ship software on time and
under budget but i do know three things
that are definitely required if any of
these three things are missing we won't
get there and that's kind of where i
come from all the time the first of
these is business value if we don't have
any business value if there isn't
somebody who wants what your team is
doing then we are nothing and you can be
as agile as you like but somebody's
gotta want it it answers the question
for us of where we going you know what
are we going to do that's business value
the second one is geek joy geek joy
the first program I ever wrote was a
banner program that i typed in in basic
on a Commodore 64 in I typed it in out
of compute magazine and you know they
hundred programming times have changed i
realized so you had a printer right and
it would print out whatever you put in
great big gigantic letters right Mike it
would say when you type then Mike and I
loved that program I love that program
so much I spent months months investing
in it because it was so glorious it was
just glorious you know I taught it how
to do italics and then I made it so that
the end was all made out of little M's
and I got color it was so cool and like
I say I'm an extraordinarily lucky
individual because most people never
find that kind of joy now here's a funny
thing I don't know what your teams are
like but I know you've seen this
experience you look around a room full
of geeks and they look miserable they
look bored and tired and grim geek joy
you got to have it nobody functions at
high functioning levels when they are
horrible when they feel bad when they
don't want to come to work so how do we
get that back well we have the great
advantage that we don't have to do
motivation right computer geeks motivate
themselves you don't have to motivate
them you have to get out of their way a
team i am not working with right now but
I walk by every day as motivational
things but not like you know not like
those bought ones but ones that have
been hand printed and put up on the
walls in various locations and every
time I walk by I just chuckle it's like
the one let's see the one we noticed the
other day said
when everybody cares great things happen
and I thought to myself yes the Great
War also known as World War one
certainly everybody cared about that and
it was great but you don't have to worry
about this with geeks right because
really what you have to do is keep from
demotivating them they come in excited
because everybody who does this job they
either love it or they're only good for
a couple months it really is true do you
know that there's a 35,000 programmer
shortfall in America every year and that
there has been for the last 20 years
that's why there's so much money that
chases us around okay and so what
happens is kids this am let me get some
of that green and they go to college and
they take their first computer
programming course right and they're
like a fate worse than death okay they
would never do this it's it's horrifying
to them and the ones that are left right
the ones who are like hey oh cool that's
geek joy and that's what I'm looking for
all the time
the third one is courageous curiosity
listen all of the software development
is about it some sort of journey if you
will I know it sounds kind of vague and
Zen like but but you know we get on this
road and we're traveling down this road
and we know where we're going because
the business value and we know how we're
going to rock it because of geek joy but
the only way you can know where we are
right now is if people have the nerve to
ask unfortunate questions right if they
have the confidence to say you know do
we really need to do X or Y or Z to our
customers actually care I'm working at a
very large corporation of america right
now one of the things about coaching is
you don't usually get to if you're an
external coach like me who goes from
company to company you don't usually get
to claim your companies but oh this is a
well motivated team and they're pretty
excited and they're working really hard
they're behind schedule because
everybody in computer software is behind
schedule and they they work really hard
and where was I going with that oh so
the other day huge crisis huge crisis
they're printing charts right pronounce
reports crisis the letters over the
column headings instead of going
sideways and running down like this they
have to be printed like this in these
little narrow one column header headers
right and the developers are freaking
out because it's right there in the
requirement right they've got the sample
report they know what it's supposed to
look like and there is no way in hell
that this ludicrous framework that got
sold is capable of turning the letters
90 degrees before printing them okay
so I'm watching this and the business
owner comes walking through and my
colleague my fellow coach nan he says
say look do you care about cool weather
the letters you know go in that
direction and he looks at us like we're
insane like we're just crazy why would
we ever ever care about that the people
who see these reports work with these
reports every single day they know what
the headings are anyway right because
they know they know the codes that are
going into those by heart that's what
you do when you use a report every
single day to decide what you're going
to do they could not care less they
would probably be okay with no headings
at all this is what the guys say and my
team was just like okay you know and i'm
like okay next challenge right and the
only reason this happened seriously the
only reason this win happened is because
nan had courageous curiosity he didn't
just let a document tell him what he was
supposed to do he went and he asked a
decision-maker to make a decision and
the geeks were amazed they were amazed
they think they worship man which is
cool with me because he's very good at
what he does so oh we talked about this
tangling me up in the cable thing um so
this is where I come from the three
values of cool I want to go backwards
for a second suspect all systems
now the rest of this talk is divided
into three parts in the first part I
want to talk about the essential fact of
being a software development coach if we
don't get this fact right nothing else
is going to matter in the second section
I just want to go over some basics
because you know when you've been doing
thanks for a long time you can sometimes
i'm sure you have this in your own
practice today you can sometimes take
for granted things that people don't
know are the basics right you were
sitting next to a developer and you're
watching them work and you say well you
know why don't you save here and the
developers like oh my god i never
thought of that that's the basics and
we'll talk about that a little bit in
the third part is the most system apart
and it's the part I most suspect myself
what it is is what I call five pillars
five fountains five pools five also
blobby things that I use hamal use it
for two things 1i use it to evaluate new
coaching ideas and then the second one
is I go in reverse I look at a problem
and I use the pillars to pull out ideas
that might help the team dealing with
that problem so that's what we're going
to do and I'll tell you the truth I'm
not really feeling all that luxury today
so I'm perfectly willing at any point to
stop and talk okay so we might be doing
some of that all right the essential
fact of coaching is this people don't do
what you want them to do because what
you want them to do is right okay no
shocked gasps so I'm thinking maybe
we're on the same page but let me
elaborate a little bit on that what I
mean to say is that the rightness of
whatever it is you're advising them to
do is not the most important part of
whether or not they do it
now it's a funny thing because you'd
think something like that might be
pretty basic and fundamental but it's
not I know a lot of coaches especially
people who are just getting started in
the trade and you know we come out of
this excitement usually some passion
about a new technique or a new way of
doing things and it and it works and
it's brilliant and you can't wait to
share it with somebody else and then you
share it with them and they look at you
like your problem and and they're doing
that they're doing that and you get
upset because after all you're right
after all committing your codes several
times a day does actually work
significantly better than committing it
once every two weeks right I'm going to
trust you guys know what I mean when I
talk about continuous integration right
so you know when I say why don't we try
committing several times a day I'm not
just making this up I tried this I've
seen it done in a lot of organizations
and I know that it works better and
here's the thing that doesn't matter
because that's not why they do what you
want them to do first of all I think it
should be said they don't always do what
you want them to do anyway right one of
the effects of the coaching life is that
it has a lot of losses right the the
folks who teach sales seminars one of
the things I focus on more than anything
else is this that you got a smile and
you got to ask the next person you got
to you got to because mostly you don't
close a deal and mostly in coaching you
don't get what you want and you just
keep moving and keep working with it so
let's talk about what this thing means
this essential fact there's bad news and
there's good news it's way more
complicated than being right being right
isn't that hard there's a great deal of
information that we have over the last
roughly 30 40 years about what makes
software development work and what
doesn't primarily through the form of a
whole bunch of incredibly bad
movements and experiments that didn't
work in any way shape or form right
that's where all that data comes from
and there's a lot of it but coaching
people is a lot harder than just being
right about knowing what they should do
the other bad news is I'm going to
assume that you guys are relatively
smart and it's unfortunate because being
smart is not enough to do this job right
it's just not enough to do it you can be
brilliant I've known people who were
boning I don't claim that myself mama
didn't raise no thinkers over here but
being smart is not enough there's more
bad news you have to give up what for
many people is one of their favorite
things arguing right you have to learn a
different way of working because argue
me doesn't work anyway it doesn't work
very well you might win some everybody
wins some the worst bad news is that it
sounds like I'm telling you that this is
a great excuse to become a manipulative
dick I'm not telling you that I swear I
swear I I don't do anything in my
coaching practice that I wouldn't do
with my children my family my friends
everybody around me all right I I don't
lie to people I don't always tell them
everything I think either right and
that's important that's important being
honest means thinking believing
everything that you say it doesn't mean
saying everything that you believe okay
so so that's the bad news the good news
is this you don't have to be right and
you get to get rid of this idea that the
resistance that you encounter in your
daily lives is coming from the fact that
the people are stupid or evil
I've been in situations where I thought
it was both okay and you can let go with
that right because it doesn't have to do
with rightness and this gets you the
situation where your patience is far
more broadly rooted right because you're
like well it's cool they're just people
they're all trapped inside themselves
just like every one of us has trapped
inside ourselves I used to say a thing
after i did something particularly
stupid i used to say you know it seemed
like the right thing to do at the time
at the right how many times in my life
have I said that that's what almost
every one of the people you work with is
saying all the time so you get to extend
your patience which is awesome and since
I know most of you came from the geek
trades originally some of you are still
in deep in geekery you get to try new
things and trying new things is really
cool at least for me that's what keeps
me afloat so um a natural question that
comes up when you say this is will if
they don't do things because because
what you told them to do is the right
thing to do why do they do the things
well first of all reminder maybe they
don't do what you want them to do most
of the time so you know but when they do
do what you want them to do the number
of reasons is vast beyond counting this
is just a partial list and I'm not that
big of a slide reader so I'm sure you
guys can figure out what I mean to say
is that all the reasons that all the
reasons that you came to this conference
are just like all the reasons that that
guy wrote a 400 line long method I'm
sure it seemed like the right thing to
do at the time
and maybe maybe it's a bad day maybe how
to fight with your spouse maybe you
stayed up too late playing a stupid game
now that that's ever happened to me like
last night in particular okay maybe it's
because they ordered you to on the main
coaches list there's an argument going
on right now about a fellow who is
claiming that that agile adoptions that
are imposed are evil well you know what
there is no sizable organization on
earth that does not give orders so
sometimes you know what people do what
you want them to do because somebody
else ordered them to now I don't give
orders myself that's not how my game
works but my point is even some reasons
we often take us crummy reasons for
doing things are some of the reasons
that we do things in fact even rightness
every now and again my dad used to say
even a Blind Pig finds an acre and once
in a while right sometimes they just say
huh that makes sense we'll do it that
way whenever that happens I'm always
astonished oh my god that's
inconceivable to me that I would get a
team to do something just because you
know it makes sense okay so that's the
essential fact and I'll tell you what
right now we could stop right here the
rest of this talk doesn't matter to me
nearly as much as this I want to make
sure everybody in this room gets this
you gotta let go of rightness you will
not succeed if you were obsessed with
the fact that your idea is right does
anyone have any comments or questions or
controversy to raise at this point you
totally welcome to really I know it's a
really big room I'll repeat any
questions or comments or controversies
so everybody can hear it yeah well I
don't always right sometimes they do but
um a lot of that is going to come from
the practice oh I said I was going to
repeat the question sorry he said gosh
Mike you seem like a really brilliant
and warm wonderful human being oh good I
don't know why I feel like stand-up
today but I really do just doing a
little stand up he asked me um how do
you get them how do you encourage them
to find the good reasons themselves to
find their own path of thinking about
what they're going to do and my answer
was to say first of all I don't always
one of the things we'll talk about later
is about how teaching is not necessarily
the best thing to do because you know
what then I'm paying you to teach them
they're not paying you to understand
what you know this is not information
transfer it's really not what you're
trying to do is get them to change their
behavior so I don't always encourage
them on the other hand I do have my warm
days and one of the things I spend most
of the time doing and we'll see this
it's one of the pillars would talk about
is modeling I asked those questions
myself I talked to them about my
colossal failures and you know in 35
years kids I've I've had some beautiful
failures perhaps later if there's time
at the bar I will tell you some of the
times that I failed to ship on time and
under budget and why and what you will
strike you about them is two things one
how incredibly stupid the reasons were
for why it didn't work like any fool
could have seen it wasn't going to work
except I didn't and the team that I was
working with and their managers they
didn't all see it wasn't going to work
but anybody else now would certainly I
would certainly see that and the second
thing that you'll see is that you've
seen it all before you've seen it all
done before so there was someone else
here who had something to say maybe live
for today be free
I mean like I rationally know this but I
still
right so the question is is well it's a
it's a very thick question so um yeah
part of it is about you know I struggle
myself to remember this essential fact
and I've been doing this for a while
some of you are probably struggling with
it right now the developers one of the
things I talk about later is um about
how the helping developers to understand
that engineering value is not the name
of the game I call it the money
principle in fact since I come from a
place where I'm often working with teams
who are very unfriendly to change one of
the first things I tell them about is
that this is not about art or craft or
engineering this is about money this is
about making them more money this is
about making their companies more money
it's not about quality it's about money
want to talk like that they look at me
and they're like huh I never thought of
it that way we have to do this right
there's some part of the engineering
mindset that is that it's heavily vested
in one hundred percent solutions and you
want that last you know you got your 97
right and you want those last three
percentage points of solutions so badly
you can wreck your whole project
questing after a solution that does not
exist because the solution is not
computable
so he had a project manager who said to
him he doesn't want an a he wants a C+
money money is the name of this game and
you know the Masters of the c plus is a
company that its name begins with n and
ends in T and they are stunningly good
at it they are incredibly good at
finding that exact right marketing point
where you will not pay another dollar to
fix that awful thing that annoys you
right look let's be honest Microsoft
Word works mostly for most of its
intended purposes and it's cheap cheap
ish ok that is c plus and these are the
sorts of things I tell my clients I said
guys guys guys guys look a lot of people
coming from the agile perspective from
the outside they read this stuff and
I'll be honest there are some people who
I feel have misled the industry about
what we're up to in this game and they
talk a lot about quality and they talk a
lot about craftsmanship now i'm a pretty
good programmer and i love to have it
perfect i do i believe in quality i
believe in craftsmanship but i believe
in money they do not pay these teams to
be perfect they would not pay for that
the only people who have ever in the
history of computers ever tried to pay
anybody to be perfect was NASA and you
know what they did they gave up it's
called derivation you should look it up
sometime it's the process of starting
from a known good
program a program from which you have
perfect confidence that you have solved
the halting problem you know with
certainty that this one works and then
step by step extending it in a perfectly
safe way so that you could never ever
have anything go wrong and guess what
it's too expensive for NASA nobody will
pay for that I spent a lot of time
talking to my team's about that I'm
sorry I went off on off for a while um
okay oh yeah sure the good enough yeah
yep how to help them understand good
enough what that really comes down to is
about on a deep level of communication
and I'm I mean communication not email
right a deep level of communication
between the people who are running the
business and the people who are making
the product and to me you know that's
right up that's agile zali that's one of
our strongest points is the extent to
which we expect actual humans to
actually converse with each other on an
actually daily basis about the actual
decisions that have to be made that day
okay oh I move a little bit let's review
some basics
what's the most important basic of
course always catch them doing something
right yeah this is this managerial
principle is ancient my grandma was she
saying she said don't you touch that
again and she said cut me a switch but
she also said she also said you catch
more flies with honey than with vinegar
and I've never understood that because I
never actually wanted to catch flies but
something right is the most basic thing
of all when you find something somebody
doing something that pleases you let
them know now I don't mean to over
reward them I think it's a really bad
idea to come into work every day with
the stupid looking grin on your face
pretending that life is just one joyful
experience after another and I don't
think you should reward people for you
know not wetting their pants I mean
there's a class of people I think we
should reward for that but but otherwise
it's kind of taken for granted but you
know what even in that context a nod a
smile so you don't even have to say
anything you just have to go I try to
find somebody to say something good
about their work every day sometimes
it's hard i'm not kidding sometimes it's
hard because of course you know i have
my days to you have to really like
people i hope you all like people it's
weird you know they talk about geeks
being on social and not socially skilled
and little wheat and said this about
nerds and i don't like that word i don't
know why it seems vaguely french to me
and I just I don't talk I don't trust it
I call em geeks but are there any French
people in the audience
okay sorry um you know being a geek
isn't about what you love it's about how
you love it right and when you put two
geeks together they just chatter never
seen that have you ever noticed that
room full of people never say a word to
a stranger never look each other in the
eye and we'll talk about version 1.7
point three and how they made that
ludicrous decision to take to change
doctor who's right in the middle of that
plot element right or whatever it is
that's who we are I know it sounds
sometimes like I'm talking about geeks
like they're not me but it's a label
that I'm very proud to wear anyway you
have to like people and you have to like
them even when they don't do what you
want them to do and I say except the
whole person my friend Steve um
Doubleday taught me this one of my first
long term coaching jobs he said you know
what this basically comes down to two
rules don't waste time except the whole
person now notice that he doesn't say
except everybody and I think that's
important right but if you're going to
play if you're going to play with this
person and say we're going to do this
you've got to take them you have to take
them as they are so that's liking people
take deep breaths right patience
patience patience person-by-person step
by step technique by technique long term
Warren's a real short term winds are
illusory you just
it's just part of the job my friend
angela is a great coach she's a I'm
gonna call her a young coach which will
probably catch me a lot of when she
sees this talk but she's only been doing
it for a few years and you know she's so
hard on herself and she's so hard on her
team because she wants them to do so
much change in such a short amount of
time and I say you know your you'll get
past that or you'll leave this business
because it just doesn't happen that way
I have had gigs of three and six months
where I was happy to walk away from that
gig with too excited people left behind
I have another friend in the coaching
business who said to me once that that
sometimes the win is that you got to
enough people that they left the company
patients is extremely important I am I
want to I want to call out this will be
the one one of two times I'll
specifically call out my wife for having
taught me this over a long period of
time about children right I was raised
with spankings cut me a switch would
that's literal um and I was a spanker
because I thought you know what if you
don't spank those kids they will just be
out of control and they will make you
insane and they will drive you nuts and
something much much worse will happen
she was the one who taught me that you
know what it doesn't matter whether you
spank them or not they will be out of
control and they will drive you crazy
because their kids and that's what they
do that's what they're supposed to be
doing so Virginia really showed me a
long time ago about patience home in a
very practical and daily soar away and
that helped me enormously more basics
pro fluences a word some of you will not
recognize and that's cool because I love
inventing new words for people but pro
fluence is something that comes from the
discussion on discussions around writing
and around narratology the study of
narratives and pro fluence is literally
forward flowing and what it means is the
sense you have that something is
happening when you read a book and
nothing happens you put the book down or
a movie or any work of art the sense
that things are happening is critical
we're part of something we're getting
somewhere if you can get your team to
believe those two things you've you've
done an enormous amount of work okay
this is a very I don't know what this
middle thing about using stand-ups well
is doing on this slide it's I guess it's
one of my things right I go to team's
all-time who had been coached by noobs
or who have learned all of they know
about after
methodologies from the internet and they
do these stand-ups first of all the
first thing they do is they don't stand
up right they do there's nothing to lean
on they do this some of them even sit
and and and they answer the three
questions what did you do yesterday what
are you going to do today are there any
blocks lose the three questions people
lose it lose it I tell my people I don't
care what you did yesterday right what
have you done for me today and and
secondly um what we're really about in a
stand-up is news we want news I had a
baby girl last night okay that's news
you can tell me that it's stand up and
I'll be pretty happy I worked on this
story for the fourth consecutive day
that's not news that's your job I tell
people don't ever solve any problem that
can't be solved in one sentence during
stand up you got one sentence to solve
somebody else's problem I wish I could
forbid commas right fast and furious and
bring whatever desire be fit now this is
real coaching advice whatever behavior
you desire bring it into the reports
that stand up I asked them it did
anybody rename anything today I know
that's a silly question right but in the
beginning teams are often terrified to
change their code right there terrified
and the idea of changing the name of a
function is just over the top do you
want encourage them to change the names
of their functions have them tell you
about it during stand up okay we can
lose the Restless mmm ask for help ask
for help every day every day ask them
for help not only do you show them that
asking is a safe thing to do you show
them that making mistakes is a safe
thing to
do fortunately I'm rather gifted in this
particular area my model making mistakes
really well also apologies my model
apologies really well so this is really
important basic stuff but I want to make
sure that everybody's kind of
comfortable with this because you know
you're going to room like this you don't
know how much time have you been how
many people here have been coaching for
more than a year okay coaching software
do yeah they right it's true coaching
software an agile methodology or any
methodology it's not that many people in
this room so I think it's worth it for
us to spend some time on these basics
let me tell you two major traps
moralizing sucks don't do it as tempted
as you are to say someone you're being a
bad person it doesn't help ever for more
than an hour so the moralizing trap is a
really big one don't talk about good
citizenship we're back to the money
principle and I already told you the
craftsmanship movement annoys me because
it puts all the pressure on me to be a
prideful proper craftsman instead of a
person working on a team develop them
developing a product in order to retire
and live off the stock options okay so
moralizing no rational actor theory and
this is kind of loosely connected to the
essential fact right a Spencerian
tragedy a spin said it was a a
spencerian tragedy is a beautiful
beautiful Theory slain by a cold ugly
little fat okay rational after theory is
beautiful it's exquisite and the ugly
little fact is that we're not rational
actors and to pretend that we're
rational actors is a really big mistake
how do I know that well as anybody
noticed what has happened to our economy
since 2008 believe me I know that
rational actor theory is not true it's
coming out of my mortgage okay um
plausibility is always more important
than logic always I want to introduce
you to a concept called bump and run I
hate sports metaphors but I can't resist
them sometimes in football you have
these large guys and they run and they
hit each other and what they're trying
to do what I'm trying to do is two
things on the one hand i'm trying to
keep the other guy from nailing my
quarterback before my quarterback and
throw the ball on the other hand in
order for my quarterback to throw the
ball i have to be down the field waiting
right if I wait for logic I'm in trouble
if I try to win an argument I'm in
trouble they call it bump and run you
try to give the person one good bump and
then you just keep on moving okay when
somebody says to me don't be ridiculous
if i write 50 lines of tests and 50
lines of code that's twice as much code
as i'm writing so we couldn't possibly
be a faster way of writing code
I've never done it but you know I always
wanted to do a monty python reference I
always wanted to say you've run rings
around me logically right but gotta go I
don't know if you know this reference
right a talk show in which the the talk
show host is continually frustrated by
presenting these amazing guests who then
don't cooperate so and now for something
completely different a man with three
buttocks and he interviews the guy the
guy says yes I have the three buttocks
he says okay well let's have a look I
think I said no no I'm not going to show
you my box and the rings around me
logically is a guy who claims to be the
actual living Robin Hood and he says now
John Robin you claim to be the actual
living Robin Hood but Robin Hood Robin
of Locksley was born in 1325 and this is
1975 and the guy says you're right your
front rings around me logically and he
says but you know you can't stop there
right you can't just say okay you're
right I quit so I've always wanted to
say to a team you've run rings around me
logically there's no way possible that
test driven development could possibly
be faster than writing bad code slowly
but I'm really kind of sullen and
resentful today aren't I like I say I
have my gaze so that's the basics come
on now anybody got any comments and
controversy or questions about the
basics so far well we're gonna have time
quick like a bunny these are the pillars
suspect all systems they are inviting
sorting modeling releasing situating
okay how do the pillars work well on the
one hand their inspiration when i get a
problem i look at the problem and i say
how can i do something that was inviting
sorting modeling situating louder what
was releasing how can i do something
that's like that and often enough of
course i can pull out of somewhere my an
idea that incorporates two or even three
of those pillars and when that happens I
know it's an idea I want to try same
thing works the other way around right
that's this one ask sources they also
make good predictors if you go out on
the web you'll see a lot of fantastic
ideas for things to do for coaching and
some of them work some of them don't how
do I evaluate which ones to try I go
down my little list of pillars and I
check them off and I say damn this guy's
got all the bases covered I'm going to
try it starting tomorrow morning so it
works both ways the pillars do let's
talk about what they actually mean
though releasing
you know I've been telling us about
Robin Williams since well before his
suicide but I'll tell you um in Mork and
Mindy Mork the alien you remember crunch
sure that both of you who are my age
remember um he arrives on earth in a
spacecraft that's an egg so in one of
the I think it might have even been the
very first shows he's there at Sandy an
open refrigerator and he's at the
counter and he's got a dozen eggs and he
goes like this he goes fly away and then
goes cook he's like fly away there's
black is how can I help you if you won't
help yourselves so I'm releasing is
giving teams freedom to move and it's
absolutely imperative there was a
terrific TED talk by daniel pink about
what motivates people and I don't
remember his three were his three things
because they're slightly different words
than i normally use but one of them is
autonomy freedom you want to convince
people to experiment with ideas you want
to stop all pro forma gestures except
stand up and why do I say that pro forma
literally means for the sake of form
okay you have to do it this way you want
to stop that you want people to do
things because they work not because
their rituals you inevitably i find
myself helping teams leave company rules
behind inevitably partly because the
rules are archaic that's probably the
most frequent reason the rules are just
plain archaic they belong to the
programming of the 70s let alone the 90s
okay um ask oh when you release the team
ask them what they want to do in fact if
you want them to do something ask them
will they do it without waiting for an
answer I mean don't give an answer tell
them don't answer
I'm laying this out for you right now I
want you to think about it for a couple
days and we'll make a decision and then
when we do make that decision the
decision is going to be a decision to
try always to try we're going to try
this will give it two weeks or six weeks
or whatever we're going to give it and
if it doesn't work we won't do it so
giving teams freedom to move is really
critical and the releasing pillar is the
one that works for me retrospectives are
critical to this process I still
encounter a surprising number of
retrospective processes where they
expect to record the retrospective so
that management can see it later yeah
that's a really good idea that's really
going to work real retrospectives are
private they are an in team behavior not
ever and out of team behavior and every
retrospective no matter how I arrange
the retrospective it's another one of
those things are and don't do good
things bad things and find something
interesting to argue about pick one
thing to change decide what you're going
to change about it one thing I found
it's really important is to prepare the
common ground in advance it may seem
like the most fair thing to do is to
confront an audience like this one for
the first time and say we'll all of you
agree to wear mismatched socks tomorrow
right it might seem like that's
honorable because I'm really letting you
just live in the moment but I would
never do that I don't wear any socks
today or I could show you that I almost
always wear mismatched socks it's
ridiculous I know but I saw a an
advertisement and it worked on me the
advertisement said life is too short to
sort your socks
and so what I did was I bought a bunch
of argyles in like 20 different colors
and I just picked two of them out and
put them on and go to work anyway um
prepare common ground in advance now
after I just told you that story can you
tell what the difference would be in
your reaction if I asked you to do it
now versus five minutes ago what if I
even gave you a couple days to do it
what if I worked in smaller groups just
you guys in this row you for let's try
you you'll be the pilot for the non
matching socks program you know there
are so many things you can do to work to
prepare common ground so that decisions
don't come out of the blue they come out
of a growing sense by the team this is
the right choice the releasing mantra I
don't know I don't know what do you
think that's the mantra say it every day
at least once I don't know when people
help you make a decision guess what they
enforce that decision it's critical to
let the team make mistakes guy just
realize I'm really running out of time
take your losses calmly you know
sometimes they're just not going to do
it and it's okay maybe they'll do it
later second mantra somebody give me a
hand I already mentioned that ask for
help every day you drive try saying that
now now you drive you don't have to
convince me that what you're doing is
right just take the wheel this huge
slide I'm going to compress to a single
sentence never take it back you must
never ever offer someone a choice and
then take the choice away from them
after you have offered it right so
if you're not confident that they're
going to do it and like it maybe now is
not the right time to give them that
choice okay never take it back when you
give people things and you take them
back that's called empowering well it is
that's why we never say that word
because management took that word and
turned it into a nightmare so sorting
eighty percent of your time on the most
important story same thing I teach my
team's eighty percent of your labor I
want on the one most important story you
can spend twenty percent your time on
less important stuff and none of your
time on unimportant stuff same thing
goes for a coach except that the stories
are different right it isn't all about
production stories which you
occasionally do it's also about the
technical stories get the builds that it
doesn't take 20 minutes teamwork stories
get those two to pair to learn how to
pair together and by the way don't ever
think the pairing is natural pairing as
a skill finish the combat board for
crying out loud um environment stories
never ever ask people to start pairing
when they don't have a suitable place to
pair a laptop at a foot and a half wide
table that is five feet wide is not ever
a suitable place to pair never ask them
to do that that's an environment story
and as a coach you're responsible for
all of those stories is that five or ten
better book like
last piece of advice about sorting is
get them involved I put my sort I put my
coaching stories up on the wall right
next to theirs in a separate little swim
lane and I get them to help them sort
help me sort them it's modeling and it's
inviting and it's releasing its all of
those things it's good stuff inviting
means the two primary tasks you throw an
awesome party the best party you could
possibly throw without alcohol or sex
okay and then you find a terrific place
for everybody on the team everybody even
the ones who suck even the ones who are
so anti-social we all hate to pair with
them find a place for everybody so those
are the two tasks sad teams have lots of
exclusion on them almost always some
happy teams have exclusion at the
current team that I'm working with the
big win recently has been an up-to-date
Kanban board and the reason is because
for the first time business comes to the
stand-ups and we talk about actual
problems and we saw them together but up
until that time business was excluded
believe it or not business was excluded
by organizational design but we'll put
that aside for another day you have to
invite people to a great party and you
have to find a place for everybody to
relax and enjoy themselves at that party
it's back to get joy again silliness is
really important and I really strongly
recommend it at stand-ups we do a fact
of the day and what happens is i started
off usually for the first week I give
all the facts of the day then at the end
of the first week I say here's what
we're going to do every day somebody has
to give the fact the day and I'm tired
of giving it so every day someone will
pick will give the fact of the day and
and um chew
who's the next victim for tomorrow I
have learned the most amazing things
that the fact of the day do you know
that UPS saves 30 million dollars a year
by not taking left turns when they set
up their default routing in the computer
the computer algorithm forbids all left
turns that it can possibly forbid now of
course the right the drivers then adjust
things it's not a computationally salt
problem but they save 30 million dollars
now that's an amazing fact of the day
feel free to use it use quotations
especially the non motivational ones
there's a great big wall at my current
team and has a big quotation from Rob
who's the head of the business who says
you can count them one by one said even
mean yes as a matter of fact you can you
can count almost anything one by one and
categories again at my current team the
current category and we keep a crowded
or up for about two weeks is great songs
about jail and I think when I left the
day before yesterday I think there were
seven great songs about jail you can
invent categories my favorite category
of all time three hit wonders
bands are individuals who only ever did
three big songs don mclean right
American Pie Vincent also known as
starry starry night and what yep three
hits that's it he survived on that for
30 years um Emma Goldman said if I can't
dance I don't want to be a part of your
revolution and that's important remember
that modeling is the most important
pillar modeling this is a Giselle
Bundchen and she's a supermodel there
was a black-and-white poorly formatted
Polaroid of her naked that was auctioned
at South bees for 150 thousand dollars
this is a different thing this is a
super model he said be the change you
wish to see and that's critical I hope
you've noticed that among other things I
enjoy myself and I enjoy myself at work
too in fact one of the things I had to
do two years ago I said I'm not going to
work five days a week anymore I'm going
to work for and it made all the
difference it really did because you
know what I'm usually in a pretty good
mood when I come to work on being the
change I want to see I want to see us be
happy to be at work this is the central
pillar everything else suspends from it
you not only show technique when you
model you show how well it works there's
obvious modeling here's some less
obvious modeling make lots of mistakes
try things without knowing whether
they're going to work work across
multiple teams successfully a prize
business of good news and bad news the
very minute that you know it above all
laughter wrangling arguing disagreeing
talking about things asking hard
questions get joy
almost done almost situating as the last
of the pillars I could have said
teaching but we spent too much time
teaching in this business I'm going to
refer you to a book called tennis the
inner game and in it he talks about his
technique both for um well he talked
about its technique for teaching tennis
and one of the things he does is on the
very first day he takes him out there
and he hits balls at them and he says I
want you to hold up hold the racket just
like this and just keep hitting just
keep hitting it and pretty soon you know
what's going to happen you're going to
hit a good one and you're going to know
how it feels when you hit a good one
it's brilliant that's not teaching
that's situating them that's putting
them in their bodies with the ball
coming away from their rackets in a way
that feels good so that's situating
pillar there we are tada these are the
three blobby things but suspect all
systems of all kinds if you don't have
business value you don't know you don't
know what you're going to do you just
don't even know if you don't have geek
joy you're not going to be working at
full production capability you're just
not and if you don't have courage is
curious that curiosity you'll never be
able to find out where the hell we are
those are the three things please
suspect all systems and thank you very
much that was a lot of fun i really
enjoyed myself
thanks folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
