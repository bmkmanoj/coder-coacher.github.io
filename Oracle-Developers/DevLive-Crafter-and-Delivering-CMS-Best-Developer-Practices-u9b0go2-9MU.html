technology Network and I'm here with one
of our sponsors at Oracle code here in
New York City called Craster software
and I'm speaking with Alex from crafter
how you doing Alex and do a little Laura
thanks Rodney it's good to have you
again because I know that we've done
this this interview a couple of times
you have so many cool gadgets that you
guys have developed and you're showing
off so let's talk about crafter first
who is crafter so crafter software we're
an open source java based web CMS
essentially what that means is we like
to give you the tools to create digital
experiences across any channel so that
can be you know website a mobile
application we like to say we do from
everything from a to VR which is
something we're showcasing today oh
that's kind of cool you know we did see
the virtual reality it's over at in the
north
noisy side of the hall and I'm hoping to
get some still video of that as well but
why don't you show us a couple of the
other cool things that you've got here
yeah absolutely so I'm a big believer
that people like to play with toys no
matter what age they are so what I did
is we were organizing the events both at
JavaOne Oracle code in San Francisco now
we always like to bring something
interactive for people to you know play
with yeah and with crafter our CMS is so
open and so easy to use that you can
actually use it to pretty much create
anything like I said a typical website
and internal employee portal and even
virtual reality now what I have here is
called what we like to lovingly call a
crafter cardboard it's Google cardboard
but what we like to think the
applications are is you can actually
just put a little QR code on the side
and using craft or CMS you can publish a
VR showroom now from there it loads in
your web browser you simply put your
phone into the cardboard and you can
interact in any way you want oh cool oh
man
ah that is very cool so the idea here is
we figure interacting with digital
content has almost stagnated in a way in
the past five years now yet web 1.0 web
2.0 then came the advent of mobile apps
changed everything and we're thinking to
ourselves you know crafters design for
the area of engagement we are designed
with mobile in line we are designed with
social in mind and we're also designed
with flexibility so you know with that
comes the potential of other VR and
augmented reality right now this is very
basic you can go to VR crafter Cloud IL
and load this very instance of our
virtual reality showroom you simply just
get a cardboard unit and set it up we
want to revolutionize the way people
interact with content and if you're
looking for the next big way to WoW or
impress your boss or impress your
customers you've got the idea for a
digital showroom that you want to do or
you know display content display your
latest products in a way that is just
unprecedented you should really check us
out crafter software.com join our
community get involved learn about the
software it's a great place to be so I
love the community message but this is
really what it's all about right here
this is so cool because I'm one of those
people who use is like a bar glass but
this is this is actually an amplifier
right yeah crafter we like to say we
give you the tools to help amplify your
message and so we wanted to get some
swag that represented that this was a
little bit of my brainchild so these are
little silicone amplifiers and what I'm
going to do is hopefully the copyrights
trick wouldn't happen but I'm gonna play
some cake and the idea is you know you
have your phone right here can't really
hear much of it but
if you amplify your message in the right
direction you can reach your customers
anywhere oh that's great I love it
so alright please come check us out at
our booth at Oracle code in New York
City we'll also be in Atlanta we're at
JavaOne every year and if you're ever in
the DC area come check us out as well
possibly the coolest laptop stickers
I've seen around the show today thanks
so much for dropping by all the great
talking with you have a good one you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
