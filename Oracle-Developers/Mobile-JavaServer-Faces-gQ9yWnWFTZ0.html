Twitter at Quito 99
I'm the principal consultant virtua
which is my company that does training
consulting architecture mentoring etc
mostly around JSF Java EE and Liferay
technologies I'm also an official u.s.
primefaces partner so we do prime basis
for consulting as well although I do
work with other JSF component Suites I
wrote a book a long time ago
JSF in action I run a website which
needs some visual work but does have
some good articles about JSF called
chance at central calm so our one arm a
co-host of the enterprise Java newscast
which I encourage you to check out
it's a newscast about all things related
to enterprise Java development whether
that's JSF or spring or a JB or Scala or
you know what's happened to latest
version in Java 8 or what's happening in
the world of a JavaScript and you know
Java development so lots of different
topics enterprise Java news.com you can
also find it on iTunes I also speak at
lots of conferences and I'm a JCP member
and I've been on different extra groups
currently I'm on Portland and JSF expert
groups so before we get to the this how
many of you guys are currently using JSF
ok so most of you which is good I'm kind
of going to assume that you're familiar
with a JSF works and this talks about if
you have any questions along the way I
can clear up something how many people
are currently doing mobile Oh at all ok
so see you come to the right talk there
ok
so and I think one of the key things you
know for people who have existing JSF
asses you know okay but now we have this
new requirement how do we support this
without rewriting our entire app so what
we're going to be looking at today are
some of the different ways you can do
mobile with JSF so for mobility in
general there's a few different ways to
do it right one is you can write a
native app so what that means is you you
buy a Mac and get Xcode or you get you
know an eclipse or idea and use Java and
write an Android app or you do both
right and that gives you lots of
flexibility you can take total advantage
of all the native features of the
application you can actually be in the
app store that they had that they
provide but it's also very expensive
because you essentially have to maintain
a separate code base for Android and a
separate code base for iOS and these
days it would be strange or probably a
bad idea not to support both right so
great plug race drinks and as some
minuses as well on the other benefit of
native is that you can always access
native things like the camera the
contacts calendar all those sort of
features which are built into the Apple
into the device you can access as well
okay and obviously for some applications
it's the only choice if you're writing a
sequencer you're probably going to have
to write a native application right but
it's not the only option
so there's also web development right so
you can write a web application which
looks good on a native device I mean on
a mobile device right so so that when
you look at it on your your tablet or
your phablets or your iPhone or Android
device it actually you know adjusts
using some sort of responsive layout or
some way to make sense on your device
right and there's a couple different
ways to do they're served at least three
one is I'll actually start
start with responsive design that's the
that's the popular term right and that's
essentially where your UI will adapt to
the layout of the size of the device
right so you know if you have a small
screen your your layout will sort of
adjust itself so that it looks good in a
small screen if you have a bigger screen
and it look good on the bigger screen
and you essentially write one page which
can sort of dynamically adjust when the
browser displays it okay so that's a
very common approach then there's two
other terms which to me are a little
more murky and saying this is someone
I'm not a mobile expert I'm more like
you guys I've done a lot of desktop too
long and I do mobile when my clients
require it okay so to me progressive and
adaptive or a little more murky and and
often people say adaptive as sort of
like progressive or subset of but
basically the idea is that instead of
just relying on on the web browser or
doing stuff at the web browser you can
sort of do things differently right
so you enhance the application more to
support a device as necessary the
default might be boring it might look
great on a desktop but you know the more
that your device more features or device
has or the more things you need you
might progressively enhance it and that
might include tailoring the results of
the the actual output to the device on
the server so maybe when the server
comes to you or when the request comes
in you say okay well this is an iPhone
let me display this thing instead of
that thing okay now maybe the thing that
you display maybe the page you display
does actually and do some responsive
stuff when it gets there but you might
display a different page all together
okay and that's really where adaptive
content is really at least in the
terminology for the the jsf mobile
vendors they're using the term adaptive
to mean more of the server-side
enhancement right the ability on the
server to tailor the output for the
client okay now if and now so the jsf
vendors has used that term for
server-side if you read like a wikipedia
that's not exactly what it means but for
the purposes of our conversation will
consider adaptive to be more like
adapting the content on the server
before it goes out
and responsive to be more like adapt to
the content in the browser once it gets
to the user okay just just to keep
things simple okay so that's the idea
with the web side of things so you can
make your website look good on a mobile
device and how many people have gone to
one of your favorite sites on your
mobile device and you just say oh my god
it's still set crap on my phone or
anyone ever had the experience right
like Jeff Soto looks like crap so so
that means that you know there's no and
none of these things have happened right
right so that's the web approach now
another approach is the hybrid approach
and this is the idea of having a native
wrapper so you actually do have
something which you can install on your
device you do have something that you
can get from the App Store okay
but it actually allows you to maybe
access some native features like the
phone I mean Martha the camera or
something else but you at the end of the
day you're still loading pages from a
web server okay and those web server
pages you know they're probably were
adapted to look kind of like the the
native application right and you'll find
if you poke around in some of the
applications on your phone some of them
kind of do this like Facebook did it for
a while though it didn't work out too
well for them I think they went back to
native but uh but Facebook that's kind
of an extreme example um but some of the
some applications you use if you poke
around a bit you notice there are
actually you're seeing a webpage inside
there okay so that's the hybrid approach
and different products have different
approaches right and some of the JSF
solutions I'll show you will do hybrid
some do web and actually show you one
solution that's native that isn't really
JSF but I think it's relevant to discuss
okay any questions so far all right
so I guess the first question is how
does JSF actually enable mobile right so
JSF is a you know server-side web
framework it renders HTML how does it
work on a mobile device how does that
actually work well at the end of the day
when it comes to rendering HTML or any
kind of marketing JSF is really good at
that right it's kind of built to
generate markup and output and it's
actually designed so it doesn't even
have to generate markup it could
actually generate different types of
things originally we thought we might be
generating more as SVG dynamically but
that didn't really happen so just that
it's really good at that and does this
with something called render kits so
render case essentially allows you to
take any UI component and then separate
the process of rendering it from the
actual component itself and this is just
the way JSF has always worked from day
one okay usually when you use the
component you just use a tag and it
works but what's happening behind the
scenes is that tag you specifies
essentially saying give me this
component in this renderer together okay
JSF internally can associate a different
render with a different component
depending on how things are configured
okay and those renderers are grouped
into what are call render kits so by
default and a normal application we use
the HTML for render kit which is sort of
the default and normally when we use a
third-party components sweet-like
primefaces or ice faces or something
it's are just throws itself into the
same render kit and it you know it all
works fine okay
but you can also use render kits to say
okay for from now on or for this
particular page or for this whole
application I'm going to use different
renderers for these same components so
maybe and I can have a mobile render kit
which will render and if the control
completely differently and then they're
ready and render kit does okay so this
is one of the features that mobile the
mobile application JSF banners can use
to actually provide JSF support okay now
another feature is html5 support this is
more of a JSF 2.2 feature so if you saw
my last talk you know more about
but essentially JSF 2.2 has the ability
to really easily integrate with html5
applications so this is not a
requirement at all for doing mobile so
if you're using an older version of JSF
you can still do use one of these mobile
frameworks to do it but if you're trying
to write an application that takes
advantage of more html5 features using
JSF 2.2 will make that easier for you
okay
so I would say that if you're looking at
mobile and you can upgrade to JSF 2.2
you should take a look at it it's been
out for a year so it's pretty stable now
so I'm gonna talk about a few different
components wheats and I'll talk about
how they support mobile first one is eye
spaces how many people have used I face
it before okay so here love you all
right so I spaced this is a really
comprehensive component suite for drea
Stefan's been around for a long long
time they're one of the first major
supporters of JSF they have over her 225
components they have themes automatic
Ajax which sort of dynamically will
update your screen your page via Ajax
for you if you want they have some bean
management facilities they have a
Windows scope that they added which is
also in JSF - we saw rest ready to show
you all this kind of stuff so like most
JSF components they also have a lot of
framework features to make the life
easier as well one of the areas they've
been focusing on a lot lately is of
course mobile they also have a checked
push actually I forgot to mention it
that's a very important feature of ice
faces Ajax push is the ability to push
out data from the server to the client
so you know you can basically push out
updates from a server in decline update
many different screens at once or one
screen dynamically based on what the
server does as opposed to just what the
client does question yes No the
questions the question is does Isis use
atmosphere like primefaces does
atmospheres a third-party
push library and the answer is no so
whereas whereas atmosphere is basically
its goal was to allow you to do a Jack
put Ajax push comment stuff regard
what web browser or what app server
you're using and it tries to use
whatever method it can whether it's long
pulling or WebSockets or whatever
dynamically and then it tries use
whatever features the app server has
dynamically and then primefaces works on
top of that Isis has our own proprietary
we can clobber pied-Ã -terre but their
own way of doing it I think they almost
always use a long polling don't they
yeah and these are just different ways
to do a jex push I'm not pulling all
these one polling works everywhere but
maybe not as efficient as than the other
ways so it sounds your question okay
okay so they also have themes as well
and it didn't let me work on mobile
basic utilities oh yeah I guess had a
lot of slides in this um so all the
tools I'm talking about are open source
and icesoft is the company behind nice
faces so they have commercial support
available as well in a commercial
version with more features so ice ice
facing this has been putting a lot of
emphasis on mobile lately I think that's
smart move and the current version of
their mobile product has web and hybrid
support okay so you can you can actually
you know build a normal web application
without and worrying about native
features using their components or you
can actually use a ice faces mobile
wrapper okay which you can actually
installed on your device you can pack it
up put it in the App Store etc and then
have that talk with ice faces okay what
that does is that gives you access to
all these native features not all native
features but a lot of the native
features in the browser okay so they've
got a very good very strong story there
and one of the things that they do is
they try to try to give you a native
look and feel for your applications so
essentially they use sort of an adaptive
technology to basically say okay well
you're looking you know you're coming
from a BlackBerry device I'm gonna make
you this look like a blackberry the
pages look like a backbreaker you're
coming from an iPhone
or an Android device so they try to
really adapt look and feel don't look
like look like the actual device you're
using use html5 and css3 and I mentioned
blackberry because they are one of the
one of the few that really really
strongly support blackberry so they
support blackberry Android and iOS okay
and the only on top of it Ajax push
features they had mobile push as well so
as you can imagine this is very handy
for mobile devices so you know you could
have a whole bunch of people out in the
field and push a notification not I
don't know if they do like native
notifications I haven't looked into that
deep into that deeply but at the very
least you can push out updates you know
to pages in your application from the
server side just a nice feature so as I
said before they use an adaptive
approach they also use responsive where
necessary okay they have similar based
themes having people have heard of theme
earlier before it's the some of you so
how many people have heard of jQuery
buddy alright although that's better
okay so jQuery has deeper UI which is a
set of UI components that are on top of
jQuery and the theme roller is sort of
the theming aspect of it so it's
actually it's becoming sort of a
standard in a lot of ways so the themes
for eyespace is mobile our theme roller
base primefaces themes or theme or a
theme roller based as well so it all it
really means is that you know you have a
certain set of CSS selectors which are
excuse me which are pretty well
understood to work in a similar theme
and you can use a nice little online
utility to make a theme for theme roller
so this is a diagram from their site and
let me make this a little bit bigger
come on come on come on oh here we go
alright so um so you see they've got a
picture of where I put my well I don't
have my clicker here they've got you
know they they have JSF they also have
support for spring and spring MVC as
well for their mobile stuff they have
these their mobile web controls and then
they have device detection and rendering
part and different themes for different
devices okay so that's kind of what kind
of their this is to me is really one of
their strong selling points assistive
ice optimizer markup so I really try and
make it integrate with the device you're
using okay
okay so let's look at a demo of the ice
phases mobile support and one of the
things I really like about what they've
done is even if we don't have any
particular device on your machine you
can go to their mobile demo which I have
here somewhere and you get this really
cool site okay
so you see they've got um your shape
should scale - there we go alright so
this is actually their showcase but
they've given you sort of a little
stimulator right inside of your browser
so you can go and look at the examples
and you see they've got a lot of these
sort of standard components right so
what was they have an accordion you
notice we have seen our accordion
component the description and they even
show you an example okay so it's kind of
hard to see here but um this is one of
the key things here is that we're not
really talking about anything different
so for JSF developers this is pretty
energetic stuff right it's a movie
component left an ID auto height is just
different properties you have to learn
how to use but essentially these are
different content panes right oh so
pretty straightforward for a JSF
developer
and you see you can look up the code
here so you see you've gotten low be
accordion I think there's a change
listener you can call so it works pretty
much like you'd expect right I don't
know if I could just figure out how to
get back to the previous area just
wanted deal one problem with this
approach okay cool whoops
okay so let me go back to these of our
examples um carousel data view this is a
good example of sort of a data table
type component so you've got sorting
different sorting cetera what's there
and what's nice about the way they've
done things is you'd actually have this
little adapter thing here and all of a
sudden now you can see actually inside
of a tablet so this is the exact same
page right but they've adapted it for an
iPad
right and let's say you don't really
care about that but you you a BlackBerry
users well this is it and you see this
is an example of that sort of adaptive
theme right so now this looks more like
a BlackBerry than it did look like an
iPhone
without the agency one of the things
that html5 allow you to do is use the
native controls when I so we've got a
spinner here got input here etc now
let's say we want to try in a nexus 7 we
get then get a different looking fuel
right so it's automatically selecting
the theme based on the device you're
using ok you see you've also got a video
audio components as well you've got a
scanner
component I believe this is this would
require the actual native integration
for this I believe so this is actually
very nice demo if you want to you know
go get it look at what their stuff
actually looks like and again all of it
is standard jsf in terms of actually how
it's developed so let's take a look at
this geolocation example here ok so it's
just another JSF component continued
location whether you're not you want
continuous updates you know higher
precision etc so it really gives you a
good example of so that all the sorts of
things you can do
okay so that that's that's the demo of
the ice phases solution and of course it
works in a mobile router as well and it
does give you examples if you want to
actually create the actual rapper
yourself and just tell you how to do
that using Xcode or using Java tools for
Android as well okay
there's also a if you have if you go to
the Play Store or the Android store if
you search for eyes face it you can
download the native wrapper there and
just play with it okay yes yes yes these
are different components are not the
same components and I think that's
actually good I think they're probably a
little more cohesive than the ice faces
components are at this point but I think
I spaces over time has have different
approaches between the AA's components
and the old components and I think this
is really just one new set of components
that all work very well together
this is all eyes faces oh yes yes no I
think I'm robust as a prime is a very
different mobile approach so so I think
this is all their own code so what he's
saying is that there was there was a
period where ice phases needed to sort
of gem start with more new components
and some of them actually came from the
primefaces codebase things around
primefaces to point x so if you get like
the latest version of ice bases not the
mobile components but there is some
primefaces code in there that's what
he's getting on so there's a little
controversy and everything so alright
any questions on this okay
all right let's look at another solution
and that inspiring faces so front faces
I'd say right now is the most popular
component suite for JSF and right now
they've got over 100 components they
have a JavaScript API dialog framework
enhanced Ajax Jason support and lots of
other features bless you
they also have html5 support as well the
themes are themed roller bass like like
a ice bassist I also have push support
and like we were talking about earlier
their push support is based on
atmosphere so same gonna work with the
atmosphere by itself before I'm just
curious so just one person alright so
but it is absolutely very good push
support as well um it's just it works
very differently under the hood then I
face this stuff but it's it's also very
powerful and as I said they're probably
the market leader it's also open source
but there's sort of a different model so
the the major releases are open source
and then if you want a bug-fix releases
you have to like subscribe to get the
bug first releases and then all those
bug fixes releases will be rolled into
the next major version which is open
source and then of course you can buy
commercial support as well so that's
sort of a different model so um I said a
prime basis has all those components
which are their standard components the
the desktop components right then they
also have something called primefaces
mobile okay and unlike the in in the
older days the primefaces component so a
lot of them were built on top of jquery
components but now they're not now the
normal prime faceless components are for
the most part all custom JavaScript on
the client side okay
however primefaces Mobile is sort of
like primaries as was a few years ago
it's it's built on top of jQuery Mobile
first and then they've added some stuff
on top of it okay so if you like the way
jQuery Mobile works you like the way the
primefaces
mobile works
it has a very broad browser device
support so and this is one of the
differences whereas icesoft
III stays as mobile supports a very
specific set of browsers really well
right if you look at the jQuery Mobile
so I which is essentially what
primefaces wraps you see there browser
support is a little bit longer right
this is kind of ridiculous list of
brothers so they've got very very wide
browser support okay even support
Windows Phone say hey and they have some
sort of a progressive enhancement
approach which means they do a lot of
tailoring on the server before it gets
to the browser but you know there's also
some stuff on the client as well and
also has very nice mobile navigation so
you can sort of navigate between
different panes on the side of the same
page and let's take a look at primefaces
vocals so I'm face this doesn't have the
the nifty mobile simulator like um like
I spaces so I have to actually use the
they use Xcode so
all right so let's look at this as a
iphone s and this was the ice faces
showcase but we'll go to the crime face
this one oh this got to be so big all
right
okay
all right so this is the prime faces
showcase and you see if they've got the
sort of standard looking field where you
can pull out the navigation I really
wish I could decrease the size of this
I'm not really sure how I got to be this
big just try and restart it real quick
here all right whatever
okay so here is your basic accordion
panel which is pretty much what we saw
before right and just like the ice
basins components we look at the actual
source which is down here which I can't
seem to get to there we go okay
so anyway I can get it back to normal
size okay so here's the source oh and
it's really big here but you can see
it's essentially normal
you know primefaces code there's nothing
really special going on here got the
accordion panel down here
okay I'm gonna restart this thing in
sauce driving crazy all right reset
content and settings let's do that
okay I'm guess we'll just leave like
this okay
this is really annoying okay so by my
iOS thing which allows really someone
see a scale button
no thank you all right I'm not really
sure how that setting got changed
because it was like this before but okay
all right so we'll go back to where we
were
okay
and actually if this is actually a good
example because if you go to the normal
prompt face to showcase you notice it's
it's still it's actually responsive
because this is actually the normal
prime face to showcase which is nice so
it actually shows up reasonably well
this way so but what we want is the
mobile showcase
okay what you having trouble finding and
so one thing we can do
I'm away in there some extra minutes I
was
okay
I don't know why the orientation is not
switching but okay so just look at a
couple more components I don't have time
here but you can see they've got a pre
so it's a decent set you know
autocomplete button calendar list dialog
link they've got the growl which is
always a favorite tabs toolbar upload
and what I like also is the this
navigation feature so basically sort of
very simple navigation to find here okay
but the way it's done is all within one
page so you see they've got a page to
find here
there's header content page so basically
you can find each of these pages and
kind of move in between them which is
basically what we just saw okay so let's
just have sort of you know if you have
one page which is a set of different
things you can just have in one page and
then have different transitions inside
of the page in the actual application in
on the device from one of the things to
keep in mind though and this is I think
where the different solutions vary so
what you're seeing here are a decent set
of components right and your course have
all the power that you have in
primefaces if you're working with a you
know an existing primefaces application
and something like this makes a lot of
sense but what it's not gonna do is you
know any sort of special adaptation for
you so it doesn't you know it looks a
certain way right you know it does vary
a little bit based on what jQuery
provides but you know you're gonna have
to basically create different mobile
pages which is not a bad thing but it's
different than having a fully responsive
approach where you create one page that
works on different devices right this is
so in this solution you could very
easily you say let's say you have an
existing premises application build some
views some pages using primefaces mobile
that support different devices you know
but it's you probably wouldn't be able
to take your existing pages as is and
have them automatically work on a mobile
device okay all right so here's a new
entrance into the mobile landscape so
this morning I announced that Liferay
has released life where a face is alloy
which is a new component suite
unfortunately I couldn't get a demo
working but now that I have internet I
can actually do a demo
so basically Liferay is a vendor a
portal vendor so they have an open
source portal product it competes with
like JBoss portal and then IBM and
Oracle on the high end right so a portal
lets you basically a sort of an
application platform where you can have
lots of little applications or portlets
that work together in the same page and
you can build an entire site with them
the whole site can have theming and
personalization and customization it's
really great for building really sort of
large sites and having the ability to
integrate with the backend and also you
know support lots of users and things
like that so you can write JSF
applications for portlets and life for a
for a while has had really good support
for doing that
and Neela Griffin is here in the front
he actually has worked on this
components we called life free faces
alloy so the use of JSF component
components built on top of alloy a UI is
they can we heard a vowel UI before okay
so a couple of you so lui is a
JavaScript pure JavaScript an HTML CSS
component suite sponsored by Liferay in
Al and life for a fake life for a I'm
sorry life for a life Ray faces alloy is
the JSF integration with that sweet okay
so so alle what you can use without JSF
Liferay faces makes it easy to use alloy
it's actually part not Perry but part of
the life for a faceless project so that
includes the Portland bridge which lets
you write JSF applications for portal
servers and also some other features to
integrate with Liferay portal but the
reason I'm bringing it up here is
because these components actually work
without the life race so you can
actually use them by themselves as well
okay okay and it's relevant here because
it actually already has some responsive
behavior so my frames done a good job in
the last couple of years and really you
know in really having good mobile
support with responsive design and
things like that and these components
have a response of some responsive
components as well there's a responsive
now about navbar layouts and some of the
components as well ok so do a quick demo
of the Liferay faces switch to this
orientation yeah I don't know what's on
them this is this is definitely one of
those days where I like it seems like
everything is going wrong for your
presentations so it's a - oh no web what
you just discovered ok
okay that works all right so this is a
life for your faces showcase and you can
see from the beginning if you don't
click on the link repeatedly it's
already responsible fright so it's
already got like a layout which looks
good in the browser all right so here's
there's like standard buttons there's a
data table component won't take a look
at that one
okay so to see down here there's the
information about the components and
pretty much in all of these components
sweets have great demos it's always a
good way to learn about the components
so you've got your surf standard looking
data table here and just like all the
other ones I've showed you let me just
zoom in here a bit the you know we
usually have pretty pretty straight
first and stainer JSF you've got your
alloy data table we've got your header
facets if you're familiar with a JSF
data table it should look pretty
standard to you and if I remember
correctly there are some other data
table demos here
was there another deity able to move
okay that's fine hit record all right so
there's also some input controls and I
actually unless the way this
autocomplete component works so
autocompletes pretty standard in any you
know component suite was yeah mister I
find it easier to scroll on a desktop
using a rural mouse but the bear is the
it looked
okay so the autocomplete you know
everyone knows about an autocomplete you
type something and it matches what
you're doing right it matches what your
tries to match what you're typing in so
here whoops we're doing server-side
matching so I'm going to type in okay
powerful integration right so see is
just doing a simple match based on what
I'm doing or favorite feature themes
lightweight there we go ready okay
okay so this is basic
autocomplete we see also has different
ways that you can do the matching but
what I liked about it was it has a
client-side approach which is handy so
you know this this is actually done on
the client as well which for
autocomplete is really what you want
right because you know unless you have
thousands and thousands of entries but
it's pretty handy so and again the the
usage of this is pretty standard this
actually uses select items which a lot
of companies don't use and you see it
also uses standard Ajax from JSF so all
that is pretty straightforward okay
is there anything is there a particular
component you think is oh yeah that's a
good one okay right so I said I said it
also supports for some other components
so what what um the whole adaptive
feature can do is basically based on
what device it is to render something
differently right
so to go to add a component it actually
renders differently for the mobile
device
uh-uh what just happened here
okay so you see we're using the native
date picker here instead of your cute
little Ajax JavaScript one like we
normally pop up right so the example
there and what's great is again the way
you use this is just a standard way
you're used to using JSF so go down here
and we see there was the infant date
component and you have a normal date
pattern and everything nothing special
there so this is another choice that you
have is the light free face of alloy
sweet I think it's a no-brainer if
you're using life right um but it's also
something to take a look at if you're
not in there's pano Leon says well this
is there's some adaptive features in the
panel stuff right yeah so like the alloy
royal row right so that's adaptive as
well oh let's be chef okay so so here we
have these different columns and the
infant these are all alloy columns but
just made some responsive and adaptive
right sesame responsive using bridge dot
so one thing I do I do is just when I
talk about responsive I think what might
make it make a lot of sense if we just
look at that same demo
in a desktop browser okay so this is
what it looks at the desktop browser
it's the same page right but it looks
very different you can get and you know
this is something that mostly the Suites
will do with you know if you use the
right layout containers then you
actually can get this sort of look and
feel where it will basically change
depending on with the device so this is
great here and it also works in the on
devices as well okay oh yeah so and
basically but why responsive we mean it
can do stuff like this so it's not in
some cases looking to see what device
right like deciding what the display
that's more of an adaptive technique but
the responsive is really more saying
okay well let me just change based on
how big the devices right so you see
here we've changed the viewport and now
this is pretty much what we saw in the
film right so this is definitely
something you want to look for that you
can get from these at different products
okay
any questions so far okay so if you have
no questions about life or your faces
alley you should talk to him afterwards
there's free swag at the live life free
breath apparently yes question
yeah um actually I'm about to talk about
nef phases so hopefully I'll get to that
yes you know I was look I actually
recently had them on my slide deck and I
couldn't find much in rich faces they
have officially said that rich faces is
a maintenance mode which means are not
really going to innovate and I and I
went back to the documentation I
couldn't find anything recent on their
mobile support so I think they do
support mobile and I'm not really sure
how well um and they're certain they're
definitely not promoting it the mobile
support that is all right so let me go
back to the slides okay so I'm gonna
fortunately not have to motor through
the mobile ATF stuff but I'll go through
this quickly
all right so Oracle has cement some
choices as well and they've got a couple
different ones say ATF faces rich client
that is their component suite it's part
of ATF essentials so it's actually free
you don't need what you don't need a
WebLogic license or anything as totally
free it's not open source but it's free
so that's their component suite and it's
got a lot of stuff in there it also have
something brand-new there's a session
about this I think I might be going on
now called
they have a new product called the
mobile application development framework
or math which is for native applications
is not for web-based applications so
I'll talk a little bit about that
quickly and yeah those are the two two
choices basically from Oracle okay so
idiot faces rich client has been around
for a long time and just for this a
quick history lesson Oracle has always
been very instrumental in JSF a lot of
the original features and JSF came from
Oracle's UI X components which were out
before JSF
and Oracle uses ATF they use JSF and
specifically ATF faces rich client in
all other enterprise products so
whatever Oracle Fusion Middleware
product there is that has a UI it uses
ATF faces so they've made a very big
investment in JSF and have had a big
influence on it over time and ATF faces
rich client is their component suite has
over 150 GS F components skinning and
JavaScript API dialogue framework is
actually heavily influenced JSF two and
two point two I have a lot of data
visualization components because as you
imagine in their products they need very
good data visualization okay and also
has very good tooling for JDeveloper and
eclipse this is something which i think
is very those unnoticed that but uh they
actually the best JSF totally out of
anybody especially for their own
components they can actually get
drag-and-drop and like all sorts of
things like rad drag-and-drop assigned
to a data source sort of neat stuff that
uh that I think is actually speeds
things up a bit
but uh but they've got very good tooling
so we talked about that okay so on the
mobile side they have touch and gesture
support they have html5 support and they
use sort of an adaptive approach so if
it's a mobile device though they'll
display things using html5 instead of
Flash Thank You Apple they will display
tables and scroll bars automatically
without I'm with pagination so instead
of having you know a scrolling data
table they'll put paginate iran it
automatically pages with the stretching
layout render using a flow layout so
they do sort of adapted stuff
automatically I think your question was
about the Oracle ADF mobile product
right
right so so horrible if you look on
Oracle site and I actually had to wade
through this a bit so there's all these
different mobile things there's Oracle
ADF mobile which is essentially sort of
it's not officially deprecated but your
answer is use a DFA size rich client
they're not gonna put any more work into
it but ATF Mobile was based on patchy my
face is Trinidad and supports a lot of
the older devices so if you need to
support older devices the can't even do
html5 or something then that's a good
solution but if you if you can support
newer devices then the answer is to use
any of faceless rich client so if you
find or ADF mobile that's an older
product there's another one actually no
what is that one I said now I'm getting
myself in a theist there's another one
which they rebranded as math but anyways
but the one you're thinking of I think
you need to use a different product okay
so what else do they have there they
have a special skin which minimizes
images but they don't have native
support so so in your faces rich client
is not gonna you know do anything on
your browser but it is does have a very
good set of has pretty good support for
working natively on on your different
devices okay we're not natively but
looking good I shouldn't say on your
devices so I'm going to do a very quick
demo all right so
and of course I don't have this bookmark
I said this one this day enjoy
everything discussion on what if the
Oracle site is actually having a problem
yeah I think it is okay so the maybe I
can find a screenshot or something I
guess their demo site is not up or
running okay so no that's a actual video
all right well they have a lot of
components if you go to the site you can
actually look at the demo which is
apparently not up right now so don't try
to go right now but still a tur and I
thought they might have a cool
screenshot but I don't really see one
yeah I don't see one but they're
actually quite powerful components and
they they do a pretty good job of
adapting if you try to use it with a
mobile device automatically
out-of-the-box okay
hey that'd work
no I didn't okay all right well
okay so the other thing when to talk
about was the Oracle mobile application
development framework or math mystical
this is something which I think they're
they basically rebranded it had a
different name which I think was a DF
mobile that's getting the names confused
but um so they rebranded it but this is
an interesting topic because it's it's
not really JSF but it's it's JSF best so
what I find very interesting about
Oracle's approach with this tools is
then Oracle number one client for all of
their development tools like ADF doser
tools is Oracle they have like thousands
of developers and they use this stuff
right
so from Oracle's perspective they have
all these JSF developers use the ADF
faces rich client and they need to build
mobile applications so they made it
really easy for JSF developers to write
mobile applications and what's
interesting is you can actually write
native mobile applications okay
and they're actually native on android
or iOS even though you've written them
in a java and the programming model is
very similar to JSF so it's not actually
JSF JSF does not run on the mobile
device okay but the programming model is
very similar okay so you have you know
pages which are sort of like facelet
pages and they have tags which look like
JSF tags and you can write your code in
Java
maybe that runs on the native device and
the way it does is it has a lightweight
embedded JVM so when you have it's
basically there there is obviously a
native application you're installing it
includes JVM actually I think it only
supports JDK 1.4 so it's kind of old but
it's it's an actual JVM you can write
your Java code in there and if you want
you can write pure html5 and talk to a
rest service or whatever you want to
call be in the same application okay
and they've have really good released
extensive tooling for Eclipse and
JDeveloper
so they have like about 80 UI components
that and remember these are actually
native controls is aren't really JSF
components they support patchy Cordova
plugins a Cordova is a framework for
writing device native plugins so you can
do that using Cordova and then of course
since it's native application it
supports offline access as well as Amin
on the online access and of course if
you wanted to you could still build a
hybrid application where you you know
get pages from a server as well you can
do either/or it also includes an
embedded SQLite database so you can save
stuff for local storage and it's not
free or open sources license to per user
or there's an unlimited user license
I've absolutely no idea how much costs
so you want to put into that you should
go to the Oracle booth ok and basically
the architecture was kind of like this
so this is the device native container
and here's your server HTML there's your
html5 and JavaScript there is the Java
VM
here's your kanuma plugins and you see
they all kind of work in tandem together
here and then you can of course talk to
whatever you want to from outside of it
so it's really kind of a fascinating
product and I haven't really done a deep
dive with it but it's something you look
at if you if you obviously this is not a
situation where you can take your
existing JSF application and turn it
into this but if you needed to build
mobile and you wanted to leverage your
JSF skills this might be a solution ok
and I don't really have time for demo so
but you can go to their site look for
Oracle math you can see a lovely demo of
all their stuff so to summarize JSF has
mobile solutions today I think you can
probably expect there to be more mobile
features in JSF 2.3 which we're working
on now
they excel at the adaptive approach
is one of the benefits of JSF is sort of
the ability to do stuff on the server so
so the solutions generally do a good job
of sort of doing things like picking the
right component based on the device as
opposed to sending stuff to the device
and then letting the device decide to do
to do it so if you use that in
responsive and mean in a in tandem with
the responsive design you really can
have a really powerful application okay
so we talked about ice phases and
basically my my perspective ice phases
has lots of really strong features for
mobile for hybrid applications I think
it's really when it comes to hybrid
applications primefaces has a really
good set of pure html5 components really
broad compatibility all right and of
course you know it's which primefaces so
if you're already using it it's a good
good a good option in your faces rich
client has pretty big mobile support you
know it's all built in there nothing
super fancy but it's there and mobile
application development framework is a
unique approach for writing actual
native applications using a JSF like
programming model okay all right so we
don't really have time for questions but
if you have any you can compact word so
