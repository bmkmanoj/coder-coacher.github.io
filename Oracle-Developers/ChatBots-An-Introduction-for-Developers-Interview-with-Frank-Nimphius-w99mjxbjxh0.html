Toronto I'm Bob Rubert with the Oracle
technology Network of bringing you yet
another interview with one of the
session speakers from today's event and
that session speaker happens to be Frank
nymph is Frank how you doing well I'm
doing pretty well
you're looking fine - thank you we just
talked about that you're having a good
hair day you have a good hat a so that
is where I can possess so describe for
the viewers your role Oracle what do you
do I'm doing proc management for the dev
team and I had many products that I
worked for over the almost 20 plus years
now then with Oracle and the product I'm
currently working with is mobile cloud
service and check BOTS recently that we
started building that one so everything
mobile that's kind of that times at home
with me tell me about your session today
describe that in if I give you exactly
one hundred and twenty seconds how would
you describe your session it's much as
you seen the introductory section about
chat both checkbox is a new topic of a
topic that's really kicking off this
year it's a new channel into mobile
development and yeah so we're building a
platform for that I introduced that in
my session showed the platform as well
and also gave kind of a 360-degree view
on chat pods from my perspective so for
the benefit of people who may have been
living in a cave for the last year so
what is a chat bot well a chat but it's
a virtual agent if you want to say so
you can imagine that you had in the past
your phone so you called somebody then
you had a mobile application so you had
some widgets to work with now the newer
generation actually they're looking at
messenger as a client so they use
Facebook Messenger or they use cake or
WeChat so what they want to do is they
want to send a quick message have that
operating on whatever servers that they
are not aware of and giving them a
response that they're expecting so that
apples are doing Jetboil it's just like
a conversational interface the
you can send text messages too and that
will do some operation on the backend
and then the outcome is could be a book
slide cook for your third chase it could
be anything
so chances are the the entity that I
spent 30 minutes chatting with on a
recent call with my cell service
provider was probably a chat buff could
be yeah so if it's done well then yes so
there's always a risk like if you make
it too perfect if people don't see that
they're chatting with the temple and
chances are that people are trying to
figure out if that this is a chatot and
they won't stay on the line long enough
with you to do a touring test yep it
will come down to the Turing test yet in
in developing chat BOTS what what unique
challenges or hurdles face developers
well first of all its new technology so
there are a lot of articles around chat
BOTS that you can kind of read up on the
Internet a lot of opinions everyone says
well Chet what makes the world a better
place which you know my talk I said
neither a mobile application or a chat
what makes you rich men its business
model that's the check for support but
once you have a good business model then
the chat but really helps you to reach
out to an audience that might not be
interested otherwise to make business
with you just to give you an example if
you have a loyal customer base they are
happy to download your application run
with your application but if you don't
have a loyal customer base or there's
someone out there that it's not your
customer if you want to reach out to
millennial then actually that is a kind
of interface that you want to work with
now the challenge that developers have
is to first of all identify design
patterns that work for the chat BOTS
sooner two that we have done parents for
the web and for the mobile application
but then the turns also is like how do I
get all of the artificial intelligence
the machine learning that is required to
understand natural language work in the
context of my vacation I'm billing so do
I have to get several technologies put
them together or do I have to learn a
lot of ATI so that's where we come in
and say okay we make it simple we're
just provided a platform don't bother
would be in internal we do
that for you is what sort of tools are
we talking about that would that would
aid developers in in building chat
I think the tool doesn't really matter
as the technology does now I can always
speak for what Oracle provides now we're
looking for a more component based
approach so instead of you coding
everything we want you to code really
what matters and not more so this is
like we give you a declarative and
component based approach on colossal
building the conversation flow so you
have components a component is doing an
input tags and output text components
providing a list and you just bring them
together in a flow that would be kind of
natural conversation that in the end
will come up to and result so if there
is something that we don't provide you
write the custom component and this
custom component is just a piece of
JavaScript or Java depend on the
language of your choice and that is
exposed as a REST API so you expose the
component that will do the logic as the
rest API and our chat platform will
actually use that information bring that
into a internal laundry that is your
conversation and you know whatever the
user types in it will find what the
user's intent what is it what the user
want to do and then if that intent
actually invokes your component it will
call out to your rest service and so the
tool doesn't really matter you go with
what you want if it's Java hey go is not
bent or whatever is your job a tool of
choice if it's JavaScript use at home or
use webstorm or whatever tool you like
to use for your java world or javascript
work now you gave a session on chatbots
a different session and share parts at
the new york oracle Kotov met you talked
about chat bots here what's next on your
calendar Oracle code it over so I'm
going from here back home which is
Germany I'll be in Berlin next Monday
I'll be in track next Friday and then
see what comes or you haven't so for me
we're racking up those frequent flier
miles
ah you know if I could be myself from
one point on the earth to the next
without getting frequent flyer miles I
would do that
well maybe at some Oracle code event in
the future we'll be talking about
developing transporters yes and
hopefully I'm presenting it in so
phasing it if you'd like to see Frank
present at one of the events in Europe
you can find more information about the
entire Oracle code series at developer
oracle.com slash code you'll find a
complete list of all the upcoming events
along with information on how you can
submit a proposal to dilute to deliver
your own session and an Oracle code
event for the Oracle technology Network
I'm Bob Rupert thanks for watching and
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
