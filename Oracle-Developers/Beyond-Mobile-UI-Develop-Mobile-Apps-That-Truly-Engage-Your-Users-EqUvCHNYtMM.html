right now and we'll be good afternoon
soon and I hope everyone has got their
lunch okay okay so thanks for attending
this is this this is the third day of
wattle open world and you know I see a
lot of people here and thanks for
attending it really helps us you know
helps us get motivated thank you so much
so today we are going to talk about you
know going beyond just the mobile UI
we're going to talk about how you would
truly engage with your users and a quick
introduction my name is Perez I am the
director of product management for
Oracle mobile cloud enterprise and are
we here is the senior director of
development for cloud enterprise again
so we will take you through a a few
interesting topics here first you know
just as a show of hands how many of us
here are new to mobile cloud service ok
nice that's a good balance so we will go
over in depth on why you would choose to
use mobile cloud servers and why you
would build mobile apps with move the
cloud server side and then we will go
quickly over where Oracle passes and
where we fit into the pass then we'll do
mobile cloud deep dive I was going to do
a quick presentation and then we will
get to the meat of what we have today
which is pretty much you know how do you
truly engage with your customers and we
will try to answer that question for you
then we'll do a demo it's an interesting
demo and you know it gives you an
insight of what we are what we're doing
at Oracle and how you kind of enhance
your mobile app efforts so starting off
first right so let's talk about a common
business challenges that people have
right when they are building mobile apps
right things like you know it's really
difficult to maintain
highly resilient apps you know how do I
innovate when the industry is moving so
fast you know we have bots we are cxa so
how do we kind of you know keep
innovating and match the innovation
that's happening in the industry how do
we avoid vendor lock-in it's very
important for us right now these apps
are not just for something that you can
make ones and throw it in the App Store
and forget about things right you have
to keep updating them once or one so
often and how do you go about leveraging
open source but one of the most
important things that happens is you
know it's so difficult to engage with
customers right you know customers have
a lot of choice so we have to do a
really good job there and that's the
star this talk is pretty much about that
now going into the technical challenges
for mobile app developers so how many
app developers in this room oh nice okay
so the challenges are pretty much
different you know in the sense like you
know how and where is my code managed
you know what language is what framework
should I use can I get full automation
all the way from code commit to
repository to production right now how
do I do that and then you know how do i
connect to existing SAS applications
back-end resources you know how do how
do you go ahead and automate your
engagement with customer so all these
are real critical questions to ask and
this and these are some of the questions
that we will try and unfocus on today so
in in the way we see things right we see
the front-end app developers as being
the engine for creativity you know you
design and create and that's what
front-end app developers do they focus
on the creativity aspect of apps right
on the backend side you want people to
focus on the mobile first api's worry
about the lifecycle while the business
needs to focus on the agility and the
engagement aspects right so that's how
we put things into buckets and that's
how we kind of warned people to think
about mobile apps
so what we have built is a mobile
application development platform
basically right now you have you want to
be able to build better apps faster and
you have the choice of using any kind of
front-end development to you could
choose to build your app through ionic
through react you know we provide
Cordova SDKs you could purchase to build
apps using iOS Android we are totally
develop agnostic you know whatever
framework front-end framework you want
to use you can use right and we even
have local development platforms like
max now we provide all this all this
with mobile for services like so things
like location awareness of your app
things like push notifications storage
all of these things right view you must
have seen many of our competitors have
the everything's all separated out in
different place it's difficult to pull
all those things together we make it
really easy for you to building it out
in one single platform and then we also
provide a way to kind of you know put
out your endpoints you know have your
API is built out so it's a it's an
end-to-end platform now if you're
looking at what all mobile services we
provide pretty much right you know
security comes first right now is
something that the core of a mobile app
right push notification storage data
offline and saying analytics is also
important location-based services you
know and overall lifecycle management of
the apps itself and the artifacts that
the app depends on now everything we we
are showing here is pretty much out of
the box they solve most common mobile
requirements they are pre-built tested
and optimized for you and then we have
our own if we have the ability to now go
build your own custom services you know
implement your own flexible services
backed by enterprise great connectors
right now where are we in the Oracle
Flash port pass portfolio you would have
seen that so many different paths
elements now and there are there's and
we fit into the mobile bucket along with
documents cloud service so if you look
at a stack right we have continued to
innovate on the mobile side
last year we would have shown you
there's just the slide with you know and
iam enhanced it with the I and M L now
what we have is a from beyond just the
mobile API catalog the API shaping
connectors and the mobile services that
I was just showing we have intelligent
biobots we allows that and you must have
gone in for some of those sessions but
beyond that we also have the mobile and
bought insights you know a platform we
call CX a cross channel data aggregation
I'll touch up on this on some of few
slides I have later so pretty much you
know end to end anything that you want
to build an app out of you know we have
it available you can choose to build a
web app mobile app a voice app a
messaging app everything based on the
tools that we are providing inter as a
platform end-to-end so I'm just going to
transfer on to avi and he's gonna good
to show you what we have what we have
built out and he's going to give you a
deep dive thanks professor okay so what
I was gonna show was kind of what's
under the hood essentially of this
mobile cloud platform and I'll start
with like a very high picture of where
exactly this mobile cloud kind of fits
into the larger platform strategy that
we have at Oracle so as you know the
software is the service layer on top and
then the infrastructure as a service we
fit right there with the path services
and what mobile cloud enterprise is is
essentially it's a single unified hub
for developing deploying maintaining one
monitoring and analyzing your mobile
apps looking a little deeper into that
what we provide our sort of API is a
platform that provides API is both on
the tooling in the runtime perspective
and as far as mentioned we're agnostic
of
fronting technology that you use but we
do support Oracle tools as well as
third-party tools and you can build
everything in native code as well and
provide SDKs to make that simpler but on
the tooling side also we have API is
that we ourselves consume for developing
our design time and various other cloud
services that Oracle use it as well and
then the analytics and continuous
development tools also use the tooling
api's and then drill down a little bit
into the mobile cloud itself well it
consists of essentially sort of the core
engine including a node node based
custom code container for the analytics
pieces we have the collectors and
analytics engagement scheduler built in
there and then for bots we have channel
support language intelligence and a full
dialogue dialogue engine the cloud
mobile cloud itself utilizes a lot of
services across spans so on the front
end from the left side we're showing the
load balancer as a service that's
essentially where our requests and
everything come in through that it then
ties into the identity cloud service for
managing access and then we have
something called PSN the path service
manager that manages the lifecycle of
this or so this is something yet your
DevOps
or or in the case of Oracle managed apps
would utilize to manage the entire
service and the services within the
cloud mobile cloud also utilizes the
storage cloud service for logs and
object storage archiving database as a
service for data and then the managing
your the lifecycle of your apps itself
through developer cloud service and then
connectors to on-premise and cloud
services and previous we'll show a demo
of one of those the service itself also
is heavily relying on Kafka and SPARC
services from from the Oracle plans
platform as well and finally under for
notifications we support APNs although
you know
firebase Google Windows and then also a
third-party integration for SMS support
through xenoverse the way what we've
done here is essentially we have we have
a construct called a mobile backend and
essentially that that's what encapsulate
all the API is and other resources
security and everything that you would
require to implement the backend of your
mobile application and in terms of like
some of the features that we get from
the platform itself out of the box right
so through any cloud service and the
service is built into mobile cloud you
get as a common security model across
all your path services a single account
for your services identity propagation
across services or support ng Federation
through sam'l open ID as a sole support
SSO integration with a DFS as your octa
social login through Facebook and other
social platforms mobile user cell for
registration and then multi-factor
authentication and just to touch on the
path service manager this is actually
the thing that DevOps uses to manage the
entire platform that's you know it
provides a common API CLI and
essentially this will you can manage the
entire lifecycle of the other service
itself but also what it does is a nice
abstraction that then lets us not just
deployed into the cloud but also into
the Oracle cloud machine on-premise
solution then through the Oracle cloud
platform services available they're
essentially load balancers a service
allows you to manage all the URLs
now it's also VPN capable and proxy
distracting what this allows you to do
now is actually build mobile
applications that can then connect back
into your enterprise and furthermore
through the Oracle cloud and its
regional data centers and availability
domains you get high variability
disaster recovery but also
colocation with within geographies and
then on the database side we give you
the ability to bring your own database
essentially for all yours storing all
all the data and metadata associated
with your mobile applications this also
allows you to kind of manage and use the
database any way you want one of the
capabilities of that is essentially use
multiple instances of the cloud service
on a single database gives you the
flexibility of having a TR solution and
high availability options as well and
furthermore we have also introduced the
low cost storage cloud service as an
option for for storing archiving data
and then finally for the app lifecycle
itself through developer cloud service
integration okay and I'll turn it back
over to Purvis continued thank you so
let me talk you through engagement you
know it's all about delay delighting
your customers right now the more you
delight your customers the more uptake
you get off your app itself if you think
about it right now if you look at your
smartphones you probably have 3040 apps
right but in effect you're basically
using about ten of them every day and
it's pretty much so difficult for you to
get back and look into apps that you
have downloaded but you have not used in
a while right so it really helps if you
know if you are able to you know get
your users to you know get your user
attention and reengagement strategy
straight right so excuse me
this happens once Wow I managed to hit
then but so let's look at the key
engagement tools right now we provide
you with push notifications data offline
insane capabilities analytics
location-based services together with
integrations and connectors engagement
is all about being able to solve
problems you know with an intuitive UI
but much more than that right you need
timely notifications offlane
availability location of grandness for
your apps and basically Cris
integrations with multiple services now
if you look at push notifications and
how they have evolved over the past we
started out having simple push
notifications in 2009 or so right all
that it would be a text message and then
we moved on recently if you look at this
one on the Left right this is a lyft app
and it's pretty much the notification is
almost app itself right which is showing
you where your nearest cars are you
gives you a gives you a way to book your
car right from the notification itself
it gets really complicated and on the
right you see a shopping cart experience
where you are basically getting a coupon
of something that you might have already
seen in a at a certain place right so
these are really engaging notifications
right but if you you know much more than
that right notifications are all about
personalized content you know you can't
just be sending no division come look at
my app again right it has to be much
more than that
so things have gone and gone to a level
where you see this notification here
right
the UI is is all about you know engaging
your customers with something they have
already seen in the map for example
right so in this use case right imagine
a person having come to a particular
store
have this visited this page multiple
times now if you want to re-engage with
this customer you probably want to send
them to the same page all through a
notification right now maybe they'll get
back to your app and buy the product
you're showing out here so these are
interesting user experiences but really
hard to develop right these are things
that you probably have to go and write
native code for and most of our
enterprise customers use Cordova and its
developer intensive tasks right until
now so what we are announcing is push
templates so in notification templates
the some of these things can be pretty
so what we would do is we'll build these
push notification templates for you
where you would come in and you would
select a template and just configure it
and this all these templates well just
like all our other artifacts with her
we'll have a life cycle so you'll be
able to have revisions or you know
versions of these so in effect right
let's say you come in and pick a camping
and start configuring your template you
would just go ahead and pick the
pictures if you choose to and configure
all right all of it right here and then
you use an easy-to-use
you know engagement experience build an
engagement experience for your customers
but over all right all you need to do is
integrate with our sdk right and you can
trigger off all these notification
notifications directly from your sdk and
if you choose to you can make it all
dynamic and you know you use custom code
to change all these pictures and all the
elements that you're seeing on the
screen right now and then send all these
push messages and multiple formats now
you're not limited to a couple of
templates right you have ten or fifteen
templates that you would be able to
choose from and you know more or coming
so that's about push templates but you
know when you think about all these
notifications you also have to think
about analytics right so we have the CX
a multi-channel a user insights
platform now to collect understand and
engage with your customers one of the
aspects of things here is being able to
improve the customer experience using
data that you already have so let me
take you to a phenomenon analysis here
so when people use a shopping app again
you know they come into a certain place
and they are interested in buying
something and they put something on the
shopping cart but for some reason or the
other they might just abandon it right
so this is a typical thing that happens
and what you do there is you need to
find all those metrics for targeting
those currently targeting those
customers so in this case what we are
showing is we have defined a funnel we
have you know we have the results of the
final and then you could drill down and
look at it from a perspective of a
particular country or a region and you
could say okay this V let's give out a
personalized campaign for these set of
users who have come to this page but
have stilled abandon their shopping cart
let's give them something personalized
right and then you would set all these
campaigns and send out personalized push
messages that your configured using push
templates so that's the that's a beauty
of the platform here right so you're
able to use the siRNA lytx build out
specific campaigns and you're able to
segment your users and target them and
have a personalized experience basically
so you know does anybody have any
questions or anything they'd like they'd
like to talk about here yeah okay I'm
open for questions later but let me talk
to you about something that we've built
on connectors we have a wrist based
connector and we've always had that but
now we have enhanced it with swagger toe
2.0 so the thing is with with all your
apps right they're not just going to
depend on one single API you you built
out an app at sourcing multiple other
API is public API is sometimes to get
information and
onto your app now for for most you most
programmers this is not something very
very new right but what we have done
here is given you enterprise-grade
connectors that that scale enormously
and you're able to use the right
security policy all from the get-go and
it's all built-in right so let me give a
quick demo okay this is our mobile cloud
service platform and you know you you
are you're able to get into this
platform by asking for a trial you can
go to Oracle cloud and get a trial
version and get this going so let me
show you the connectors page here you
know there are a few configured
connectors already I'm gonna pick one
and walk you through those so what I'm
doing here is I'm just you know putting
an API name for a connector and then I'm
going to pretty much a fully built out
platform where you can put in details
and it just you know very if you get
stuck you get hints on what could what
could be round and you could change that
so in this case you're looking at a
particular swaggered definition from
Oracle documents cloud service you just
throw that in here and then if you some
of these varga definitions need user
name and password you have the option to
do that in this case we don't have
anything like that
so moving on and once you have the
swagger definition n you get all the
endpoints at this fag that the external
public API survey shows you and you
basically can get hold of all these
descriptors right in one place right so
you base if you have something that you
want to search for using the descriptor
file right you could basically search
for let's say like folders right and you
would get a bunch of these
and descriptors that that have that
particular time now now why is this
useful right you know it's really
difficult for us as developers to go and
read a lot of documentation and it's a
simple an easy way to kind of go and
configure your connectors just by going
and looking at what is already there and
just trying it on you know so in this
case what we are doing is basically
document cloud service is a place where
you would have folders and files now I'm
going to go and select one of these
folder items and I'm just going to go
and test that end point out so next step
here is security now we have a bunch of
policies security options that you get
that are pre-built for you so you don't
have to really muck around with writing
code for it
so all these policies are available so
you in this case I have selected a basic
auth essence SSL client policy and I've
already have you know a CS FK that I'm
going to use for this particular demo so
the next step right let's just move on
to testing these endpoints right so here
you would see that I have these two get
n points here and right now what you can
see the descriptor is already providing
you some help on how you would use it so
there is a folder ID here and then it's
saying that you know you can use if
you're at the top level you can just use
self just to see what's inside the
folder so let's try that out so I'm
going to pick an end point and a mobile
backend to go and test this out
I have already configured that so I'm
just going to test that end point and
let's look at the response that I get
right so this is a JSON response what
you can see here is there is a folder
inside the stop level which is the
Oracle OpenWorld 2017 demo folder and
there is an ID for it here so let me
grab this ID here and I'm going to run
this
or run this and find with this new ID
now I want to see what's inside the
folder that's what I'm getting at so
once once I have the idea in I'm just
gonna go test identify it one more time
and this time around what I'm getting is
here it shows that there are two files
inside the folder and one of them is
something that I want to go and display
later so a vortex file and I also had a
picture here somewhere let's see yeah
and there's a jpg file here so in my
case right and I just want to go and
look at what's inside this text file so
you can imagine that you would be using
in the rocks cloud service you would
host a file and you'd want to show that
in your app right so you would be
configuring the connector that connects
the Ducks cloud service and pulls out
the data and sends it back to you
through an API that you have established
inside in CS so what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to take the ID of the file
right here and I'm gonna use that ID to
download that file so I have this out of
the gate here which is gonna help me
download the file and just go ahead and
throw that ID in and run the run the
connector one more time right so
basically it worked and let's look at
the request you know just to see what
the what's happening here so it's a
simple game right and it shows you the
entire you know entire endpoint and it's
also showing you the beer or token here
and when you look at the response you
see that it worked let's say hello
conference attendees and welcome to open
one so that's the demo right so the idea
here is to show you that it's an easy
thing to consume a swagger
you know the swag and swagger
specification and B is able to connect
to back-end systems it's simple to do
that
so any questions here for me yeah so I'm
available with Harvey here and that's
pretty much the crux of our presentation
and you know just as a summary of things
that we did today right we started out
with talking about MCS we talked about
you know different pieces of MCS where
we fit in the past and how you would
really engage with customers with
notifications we showed you notification
templates we also showed you how you
would easily configure connectors to
connect to other external api's and you
know get get your data back using the
swag respect so we are going to be here
for some time so please feel free to
come back and talk to us thank you
yeah so if if you guys are interested
come visit us at downstairs we have many
demo parts we are demoing BOTS today we
even have an interesting VR AR app to
show you so just come on down and we'll
talk we would love to talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
