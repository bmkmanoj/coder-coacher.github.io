report Mel software and we're the makers
of snapcode this is snap coding for
education and snap code is a brand-new
free ide for education and I covered a
little bit of this and the keynote this
morning but we just had five minutes so
there won't be much rehash here but the
the basic story is is that we started
teaching a class in our kids middle
school and so there's some really great
educational tools out there there's
scratch and there's blue jay and there's
green foot we were actually inspired a
bit in the last couple of years there's
been some wonderful educational sessions
here talking about the the tool set to
use to do that kind of education and so
we started down that path and the thing
we found is that our goal was to teach
real java programming in a modern way
and so those tools have been around a
little bit and with all the changes in
client technology and the new java
effects and new silent programming that
they are still kind of in a swing world
scratch has even older than that it has
a proprietary rendering environment I
think and and also we found that it
wasn't even necessarily teaching Java it
kind of teaches scratch script and we
wanted something we could build on so we
found after a few weeks you know
scratches was a beautiful way to get
started but after a few weeks we had to
throw that away and move to green foot
and so there were a lot of new concepts
and I felt like you know that through
the kids and whereas just starting with
green foot put you in the in the
position of having to deal with the
semicolons and balance prices and kids
have an amazing propensity to to add 18
extra brackets at the end of a method so
so we were kind of inspired and then so
our background is my co-founder and ice
started at Apple in the 90s when
actually next if anybody remembers when
Steve Jobs was in exile and the one
thing that next did really well was
developer tools and Apple of course has
that tradition now from from those next
days of having interface builders and
then so so our day job the thing that
pays for snap code is report mill and
report mill is a is a reporting tool but
it's also got a user interface builder
hidden inside of it that we use to build
rapport mill and now we're using that to
build snapcode and so snap code is
actually just a separate entry point
into the same report melts or space even
though what report mills is still a
swing application snap code is is the
world's first pure javafx IDE and so of
course being in javafx we get a lot of
benefits of graphics and animation and
so our goal with snap code was to bring
together the best of all those tools
that we can get the kids started in a
visual environment and snapping causal
puzzle pieces together not having to
deal with syntax errors and really
separating the concept that that a lot
of people get intimidated by programming
they think you know what we do is magic
and that they could never learn it you
know and yet anybody who's you know
who's told their kid will go across the
room and you pick up those toys and you
put them in that box well you've done
some programming there you you separated
out the instructions from the syntax and
and so really this visual programming
gets you there that kids immediately
understand that all i'm doing is is a
you know telling a character on the
screen to move and to turn and to pick
something up and you can do that before
you get into the the semicolons and the
balance braces but the thing that we
bring to the game is that at every step
they're in a real IDE so it's kid
friendly it's got big icons and then it
doesn't have a lot of
extra features on front to confuse
anybody and it's awesome my train of
thought there but so you can you can
create the code you drag in those puzzle
pieces and you can switch over at any
time and see the Java and so so so
either in a real IDE so one day when
they eventually get to NetBeans or
eclipse it's all going to be familiar to
them and and be at every step of the way
they could drag in a puzzle piece and
throw the switch to see the Java codon
and I'll show that in a moment and and I
would encourage people to do that you
know as frequently as possible the kids
should you know should always see that
that there's really no difference
between a puzzle piece that says move in
a line of code that says move open paren
close paren semicolon and then and then
we also have where when you run the
program it pops up as a separate process
so so they they and the files they
create or Java files and they'll see
their resource files for images and
sounds things that I don't think are
complicated and that that mostly get
done for you but but not hidden from you
and I think in this way the developer
tool you know isn't it facilitates
programming but it's not a crutch and
after starting with a visual thing that
there's very little that kids have to
unlearn from from from having that feels
facilitated feature but I'm going to be
pretty informal here we had a booth this
week and I was the only one running it
and I
I'm a little frazzled from that and from
the the keynote and such and all the
hacking that we did to make as much of
this work as possible before the
conference today but but let me show you
some much more depth than we did in the
keynote today so in all so this is the
website the website is very simple if i
click on snap code it'll take us to the
snap code there's a download page and
there's the exe and the dot app so it's
a it's a native executable you know
nowadays there's a lot of in browser
programming tools to learn nothing that
I can find its Java so everything I've
seen so far is JavaScript or some of the
scripting languages and again you know
to me if you're going to spend a lot of
time teaching them to program you want
to feel like they've got a real language
when they're done with the effort and so
so these download and they're nice and
they're self-contained they're only a 50
megabyte download and you're running the
full IDE on your desktop so I having
done that I'll go ahead and launch nap
code and so it's got a very simple
welcome panel here and so right off the
bat we can just type in my project for
nor click the new button for a new
project and give it a name and already
had one of those let's call this test
two and in a bring up snap code and so
this is all job FX and the the paradigm
we're going for in the UI is like a
browser so there's a you know as they
add resource files and source files they
can page forward and page back they can
always get back to this homepage here
that has a lot of helpful items on it if
they mess up a source file beyond repair
and they haven't saved they can hit
reload or refresh here and to run their
process they can hit run
the swans are going to start buying by
clicking a make up a new studio project
and this is the kind of the scratch like
environment that gets you started very
easily and I should mention that in
addition to the visual programming with
the puzzle pieces there's a full sprite
kit in here and so this is a very you
know nice basic way to learn you know
really at the core of any game is a
sprite kit which is where you can create
a new sprite or a new actor and it'll
have methods to move it across the
screen and to turn it and to remove it
from the screen and so we all have all
that in there very similar to scratch
your green foot so i'll just say add a
new actor and we have a few of them
built in here we could also work with
our own just grabbing an image off of
google images or something of course
these are nice because there are pngs
with the transparency in them but i'll
position this guy and and so in our
project just by adding that cat we get
the source code for the cat and by
default with a studio project we get a
scene for that cat to live in and by
adding that cat we get our first line of
code added for us basically to add that
actor and but with a cat I wouldn't
switch over I was encouraging to go to
Java regularly so I'll do it myself but
the class here has a constructor so when
the cat is created we can put in custom
methods here there's a main method that
gets called one time after the cat is
created and we can do some robotic
instructions here and then there's an
act method and this is really like the
the basis of any game or animation is
that on every frame of the animation
this act method gets called and we can
update our sprite or our character so
I'll switch back to snap code and I'll
just go ahead and drag in move by ten
here and i'll hit the Run button and so
just like a normal ID it pops up a
separate process and it gives us a
console
background and just like we'd expect
that act method is getting called over
and over for each frame of the animation
and off the screen the cat moves and and
then as I also showed this morning just
a simple rotation now drag and drop in
set rotation so on every frame I want to
set the rotation to and here's a line of
code that I can just drag into an
argument so instead of rotating to a
constant value I'll have a rotate to get
angle between the cat and the mouse and
then this is our this is our first game
so the cat is chasing the mouse so so
this is our visual equivalent of hello
world not that I'm advocating skipping
hello world but but but this is
certainly a way to engage the kids I
think a little bit of instant
gratification but as as was kind of
pointed out at the session so with this
code the cat when it gets to the mouse
it goes crazy the cat never expects to
get to the mouse so it's it's a frazzled
and it's basically falling in on itself
every time removing 10 past it so I
might put in a block like an if
statement so all lets the drag and drop
in my if here and and i'll put the
statement so if the distance to the
mouse i'll drag and drop that in is
greater than 10 then I want to move by
10 and that will fix that problem and
actually I didn't mean to delete my set
rotate to the mouse
you know so now that cat is chasing the
mouse and when it gets to it it's just
going to stop because it's it's a closer
than 10 pixels from it now and so
another common part of at least
programming tools that I learned when I
was a kid is pen graphics and so this is
basically in the same sprite model so
there's some pen methods down here get
pan and bend down so in the constructor
when the cat first created i'll have it
just do a pen down and then on every
step of the animation i'll have it set
the pen color to random and so we have a
nice little string model for colors so
off the bat we don't have to bog them
down with the JavaFX paint class color
we can just say the name of our caller
and so i guess i'll pop over the java
code here and so again we see in our act
method the set rotate to the get angle
to the mouse and if the distance is
greater than 10 there's our if
conditional with our move by in there in
the set pen color and so i'll run that
and so now as the as the cat chases the
mouse it leaves a nice trail behind it
we can pause the execution of the
program or the animation really and
start that we can set the frame rate
higher so that the cat chase is faster
so there's a lot of fun things we can do
there so another thing that we found in
programming in the class is I felt it
was important to do some console
programming that the games are fun but
but to me the kids need to learn to do
something relevant and really that's
kind of the the over-riding theme I
think of snap code is to help kids get
to relevant applications first I think
that's what made programming fun for me
when I was a kid is you get your Apple
too and you'd turn it on and there you
were two basic prompt you know and and
you could write a program that would say
you know enter in the
the sale price and and you could
calculate a tip you know and your
parents would walk in and say oh my gosh
that's actually useful and but nowadays
the kids they get off their xbox with
our immersed in a 3d world and they they
go to write a program and there's no
gratification because it's it's not
useful and I think paradoxically
command-line programming can give you
that because in my son's middle school
what their science class has already
taught them that distance is equal to
velocity times time and so so it's very
easy to write a program from the console
to calculate that enter in the velocity
and the entering the time and i'll tell
you how far you've gone but all that is
to say that there's console programming
in here as well so again i'll drag in
and actually i'm going to go ahead and
put in another block here in the in the
main method for the scene I want to have
a while block so this is something that
I want to go just happen over and over
again and and I'm going to drag in the
console so the scene has a console
associated with it and so the methods
the puzzle pieces are context-sensitive
so if i have the scene selected we see
all the methods for the scene here and
with a cat the actor similarly if i
select on it we see everything that an
actor can do and so if i click the
console this is just returning the
console it's kind of a no-op all by
itself but with it selected we see what
a console can do and so we can do our
print line well maybe that's obligatory
will will drag in our print line hello
world and run that well I'm just going
to go on and on so it's printing our
world for us over and over but what I
really wanted to show there was I want
to enter an input string here and so the
console was asking for an input string
and the parameter is the is kind of the
prompt and so i'll change that to say
enter color name
and and then below that I will set the
console color there it is
oops
and so so so of course all this is
brand-new we've really just got this
working in the last few months so I
think it's time goes on we'll figure out
how to do hopefully as much as possible
visually but I'm going to drop in the
Java code now because what I need to do
is I need to take the value from our get
input string and stuff it into a
variable and well and I guess I actually
could have just embedded it in that same
line of code but but but let me spin
this as a feature you can go into Java
code and write some actual java code to
show the kids that as well so but here
I've declared a variable and put the
value from entering the color name in
there and we're just going to set the
color so this is the background of the
console so again I'll do a run and we
still got our cat I let him run off to
the side but at the top we have our
console and so I can enter in a color
name red and green and blue and silver
and I misspelled silver light pink light
light blue so there's a couple of
modifiers in there I think even random
will work so you know here's where we
could we could write a lot of basic
console programs you know one thing
again when I was learning how to program
it it really was a free ticket a lot of
times because so many people didn't
understand programming and I can
remember a number of class projects
where in a literature class in eighth
grade I wrote a program to ask you ten
questions on Shakespeare and and then it
would just grade you and of course
everybody else worked on their project
for two or three months and and I
throwing together in 10 minutes the
night before it was due but that's the
basis of a console program you know it
was just a console program back there
where enter in you know question a and
if it's you know true
add their one to their score if it's
false they get nothing so console
programming I think is should be an
integral part of teaching kids to
program and also a very fun part and as
I say paradoxically it helps them build
relevant programs that they can apply
maybe to their science class or building
quizzes or whatever
so I you know I guess as as this puzzle
thing gets built out it's kind of a it's
kind of a situation where we don't
understand the solution until we the
problem until we work on the solution so
I think I don't quite understand their I
don't quite have a good idea yet as to
how to model variable declaration I mean
I suppose it'll be as simple as creating
a puzzle piece that maybe let you choose
from a can set of types and then type in
the name I mean we will actually so I'm
now to the point where I'm building
snapcode with snapcode so I one of those
projects in the Welcome panel is was
actually called report no but it's it is
report Mel and snap code and it'll load
up any source file I've got but but
really we can only deal those puzzle
pieces are very well matched for method
calls and so you'll see in some main
complex programming files where we've
just punted but but but I feel like well
as time goes by you know and again I
think there were so many good good tools
out there that invented this stuff
scratch and Alice and google app
inventor but but since they really kind
of had their own programming languages I
don't think they were very inspired to
you know to model switch statements and
an other kind of more advanced
programming structures so I think we'll
have an opportunity to figure out how to
do some of that stuff graphically
alright so so let's see from there i'll
go ahead and show so this is really one
thing that we're i guess we're really
going to focus for the rest of the year
and we in the run-up to java one we were
really we were hoping to have a few of
these ready but we did get one working
and more importantly we have the
framework for these exercises and this
would be kind of self-paced learning and
there's so many of these now that these
apps on iOS where you play them and they
have challenges for you and if you do
them correctly you get achievements and
you get badges and that seems to be you
know very gratifying way to keep people
engaged in an application so so we're
kind of putting together a simple way to
build those so that we can create them
quickly and actually they're helping us
fine-tune our sprite kit but also this
would be something that the teachers
would be able to do you know or even it
would be a good assignment to not just
create a game but create an exercise
that would help kids learn but just by
opening up this this exercise exercise
one it brings up a our exercise
instructions here and it tells us about
our dog Sparky and it gives us a grid
here that's five across and and Sparky
wants to play fetch and all he knows how
to do is move pick up ball turn around
and drop ball and as it turns out he
knows how to do four loops let me get
rid of those but and then below the the
instructions we have a list of all the
puzzle pieces that we're allowed to do
that with and so and and then what we've
done here is we've broken down the the
whole program into a set of tasks that
they're supposed to complete move to the
ball pick it up return to start drop the
ball and turn around and so I wouldn't
collapse these so we see the
instructions and our skeleton and
I'll just drag and drop these in there's
our for loop and a move so I know this
will get us our four steps across the
screen to the ball and then i'll go
ahead and say pick up the ball and turn
around and i'll move a couple of times
and and then i'll all the show that i'm
stumped and i'll just go and hit run and
see how well we did and so execute the
program and he goes cross-screen he
picks up the ball and he
so you know I'm also I'm lead programmer
but I'm also ahead of the the graphics
and effects department so those were a
little painful but you know but and so
basically this is a simple programming
assignment but it's also a unit test and
you know and I guess that's another
aspect is all these things will be will
be hiding that they would see in the
real world or maybe hiding in plain
sight you know that that here they are
running this is a separate process and
they have their lists of process in the
lower left-hand corner here and they're
getting all their java files and they're
seeing all their resources and they've
got a project manager just like a real
ide and they're kicking off the separate
separate process and and then we've got
this built-in unit test and and so this
this is untested in a classroom
environment well maybe we should go and
finish our assignment I'll finish moving
I'll turn around i'll drop the ball
we're out of puzzle pieces hopefully
they're in the right order picks it up
all right so and then I guess in
addition doll that we have this this
browser environment and so so every app
that you run by default comes up in a
Java browser and so this is you know
very much an equivalent to to a browser
and I think the theory here was that for
the longest time son tried to push this
idea of Java in the browser and I think
in reality the real model should have
been let's put the browser inside of
Java you know southern rather than
having Java just run as a plug-in if the
browser had known about Java to begin
with we would have had all the access to
Java and since HTML is really just like
an image type it would have to be made
more sense to have it just be a feature
of the job of browser but so this has a
real URL in here and I guess for
instance let's see I'll find one of our
images and I can just change the URL
here to instead of kickoff of the
playground class will have a go to
images balled up P&amp;amp;G and and so it loads
up the ball and if I go back it'll go
back to the you know to the game we can
page backwards and forwards and if we do
a refresh it'll basically you know
reinitiate our program and kick it off
again you know so again they're learning
real programming
and and I think our insight here was
that so many programming kits you know
even something modern like javafx so
have the as its corner stone of its UI
windows and to me the the essence of so
many modern applications is really but
browser-based I mean even when we're on
our iPads we're basically going from
scene to scene to scene and a good
architecture for a lot of apps is to
encapsulate those functionalities and
their own classes and basically page
through them so this really puts them in
that mode and we can easily with one
line of code like if this when this
finished at the end of our checker we
could just tell it to go to exercise too
and that would show up inside of this
panel so there's there is a model for
browser programming that you know that I
feel like educationally would get them a
long way to understanding you know
they're they're more likely to use that
than they are bringing up new windows
and also they don't have the overhead of
you know learning something like that
they're not likely to use for a while
that was kind of a confusing aspect of
Swing I think so so in addition to that
I'm going to create a new project here
and so so we you know we're kind of
going down the road of you know trying
to get all the important parts of an IDE
in here so we you know we do we want to
tie this to a cloud and we've already
done it to Google App Engine about where
we've torn that out and we're going to
look at Oracle cloud now but it there
we'd be able to to do some basic version
control and again you know like the kids
by default they would create their
project and it we get saved to the cloud
then they could go home and they could
work on it when they're finished they
could commit
they're their final version to the
teacher and the teacher could check it
so that's that's all kind of down the
road type stuff but we do have all the
infrastructure for that and let's see so
I'm going to go to a server I'm going to
try to go to report mill and if the
internet doesn't work then we'll just do
it from the file system but i'll just
type in a URL for our server here and i
wanted to go to asteroids so good pulls
it up so these are all the files on at
report melcom for asteroids and so this
is actually a green foot project and
with a little kind of a small glue layer
we can emulate all the green put a P is
on top of our sprite kit and of course
green foot is swinging and Java 2d but
this is all pure javafx but i can i can
take this i'll go ahead and say update
and it'll show everybody every file in
the project wants to be updated but it
pulls didn't pulls it down and so again
this would be something where you could
set up a bunch of samples that you
wanted to work from and they could just
type in the URL to get the original
version of that but so here's our class
all of our classes and we can pop over
and look at this in snapcode and so you
can see some of the places where we
punted here these are like expressions
when I guess I should show this that
like when we select a line of code in
both snapcode in the job editor on the
bottom here we see the kind of the path
of the of that that this is an if
statement that is inside of a method
which is inside of a class and as we
click on each of those it highlights the
the different piece there and then the
same thing from the Java code that if I
select a method we have all the features
of a modern Java editor code completion
and syntax coloring and symbol
highlighting and occurrence
highlighting over here on the right to
pop over quickly and searching but again
you know here we have a method ID inside
of a method call inside of an expression
chain which is inside of an if statement
a statement block a method declaration
the class declaration and then the whole
file and and that can be kind of handy
to to just understand the structure of
their other program but they can ignore
that until they're comfortable with that
concept but as a green foot project the
green at the center of the green foots
world is their world class and for this
asteroids game it's its space this class
space that renders the background of
asteroids and holds the asteroids in the
spaceship and so I can just double click
on that and in fact you know anything
you double click in the in the file will
be launched and this is really because
of our let's bump up the frame rate and
see how quickly we not here I can't get
it to go higher so let's see
yeah so even in the in the designer here
or in the project editor if I double
click on an image file it actually
launches this image file as a separate
process in the browser and since it's
not a class it doesn't you know kick off
the class and get the application
running it'll actually just render it
and again that shows where it's real
easy to create links and navigatable
applications without having to deal with
windowing without having to create a new
window and pop that up but so there's
several of these on the website so we
can go with pac-man as well report
milcom / examples / pac-man and update
files again
not yet I have a couple of these demos
or are already videos on our website so
they show that URL you know in fact if
we see if we just remember report melcom
/ examples there we go so that's a
little simpler so just going to report
milcom / examples will show us all the
directories currently in our examples so
there's also a simple mario game there's
pac-man there's a job FX render bug but
i found that i submitted to their bug
tracker i can't remember what radius
does nothing it's just two images uh so
anyway but we have pack me in here so
I'll just double click on the intro and
kick off that one so notice is the URL
changes here you know so it started out
on the intro which was which is its
model as a green foot world but when you
set a new world in green foot with our
emulation layer it basically sets that
the new URL for the new class so that
this is a really nice example that one
of the
greenfoot people did I'm going to get it
back real so let's see yeah so in the in
the back in the ID here you know we do
have a debugger and of course this is
something that you'll even ever you know
co-worker that that you know so I think
a lot of kids get out of school now even
out of college and they don't even know
how to use the debugger the way you
debug is print line right but you know I
feel like well that's a important part
of Education and debuggers are so easy
to use and they're also very informative
so that's why I think it's a great
feature for an educational ID to have a
real debugger in it but we can you know
just like a normal ID ouch well we'll
see what that does I I I tried to set a
breakpoint there and I will kick off the
debugger yeah and so it basically tried
to load up our intro here and it stopped
at the first line we have a printout of
the variable so we can do a little
exploration here so this is our our
intro class and it's a world object and
it's got an image for its background and
a paint order and in x and y but but
there's all the variables and if there
are objects themselves we can navigate
into them we can type in expressions so
let's see you can step forward here and
an expression I might just change this
guy to see so we'll see what the color
is and so just typing in that see we see
that it's a Java odd color and although
this actually when it gets set it gets
converted to javafx color since all of
our sprite kit is in javafx but anyway I
can kill that but but but I do think you
know that that's part of a you know if
you were going to teach a
old class and programming you it
probably want to get to it sooner rather
than later but certainly by the end of
the class you'd want to spend a week on
on way here's what a debugger looks like
and here's why it's the something you
need to learn how to do so also
client-server programming is a big deal
and so so I created a servlet
application here so in my project
browser if I click on the top level on
the project just like a Java file will
show the Java file in the browser here
if I click at the project level we get
our configuration so I earlier I
configured the server when I pulled down
a project but the basic here we can
reset a homepage if we don't want the
default helpful homepage we can have a
specific you might have a readme file
for your project you can figure that as
the as the home page and our building
source directories and we can drag and
drop in jars so we can use external
libraries you know maybe we want to use
this to make a robot using mindstorms or
something I haven't actually tried this
but I look forward to it but we'd have
to pull in the jar for the you know to
talk to the CEO a serial port to control
the robot and so I just pulled in a one
of the easiest servlet containers are
really web servers jetty and and there's
a simple class here that kicks it off
and i created a stag servlet here with a
get method that will return any file in
my application and a post method that
will save a file into my application
that's probably dangerous and and then
my tests are but this is actually report
milk code so this is what most of our
our day job customers so using this just
loads a template of for a report and
loads a data set for a report and it
runs the report and slams the the gets
the PDF bites and slams it into a
response so if I kick off this
server it'll kick off the browser over
here and and show our report in the
browser so we can move on from you know
from all the simple visual programming
we can eventually get you know at least
give them a taste of real programming
because in real life they're not going
to get to do that fun stuff we all know
that servlets so so there's also a UI
builder in here so let me create a new
project call this test three open that
up and and I'll say create a new file
and so here's where we create new files
so by default we can create a the most
common would be to create a new Java
file but we can create a javafx you I
file here or a swing you I file or a
data table or report no report but i'll
say a java programming file I mean a
Jedi want a UI file i'll click ok and
i'll just call it untitled and i'll hit
edit here and so so this is our designer
and it lets us you know design graphics
so we can create a box and put a color
on that maybe with a gradient and drop
shadow and but we can also go to the
gallery here we can drag and drop in a
button and a slider and a text field
and actually i'll do some simple binding
here i'll bind the the value of the text
field let's see
okay we managed to break that somehow
all right well let's just go ahead and
save this and we won't we won't get to
see the slider updating but but I say
that and close that and so so now we're
seeing the job FX version of this and if
we double-click on that you know we
actually have some real you I in here
you know so again in the interest of
creating a relevant application you know
that this would be like when Greenfoot
they can make the cat run across the
screen but then they can add a slider to
you know set some some value like the
rotation of it or something and let's
see I guess the final thing I have here
I'll go to the home page and there's a
data table and this is actually
something else we broke in the last sin
in our rush to get all this graphical
stuff working somehow we broke this the
homepage you date a table let me try it
from here
yeah son and and we'll get this fixed
pretty quickly but but this would be
where we want to create like an address
a bunch of addresses so i could create a
contact table and actually I didn't mean
to close that data table I'll call it
addresses instead and then I'd might
have a few properties like name address
phone and I'll just click ok and so it
creates a table for us here and they're
all collapsed right now but we can add a
new record so you know right off the bat
the kids can learn some basic database
data structures or creating a database
without having to configure a separate
database and we can do some import the
data here and I'll have a bunch of
addresses I'll select all and I'll copy
those and I'll paste those in and
they're in here they're just all
collapsed and I'll say import and so now
all those addresses are in a flat file
database inside of their application and
there's a there's some buttons here for
auto generating a form and auto
generating a report and that would
create some UI this is broken too but I
can I think if I save it it will show up
refresh project try reloading it
alright well let me just say that's a
future feature okay but but but I guess
what I'm saying is that you know in fact
I was struck by a talk I saw recently
where they said blue jay has like two
million users a year but the average
time that somebody uses blue jay is 90
days you know so what that basically
tells you is that you know it they get
started they learn all these concepts
they get familiar with a tool and then
they have to switch and and that was our
experience with the scratch and green
foot is you know just about the time
they got comfortable with that tool they
hit a wall and they had to switch and
they had to unlearn they had to relearn
and and so you know what we're hoping is
to build something you know that that
not only get them through a semester and
through a year but get them through you
know potentially you know several years
of programming increasingly advanced
programming classes and and who knows if
we can stay one year ahead of them maybe
they can use this in the real world when
they get out
so and and that's pretty much all i had
i appreciate you guys putting up with my
it was more of a demo than a
presentation uh-huh but but we really
are working hard to you know to get this
out there is totally free report mills
paying all the bills and and we just we
just want people to learn to get alike
we want our kids to learn how to program
yeah go ahead I'm sorry you were first
hmm you know I i I'm not in the least an
educator I you know I have a great
respect to now after having tried to
teach this class you know I think I had
some good ideas but I would love to hear
some input I suspect if a real educator
tries to use the product that they'll be
educating me as much as the kids uh-huh
right yeah so I so at the let's say at
the front of the you go to report melcom
we got two big links here the second one
is snap code and there's a big download
link here and those top two that that's
the dot exe in the dot app
all right i mean i would say you know
what i am the world's loneliest
programmer I work up and outside in the
boonies in Dallas outside of Dallas send
me email you won't be bogging me down
and my emails well pretty much every
email on our website report melcom comes
to me supported report mill Jeff a
report million poet report mill so so
send me that you know hopefully I'll
figure out what will get the source code
out somehow we're kind of working the
source codes all tied in with report and
Mel right now maybe we'll just post the
whole thing we haven't quite figured
that out but but I don't know anything
about open source I don't know anything
about github or bitbucket or whichever
one would be the best to get this stuff
out there but but certainly by the end
of the year we'll figure that out uh-huh
I'm sorry go ahead and no beer
yeah I would definitely like to to
figure that out i mean i think it should
be simple right now all the strings are
hard-coded but but our UI model is is
very simple it's all xml files so in
theory if we if we just and actually we
have one line of code that loads the UI
so it wouldn't be hard to to put a point
in there that would say load a language
bundle you I instead of the the UI
that's right there so I did and you know
after this morning's keynote a couple
people came up and asked me about enters
an international offered to help uh-huh
so yeah you know I if there's so many
things that that I that are on the list
but I think that would be a great one so
I did to send me a note and i'll bump it
on the priority list huh well so some of
my son is our oldest and we started when
he was 12 but my daughter said in on
those classes and did them to and
actually then she's she was nine at the
time you know i think the the puzzle
piece part i mean maybe you know for
four six seven eight year olds you just
wouldn't worry about the Java I that
wouldn't be awful i think just just do
the puzzle pieces so i think if we had
enough of those exercises that would
keep them engaged you could create a
nice little week-long class or longer so
we'll just have to see how that falls
out uh-huh
wait
for that
we're bright yeah you know I mean the
only thing the only advantage I have
from an educational standpoint is it
takes me a long time to figure something
out and so I remember the pain of
certain aspects of it but but I'm the
best thing that could happen to me is
for a real educator to you know or
multiple to start giving me feedback
because I'm sure whatever I did was more
or less wrong you know I guess I'm a big
fan of learn by example eunos once you
gotta you know page a code that does
something you know doing 10 things that
are similar to that or easy you know so
it in some weeks we come into class and
I'd have no clue what to do I would just
write a simple program a little game or
a little console-based program a quiz
and and I would just pass it out and I'd
say everybody just type that in and it's
because actually when I started we on
the trs-80 before the Apple we got a
magazine every month called soft side
magazine and my brother and i would type
in those programs and and I had no idea
I was learning out a program i just you
know that was how I you know that was my
xbox and my cartridge or my CD was
typing in those programs so yeah so I
really didn't answer your question you
know it's up that that you know it to me
that's the easiest way to get started is
to have you know some exercise and you
could be as simple as having a one page
program that they type in yes
Yeah right actually I didn't I did mean
to show that so that's what we really
wanted to make this available for other
people to create them you know so if you
look at the files in the project it's
all there and and so when this project
gets loaded it changes the homepage to
this this exercise page which instead of
it let's a three pained page that has
the the skeleton of the class that you
want them to modify and the the readme
over here and then the puzzle pieces and
so this this object you know this thing
right here is really just a text file
and I can say open it in a text editor
and and so this really just has the
puzzle pieces and and then so it then it
loads the in this case it loads the dog
class as the framework know it loads
Sparky is the framework and and and so
they only other the only real pieces are
the read Mees and so the readme is made
inside of here with our designer so you
just create a new read me javafx file
and and just draw your instructions and
in this case we have two of them if you
ever read me and read me more because we
found that there's there so little room
that you kind of want to give the the
picture what they want to work on and
the full instructions but give them an
easy way to get that out of the way and
of course if they don't need the picture
they can get it all out of the way but
but so the pieces are just the two
readme files and then this text file
that has the the lines of code that they
would add and then all the other Java
files or any support files you needed to
make that game or animation work oh
right there's checker so so at the end
of the after all the instructions have
been then called checker gets called
and and so really it has like a let's
see I think there's a method called or
is it yeah it's hard coded so right now
there's five checks but it for each
check it asks for the for the string
where does it fill that in well so I
guess it so anyway the checkered class
gets called and it really just walks
through the five different checks and
that's all in this one method so check 0
is did Sparky travel to the ball which
is a bully and I said inside of the
Sparky class did he pick it up is
another boolean you know facing the
right direction I can just say a
Sparky's rotation equal to 0 and ball
fetched is it I can ask is the actor at
that first cell a ball yeah so the
checking is simple too so we're of
course we need to refine this a little
bit and then document it but but I'm
confident that it's pretty simple to
where we could get a lot of people
creating these exercises in a short
order all right I want our one more
well so I had pieces of the Java editor
for a while and the database stuff which
isn't really about relevant right now
it's been two years probably on the on
the real guts of the IDE and the in the
visual graphics the visual puzzle pieces
oh but like I said well we've been we've
been building these developer tools the
other ones and a lot of it actually is
built on on report mill so report mill
and report mills hidden UI builder share
our a big base with the with snap code
so we weren't really starting from
scratch no pun intended
alright well thank you guys so much for
honor for your patience and showing an
interest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
