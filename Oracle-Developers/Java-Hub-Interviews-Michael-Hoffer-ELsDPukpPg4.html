hello everyone I'm David Lopez for
JavaOne and I'm here today with Michael
Hoffer who was a featured speaker at
JavaOne a computer scientists at the
Goethe Center for scientific computing
in Frankfurt Germany a co-founder of the
digital brain Factory and a developer of
VR else to do a visual programming
environment combining visual and text
based programming Michael thank you so
much for being here today how are you
yeah thanks for the invitation yeah I'm
fine
how are you great very excited to have
you um so if it's my understanding
you'll be doing some 3d printing at the
conference yes like last year where I
started to do 3d printing with a simple
Ultimaker printer I do this year with a
better printer which is laser based
printer and we also show some software
for creating 3d geometries on how you
can programmatically create them in a
literal programming or tech space
program in the environment so it's
exciting do you happen to have any of
the 3d printed parts that you made up
yep
so let's see yeah so these were a few
ones we printed last year so pretty
simple geometries but actually they make
sense if you see this robot here and
we're going to extend the robot for this
presentation so you know look all the
white and orange parts pants when he
printed and here you see some some
electronics and this is just a Raspberry
Pi inside which is kind of the brain of
the robot so the base and the wheels are
3d printed yes exactly the base and the
wheels are printed and then I see some
some connection parts which connects the
the upper breadboard and the rough a
pile and you see the universe with poly
folder oh wow does it snap into that
yeah right so you don't don't need to
any kind of screwdriver or something
like that yeah and then we have even
more exciting parts and
something like this oh wow and that's
flexible it's yeah it's flexible and
printed in one go so just one piece and
I really like the complexity of these
parts because it would take you ages to
create a thing like this and the print
up just print it in maybe a few hours so
that's really really interesting I think
oh that's amazing so is that sort of
where 3d printing is pushing right now
making flexible parts like that yeah not
only actually this is something that you
can do with printers that are quite a
few years old but I'm interested in
creating geometry so this whole thing
was created by using a Java library that
I created or you can just define the
geometry and then you can change
parameters and change the sizes and
spacings and so on and you can change
the base with the shapes like you could
use squares instead of triangles and so
on yeah and also all the other parts I
showed for the robot are parameterize so
if the recipe pie changes in size or you
want to adapt it for a different board
then you can just rewrite the code a bit
and generate the geometries and yeah so
I think 3d printing has a lot of
applications make communities and so on
but also it's in scientific applications
it's a huge improvement so what Reed's
sometimes do is we have reconstructed
geometries from bones so we get that
from
medical imaging applications and then we
can recreate the whole bone structure
and we can use that for presentation
purposes or even for doing some crazy
simulations could you walk me through a
bit of your design process when you go
about these do you do additive or you
morph subtractive start with bigger
shapes and then carve out from there
yeah so you mean the design process of
the geometry
of the geometry yes okay actually I use
an algorithm that's called constructive
solid geometry where you have like
boolean operations you can create
intersections you can add two geometries
and subtract them or you can trade the
hull around those objects for example
and then out of that you can make
basically anything and then you just
combine those parts and that's also one
application for the visual programming
environment that I developed at the
center because we use it for creating
complex simulation workflows and also
for training the workflow that
visualizes process oh yeah and maybe I
should just show it to you does that be
VR else to do exactly so the basic idea
is actually that you can create a user
interface automatically for any kind of
Java class
so if you write Java on this case movie
source file then usually you have to
create your own yeah the user interface
on as always we start with the hello
world program and if I click compile we
create instance I created an instance
inside the file of a drum machine and I
came directly invoke functionality so
here you have the hello method and here
is the visual representation and of
course we can also do that with the
geometries so here we just define a few
notes in space we're going to define
finals and we can visualize that
instance I also get a visual
representation of my source code I have
interactive access to do the geometry on
this is really a huge improvement over
tech space program because here you can
really see what you're grading you know
so you have in each with immediate step
you can visually
inspect the results and I mean most of
your mistakes you make are instantly
clear if you look at them but if you use
a reactive a debugger for example in
regular IDE and most of these problems
will never you can't track them because
most of the stuff are not tracked by the
environment this is for example a
geometry that I create so here I have a
base geometry just a cube and then you
see another cube which is basically just
more or less a plane and then here this
is something that I added why the
application is running so I can open up
this editor and here you see the source
code for creating and copies of the same
object and yeah place them around the
circle and then here is so called
difference operation so I can create
these holes here so that's how I create
all the geometries that you saw earlier
and then at this point it's principal at
this point it's basically printable so
you have to do one additional thing you
have to save it as a so-called STL or
obj file which is just text or binary
file describes the geometry then figure
to the the printer application and the
print application is just just a regular
print screens or you can adjust quality
and stuff like that and you can choose
different materials depending on your
printer and then you can just save it on
an SD card or directly to the printer
depending on the model and then yeah it
just prints basically so but this is how
you could create your own 3d geometry is
really easy and for for one of the
sessions we not only use this for 3d
printing but also for creating
emulation of a solar system presumably
our own solar system so this is just a
Java X application and here is the
interesting thing is that we not only
realize the interface of one class but
we utilize the whole control and data
flow of the source code so what you see
here is also an application that creates
a 3d geometry and if I run that you
instantly see all the results but
instead of the things that I did in the
mural studio which is currently still
swing based here I'm able to just load
some some source code and get instant
feedback here on the utilization so I
can change stuff here let's zoom in a
little and what you see here is I can
change this parameter for example - like
0.5 and it also automatically updates in
the source code so and you can change
the implication order and things like
that and if I run it again we see that
this has changed and of course I can
also change it in the source code as
usual but the whole thing here is and
also yeah kind of my research topic is
trading if you're programming
environments the directly mapped to -
source code so also if I select stuff in
the editor you also see a selection in
the control flow window and also open up
some some other things like this
historical thing here if I run that so
it's it's slightly different than the
previous one it's tourism in you can see
doesn't create this circular structure
so we have n copies of an object in yeah
so that's that's kind of what what would
you do in the sessions we look at how to
create such applications for printing
for simulations and in the other
presentation
- yeah look at the robot and how to use
3d printing for creating your own robot
projects and also there we will show
this user interface or programming the
robot and give it some behavioral like
rank objects for example or avoiding
them things like that okay so you're
running two sessions at JavaOne outside
of the java hub like doing 3d printing
so one of them is creating amazing
visual programming environments with
JavaFX yeah and that's the 3d
interactive solar system simulation you
were just showing us right so this is
one application but what I was showing
right now was the also the 3d printing
library but we will apply that to two
different domains one is simulating
stuff and one is creating geometries for
3d printers or other purposes and so
yeah there the idea is to explain how to
to map source code to a visual
environment and have it synchronized
both ways so if you change the source
code the visualization changes if you
change the visualization the source code
changes and all of that should should
yeah work instantly so without the lag
or something of course it might take a
few seconds for compiling but you don't
have to restart the application
everything is done at runtime and also
we're looking at instrumenting the
source code so that you can actually
create events for all the invocations
and then you can feed that to the java x
visualization so yeah that's that's one
second and actually the previous
sessions I gave last year and the year
before were kind of preparing all that
because they're I I showed how to create
interactive 3d visualizations for tribe
of X and last yeah also explain briefly
how to visualize language models so like
visualizing programming languages in job
of X and this year we're going to
combined all those things into into one
so that we get a functional programming
environment cool and your other session
is called pixie box creating a
programmable object tracking robots is
that the robot that you showed at the
beginning of that yeah yeah so this is
actually also we started with that robot
it's called pi on wheels and then we're
going to extend it with this this pixie
cam you can see here and this is a
camera that does all the object tracking
on board so I can really just grab the
coordinates of the objects it tracks and
then feed that to the Raspberry Pi so
you don't have to do image processing
yourself so everything is done by the
camera and for that robot we also yeah
show a visual programming environment
and as this is a buff session we are
going to discuss different possibilities
so we're not showing off just a finished
kit or something
it's yeah something cool people do you
define object tracking for us so object
object tracking is basically you track
that objects in the boundaries of the
camera so it just gives you coordinates
and says here is object with color ID
one for example and you have different
object like this blue one and this red
one it would say on this coordinates
there's the red object and here you have
a blue object for example so you can
kind of get the this media information
and then the robot could for example
move into the direction of one object or
avoid the other things like that
well all that which is a like a
Raspberry Pi and a camera yeah and then
we're going to connect that to PC or Mac
Book and then yeah you can kind of
control that and my idea was to create a
robot project that uses 3d printing so
kind of motivating schools and
universities to adopt the technology
because this robot is really
cheap if you have a 3d printer and if
you buy a printer for the University
then it's really makes sense for people
to to create their own things because
the plastic is really cheap so the wheel
here is you can make all these parts for
under one dollar so it's really no money
and the only thing that cost you some
money is the Raspberry Pi and the
electronics here but it's not much so
that's why I started with a self-made
robot and of course you can attach that
to different robot models yeah I noticed
you're still using a breadboard have you
solidified the circuitry so far or is
that something you're still claim with
yeah I just play with that because as I
said it's not it's it you do it yourself
thing and you change that because you
make different experiments and for me W
makes sense to kind of finish the
circuit lay layout because yeah I I
changed that everyday cool it's
something new so yeah yeah that's sort
of the process the prototyping and the
fix the fix the pics yeah and all the
whole 3d printing is about prototyping
actually so if you're really sure what
you are going to make and you need like
thousands or millions of these pieces
then you wouldn't do that with a 3d
printer but if you kind of change the
geometry all over again and make like
three or five objects than a 3d printer
will you Excel said yeah this is what
the 3d printer really does and here's
another really nice example that we
might show the java hop and this is a
part for a drone it's a drone arm you
would place the engine and then you as a
whole for four cables and so on and
actually my motivation was to to create
it is light wide as possible like a
bird's bone with some structure inside
and
is a bigger piece I don't know if you
can see but inside there is structure
that holds the the the inner pipe and
the the outer boundary together only
very few pieces and this is closed in
the finished model and you couldn't
create such an object with like milling
and drilling and so on because it's it's
completely inside the object and there's
no hole out of this year you know this
is completely closed and when you fly
the drone actually I have also the drone
here I don't know if I bring it over or
yeah yeah so just like the robot this is
a completely do it yourself thing
nothing is really finished but it still
works it's our version of the Amazon
drone so it delivers its own box with
your own cart inside and you see the
inside also very chaotic but the drone
still flies and it's also not very
difficult to build such a drone and of
course if you are not a good pilot than
things break but you can replace them
with yeah when I when I go on vacation
and take the phone with me and go flying
then I just take like ten parts of those
and print them in advance and also these
parts here you can just stick them
together
so that's amazingly simple yeah really
simple and and still I mean I I made
different versions of this drone and
there is yeah this is really also a good
use case for the java libraries i
created because you can shrink the drone
just change parameters and say okay my
engines are a bit smaller and the inside
the radius should be smaller and some
things like that and
then you can just reprint the whole
thing in a different size or you could
change the layout in general like I did
so this was a different version of the
basic structure for the drone and then
you could just add the drones drone arm
like this and the cool thing is you're
happening if you have it in Colditz it's
really not difficult to just change the
shape and then you feed it to the
printer then you wait a few hours and
you can take out your new drone you just
have to assemble it then this is really
really fun because also these parts
which are very complicated
I mean creating the source code yourself
and then holding the result in your own
hands completely automatically this is
really really fantastic because yeah we
do a lot of mathematics and everything
is your ethical but at this point we can
also further the bone reconstruction
algorithms I explained earlier you can
then really apply that algorithm print
the part and then you hold it in your
own hands and this is really yeah it's
just it's it's special you have to try
it yourself and this is all on display
at the java hub right yeah exactly we
will show the software the Bureau studio
version also the job of X software and
we will also show the robot and Steven
bought a new printer like like this one
behind me which is a resin and laser
based printer it can print objects like
this one Wow
and this is a rather big one you can
also print the same object smaller and
that's all one piece yes that's all one
piece and this is a support structure
that you should remove afterwards so
here I did that with a smaller one I
didn't just to show the difference and
here I have a really small one I don't
know if you can see it but it's the same
object and so yeah you can really do
really yeah amazing things with the
printer and also you can print bracelets
and stuff like that so I should say
these these geometries were not designed
by me that are just samples that came
with the printer but all the other
things were done with Java software
that's amazing so Java one attendees
definitely don't miss the Java hug I get
a chance to see a 3d printer in action
and then is the source code all
available to attendees yes of course
otherwise I think it's boring so you get
all the stuff you need to do your own 3d
printing and simulations and things like
that also for the job of X session you
get all all samples and everything -
yeah try it out for yourself yeah well
thank you so much for doing the
interview yeah thank you as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
