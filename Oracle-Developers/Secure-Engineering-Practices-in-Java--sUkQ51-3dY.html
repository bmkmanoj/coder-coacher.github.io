my welcome to the first day of Java one
San Francisco 2013 this is a talk on
secure engineering practices for java
and i understand the talk is being
recorded so i have to kind of stand here
at elekton which is not my normal way of
speaking so i apologize if you're kind
of behind a pillar the rooms not laid
out too great so you may just here yeah
a talking head as opposed to seeing
what's going on and it's important
disclaimer which I'll let your speed
read from IBM and I'll start by
introducing myself so my name is Tim
Ellison I work at the Java Technology
Center for IBM based in early in the UK
I've been doing various kind of runtime
developments in small talk and Java and
so on a currently technical lead for IBM
Java rate and 7.1 and that's my email
address there if you if you want to get
in touch with me so today's talk is
about secure engineering practices I
kind of wanted to start off by
explaining and what is meant by secure
engineering practices really and and to
try and differentiate between secure
engineering and other types of security
so when we adopt secure engineering
practices intention and the goal of
these practices is to achieve this
higher level of assurance around the
software that we are shipping and the
system is that we're shipping and the
software assurance that I'll explain as
a talk goes along is different our
assurances about the safety of the
software in which we're shipping is
different to the controls that we use to
achieve that level of assurance so let
me draw the contrast security controls
are sorts of things we put in place and
you'll hurt you'll hear talks about them
during the conference about the new
features it appear
in Java to do with how code is being
signed or how we're adopting the latest
encryption standards and so on there are
all types of characteristics that you
can bring to your software which will
give you some level of security some
control around the security of that
software and of course it's not only the
software itself where is the environment
in which that software runs so there's
no point in having a very secure program
that's running being run by people who
are not trustworthy or on systems which
themselves can be compromised and here's
a definition which has been taken from
the national information assurance
glossary and who you know as I said
described security controls as the whole
sort of life cycle it's a management
operation and technical controls for
information systems that protect that
protects and those things are important
for us in terms of software security so
obviously security controls are very
important aspects of building secure
software systems software assurance in
contrast is how confident we are that by
adopting those controls and the entire
lifecycle that the entire system itself
is secure so it's a it's a measurement
of how confident we are in the security
of our system and so again lifting from
the glossary Software Assurance it's a
statement of the level of confidence
that it's free from vulnerabilities it's
the assurance level that we can have
that the mechanisms we're doing is
giving it some safe software and why
that is important is because IBM and
other large companies see a quite a
evolution and change in the way people
are looking for procuring systems and
running their systems in lots of
different types of environment so
clearly you know software has been used
in places where lives can be at risk if
the software does not behave correctly
they need to be secure systems entire
businesses can collapse if their
software systems are compromised and/or
there's a level of control and
collaboration between various companies
and also be severely compromised if if
the software is subject to any kind of
security attacks now here we go backup
software is running
so as the market for software and
computing services evolves people are
looking for some level of assurance that
the software that you are delivering to
them is safe here's just a tiny speck
you to read the eye charts here this is
a quick kind of scatter plot of IBM's
vulnerability teams incident they have
seen over 2012 and are listed by the
date across the bottom and and then
different colored circles as to the
severity of the type of incident that
was seen and color-coded by whether it's
kind of like SQL injection or a denial
of service and that kind of thing the
details are not important what what is
important is you can look at this and
say we are subject to a lot of pressure
to ensure that the systems we deliver
our safe and secure because people are
out there trying to find ways in trying
to find mechanisms by which they can
determine how to game the system and how
to get advantage of this particular
software and so secure engineering is
addressing these sorts of problems so
then the question kind of arises well ok
if I understand that I want some
software security assurances how do I
measure that and it's not an easy answer
right it's it's a revolving state when
we talk to customers and we talk to
suppliers and they are requiring these
assurances that the software we produce
meats recognized published security
standards and there's a variety of those
things to choose from that the company
itself has a history of providing
security fixes and updates to the
software whenever they reported either
publicly or privately that we react to
do those and that as software tools are
available that can scan the code or
check a deployed system that the
software we produce in the software we
consume has a good score against these
kind of tools and again it's a whole
suite evaluation as to how you determine
what's good on that but also people are
looking to see how IBM and others
actually develop their software they
want some information about the process
we go through to develop a software to
show that we are serious about security
and that the mechanisms we have for
security flow all the way through the
life cycle and produce something which
we have a high level assurance about
safety and security of that system so
there are no overall standards that you
can sort of everybody will agree to it's
a bit of a hodgepodge it depends on who
you're dealing with us to what level of
assurance they're looking for and what
the particular measure is that we'll use
to give you that assurance and it covers
all these different sorts of areas but
it's definitely a very key factor in
software that that we write so as we
engineer our systems for security there
are two key points I'd like to draw out
the first key point is that security has
to be there right out of the box
everything that we produce and the
solutions we provide has to have a
reasonable level of security in its
normal configuration as soon as it's
installed it has to be kind of safe by
design okay it's not something that you
put in later and also that as we go from
release to release when we're adding new
features or fixing defects in some of
the software that we are taking security
in mind as we do that so the software
evolves from release to release we need
to be improving the security are not
adding any regressions in that respect
the second main tenants here is that we
have to be very proactive so whilst we
can go through all of the engineering
practices to try and assure ourselves
that software is safe and secure when
there is an incident that has to be a
mechanism by which resident is handled
and it has to be done in a very timely
fashion and proactively address any
threats which may have been raised
against these systems and to achieve
that to achieve these high levels of
confident a confidence in the in the
safety of the system
it's not a point in time on a single
point in the process action it's
something which has to be built in from
beginning to end all the way through
development process all the way through
and very few people are writing software
that don't depend upon third-party
libraries or service providers or other
kind of inputs into the system so all
the way from the do the supply chain of
things that you're taking in through the
development process where you're adding
the extra value and building the system
and then out into the deployment
lifecycle there are aspects of secure
engineering which permeate throughout
the entire process so just to do a quick
kind of scatter through them and what we
need to do is throughout that process we
need to use tools that are appropriate
and practices which are appropriate to
the system which is being developed now
appropriate in this sense means
something which is going to be dependent
upon the type of system that we're
building clearly there is a different
level of safety assurance you need for a
system which is handling critical data
and something which is available openly
on the Internet to something which is a
tool which you're writing for a limited
period of time to be used by the work
group and trusted individuals so it has
to be a proportionate response in terms
of what you're going to do it's also got
to be very relevant to the risks and the
threats that you see that would be
applicable to the software that's being
written and so here again a kind of
scatter of various tools and techniques
which you would apply throughout
different phases of the entire system
development and I don't intend to go
through all of them because it's an
entire talking its own on each of these
different boxes but you know within IBM
and I'll surely in many other companies
and you're looking for building
highly Sheard software you have in the
supply chain review processes so if
we're taking in things for open source
and a lot of our systems do use open
source software we will be scanning that
software and looking for any issues that
we can detect in that and also we're
looking at the pedigree of some of this
software or finding out where it came
from him who wrote it in some throughout
the development process and life cycle
there are key points in time at which
you'll be doing specific types of checks
things like manual code reviews of the
code that you're writing and analysis
and so on but there are also kind of
foundational fundamental things which
always done and you know that you see
the gray box at the bottom here with
multiple areas coming out it clearly
having a good control over your source
code an object code and is just a
foundational part of producing secure
software you need to ensure you know who
has changed your software and why they
changed it and then all the way through
out to the deployment so they've kind of
dotted blind boxes out on the right-hand
side show that even after the software
has been written and it's been deployed
out onto the service there are still
aspects of what you do there which
require some feedback into the a surance
process for monitoring the logs of the
software that you've got and scanning it
and perhaps even black hat trying to try
to hack the software yourself see if you
can get into it and find out why it
since ago so I wanted you to start with
I'm calling it like an anti-pattern and
yeah the way to do this is not just to
treat security as a testing issue at
that point in the life cycle which
you're going to be testing your software
so join development I've drawn a kind of
traditional waterfall method here and
i'll use that as an example they kind of
applies to two different ways of
developing software as well but if you
are in the mindset that security
something that we're going to test for
and make sure that we can't find any
vulnerability
that point the code is written by that
point you're way too late in the process
even with the best tools that we can
find you know we're expecting to see
something like only about fifty percent
of the known types of vulnerabilities
being detected by tools and tests at
that point in the process and then you
have to go back and you have to see what
the impact of those changes also going
to be on the design of the system you
can add a very long lead time to the
overall development process by only
finer things so late in the process and
so that's not the way to address it and
what we do is we've broken down the
development process into lots of
different sort of themes the same can be
done in in the different end phases e
the supply chain and also in the
deployment but for the purposes today
I'm going to just focus on the
development practices there are a number
of tools and processes are described
earlier and these things fall under
various broad categories the kind of
outline in these boxes here so I don't
just go through them quickly and then
we'll take a deeper dive into these
different areas the first thing is to
understand what the risk assessment and
threat model is for the system the or
building so risk assessment is as we
spoke earlier what type of system are we
building what are the sort of issues
that we expect to be challenging that
system and what can we do about that the
security requirements so again SS a
system which needs to be highly secure
secure coding so once you've got a
design for your system what are the
guidelines you need to adopt to ensure
that the design is accurately reflected
in code and how do you manage that
security testing yes definitely is
important you know I said don't do that
as the only thing that you're adopting
is part of your security testing and
security assurance response and that's
certainly true but it does form an
important part of the entire department
process security documentation
you know an aspect that people often
don't think too much about but it
advising the users how to use your
software securely and incident response
so when things don't work out right you
need to be able to deal with those and
across all of that is having the proper
education and awareness in place so that
everybody that's involved in the entire
project lifecycle understands what the
goal of the system are you don't want
different parts of this process you
don't want different people who are
participating in that process to have a
different view of what the assurances
that you're aiming for in the systems
that you're building and likewise our
project planners have to build software
assurance into their model of how
they're going to be delivering the
software it has to be a measured
response to the risks and threats that
you see because in the end of the day we
have to deliver the software so let's
take a look at the the risk assessment
and threat modeling so here the goal is
to identify what the risks are for this
system and ensure that software product
that we're developing and deploying kept
can minimize those risks and threats so
first of all obviously the first thing
to do is to identify what the risks are
and what risks are important to to that
particular software that that we're
building and then investigate them and
create a mitigation plan sounds simple
right so looking at different types of
risks and here I kind of broken it down
into various areas so you know there are
technology risks are things which are so
inherently a tissue weaknesses based on
the maybe the hardware that you choose
the programming language that you choose
and the technologies that you use
anything which could be used there to
increase the risk of an attack against
the system and the actor risks relates
to the people who are involved in the
interaction with your systems and this
could be served
is as well as kind of individuals so the
interaction between various people and
the system can introduce risks because
people may not interact with the system
in a way which you had designed and
intended it to it data miss handling if
your system here is managing some kind
of business data for you then there are
a whole number of risks and which relate
to the integrity of that data so first
of all yes are ensuring that the data
itself is coherent but also if it's if
it's personal information or private
information there can be sort of legal
implications if you make that
information available outside of the
system now so there are there coming
some pretty high risks here and again
that's part of the threat assessment and
the mitigation that you'll be looking at
this risk and saying or what happens if
you know this data is available how do
we do backups and then sure that the
backup data is is maintained in a way
which is not lead to any data loss and
policies and processes here you know in
an ideal scenario you'll be following
some well-defined processes as a
software acts upon the data that you
have and following these kind of
scripted flows and ways of working not
all of a highly predictable and in fact
you know people may end up choosing new
paths through either just because it's
something that you hadn't thought of at
design time and they're just driving the
system in a way you hadn't anticipated
or as I mentioned earlier as a system
evolves and people want to do new things
with it right reading these systems
through the different states could end
up breaking some of the assumptions
which were made earlier and some of
those policies and processes may no
longer be as applicable the business
risks are things which are going to
directly impact your business and so
clearly you know ensuring that things
are
a measured and the response to the risk
is appropriate to the amount of risk
that your business would suffer should
that come true and then as I mentioned
at the end sort of the project risk is
the fact the realistic fact that we have
to ship this stuff so it all has to be
proportionately so there are various
different ways in which you can evaluate
what how these risks apply to your
particular system and how you're going
to look at all the different risks
you've identified and microsoft a kind
of quite active in this area and they've
published what they call a stride threat
model and a number of papers and tools
around this particular model which you
can use and and you can go through and
it'll take I don't know something like
20 to 30 hours of working through the
tools and describing the system in terms
of the model to come out with a risk
assessment for the for the system that
you're building this is one particular
threat model there are a whole bunch of
the ways of which you can evaluate the
risk and so I just use that as an
example all right so kind of move along
we've got that we understand some of the
security requirements for the system I'm
going to do that nice and early in the
process we understand what what is that
we want from the system and we're
identifying the risks join the design
and we're prototyping things and we're
figuring out you know this is how we
need to interact with our users it's
going to require secure connections this
is where we're going to store our data
we're going to require some encryption
at this level and this is how the
operator is going to interact they go to
login information you know what's the
right level of logging that we don't put
private information into logs but
there's enough there for four people to
be able to accurately diagnose any
threats etc etc so all the way through
the system join the designing of
prototyping you're constantly thinking
of the software assurance and then comes
a point where you're
you're coding this thing up for real and
at this point you know you should be
looking at best practices for design
moving the design into the coding phase
so the whole bunch of kind of aspects
around reducing the attack surface of
your system to ensure that's minimized
and people have you know that the least
possible opportunity to come an attack
system and following a whole bunch of
principles and again yeah ensuring that
as transactions and threads run through
the system that they have the smallest
amount of privilege that they need to
accomplish the operations that they're
doing and that as I mentioned before
security in depth and defense in depth
are built in that into the software and
in so you've done this all the way
through you'll be documenting and
describing this and at the end of the
process you will have something which
you can share with people who are
consumers of the system and also share
all the way through with the architects
and the designers and the testers what
level of software assurance you have for
your system and that again everybody's
on the same level everybody understands
what is expected of the system so let's
talk about secure coding here we've got
our design we figured out what the risks
are to it and what we're trying to
achieve and now we're kind of at the
coding stage we want to embody this in
some Java code well even when presented
with a good secure design there are
plenty of opportunities for people to
end up putting defects and aspects into
the code which themselves could be poor
in terms of security so working with
developers to ensure that they
understand what is required and the
developers themselves are educated so we
talked about education being something
which spans the entire life cycle of the
project there are plenty of resources
for developers to go off and look at
there's the might of top 25 and the
OWASP top 10 risks to systems
which developers should be aware of and
developers need to understand different
concepts around trusted untrusted code
now when you're taking a data from the
external users that wasn't be thats
painted data so you know if you if you
look at the top risks that we have the
SQL injection was still pretty much top
of the list so developers need to be
aware that they need to neutralize all
the external data as it comes into the
system etc etc and the team and the
application must handle all these
different concepts correctly and embody
them in the code there's kind of a shout
out for Java right here because this is
something which has been considered
during the Java rate time scale as well
and there are new annotations which you
can add on to data which you consider to
be tainted and some of the tools that we
can then use to go and look through the
application and see if tainted data is
being passed into calls and places where
from your design you're considering it
to be safe and that can give you a
warning and you get a lot more
information from these tools and then we
had in the past if we're using these
tools or we're doing code reviews and we
find out that there are some departures
from those standards then we kind of
have to evaluate how serious that is so
what's the severity of the failure of
course this could be during development
time in which case you're evaluating
these and your thresholds are fixing
could be pretty low if you already
deployed this out into a system and you
have a bug report come in or you've had
an incident and you've tracked it down
to particular area of code then you know
prioritizing the severity of it is very
important to ensure that you're fixing
the right things so how else are the
consequences of this particular omission
or oversight is clearly and an important
part of the evaluation and the
likelihood is going to be at the floors
going to introduced by violating the
rule
and how expensive it to fix it it's some
obscene that you find a test time and
it's an error which has been introduced
there which is very expensive to fix and
you may choose to disable some area
functionality or work around it in a
different way the secure coding is a
very important aspect but it's just one
aspect of the entire end-to-end system
of secure engineering so I've mentioned
a couple of times already so I'll just
reinforce it it's important that
everybody is sharing a common view of
what we're trying to achieve in this
system so we've got our code we're not
testing it just at the test stage for
security we're feeding that advice all
the way back upstream to the
requirements making sure that the
requirements are modified it turns out
that we have a new part of the system
and the design team also understand the
security advice so once we've done that
we would expect to get fewer code
vulnerabilities flowing in through the
system and found by test you know
probably still only finding fifty
percent of them in tests but there
should be fewer to find in the hot in
the enormous when it does come to that
security testing well as everybody knows
you know numerous people have pointed
out that finding a defect and fixing it
later in the cycle is much more
expensive than if we get addressed it
earlier so you want to give your testers
some work to do but you need to have
addressed it as soon as you can and
using the threat modeling you can give
the testers some good information on the
types of risks that you have assumed for
your system and where you think the
particular vulnerabilities are that need
to be addressed so you're going to use
your risk assessment and some tools and
some manual based testing to probe and
try and evaluate the assurance that you
have your system over things like
breaching access rules so again if
people not using the system in the way
that it was intended to be designed for
bad actors and people sending malformed
information
and then all they do things out of order
you know the testers should be able to
try and find some way in and untested
security system that way that's the sort
of dynamic side of it from from the
threat model statically will be running
tools over the code checking that it is
adhering to those coding guidelines and
using the tools to see if the code that
we've written has a dear to the
guidelines and that people are following
the best practices we do that using some
automated tools and we also did it by
manual code inspections and again the
amount of effort is put into that the
types of tools and whether it's manual
or not depends on the particular
implementation the area of code and the
type of system that we're building when
it comes to running the system and
dynamically testing it will tend to do
the SQL injection attacks for anything
which takes user input there's also
fuzzing and penetration testing you know
lots of ways in which we have of sending
information to sort of web-based
applications to try and find out whether
we can bypass that and the whole suite
of tools that we use to do that in terms
of documentation we said that all the
releases that we have should be secure
by design in a default configuration and
that's fine and that's something which
clearly the testers will have some level
of focus on to make sure that occurs and
but it's also very important to be able
to describe to the end users into the
operators about how secure system is and
what the impact is of changing any of
the configurations you have full system
so these have some very clear guidelines
often you may find that security
somewhat contradicts usability in some
aspects and again that has to be
explained to users in that you may want
to increase the security of it we
comes at a particular sort of cost but
it's important that when you're
describing to the end users all the
information about how configurations
effect security is really kind of
spelled out and you may have to do that
in more than one place I think it's
important to have a security document
which explains the safety of the
individual system all in one place and
talks about how people can use the
configuration to make things more secure
but also to describe that in the
individual sort of functional
documentation and people are trying to
achieve particular tasks so to give
examples of that when when changing the
configuration to allow things like
backwards compatibility or demo accounts
that sort of thing you know it has to be
kind of made very apparent people what
the impact of that is on the overall
safety of the system likewise using
templates and scenarios where you can
show people you know if you are using
your app server in an external facing
environment then this is a sort of
typical configuration file that you will
need these are the enhanced securities
that we would expect and we have already
disabled any kind of guest accounts or
demos and that kind of thing because you
just don't want any of that to made
available externally and if things don't
work out quite as you have planned then
you know you're going to get an incident
report and so you need to plan for that
very early even after following all of
your secure engineering practices yeah
all this forms part of your engineering
practices in general establishing the
communication channels very early is
part of this security incident response
so you know what's going to happen is
you're going to get some kind of
incident report coming in from an
external source that says that we found
a vulnerability and they may well say
and we will pub
in 90 days publicly or something like
that that's not the time to try and
figure out who need to know about
information all the way back up the
track you need to bring together the
coders and the designers and the
architects and the project managers and
to be able to deliver a fix successfully
out again with an appropriate response
depending upon the type of incident that
you have received so getting those
communication channels established very
early means you're not scrambling around
trying to find out who needs to talk to
whom and so we end up with teams inside
IBM who are product security incident
response teams who have contacts down
through various products and people are
on the hook to develop that kind of
policy and plan around incidents so yes
we have to plan for lots of different
eventualities but clearly you know some
things are happening more frequently
than others and so you know there are
some levels of almost expected types of
vulnerability that we're going to see
and we have a faster path for how we get
those things through the way you're
going to find out whether you have an
incident is as someone's going to tell
you about it or ideally you ought to
figure it out first right so as part of
the design you'll have established a
means of detecting these incidents or if
somebody comes to you and tells you that
they've done something you should be
able to verify that and so again having
tools having enough logging designed
into the system that is showing you what
is happening with enough detail there
you can go back and verify what people
have told you and/or proactively you
know use data analysis through the logs
and figure out there is an incident that
has occurred it's going to be very
valuable once you have received the
information we're going to prioritize it
again based on how important is this to
the business that we're doing is this
something which is related to
confidential information is a legal
briefs that we have is it a business
impact that we have
is it a breakage of the system which can
just end up bringing our system down
temporarily and or is it cover knit you
know they're filling up the log files
faster than we would like them to and
we're wasting disk space like this
there's got a lots of different ranges
on which we can determine the priority
of the incidents that we have and and
then recover from them and then on a
regular basis looking at those incidents
and going back and learning the lessons
so again it's a communication channel
all the way back through the coders the
desires project managers this is an
instant we saw this is why it occurred
doing the analysis on that and learning
lessons from it so we can design systems
better in the future so that's where
education and the environment comes in
it's that positive action that we
maintain all the way through the full
system lifecycle and showing that
everybody has the same sort of
information as everybody else and saves
all information that you know the
adversary's would be using as they as
they currently investigate our system
I've taught as I said at the beginning
I'd rollick a very sort of waterfall
type flow here of how systems are
developed and with agile you can
certainly see how these different
aspects of risk assessment would be done
very early in the agile process the sort
of requirement stage and then you'd be
doing secure coding and testing at each
iteration all the way through and then
as people look to trying you know
compress and make even that more
efficient with the DevOps style I think
he is interesting challenge here as to
how we ensure that the assurances that
we have around the safety of the program
are not compromised by the sort of
turnaround times that the DevOps are
looking at and the quick turnaround that
we have the shipping this summer so I
won't talk to all these different
aspects here but again spice to say
there are lots of different roles
that people on the team have and how
that relates to the secure engineering
so and it with a quick summer here the
security but security controls who talks
about at the beginning no the metal is
that we use to to make the system secure
and the assurances that we have for the
systems that we are producing for people
they're both very critical and very
important parts of the software that
we're producing the vulnerabilities that
we're having in the system has changed
the focus from just focusing on security
controls to to looking at the bigger
picture you know the risks that we have
and if you heard Hilton speak this
morning you know part of his role for
the Java is seeing how the bigger
picture the risks appear and he had a
chart which showed it was kind of a much
higher risk in the deployment areas and
it is in some of the server-side
technologies and it's a lot of the new
technologies which are being brought out
in eight and beyond will be addressing
where those main risks are in the
software to build the software however
you know it's not just understanding the
risks it's designing all the way through
the entire development lifecycle and the
things that we design coding and
integration make sure we get those
critical business process and workloads
correct the development seen themselves
have to be educated and so growing
skills in analyzing risks and threats
and definitely forms important part and
using the appropriate tools of the
appropriate point there's a quick plug
for an IBM red book so this is much more
exhaustive description of the secure
engineering process I've had to give a
very high level view but if you go to
this URL and the team in IBM who work on
secure engineering frame work full time
they've produced this red book in a
series of read books and it's
specifically on this topic and it goes
into a lot more detail
so I'd recommend that that's all I had
