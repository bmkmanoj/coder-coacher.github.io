off the mixer
there's no switches here
check check all right Epic's it it's big
Jewish begin testing testing say it
again
testing testing testing we can just move
the mic in between us sure that kind of
works well do we need both was it gonna
be you know mine works I think this was
I think this one I think this one was
working as well right okay after you go
back there
I don't see you create new source No
yep
so stop
still going I don't remember how to stop
it yeah
so I have to press the red one
okay so preview broadcast
phones off will it taste
okay
we did
do I send it
right the left
so it's dreaming right now
I'm not sure
I mean they're both blinking
should have a hand puppet come after me
hi I'm Melissa thorn with the Oracle
developer community here at Oracle
OpenWorld 2017 and I'm sitting with
Christopher Jones can you get over I
have things like that and you're giving
a few talks today we have a bunch of
folks in my area so I'm technically the
product manager for data access one of
the data access groups so we have talks
on really interesting things such as the
this is really interesting actually it's
the Oracle met layer of connectivity
between anything such as an application
of Python or your financial application
and the database okay so anybody who's
interested in optimizing that tech stack
should come along to a session later
this afternoon and I've got some links
later in the slides which will let
people find exactly what I'm talking
about and of course we've got some cloud
stuff going on as well you know this
there's a lot of interesting cloud
obviously from users and from us push
and pull and we've got some talks there
on connecting to the cloud today we've
got a lot of interest in Python got some
Python sessions coming up during the
week a lot of node Oracle sessions
coming up today I'm going to speak a
little bit about surprise surprise as
you can see on the slides node oracle DB
some general optimization tuning
sessions which would pretty much apply
to a lot of these languages because
they're all very similar in letting you
access alpha beta base from a
programming language they have very
similar functionality capabilities
accessing PL sequel accessing sequel lot
of nav optimizations with caching
results so you don't have to do too much
network traffic backwards and forwards
and anyone who's interested to look up
all of your sessions and the summaries
can do so on the open road website where
we have this session catalog so there's
still plenty of time to register and get
in to check them out and it's great and
you're ready to share some slides
yeah I am I made a little bit slide base
today so I just thought I'd run through
a couple of things so this is a kind of
cut down munch of a couple of the
sessions which we've got going on but I
wanted to give a little bit of an
overview so node Oracle DB is a Don for
node Oracle databases
sorry I'm now confusing myself with
people around me no don't really means
the add-on for the nodejs ecosystem let
me start with a safe harbor statement
people at the article conference
probably know this well I'm going to be
speaking about some open source things
dates are a little bit unpredictable so
don't go and make purchasing decisions
based on anything I say BIOS up there
you can pretty much fine if you start
looking for that Gigi HRD which is my
twitter handle but in the old days when
Twitter was young and my friends were
all getting single-letter twitter
handles I thought nobody was using this
thing so I just chose some random string
out there which was G HRT now probably
means something else but anyway that's
that's a handle that I tweet on so the
group that I look after looks after
these api's and some of them are
proprietary api's into the database
you'll kind of recognize the Java JDBC s
these are things which you make
available they're all sort of standard
and free and out there
capi is the Oracle call interface OC is
that that I like an Australian a or an I
I don't know with my Australian accent
like ah where that comes across I then
we've got some open source drivers out
there some of these are in the I've been
sauce places such as github the HP's on
that the php.net web sites and there are
some which we kind of contribute to in a
sort of a question/answer way the Perl
Ruby rust and go they're all drivers out
there that people using those languages
can access Oracle database the word
driver is kind of word we use here in
Oracle people also know it as api's or
interfaces things like that
Melissa can I do a quick shout out on
the Ruby people I mean you know some ot
Enochian has been really good for
developers so ruby community has two
really key people out there who have
become Oracle aces this year very
recently so Takahiro
Kubo looks after the rubirosa
rubio c88 extension which is a core
layer for the ruby language to access
our of a database and yes Johan de looks
after the Ruby on Rails adapter on top
of that so a lot of people use Ruby fire
Ruby on Rails
those two key people have been really
key totally out there techie people out
on github answering questions creating
content
longtime maintainer of these things it's
just you know I go home I kind of get
paid for some of this most people are
doing into their spare time for a long
time I just really really so they're on
the oracle website my computer's not on
them and I haven't gotten up there but
on the Oracle a site you can find them
so thank you very but yeah so Honda we
would really do from Oracle appreciate
your efforts for the Ruby community but
I had a decide so nodejs people still
coming up to a booth throughout a demo
both here at open world you can hear the
harm in the background everybody's
around it is a an environment which
pretty much has its own network file
system interface so you don't need like
a web server to run it you write a
programming node which is a JavaScript
engine writing in JavaScript language
you can listen for requests in the web
from sockets FTP and sane responses back
so its own little generator there used
by a lot of places has been become very
popular in the last couple of years how
this fits with the Oracle stack for
people who don't know say this we still
sort of think of it as a sort of
three-tier stack so there's obviously I
use a sitting out there there's this
meet here which is where all the node
and that the love and the magic happens
and then there's a database tier so sort
of three-tier stack and in that mid tier
you've got the node programming
environment you've got a little mode or
Polly the adapter which is out there
free on github and we have the Oracle
client libraries okay so those are
called client libraries are available as
zips and rpms for our for Linux users
and other Linux users they provide a lot
of the real magic they're used by pretty
much everything which accesses the
Oracle database so they're widely tested
they're stable their core free to
download from OTN surprise surprise that
OTN is hosting that for all of their
platforms that we support
no it's Oracle developer community so
conferences just started for me and the
pre branding is happening but anyway
because it's excellent used to hear that
we're getting a bit of life this year
coming in
and some changes as obviously developers
I think are a bit key focus for for
everybody so no narc will be be is just
out there and github it's again
something which users can contribute to
although we may leave maintainer zon it
users can make contributions and users
have made contributions and we
appreciate those people who have taken
time to make some code changes and dark
changes suggestions and things that I
can build up this kind of community and
ecosystem okay so I'm not gonna really
cover my whole poll cause I'm going to
go through tomorrow I've got a little
bit I'm gonna go like into just a little
bit of installation really just so that
I can show you some future stuff and
I've just got one tip I just pull one
tip that'll slide which would cover but
this is the kind of overview of the API
you can see it's very low weight in
terms of classes there just a few key
classes you don't even need the LOB
class in the current releases because
we've made lobs a lot easier to work
with in the last year or so we're trying
to do a lot of the magic for you so that
no developer doesn't have to write a lot
of code just works it just does does
things when they need it
so people again who haven't seen no just
an introduction kind of callback hell
there's blank lines I'll get to in a
minute but you can see it's sort of line
one there it says hey I need to get my
API that I want to use Oracle DB get a
connection
I don't execute bind variables a binary
was always very important in all of
these languages in terms of scalability
so the statements don't have to be
repass cuz the text of a statement
between the quotes there's constant
every time something we execute that and
for security so there's no sequel
concatenation security issues they're so
binding and then in the node sense you
get a result back and you can print out
rows here that's pretty simple and it's
for flesh it out you get obviously
connection strings there and a lot of
error handling and things like that but
it's basically as you can see in red
standard as you get with JDBC with OCIO
PHP
you know connect execute get data done
and of course get data of course you
actually get some data back I've got a
to another couple of quick slides would
actually show the same thing so promises
are a big thing here in know they're
just coming online makes a little easier
than that kind of callback methods we
showed on the previous slides I'm not
gonna go into a lot of detail on that
and then recently in and no 87.6 and
more popularly in the next long-term
support at least eight you can use this
new async/await
which makes things a lot more familiar
to people who don't make this kind of
call back what's happening when kind of
structure you can see there on lines
five and six and red you're pretty much
saying await this action yeah wait for
my connection don't succeed when that's
done then I can go on and I can do my
execute you don't have a kind of nested
do get connection okay when that's
finished like go and do my execute okay
now I can't go and release the cursor to
get any more linear look to the code
which is kinda layman's term saying it's
easy to work with easier to debug so I'm
not gonna go into any of these features
anybody who's here at the conference can
come and see my talk tomorrow I'll talk
a lot about these things and you can see
there's a URL on the screen my session
is 67 twelve and that tiny URL active
low W that's horrible open world
w17 will take you to the list of a
really cool sessions in the application
developers space what time is it
tomorrow at the using the afternoon
that's a good question I won't work that
out everything about it yeah I have a
lot of sessions and I I think that's one
of the lighter ones in the early evening
as mice the developer things seem to be
in the early evening they don't like
developers getting up early in this
space so people coming along to the
session we're hear a lot about some of
these things on the slides if I can pick
out something which I'm not going to
talk about either there or today in
slides as the high availability features
so those are things which come free
without key Oracle client libraries fact
that I talked about I think is like fast
application notification transparent
application failover things which can
may really add a reliability into that
into a stack for an application and
coming down straighten things like
application continuity more more
buzzwords your application continuity is
a way for the application to actually
remember what is being sent to the
database and if that database node
disappears it can replay that
information to somewhere else where you
can reconnect to a database so you don't
actually lose any information any of the
transaction and inserts anything that
you've done it's not been committed yet
to a database where the database
disappears the client is remembered what
you've tried to submit and it can
resubmit it back and store things out so
I'm gonna take a little bit of a sidebar
actually so this is something I'm not
actually talking about in my talk
this is programming and your API new API
so this is actually a C interface and
something we've been working hard on one
of the key developers is here at the
conference and it's now being used if
you look right there in the middle of in
Bowl that's being used by this the node
Oracle DBA version 2 API and by cxr pond
which is a Python API version 6 using
this and our third-party maintain is out
there
Kubo for example start of a Russ driver
another one's come along with a go
drivers come along using this C API to
write interfaces that you can use in any
of these languages so it's a kind of
efficient way to to get drivers out
there and you don't actually have to use
it for drivers it's a little bit
targeted at drivers but you can use a
friendly application you like if you
want a really high-performance C API
application out there but you don't like
Oracle call interface API for whatever
reasons we kind of abstract a little bit
smooth out some of the rough edges make
it a little easier to work with we've
had some really good feedback and
particularly from these driver maintain
us about it so that's a little bit of a
sidebar really because trying to tell
you where things are going we're this v2
which is out there in a developer
preview at the moment API is going to be
unchanged the stack is very similar to
what I showed before we just stick this
ODP I see layer in there users don't
need to know anything about it
totally totally hidden under the scenes
but I just wanted to throw
out there for people who do kind of like
to know how it's all built and where
things are heading now this new reliable
API underneath so the key thing we're
gonna have is pretty much you need to
install this client stack so Oracle
developer community now has the instant
client as we just discussed get download
that or even use libraries which wooden
part of the Oracle database it's the
same same set of libraries need to tell
applications where to find those
libraries it healthy library path or on
Windows you set path and run an install
command so in preview mode at the moment
it's not that bear on the NPM registry
so we just got to installing from github
with this extra github syntax so you can
go and play with that yeah you might see
a lot of difference because the OTTI is
really the same as exposing the same
functionality as before but as we
stabilize this release it then we can
start adding a lot more great
functionality on top so I'll come back
to some of those things a little bit
later so I want to just go into one tip
as I said I pulled out one tip so we
have connection pooling we recommend
people use connection pooling connection
pooling is good pooling is good your
shared resources connections can take a
little bit of resources to start up and
stop and you don't want to waste that
effort that you've taken to create that
connection so we suggest creating a pool
is how you do it in node ok this is a
node specific tip is it by default you
have for worker threads there and so
each of those worker threads may be
connecting to the database and trying to
do some work they're doing a sequel
statement doing a slack doing an insert
and those worker threads could be fully
utilized so what happens if something
else comes in the user puts another
request wants to make another connection
there's no worker threat to actually
handle that work and now in this
particular scenario we've now got five
threads that extra workload comes in and
could go through to the database so it's
just a little trick it seems to catch a
few people aren't aware is because we
see a lot of people who are new to node
don't really understand how this kind of
all works and plays together they kind
of think connections are asynchronous
but actually those connections to the
database there on that those right hand
red arrows are it like in red arrows
they're kind of waiting for the work to
be complete on the database before they
get free and those worker processes are
reusable and one final tip is that node
itself limits the number of threads you
can have so it kind of means keep their
maximum size of their pool under this
that was a little bit of a tip just a
sidekick and so I just wanted to throw
it out there what are we kind of working
on in future wait the appetite for those
know people spoke a little better
version two of no totally be based on
this database programming interface API
we're really hopeful that we sorted out
some of the legal technical issues and
getting pretty for binary Zout there for
this so that installation will be really
smooth you won't need C compilers or
anything like that at the moment which
is annoying for people on Windows and if
this conference finished we can actually
get down and do some work and get those
out there it's in a little bit of demand
for a simple execute connect/disconnect
core people seem to like doing
single-shot things to a database not
having to worry about error handling and
things like that so maybe we can wrap up
that somehow a bundle it make it usable
for you
Python drivers already got things like
their Python object a sequel object
binding that's available in that Oh dpi
layer so once we pick that up and we
should be able to be able to pick up
some married object to single object
binding which should be really neat so
does so soda is the simple Oracle
document access model which is available
in Java at the moment okay now in a
teensy of the database and a you all
know right okay from 12 to 18 that
should become available in in 18 C and
the OCI layer we could then put that
into a DPI and into node and so you get
a document style access instead of this
old sequel access into the database
that's really cool an API is something
else I wanted to point out about so the
node community is aware that a lot of
non-vegans coming out there's no 4 node
6 node either kind of the current
mine is gonna come out later this month
so introducing a new API for add-ons
like no terribly be a binary add-ons see
it written in C C++ and so they're going
to bring that out and at some stage
we'll have to cut over to the Hat that's
the kind of future thing disclaimer of
course standard Oracle disclaimer just
in that little fine print at the bottom
you know don't these things may never
happen it's open source and you
contribute they'll happen faster and
things like that so we've got a couple
of other sessions coming up here at the
conference my session tomorrow there we
go 5:45 I mean it was a light one I knew
we get to read my colleague Dan McGann
who's actually a real JavaScript expert
he's contributes to the team we're
getting some help from him with his no
binary packaging and things like that so
he's got a couple of sessions on he's
got more than I've listed here I think
he's got to talk in one of the theatres
as well 1:30 tomorrow I think so there's
a lot of node activity at the conference
and that last session that's mentioned
there on the Wednesday 5:30 that's the
one which is more general so that one's
really applicable to all of the drivers
out there to see Python know drivers but
that's actually a good one because it
really delves down into the what
actually happens and caching and things
like that and if you do something we
call Oracle database cloud traffic
manager which is a kind of new
architecture there in connection land
which I don't have time to discuss today
anybody at the conference can come along
to our booth left-hand side of Moscone
West we're here in sunny San Francisco
it's a great sunny day in San Francisco
that is actually one of the rare warm
days out there it's really beautiful to
see everybody out enjoying themselves
and that's my final slide that's my
contact information you can find me on
Twitter and social media and things like
that
part of a sort of Oracle developer
community yes formerly known as our
whole technology network thank you
I'm loading your slides to any to your
blog I will be uploading my full slide
strength
tomorrow's talk on to the standard
conference website a lot of this stuff
will fill the throw into the blog as
well where people will be
really interested no well keep people
we'll be ready to trace it I don't want
to be too American about this I gotta be
Australian and just sort of quiet
low-key right few people yeah more than
a few people you know thousands of
people going by our downloads to get
10,000 tens of thousands of downloads a
month of this so there is definitely
some interest out there well thank you
so much for taking time to share with us
and good luck at all your sessions it
looks like you'll be very busy I am
actually very busy analyst meetings team
dinners you have important things if I
change commitments my concerts
yeah I'm commuting and things like that
but it's a great conference open source
is great conferences are great to go
very well together because you keep
talking can can communicate learn from
everybody and if anyone's actually at
the conference we're filming this live
and the developer lounge and must go
anywhere on the right hand side to come
on by I've run out thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
