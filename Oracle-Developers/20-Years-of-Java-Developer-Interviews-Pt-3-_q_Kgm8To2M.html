what I expecting for java future is the
better because Java ever ever given us
to community anything things with
qualities and opportunities for
developing new technologies I think the
future of Java is being like this I
think it's very great and must keep this
so so for the future of Java what I
really want is more participation more
community I want more interest from
developers because I think that you know
java strikes a chord with with what we
we developed if we want right we want to
be image experimental new technology we
want to be able to try out different
things we want to be able to get our
codes into new you know new ideas new
universe right so I really want to have
the freedom to choose where I'm going to
work on what is the new thing that's
going coming on I think the fact that
Java is available everywhere the Java is
a technology that's that you have you
have I think that because job is
available everywhere because Java is
available in all devices and and my
knowledge is valid no matter how the
technology change I think that's really
really important oh the future of Java
is Java user groups you know I'm the
mascot for java groups because Java Sea
groups are the coolest part of Java ever
and I think the future of Java is more
and more javi's groups doing more and
more stuff and cool things together and
i'll be there when the java can be adapt
with new technologies can observe with
not on making java but other language
like here and we can c lambda we can see
about security we can see about
magnificent the internet obscene
and it java can be adapted in new
technology that the futures is be huge
for him it's very hard to predict what
will happen the next 20 years with Java
but one thing I'm sure you will be
programming and talking and attending
events like Java one talking about Java
and especially making friends with the
java community in the next 20 years so I
don't know about the future of
technology but I loaded whichever
technology we have in the next 20 years
we will be using Java to them I think
that in the future job will be the
technology behind the most important
applications in the world everything
that you see emerging as somewhere Java
behind it for cept for pdata machine
learning all the big tools they are all
based on Java the Internet of Things
have lots of Java behind so I don't
imagine any new application or
technology coming without having Chavez
part of this so I think Java we still be
the glue
that puts everything together and the
community are going to make good to make
the java the biggest platform around
everything i seen yoga in the future
everywhere because we are getting
internet of things iot will put the
other in every single piece of hardware
well I don't really know where javis
going i hope i can i can tell you my
wishes are like i see a lot of things
happening the world and technology like
the internet of things and even java in
the way we program job is a great tool
and as a tool you can use it for
everything so i think it's very hard for
in my dreams like my best wishes would
be that job would only be used for
increasing our knowledge for making like
robots to send other planets to discover
more to give more knowledge for us
humans to improve our the way we lived
in planets to make life better for
humans for animals for plants for so
probably so that we can I don't know
live better and live we can use that
that those tools that technology to make
the earth a better place for everybody
future of Java I seen a short being used
a lot more and java java in mobile
device is in has betty is something that
i really really excited to see working
and working on and I I think Java is a
great language is a great platform
you can do a lot of things with Java
things that a new normal cone could not
do is something that make me very happy
with the language I think I was going to
be the future of everything everything
is going to be related to it and i think
it's it's like already it is like there
are so many people here trying to
understand and trying to know more about
it because it's the future I see the
Alpha going further down the IOT road
going to many embedded devices going
these already CDs already established on
the server side it's getting more I
believe it's gonna be more established
on the embedded side as well we using
with more gateways and more devices on
the field different in the future of
Java is
like a technology in
now of urs of the Dewar's when people
that's not working in itrs people like
doctors psychologists or economics can
use Java to build your applications
without cold without the ancestors to
write code and like a application for
dead person like a person application
this firm is the future of the job well
I just hope the judge can be embedded as
many as part in technologies as you go
in our daily lives so today I strongly
believe infinity of things so it's going
to be everywhere and because that's
going to be a bone walk or a form of
Technology and of course is a lot you're
going to need a lot of the Gospels come
up with solutions for everything for
everything and because of that I think
we're going to see a lot of a lot of
solutions and new technologies out there
what I'm seeing the future of course i
believe the java more and more open
sauce and the community more more
participate in the java process on JCP
on some giant specification we have some
projects search dog GSR and adopt
openjdk so i believe in the future
everyone keep participate more and more
in the java future to write the future
not about the java but the future of the
humanity i really hope that java will
continue improving in this aspect like
as a core platform and maybe try to
forget about with these javaserver faces
and things and focus lee mainly in these
core java like server-side applications
i think the future of
about Java is in small devices we can
find the Java in TV in clothes and other
kind of things that we can use in our
days I still job XL in the future
especially the other day I was in the ER
line community I was talking to their
own bosses and I asked them a little
question like what do you do to the
innovation is there any areas where
developers can expose their ideas are
you are you listening to people and they
say no we don't as I do have a java
community process like something that
you know people can submit and they can
apply their ideas you know for for
talking or negotiating and they say no
we don't have it and we don't plan to
another thing here that's what Java is
so successful and so that's what job is
so good because people can get together
and they can innovate and they can have
their ideas and can be listened and I
think this is what the community mrs.
and I think that's why Java is a very
very writing I see the feature with a
lot of devices connected with Java
behind
java running on the edge devices in the
gateways and plenty of Java devices for
international things so asking about
future it's a very hard question
everything depends on what the future is
it tomorrow next week 10 years 35 years
so when I see Java today and I am in the
middle of the Internet of Things echo
system right now I see connected people
IC technology connected to our body in a
more strong strong way I believe that
after all these wearables who have more
thing embedded in ourselves and I
believe will be able to extend our
memory our vision and everything and
enhance the power of hardware and
software on that so I believe Java will
be in our body in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
