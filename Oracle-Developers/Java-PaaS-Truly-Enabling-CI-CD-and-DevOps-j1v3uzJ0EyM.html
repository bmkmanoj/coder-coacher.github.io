Java Paz platform-as-a-service
I'm going to be going over multiple
paths offerings focusing on one because
I used to work for the company we're
gonna be looking at paths from a
perspective of continuous integration
continuous delivery and at the end
DevOps and then I'll also talk about
what I think is the future of paths and
cloud computing in general you can take
that with a grain of salt so I work for
a company called effects consulting and
we are a digital engagement company we
primarily focus on customer experience
management and we have partnered with a
couple companies hippo being one of them
Adobe being another and or in we offer
Technology Strategy and consulting also
mandate services in the cloud and my
position there basically is the director
senior cloud architect for aw thanks
most recently I worked for a cloud B's
as a Solutions Architect and I spoke
most recently at OpenStack summit in
Atlanta Georgia I think back in May on
Jenkins integration to OpenStack
deploying slaves dynamically out to
Rackspace
I've always been an early adopter of
Java I'm telling you all these things
because we've been encouraged to let you
know who we are you know before we dive
into our talk and then there I am on
LinkedIn and also there's my blog it's
all technical no personal stuff there so
our agenda I'm gonna give you a starting
point you're gonna know where I start
from it may not be what you agree with
I'll apologize up front you know my
experiences are just that my experiences
and some research that I've done we're
going to talk about pass we're gonna get
into paths foresee ICD DevOps and
finally we will talk about PA's futures
so today when I talk about continuous
integration I'm going to be primarily
talking about it as it's underpinned by
the Jenkins tool set the tool chain for
Jenkins open source and then the
Enterprise version from cloudBees
I am quite aware of other tools out
there Travis CI circle CI bamboo
electric cloud urbancode deploy I am NOT
trying to slide any of them I started
using Hudson I moved on to Jenkins
that's just where I am I've tried some
of the other tools
I think Jenkins is so valuable to me
because at heart I'm a developer and in
Jenkins showed up in our organization
organically because developers brought
it in and we could tweak it and mess
with it because it's so extensible I'm
going to talk mostly about platform as a
service from a perspective of cloudBees
though I have used OpenShift Heroku
Engine Yard and also a big user of
Amazon ec2 and the associated services
thereof I believe that traditional IT is
slow I believe that if you're not using
cloud technologies then you're you're
not really helping your business and I'm
not saying put all your stuff in the
public cloud that's not what I'm saying
at all but there are plenty of
technologies that you could leverage
that are part of the cloud technology
tool chain that would help your your
businesses react quicker applications
being provisioned environments being
provisioned quicker so I hope from this
talk you get an idea of which way you
could go to help your businesses and
again one thing I want to point out
there are trade-offs with regards to
moving to the cloud whether it be
platform as a service or infrastructure
as a service or SAS if you've got poor
performing IT paths is not a secret
Silver Bullet for you it's not gonna fix
everything that ails you it may even
amplify the things that you're doing
incorrectly you know one thing it can do
if done correctly it can lessen the
impact of mistakes or bad decisions
because it allows you to move faster so
even if you fail you can fail faster and
recover faster that's what I see is the
biggest promise of pass so we'll start
off with the definition from NIST I'm
not going to read the entire definition
I will tell you that from here what I
get out of it is that customers can
deploy to a Paz platform without having
to manage the tool chain in that
platform they're not managing Tomcat
they're not managing all the other
associated ecosystem partner provided
tool sets and there are trade-offs there
as well if I split this apart here's
what I see paths being platforms running
on top of infrastructure as a service a
lot of times not all the time but most
the time providing a solution stack
whether it be Tomcat and my sequel or
glass fish or even wild fly everyone
using paths you know you're not going to
manage those stacks you may have some
configuration input to change the
configuration of those stacks but the
whole idea behind Paz really is to
encapsulate complexity away from you
you're not doing infrastructure as a
service so it's not as flexible is
infrastructure as a service it's not
designed to be and it's not as narrowly
focused as software as a service
hence this pyramid focus versus
flexibility this should be something
that you already understand or should be
able to understand quickly SAS very
focused on business services right
salesforce comm MailChimp some of your
monitoring services like Naji osore even
copper egg very focused paths it's right
in the middle it's a sweet spot for you
know small to medium sized businesses
startups companies whose applications
are contained in such a way that they're
not they don't require a lot of esoteric
configuration changes and in an
environment to actually execute that's
what that's the sweet spot of pass the
more configuration changes you need the
harder it is to fit in the pass
regardless of the vendor and then of
course infrastructure as a service your
you major players there Amazon obviously
Google Rackspace which is based on
OpenStack Helion from HP
so again pass is not
infrastructure-as-a-service you will not
in most instances get access to remote
into your servers it's just not going to
happen
there are there are exceptions and I'll
cover some of those today you're going
to manage your applications you're not
managing the stack that's the whole idea
behind pass you can repurpose some of
your resources to do something else
other than managing Tomcat or managing
Linux OSS as a matter of fact and a lot
of past platforms you know I know there
are some ops folks in here that have
their favorite Linux you know I like
Amazon's Linux or I like sent OS or I
like Red Hat or pick one most pass
vendors pick one Linux and stay with it
and it irritates a lot of ops people and
that's one of the trade-offs you have to
make when you choose pass you no longer
get to choose your favorite Linux or for
that matter your favorite web container
you may find yourself moving to a
different container they offer Pass does
offer a lot of vendors offer SDKs and
command-line interface tool kits and
even RESTful API is that allow you to do
some configuration and actual monitoring
while you're using the pass platform and
I'll get into a little bit of that later
these api's also allow you to customize
things with the cloudBees platform which
by the way is going away they announced
that three weeks ago right before I had
to speak thank you
you could customize the cloudy's
platform with an SDK and move things
around without ever going into their web
console so you know when you're looking
at paths you may want to look at vendors
that allow both the access in the web
console as well as SDKs and api's so we
understand what passes or at least you
guys understand what I think it is you
know I'm not the only one talking about
cloud here this week I'm sure so
continuous integration to me is a
collection of practices and patterns
design for repeatability you're
integrating multiple times a day
the idea of
pushing your code once a week twice a
week or once every two weeks that's gone
and if you people are still doing it
good luck with that because it's really
gonna slow you down
integration multiple times a day it fits
within your daily cycles for your agile
software development continuous
integration underpins agile software
development in my opinion you can't do
true agile software development without
continuous integration you're kidding
yourself
the end result basically is that you
succeed or you fail okay well we always
do that but with continuous integration
you've succeed much faster or you fail
much faster so the impact is less you
are integrating faster multiple times a
day so you're integrating smaller chunks
so your failures your failures are small
and then you can react to those failures
quicker so that's the promise of
continuous integration and I put this
quote in here you know there are no
mistakes
you do not figure them there are no
mistakes where software developers were
ops folks there are plenty of mistakes
continuous integration underpinned by
paths is lessening those mistakes so
that it's not the end of the world when
something crashes okay so here is a
typical in our shop this is a typical
continuous integration cycle we write
code now most of us use eclipse a couple
of us use IntelliJ I'm going to show
eclipse on here in a moment so when we
write our code and then what I like to
do I'll point this out I like to have my
developers connect to my sonar server
sonar server is you know what gives us
our static code analysis I like that my
developers connect to that even before
they integrate because they can now see
the same rules that I apply to their
code when they integrate and rebuild so
it just helps them you know it makes
them better developers if they can look
at that right away inside their IDE
without having to wait for a bill to
occur
then we push we build we store their
binaries so they can get at their
binaries depending on what they're
writing unit testing analysts analyzing
at the server level as part of the build
process deploying now our continuous
integration in our shop is a is a
deployment every time to the dev
environment so it's not just integrating
code
there's deployments and testing going on
after deployments we have a test which
is a limited functional test usually
with selenium or something like that and
then the cycle continues and it's
multiple times day probably an hour swap
four or five times a day and we've got
three or four developers working on each
project again we standardize on Jenkins
internally we run Jenkins up in ec2 I
also run it inside cloud B's I've run it
inside openshift I mean it's you know I
think over 40 or 50 thousand
installations worldwide something like
that so if you've got a chance to go up
and talk to clout bees in the exhibition
hall the CTO of cloud bees is kohsuke
kawaguchi and he actually wrote Hudson
and Jenkins so you might want to go up
there and meet him and talk with him if
you've got any questions with the
platform here's a typical - continuous
integration tool chain for us the IDE
obviously resides locally though Amazon
announced last year that they've got
that workspace now in the cloud and
other vendors do as well sonar cube
gives us a local sonar server then we
were using github and up in cloud B's
they used a frog I think locally where
we're using Nexus J unit seems to be our
standard I'm not knocking any other
tools this is just our tool chain
sonar source is a cloud provider of
sonar I want to point out that as at the
time of this slide deck preparation
sonar source did not offer the ability
to allow IDs on the local workstation to
connect to sonar source and do analyzing
of code at the IDE level so we're a
tomcat shop we use selenium so that's a
typical tool chain
a lot of tools there that have to be
managed understood and used by the
development team understood and managed
by the ops team if you're doing agile
this should be very familiar to you this
is basically a sprint with a daily cycle
inside and your C eyes happen multiple
times within that daily cycle so now I'm
going to go out and look at cloud peace
my first demo today looking at CI inside
of a Java platform as a service inside
cloud bees because since I've
standardized on Jenkins cloud bees now
is the enterprise Jenkins company if you
haven't heard so if you don't know why
they changed your name and you may want
to stop by and ask them but they are the
enterprise Jenkins company that's why I
use them
so first things first when I go out to
cloudBees I can login with you know my
Google account so yes they do have
Google App Engine integration I can log
in with my github account you know they
do have github integration they also
offer subversion and git repositories in
their cloud you don't have to if you
don't have it already you can use theirs
I'm just gonna log in with my regular
email that's their old console it'll be
immediately redirect me to their new
console well I guess immediate is a
relative term so oh there it is
little red banner cloudBees is
discontinuing their run at cloud hosting
service so which is which is unfortunate
quite honestly because it it worked
really well for what we were doing so
but inside cloud bees you know you can
choose from repositories or builds or
applications give you an idea if I click
on applications here it'll give me an
create new applications they'll give me
a list of applications I currently have
and this is a free trial account I could
change the size of my applications here
I could add additional services like
routers I could add additional nodes for
horizontal scaling so I can do both
vertical and horizontal scaling later on
I'll show you that as well on the
jelastic platform so that's another
thing that you might want to look at
when you're doing passes you know what
features does your vendor offer
horizontal and vertical scaling both
that's it's very keen this this one is
active this one's in hibernate mode
they'd like to hibernate applications if
they're in a free trial so but if you
are running for a you know a paid
account they will not hibernate your
your application for you know you can if
you want you know so that's one thing
you can do without blowing the way you
just hibernate it to make it on you know
unavailable or you can even stop it okay
I'm gonna go ahead and delete this one
because I'm going to
build it later on the interesting thing
about cloudBees with regards to its
build now this is Jenkins running inside
cloudBees but one of the interesting
things and one of the pluses of a pads
in general is their ability to gather
partners to create an ecosystem that
allows you as a consumer of their
platform to take advantage of other
services like I've got Jenkins up in
here I've got sauce labs here for those
of you who have never used sauce labs
sauce labs is a place where you can run
your selenium tests in the cloud and so
if you have to work with Internet
Explorer six or seven still come on
there's you guys are still out there I
know you're out there somewhere yes you
can do that in sauce labs
you know Firefox different versions
whatever browser you want selenium tests
can be run all inside the cloud without
you having to reproduce these
environments locally the ecosystem is a
big deal for me when I look at a cloud
pass vendor there's also the
repositories over here that's grayed out
I'm not using it but Jay frog is you
know there artifactory is a binary
repository like Nexus I know some of you
views Nexus some of you probably use Jay
frog what else sonar so to me if I'm
looking to pass I want to know that I
can bolt on additional resources and
services without having to go out and
reproduce these services and manage them
myself that's the promise of pass
reducing the complexity giving you the
additional services in this case through
a partner ecosystem okay so in my Java
one folder now if you're a Jenkins user
and you've not seen folders then that's
a cloud B's plug-in that you can get and
it's free they offer a paid version of
it as well that's much more functional
but this version is you know you can
also run it locally free in your open
source and what's going on here is I've
got all these multiple jobs that I've
defined and I'll just look at one of
those and I'm not going to run because
it takes forever
these jobs right now but I look at the
cons I'll give you an idea of what it's
going to be doing this is just a typical
job you go in there and Jenkins for
those of you have seen it it should be
very familiar for those that are not
it's kind of easy to follow along with
I'm running this job that looks at
subversion it's not being triggered by
subversion commits but it could be you
know I could pull subversion all day
long if I wanted to but I don't in this
particular but you know part of
continuous integration you should be if
you're using git you should be
triggering off what pushes you should be
triggering off of subversion commits
everything like that and then it
basically goes out there and I don't
have to do this because my palm is
really straightforward my maven palm
this is a maven build but I do say you
know here's the palm here's your the
targets I want to use and then I want to
deploy now I can choose multiple places
to deploy I'm deploying to cloudBees run
a cloud right now and my group ID at my
artifact ID I don't have to say what
those are again my palm is simple all I
have to do is give up my targets I don't
have to give it you know the group ID an
artifact ID unless you have very complex
palms then you have to give it you know
that information and then this will
deploy out to run a cloud when it's
running so that's how I got hello world
out there to begin with I ran this job
so now there's other steps I could put
in there I could deploy a war in here to
a container so if you say you've got
tomcat running up in ec2 and you've got
access you haven't taken away to manage
your app yet and easy to stomp cat or
you let's say you've reinstalled it
because most of the time it's not there
you can deploy a tomcat and ec2 with
this play this deploy or build step so
it makes it fairly easy to manage your
codebase manage your CI process but
deploy out to different clouds and there
are other api's like J clouds that
allows you to deploy to you know
OpenStack Rackspace and all host of
other cloud offerings out there okay so
I'm just going to go back in
yes I'm going to leave look at one of
the builds
give you an idea the first thing it does
it's creating a slave for me those of
you who use Jenkins those of you don't
you should know that you don't do builds
on your master everything is done on a
slave now if you've got a very small
shop a lot of your builds happen on the
master but in the real world slaves are
where the builds happen in cloudBees
it's the same a cloudBees slave is spun
up for you the first you can see is that
there's an LXE container being spun up
for you a Linux container a Linux
container is spun up a new ZFS
filesystem is put in place and then your
build happens after your build is done
then the ZFS filesystem is snapshotted
so you can use it again on your next
build which makes your next build that
much faster and your lxc is blown away
they do that for isolation purposes now
if you look at any kind of cloud
offering the two most competing concerns
are usually density and isolation high
density sometimes compromises isolation
so you have to make a decision there on
what points you can handle density and
what points on what points of isolation
you want to have they handle isolation
very easily with volatile LX ease this
is a typical maven build there's nothing
spectacular going on here
here's we get in some of my unit testing
the spring based web application MVC app
it's at the bottom here I'm archiving
and then I'm also the pulling out the
cloud B's and then I'm done and then
that's how my cloud B's hello world app
shows up now the cool thing and I'll
talk more about it later but the cool
thing about Jenkins running in cloud B's
is that and this is going away as of
December because we're on a cloud no
longer exists and for those of you who
don't have cloud B's yet you can't get
run at cloud anymore but one of the cool
things was that with cloud B's run at
cloud and Jenkins and debit cloud I
could just point to a new environment so
if I were to go out and look at my hello
world
of configuration which is just another
job it's practically the same job the
only thing that's different is down here
I'd said I want to point here and on the
fly cloud bees would build the
application container for me and then
deploy for me so if I needed to
provision a new dev environment or a QA
or a UAT environment I don't have to go
out to my ops folks and say build me an
environment and let me know what it's
ready so I can deploy I can just deploy
and cloudBees creates it for me on the
fly
now cloudBees runs on top of Amazon ec2
so there's a lot of stuff going it's
like a duck on water it looks very calm
on the top but there's a lot of pedaling
going on underneath the water you know
and they're using technologies like
puppet and chef to do this type of
provisioning but this is one of the
things I'm going to miss with cloudy's
going away with their run a cloud mmm
okay so why would you choose pads I
think I should I think I've pointed out
that the biggest reason is to not have
to manage that tool chain you know I'm
using Jenkins I'm using selenium you
know I'm using sonar you know those are
three different servers I'd have to
install I don't want to have to do that
subversion and git I don't want to have
to do that either if I already have my
stuff up and github then I can just
integrate that to cloud bees let cloud
bees get in there it's very easy to
allow an application in the github if
you've not done it before the
alternative is to manage that CI stack
yourself all those tools in that tool
chain and I know a lot of you still do
that for some of my customers I still do
that for them but they pay for that you
know it's cheaper to have someone else
do it it really is because you know
their focus is managing those stacks
your focus for a business should not be
it should be using those stacks to
produce software for your business so
why would you not choose pass for your
CI well maybe you can't maybe your
security folks are such that they
won't allow you to move to a public
cloud you know maybe you can use you
know a private pass offering like
jelastic they offer a private cloud to
do that I've worked with cloud bees as a
Solutions Architect and when I did I ran
into several customers who simply could
not move to the cloud because of
security concerns they could not move
their code they couldn't move their data
and then there were also other concerns
a lot of them around pH I you know the
HIPAA business associate versus a
conduit I won't get into what those are
but as a platform as a service vendor
running on top of infrastructure as a
service vendor there's a lot of concerns
as to who manages those PCI data and are
they a conduit or are they a business
associate because the rules change
drastically for each one of those
contexts now maybe you have resources
you know and you know let's say you have
mainframe databases that obviously
you're not running into the cloud
because there's not a lot of mainframe
cloud services out there that might be
another reason why you don't move to the
cloud you know so you know the
trade-offs are you're going to be giving
up some control for increased simplicity
you're going to be shedding some
complexity and letting someone else
manage that for you to make your life
simpler
now cloud ease does offer a hybrid
solution so you can manage Jenkins
configurations in their cloud but if you
need the builds to happen locally you
can run what are called on-premise
executors which are just slaves that
connect to the cloud B's Jenkins master
and they connect from inside your
firewall outward we should make your ops
and networking security folks happier
because they're not whitelisting IPS and
quite honestly in dev a cloud and clout
B's the IPS are not all that static they
do change if you've ever been in ec2 and
you've stopped an instance and restarted
it and you don't have an elastic IP
what's the first thing that happens your
IP changes
so this slave this on-premise executor
allows you to still run your builds
locally even though they're configured
in the cloud they are running locally
accessing your resources locally so this
might be one thing you could use if you
needed the hybrid approach you wanted to
shed your management of Jenkins but you
still wanted to do on premise building I
will say this that if you are using
Jenkins to pull your your repositories
like subversion or get you have to make
sure that the cloud can reach those
those repositories so there is that
trade-off there's another hybrid
solution that they've just started
offering it's called their cloud bees
cloud connector so cloud bees offers
jenkins in the cloud and they also offer
jenkins enterprise inside on your
on-premise so it's an on-premise
replacement for jenkins open source and
with jenkins enterprise you can use the
cloud bees connector to connect back to
their cloud so if you can run builds in
the cloud but you're running jenkins
locally and you want burst capacity for
your builds up in the cloud then you can
burst into their cloud run a build come
back down so that's another hybrid
approach if you if you guys are looking
at something like that
ok so continuous delivery I see it very
similar to CI it's a collection of
patterns practices it's got a different
goal the idea here is to reduce the size
of deployments make them faster smaller
lessen the impact of any mistakes or
trash that are in it that's introduced
as part of these deployments
it's underpinned by CI and it's part of
your agile and lean software development
and when I say lean the main thing that
I mean from lean is in a non agile
software project lean dictates that
everything happens up to the point that
you deliver your software all those
activities are waste their waste you
have a delivered ending of value you
hope that when you deliver that software
waste is overcome by the value of your
delivery if you're using agile practices
you are delivering multiple times during
a two to six week sprint so the waste is
smaller and the value proposition is
higher so that's why I keep mentioning
lean faster better cheaper that's what
cloud B says about it here's a typical
continuous delivery it's a very abstract
you know build it deploy test it release
it a lot of the more in-depth testing
and code analysis obviously takes place
inside CI now what we do with CI and CB
and how we make those work together we
do a artifact copy as opposed to a build
so if I have to move code to QA or UAT
or whatever from dev then I take a known
good artifact and I move that artifact
I'm not building in QA and then
redeploying that that subverts the whole
idea of continuous integration in the
handoff to continuous delivery you want
a well you want to prove and build from
continuous integration that you can now
propagate throughout your your delivery
cycle so you're moving artifacts Jenkins
actually has a solution for that called
fingerprinting and a fingerprint er Wars
to make sure that you're getting the
right war that you think you need for
the next environment delivery this is a
typical environment for us excuse me a
set of environments mileage may vary I
look at it this way this is the model
that I see when I look at continuous
delivery inside the dev environment its
encapsulated in a continuous integration
cycle everything is automated
from the point that the code goes in to
the point that the code goes out it's an
automated tool chain when I get to QA
UAT staging those are automated as well
the deployment - those are automated
copying the files moving them deploying
them it's all automated there is a
manual gate because I'm a developer I'm
not a QA person I cannot tell when QA
wants to change their code base I leave
it up to them and tools like Jenkins
allow
to do the automation but provide a
promotion manual gate that allows me to
change or dictate when you know based on
who I say is the promoter when something
goes to the next environments so and
this is very typical I think you know as
you get into continuous delivery one of
the ideas is you know one of the things
that threatens ops folks is they see
automation and they think automatic and
they're going to lose control and that's
not true
automation is about repeatability and
not having to inject a lot of errors
from users doing manual tasks but that
one manual task of promotion still
probably has to happen in your business
that's just the way it works most of the
time and then your your continuous
delivery cycles kind of they kind of
look like this you know they're
micro-cycles inside each one of those
environments and in a nutshell that's to
me that's continuous delivery now there
is another CD called continuous
deployment and I differentiate the two
continuous delivery to me is non
production can use continuous deployment
is like blue green pipe deployment to
production
okay so PA's environments when you're
inside paths you do not have the same
type of environment that you used to
have for it for first things first the
environments kind of go away they're
more of a logical construct inside pass
you're not going to have environments
sitting around waiting for someone to
deploy that's complete waste of
resources
so really pass environments are an
intersection of code and an application
and nothing points that out more than
the information I just gave you earlier
about the builds inside Jenkins inside
cloud base I never had to say here's my
hello world dev environment all I said
was here's my code base build it and
deploy it to this app target and so
doing I created a logical dev
environment with its own URL that I can
give to my developers and I can do the
same thing for QA UAT whatever so that's
the first thing that you have to
grasp and accept you know especially if
you're an OPS person you have to
understand that that you don't have
environments the same way you used to
when you were virtualizing your own
servers or for that matter managing iron
so and and a lot of folks are still
using you know ec2 and we will for years
to come
and you know they're using Rackspace and
and other OpenStack vendors and they'll
build environments and sometimes those
environments hang out now what we try to
do is we build in just in time so that
we can use them and not have to have
them sitting around cuz I don't want to
pay for something that's I'm not using
but that's you know the idea behind pads
is that again it's abstracting that
building of the environment and kind of
encapsulating the complexity of it and
in so doing it builds it just in time
for you now I'll get into later on where
I'm integrating Jenkins to you know
building out to AWS elastic beanstalk
and it's not quite that simple so the
cloud bees approach is very simple when
I'm if you haven't used it yet I think
you're still going to miss it as much as
I'm gonna miss it so you know I kind of
already talked about CD with cloud bees
I kind of showed you how I would do it
with the hello world dev job one thing I
will point out is I've got several other
jobs here whether it be to dev or to QA
to UAT they all are the same job they
just changed the target for deployment
everything else remains the same now one
thing you can do here is I would go into
these jobs and I would set up our
promotion so inside
Jenkins you can add what's called a
promoted builds plug-in and the
interesting thing about jank is running
in the cloud is that you can still
manage Jenkins so I can go out to
Jenkins and manage my plugins and I can
say here at the plugins I have installed
here are the plugins that I have
available to me so if I needed a plug-in
I would still add it here now there are
some plugins that are not going to be
easily added into Jenkins in the cloud
B's cloud or for any cloud for that
matter one of them would be the plug-in
that allows you to write groovy scripts
and run them because you can be very
damaging to the underlying
infrastructure
you know the virtual machines by running
Ruby scripts so yeah that's probably not
gonna happen
but the promoted builds plug-in
certainly and what this allows you to do
is to have a build finish and before it
goes pushing to QA or UAT
it allows you to define a user or a
group of users that can go in and say
yeah promote that and then another
process and sort of like a mini build
will kick off and move that file or
those whatever artifacts you have into
your environment okay and now I've
showed you maven projects here inside
Jenkins but you can also use Grails you
can use ant and with maven you can
actually use the maven plug-in or you
can just go out there and make
command-line calls to maven using
Jenkins so okay
so I kind of alluded to it I've talked
about it there is a major change in the
past landscape cloud Beezus they
announced on the 11th of September that
they are discontinuing their running
cloud they're becoming the enterprise
Jenkins company so they will still have
debit cloud so you can still run Jenkins
in the cloud but you will have to deploy
somewhere else
you cannot deploy the cloud bees after
December which is unfortunate they do
offer a migration document a FAQ that
explains how to migrate to different
platforms like Beanstalk Google App
Engine jelastic you know I think also a
medium Rackspace but there are other
tools out there like J clouds that you
could use right now that would be able
to push these applications that are
built in Jenkins push them out to those
clouds so you know you don't have to
rely just on this migration topic here
so what does it mean so obviously you're
still going to be able to use CI and
platform as a service and you probably
still gonna be able to do continuous
delivery if you can find in integrations
such that you can deliver to
environments from pushing from there
Jenkins if you want to use cloud peace
you don't have to you may because of
this you may side that you want to look
elsewhere and look at you know different
vendors like Travis CI or circle CI or
what have you
so why would they make that decision
well besides the fact that they focus
most of their business on Jenkins
platform-as-a-service has changed
drastically in the last two or three
years and I think right now a lot of
shops you know developers and ops folks
are not just standardizing on one layer
of the service architecture there's that
they are consuming different services
from SAS from paths and infrastructure
as a service so we're pass does remove
the complexity for certain things
it is not alone they're still using
infrastructure as a service you're still
using software as a service so then
they're composing them all together for
their development needs and you know
Amazon announced that they integrated
their V PC into elastic Beanstalk those
of you have not used elastic Beanstalk
it's I would describe it as Amazon's
on-again-off-again pass approach I mean
it's not strictly pass but it is the
closest thing to pass that I think
Amazon offers as far as I'm concerned
you can still use tools like cloud
formation and the CLI and it may be an
OPS works inside Amazon to automate and
puppet chef of course to automate you
know Amazon and reproduce some of the
paths functionality that cloudBees is
going away from but that's you doing it
so otherwise you look at other vendors
like open shift you know or Heroku or
Engine Yard okay which you know a lot of
times they're running on top of Amazon
anyway so
so when you talk about elastic beanstalk
I want to bring this up real quick
elastic beanstalk if you're going to use
that in lieu of run a cloud you cannot
build an application on the fly and
deploy it you have to first provision
the environment inside elastic beanstalk
then you can deploy to it from Jenkins
once you do that then it's easy you know
you you know I've got a parameterised
build inside Jenkins where I deploy out
to elastic beanstalk and if you don't
know what a parameterised build is when
I launched this bill I can set my
parameters for it you know life have a
built version parameter if I go out and
look at my elastic Beanstalk I've got
I'm running version 3 right here but I
could when I want to run this build then
version 4 will end up inside my my
elastic Beanstalk application container
so once you do build those environments
inside elastic Beanstalk you can start
to use them and elastic Beanstalk is
probably the most cost effective way to
use paths like functionality and Amazon
without having to pay for constantly
having environments up that you're not
using so
mm-hmm one of the things that lastik
Beanstalk is also announced as docker
have you guys played with docker anybody
docker not a lot docker could be in the
long run one of the paths killers
because you know with docker you can
stand up containers that allow you to
specify OS configurations application
stack configurations application files
everything you would need for a complete
server stack implementation you can
build inside docker and then you can put
that docker file up inside the elastic
Beanstalk and run it so a lot of folks
nowadays are using their own VMs and
using docker they may be running docker
on you know Rackspace or something like
that or even an ec2 so the fact that
Amazon's elastic Beanstalk now supports
docker is another you know has like
functionality that PA's benders don't
monopolize so it gives you as a consumer
more flexibility there's also the Google
cloud platform and today that they're
going to be introducing some additional
information about that platform some new
things that are coming out high-density
compute resources popular languages
integrates very well with Jenkins and
Jenkins and cloudBees as well one of the
things that I like the most about it is
live migration over the weekend Amazon
went down some of their ec2 went down
and coincidentally so did Rackspace and
you know I don't think it's unrelated
but they both went down neither of those
vendors have live migration meaning that
if the VMS are are suffering they suffer
VMware and Google they detect that and
they move it for you so that you're you
know there may be a brief outage there
but it's nowhere near what it was for
Amazon this weekend so live migration is
a feature that I would want to be
looking at if I were choosing a vendor
now you may already be locked in the
Amazon you know and maybe Amazon and
quite honestly with the tools and Amazon
brings to the table you could produce
probably something very similar to live
migration but why should you have to if
you're a consumer of that cloud offering
so I was going to show you and I left it
in here for a reason I was going to show
you a Bluegreen deployment and I was
going to basically built two prod
environments and have my DNS point to
one and then just by one little line of
a call to the B's SDK which is the API
for cloud B's I would tell the router to
switch to the new production so if you
do have the need to have production
running in two places one of them is
your real production environment the
other one is where you're deploying to
to replace your current production
environment that act is usually called
Bluegreen deployments it's not the same
as a B a B is about testing different
versions of your app you know this is
about keeping constant zero downtime
production well you know in deploying to
production so cloudBees made it really
easy with one little line of code I
could call their SDK and switch the
router over to my new production even
though the URL existed to get to the new
production it was not the DNS production
URL so it again if I'm looking at a pass
vendor I want that functionality as well
and I want it to be very easy for me now
can I do that with route 53 in Amazon
and load balancers yeah I can do that
but again automating that is all on me
whereas cloudy's took care of that for
me so I left this in there to kind of
give you an idea of what you should look
at if you're looking at a vendor and I
haven't talked to some of the vendor oh
I have not talked to openshift to see if
they provide that but that'd be one of
my questions for them so DevOps it's a
collaborative approach between
developers and operations and we know
that they have different needs different
directions it's meant really to break
down their traditional barriers and it's
meant for dev folks to learn from ops
folks and ops folks to learn from Deb
folkes and if you look at what's going
on in office right now with configure
and s-code with puppet and chef and now
even docker see your ops people are
becoming you know begrudgingly
developers they're writing you know
puppet and they're writing chef you know
the Ruby they are you know building
their configurations as code so they are
doing some development as well like you
are but you have different your measured
differently than they are measured you
know and that's why there's always been
this head-butting between developers and
admins there should be the same goals
though business agility that's why you
have DevOps to break down those barriers
or your business can move faster so
developers you guys are measured by
feature delivery and defects remediated
let's say those are two biggest things I
think we measure our developers
operations is measured by the ill ADIZ
stability reliability security
availability you know ops folks really
we don't complain about them or even
though they exist until we have to
complain about them because their system
went down or they did some change that
broke our application and then that's
when the firefight really starts yeah
the flaming back-and-forth between each
other paths can help you erect can help
you know break down some of those
barriers because it's much easier to
build the environments it makes it
easier on your ops folks now there are a
lot of shops out there that have
embraced tools like puppet and chef and
they have really been successful in
automating their operations to the point
where they don't need pass or maybe
they're using private cloud solutions
with puppet chef or maybe they're using
it up in ec2 you know cloudBees is a big
user a chef so this should seem familiar
to you guys
so DevOps in the past is all about
putting out the fire the problem is we
don't know who started the fire
so how am you guys have ever heard this
or even said this ok yeah how about this
we're upgrading our servers it should
have known
back to your applications okay how many
of you have waited for a server for like
weeks only to find out that when you did
get it it's not big enough or it's not
what you wanted how about you ops folks
you finally get a server out there and
you find out that the requirements have
changed or that the development team
gave you the wrong requirements and you
have to go back and fix it now it looks
like your fault
these are the things that we are trying
to get out of the way with DevOps we're
trying to create a more collaborative
cooperative team between the two
different teams so Paz and DevOps
obviously reduces their tasks logo on
your office folks more so than
infrastructure-as-a-service but again if
they've automated with puppet and chef
infrastructure as a service maybe just
what they need you know I've showed you
how to do to build jobs inside Jenkins
and deploy on the fly to build
environments you know that would to me
make it very easy for ops guys to handle
that type of thing now once they get
into requirements that require you know
additional network topologies you start
to step outside of the comfort zone of
pass and that's why a lot of shops use
infrastructure as a service if they do
make a mistake pass is all about
lessening that impact you can change it
very quickly you can fix it very quickly
so if you didn't use pads you could use
you can manage your own tire and I don't
know a lot of people that are doing that
these days but there are some fun some
folks still doing their own iron or
their own iron and Virtua is
virtualizing their own servers VMware
with vSphere be move and you know a live
migration that that's it that's a good
deal you know vagrant is another new
technology its new ish that kind of
replaces your typical hypervisor and
basically in a container model type way
so if you take anything from this slide
go out and look at docker and vagrant
they're not mutually exclusive they can
be used you know in the same server as a
matter of fact you know for those of you
that run MacBook Pros you're you can't
run docker natively you have to run it
either boot to docker or in something
like vagrant there's there doing puppet
and chef there's docker again there's
Amazon's web services opsworks
and then there's three new tools that I
want to show you because to me most pass
vendors don't do devops they talk about
it but they really don't deploying and
creating our environments on the fly
that's great it makes it easier for the
ops folks but that's not all that DevOps
is what about designing the topology
saving those designs and then using
those designs to push out that topology
into an infrastructure that is DevOps
and to me that's where some of these
other tools come in so the first one I
want to show you is visual ops and this
was a promising tool it is free right
now it's new so it still has a way to go
this runs on top of Amazon's Web
Services ec2 and there other associated
services and what it allows you to do is
to create stacks and I'm going to create
one in u.s. East because that's where I
hang out most the time in Virginia and
what this allows you to do it kind of
gives you this Visio interface it allows
you to design your network and
infrastructure topologies
so that should make you think right away
that you need to understand networking
and Amazon Web Services
infrastructure-as-a-service topologies
so from here I can choose an AZ which is
availability zone and you know pull that
over and drop it in and it automatically
wires it up to a routing table and then
I can choose from images you know Amazon
Linux 64-bit you know cent OS so I'm
basically depositing these over inside
this subnet and then I would wire those
together once I have this all wired
together then I would push it out into
Amazon Web Services and it would take
care of all the provisioning for me this
is getting closer to DevOps because I
can save this and I can reuse it
repeated reuse of this I can change a
slightly rename and I've got a different
environment set up this is DevOps okay
or this is an automated tool that helps
DevOps so
oh and one more thing I want to pull up
here before I get into the other two
paths is not just public if you want
pass you want to introduce that you know
abstract or encapsulate that complexity
to your end-users internally to your
company you can run private paths
offerings one of the most well known
probably and that they're up on the exit
exhibition hall this week is jelastic
you can run jelastic in a private cloud
and get all the functionality that you
need from paths without having to go out
to the public cloud so visual ops I
showed you a little bit it's promising
tool it's free right now I don't know
how much it's going to cost later it
kind of has the same focus as cloud
formation it differs from ops work and
that it's a top-down approach like
building web services you would define
them design them and then declare them
and use them so it's a top-down approach
for for ops for infrastructure as a
service as well the trade-off you better
be willing to give up some API keys and
account information to be able to use
visual ops inside Amazon and you also
have to be knowledgeable about
infrastructure as a service how Amazon
does it as well as traditional
networking topologies jelastic I can
show you jelastic as well they they tell
me they're a software company they're
not a cloud company they build software
to help the cloud their platform as
infrastructure meaning that you can use
jelastic as pass you can also use it and
go below the pass layer into
infrastructure as a service and I'll
skip right to the demo of jelastic now
I'm running jelastic in one of their
partners that's how you run it publicly
they have a lot of partners running
their jelastic cloud software and
essentially what I've got here is an
environment where I can go out in adjust
topologies and I can adjust the size of
containers very similar to what I could
do inside cloud bees
I can add
load balancing and this would be an
engine X server and put multiple nodes
out here so I really like the jelastic
offering and so does some of the folks
at cloud because they wrote some
migration information to migrate
applications over to jelastic again you
can run this privately or there are
multiple vendors including a couple in
North America several in Europe to do
jelastic public you know PA's or
platform as infrastructure
finally I got a demo of sky tap while I
was here and if you havenÃµt seen this
tool then do yourself a favor if you're
an ops person in general go up there to
the exhibition hall and see sky tap sky
tap is focused primarily on
non-production
what sky tap allows you to do is if
you're already familiar with puppet and
chef and you provision environments
inside sky taps cloud with puppet or
chef you can use sky tap to blueprint
those environments and then from those
blueprints create templates that you can
now reuse to create the entire stack of
the environment including the operating
system all the way up to the application
itself and you can take that template
and send it to somebody who wants to see
that entire stack you can save them off
modify them so it's a really nice way
for an ops person to both design and
capture and reproduce and end stacks so
sky tap is you know one of my favorites
right now especially for DevOps and they
also offer a restful api
I'll just stay on here I won't go out
for the interest of time we've got like
three minutes
so we're ending we're almost to
questions number and I can have a lot of
time for questions but I'll stay here
for a couple minutes how the how do your
vendors if you're looking at pass how do
they handle isolation versus density you
know I showed you how cloudBees did it
with LX ES and ZFS you could also use
docker for the very similar need how do
they handle security and compliance
again HIPAA you know business associates
that type of thing what are their
features do they have live migration it
may be that maybe you can live without
it you know I certainly do most of time
but it is nice to have what do they
support you know we're at a job a
conference but not everyone just does
Java or you maybe not everyone is maven
they also want to use Grails I want to
use ant or something else can you extend
it how extensible is it if they are
running on top of an infrastructure as a
service provider who are they using you
need to know that can you avoid stack
lock-in for instance an application that
I build an Tomcat that uses REST API is
let's say Jersey not gonna run in jboss
or wildfly that's using rest easy as the
Jersey as the rest api so you need to
know those types of things what kind of
changes your application is going to
have to be made to be able to use it
okay that was it I took up almost the
entire hour so I apologize for that
are there any questions out there with
regards to what I said or anybody want
to shoot me down based on what I said
yeah
yeah it's very it's similar yes
yeah exactly can you can you use cloud
formation and other Amazon tools
absolutely if you don't have the
wherewithal to do that or the knowledge
or you don't want to take that learning
curve then yeah yeah there's a trade-off
I mean if you think you can do it and
you're doing well with it then it may
not be what you need but for those folks
who don't want to have that as one of
their competitive and advantages sky tap
may be a tool for you any questions
oh yes sir
the impact of
okay so what you strive to do when your
impasse if you're gonna if you're gonna
consume a pass offering then your
application should be such that it
doesn't need specific GC settings and if
it does then you have to talk with your
vendor to see if they would allow you to
put in configuration such that you
changed the JVM GC settings based on
your application now we all know running
a web app or running a portal have
completely different GC concerns you
know in order to get that sawtooth
pattern that you want for garbage
collection in a portal you're gonna make
configuration changes yes
so not all pass vendors are going to
allow that now run a cloud that's going
away you had two offerings you could use
dedicated which you could do whatever
configuration changes you need it or you
could do multi-tenant which is what a
lot of paths offerings are multi-tenant
so in multi-tenant environments
especially you're not going to have a
lot of leeway to adjust GC like that but
again I'm not a past vendor so I
encourage you to go up and talk to folks
like OpenShift
so if you looked at some of the other
vendors like a prenda
so then I would automatically
perspective I like chef so I would use
something like chef but you could also
docker eyes it you know use docker
and reproduce the environments using
docker files so maybe you want to
research the docker but chef is
primarily how folks do that when they
need specific settings at the JVM level
I think I just want to point out this
slide Couchbase is one of our customers
and they're having a Couchbase
conference next week and so I promised
that I would put the slide out there for
you guys to see it in case anybody's
using Couchbase and one to stay out for
another week in San Francisco and there
are questions did I miss any questions
also be available afterwards in case you
want to ask me out there ok I know you
had a choice to go to someplace so thank
you for coming here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
