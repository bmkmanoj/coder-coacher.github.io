here at Oracle code Beijing I'm your
host Javed Mohammed with Oracle
technology Network and I have as my
guest today Corby Schmidt who is a
software development manager or Corby
welcome I heard you had a very
interesting presentation if nothing else
just from the title of it what are they
talking about
what are they talking about that is a
good question so we took a dataset
public datasets from the stack exchange
Network second change network is a
network you know where stackoverflow.com
is part of and we looked at the movies
and TV forum so we just took public data
set which is there available in XML
format and then we did a little you know
data science experiment on top of it so
we took the graph the data converted it
into a graph format and then applied you
know a bunch of graph analysis
techniques in order to identify topics
and especially you know what are the
things that people talked about you know
in this forum and yeah we we found you
know who are the experts in a given
topic you know what other topics and how
do these topics evolve over time and all
of that you know it's pretty
straightforward to do if you apply of a
bunch of graph analysis techniques which
is part of Oracle products today I'm
sure obviously with so much data and so
many findings can you share perhaps
maybe one or two interesting findings
you got from looking at all of this data
in a visual format as a one one finding
program we have is a you know we look at
different tags how the questions attack
with you know and we found for example
pretty obviously the thing is you know
in 2011 if you look at the you know the
Star Wars topic no one talked about
rogue one right but if you look at you
know some questions later in 2017 you
know people suddenly talk about this
movie because that's when the movie came
out so we kind of found this with this
analysis techniques and also were the
you know most activities that would be
kind of expected results of the thing
but is there something kind of that
really kind of blew you away from any of
the and it is from any of the data that
you looked at it was know not what you
know that the typical atypical now there
was nothing like you really blew me away
it was just saying oh one thing was kind
of interesting is that there's one user
who seems to know everything so not me
he's the expert in many different topics
and it was kind of interesting to see
okay alright okay so how does kind of
Oracle factor into this so you've got
some tech that you've got some
technology which you can apply some of
these graphing processes to you want to
talk a little bit about us yeah so in
this demo we used PGX
which is a graph analysis framework
comes out from oracle laughs you know
it's a research project but this is
already integrated in a bunch of other
Oracle products including Oracle spatial
and graph database option as well as a
Big Data spatial and graph product and
yeah in particular PGX
you know it offers two types of graph
analysis so one is the computational one
so it has a bunch of algorithms it can
run on your graph data but it also
offers the ability to query query the
data using pattern matching techniques
using worker pattern matching pattern
matching there and for that pattern
matching we invented actually our own
language which is similar to sequel but
it's you know optimized for for graph
queries and it's called t g qo p DQ g ql
p GQ prada graph a little acronym filler
yes another excellent so it's very
intuitive to people who know sequel okay
you can X Express very complex you know
linked queries on your data pre
intuitively okay you may be sounds
interesting if I say the customers want
to try this if developers out they want
to try this out is there a good resource
of
with the best ways of to learn more
about this PGX is available on on OTM
okay so you can just you know google
oracle PGX
and then the first download link you
know you can you can try it out and also
if you want to try out the product
there's also a way you know to get a
preview version for that but the
products they have a little bit more
integration into the Oracle acro system
you know so if you want to load your
data from the database you know then
then you have to use the product but
it's also a way to try out these ok all
right sounds good first time in Beijing
yes what's what's what's probably been
it just a short time same same here for
me anything stood out for you in terms
of vision I'm surprised to how modern
everything here so everyone now runs it
on with a smartphone you know
everything's likes for like advanced and
I was kind of surprised off you know
just a technology present here in the
city it's amazing you're gonna get a
chance to look around or to try and buy
some food oh yeah food yeah amazing food
yeah okay but tomorrow I'm gonna do some
Theresa saucer okay great
well thank you for coffee for coming and
for sharing thank you all the best
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
