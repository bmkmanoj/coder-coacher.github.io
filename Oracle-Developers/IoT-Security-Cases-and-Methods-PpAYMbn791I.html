session of Java one thanks for coming
I mean owner de Lima and we're going to
talk to you about IOT security cases and
methods and security is often something
that is not highest priority especially
if you consider the fast-paced
development cycles that we have everyone
wants just get the next product out and
they either want to receive a large
funding from a VC company and sell the
company before someone hacks you and I'm
gonna go through some stuff that is
going down as you create related and
also how these things can be prevented
how to kind of think beforehand on your
security aspect before you launch a
product and how you can use Java to do
this kind of things so a little bit
about me oh and one thing before I go
about me - this is my twitter handle and
some done some talks as well on here and
JavaOne about some other related things
and I'll be posting all my talks and
links on my Twitter handle like you like
promote it tweet and all that the pin
stuff that stays on top so if you want
to get this one I think also Oracle's
gonna give away like giveaway host our
presentations but you can find them on
my Twitter handle as well so it's all
about not me I'm Leonard Lima I'm a
computer engineer I've done development
from the embedded side up to the UI and
like a full-blown stack developer and
I'm originally from Brazil but now I
live in Austin Texas and I work for my
company if you come for 11 years and
we've been doing these IOT before IOT
was IOT it was m2m and like a.m. are
many different letters what is now
called a IOT and my role in the company
students you see the technologies and
see what's going on with the current
tech tech world and choose the best
technologies for our company and one of
my tasks last year like it was really
good a head of security because security
is getting even more exposed not only
that I'm also aspect lead of the one of
the GSRs for IOT we unit of measurement
and
how to talk about that on Monday and I'm
part of the JCP Executive Committee
my company is member of the GCP and also
part of the executive committee of the
JCP I recommend also anyone that involve
it and once you get involved into Java
join the JCP it's very easy you can join
as an individual and contribute to jsr
and especially before their final and
then we value your input on what we do
there and I would like to start about
talking about some aspects of IOT
security and when you talk about
connecting things the buzz of IOT is
connecting things so you can see you
could see on the you could see yesterday
on the demo like connected coffee pods
connected robot it's connected
everything and we've been connecting
things for years for our clients and the
buzz is always connecting things and
people don't normally figure out some
things shouldn't be connected and does
everything needs to be connected and
because you have to think of that
otherwise when you connect stuff can
happen to your things and in a study
that I quote from a study from Mecca
McAfee which is our Intel company and
they found out that attacks in Internet
of Things devices were increase rapidly
due to everyone doing a lot of things
connecting these all things fridges
cameras and whatnot and poor security
hygiene and high value of data on IOT
devices so and they tested 10 and on the
note on the actual PDF I have a link
linking back to this show if you don't
know the presentation and get this worst
of all these they tested 10 devices and
70% so 7 of them had security exposures
25 row holes of comprising the network
so you could get access to their network
from to your home network from your
device almost all of them did not
require passwords or like like cameras
that don't require you to reset a
password almost all of them collected at
least one piece
personal information and 70% allow the
attacker to identify a valid account
through account enumeration serial like
admin the foe user like these basic
therefore basic how do you say usernames
and passwords that they use and not only
that so that's a very like broad
statement but I'd like to bring to you
some recent attacks and exposures I mean
that happen and some previous years so
like two years ago like the last two
years so one of the things that are very
much targeted at our cameras and they
tested nine models of cameras and every
camera had at least one hidden account
that a consumer could cannot change so
that's one thing that people normally do
to help manufacturers have ease
manufacturing processes or it's a top
process you have one account that is
hard-coded and there are routers that
have the same things I don't it's a
common practice and the problem with
security one other I'm gonna do kind of
parenthesis here that one of the
problems with security is that it's a
direct opposite of ease of ease
so ease of configuration ease of access
so if you want to have high security you
cannot have ease of anything as much if
you want easy setup for your user you're
gonna have a lower security because your
user is gonna use your his phone and his
phone can be compromised and so you had
now have a lot security so it's very a
very big threat off and you can see
normally this hard-coded cat accounts is
very easy to be exploited
especially because using consumer
devices you can just go to the store but
I one yourself you have access to one
physical device that has the same framer
as well as in a number of them you can
temper the device and I'm not even going
to tempering device here on this
presentation because that's a whole
other topic they get a root shell to
your firmware and then they can figure
out what's going on and then they can
use that information to remotely
access your device so whenever in what
the key message here is don't think that
you're going to have security with easy
of access so it's a I know it's a trade
point but you have to think of it so
closing like the some links and I'll be
linking everything here like people were
hacking baby monitor stand and make
sexual noises through the camera so I
have a daughter and I have a two-way
radio and I could say goodnight to my
kid instead of walking across my whole
house she would say daddy and I had this
run so I got a two-way radio and instead
of she hearing me saying goodnight she
could hear someone making these sexual
noises and that would be very awful my
camera is not connected to internet so
if someone would do that he would have
to be nearby and that's one of the
reasons I didn't get a connected camera
you will be very nice to just take my
phone and see my daughter and if I can
do that most probably everyone else
could as well so that's going back to
does everything really need to be
connected to the Internet
I don't think so something shouldn't and
another thing that shooting our Barbies
so there was a yes there's a there was a
Barbie that you could talk to you and
they would use cloud services to respond
back and the there was a ssl encryption
floor called puto i maybe you guys heard
of it it was very widespread and what
happened is you could target these dolls
and be like I do am in the middle attack
and capture information so credential
issues and if you are parent with their
dolls with your daughter's doll or a
registered you can then they'll be
target of I don't know maybe identity
fraud or something like that so even
though IOT does it may be so hacking a
 sorry guys this Harry a Barbie is
not something like so you would say oh
my god I'm gonna protect my Barbie but
that also happens like you are you are
now a vector of a much larger larger
breach and that's a that I think is
worth considering as well
and so these Barbies it was a very
low-key and I found when I was searching
for these talk but another very high key
and I think everyone saw this picture
around was that guy's hacking the jeep
infrastructure Jeep Dodge they share a
platform called you connect and here I
put the description of the guy that was
driving so they did a and it was very
high profiled like the guy they had a
draw a journalist driving a car and they
hack it at 70 miles an hour in a
interstate and there was an 18-wheeler
behind this guy and they disabled
everything they could connect everything
and it was funny reading about it
because what they first thought it was
only Loco like you had to connect with a
car they eventually discover they could
use the Wi-Fi to the car provides and
then they could use any Sprint connected
cell phone to hack any connected Dodge /
Jeep car so and then you this can be
used so you're not you're now putting
lives at risk and you could potentially
hack you know the number are you think
it was 400,000 units across the whole US
and you know you can just shut down
everybody imagined a lot of cars
shutting down imagine the amount of life
that you can put away and kill and that
would be a very large terror attack made
by possible by IOT so that's that's what
people think that flying plane is into
into buildings is something bad but
imagine shutting down every car in the
highway it would be very awful so
whenever we make it easier for to get
access to a car we're most start and all
that all I can have you seen a Ford
commercial that the girls has and put I
turn on my car through my phone you can
now enable attack vector is much harder
so really does everything need to go to
the Internet and that's another bad
example I just the last example to make
it very short on examples there was a
real attack on electrical grid and in
Ukraine and they shut down in the middle
of the winter or crane his own then he
Eastern Europe they need hate and they
disabled a large part of the population
of Ukraine through connected stuff so
here it's a little more complicated
because it's it's not consumer you teach
not something that you see every day
it's and it was the first public
accepted let's say maybe they happened
before but no one said anything about it
but this one is it was the first public
one it was a very multi-stage attack
they did experian campaign to target
their operators and then they affected
their infrastructure they VPNs and they
the electrical utilities they used some
bad X bad how the same practice like
remotely they allow their workers to
remotely connect the SCADA system that
controls the substation so the guy could
just go and a dialog window popped up on
screen asking to confirm the action
which is turns a substation offline and
the guy was just trying to do something
with these models I would just hook the
cable out and and try to hope that the
attack wasn't going on anywhere but
thousands of people was there lights and
then on the link here so they did a very
throughout cover of this story another
horror story and why is that so many
different use cases and and the problem
is I think I hope it's real readable for
you guys but the problem is IO 3 is
messy because there's many different
aspects and many different vectors that
can help you I'll help you get hacked so
there's poor management like the guys
that are on a Ukraine facility that they
had these they did some bad practices
and they so they did poor management of
their security you can have device
spoofing arm in the middle attacks or
like the one or for the Barbie they
could just try and get in the way of
communication is exploiting something
that the the toy manufacturer thought it
was like ok and then you just got hacked
because of that there is more where and
of course if you do deploy a malware you
can
just dominate the machine and
potentially escalate your attack that's
one of the things they're craning
suffered as well formation disclosure so
you can get some information if by even
by fishing or like gassing passwords and
under knife you see mr. robot they have
all these kind of it's a series on on
Netflix that you can let flicks but I
see on Netflix now you can go and see
some examples of something that is being
hacking and hacking not using just
technologies just smarts as well and so
and there is also like denial of service
sometimes if you if you think you're not
even hacked your chest disabled and that
can enable something bad to happen as
well and so it's a lot of a lot of stuff
and that you have to think about and if
you try to do it all yourself your yeah
let me see I know no F word like you're
really I think screws okay like you were
screwed because it's so many aspects and
I've and I've been doing IOT for many
years and whenever I talk to someone
the only thing about your insecurity
security really do a yes it's security
it's not just a yes Security's a lot a
bunch of other things if you're only
thinking about encryption it's one thing
there's are a lot of different topics
and and I mentioned on my other talk we
talked about IOT development that there
are some people than some consortiums
that are working on that and they have
just published so the inducer internet
consortium publish this document a
security framework and it's I guess one
hundred and fifty pages describing all
the aspects of security so like
trustworthiness like the making sure
this you know that your system is secure
and it's a lot of things and you guys
are interested in this topic
I believe the documents public so my
company's member but I think they they
are not said on Twitter like we did this
so I think everyone can go and and
download it and if you are interested in
security this is a very good starting
point especially when you're considering
doing something yourself for and of
course you're not going to implement
everything but you can see the aspects
too
which you can go and look and see you
can also prioritize like I'm gonna go
after this this and this now launch my
product so it's kind of basically safe
and then the other topics as well so
then these was like I just a highlight
of the security trust and privacy issues
that it's on that document and so
endpoint security is knowing that your
den point is okay and secure and your
endpoint is who he is
so part of the security is also like
trust and Trust is also enabling and
making sure you know who you are talking
to so your when you are in you're
connected remotely specially you don't
know who are talking to potentially and
they have to identify themselves and all
that and one of the things that I'm
especially interested in is guaranteeing
that my systems are not talking to like
fake devices so a brief introduction
about my company we do IOT for
electrical and water utilities mostly in
Brazil like we work with more than 30
utilities and they entrust our devices
to be connected so we are connecting
recloser x' and electrical meters and
water meters and these guys read their
data and send all over to their billing
system so they are trusting our devices
and our everything between to build
their clients so it if someone fakes
their our device and send fake data to
our systems we're gonna send fake data
to their system and we're gonna charge
less for water consumed or electricity
or we could enable someone to go and
shut down their some cities in Brazil
some large cities not some Paulo city
but millions of hang Hampton cities - so
it's this is one of the points that I'm
really like paying attention because
endpoint security is key for what you do
as knowing that you're we're talking and
trusting the device that this should and
so communication security between
endpoints when you have days you can
kind of guarantee this one as well and
sometimes when you make
some people also just trust that because
you're using HTTP or some other secure
protocol like ZigBee des has encryption
on their payloads they just forget and
then take okay Dixie network is secure
so let's go and so I'm using a VPN so a
and then they forget there's people in
the way that can hack them and your net
you are now exposed like the Barbie and
so that's why just this guy does enable
almost anything you have to start here
and you can add on a separate layer and
I was talking with some people today and
I said yeah security true Security's you
have easement to layer and after you get
the data and another thing it's very
hard to do is guarantee that the data is
gonna be stored securely and not
tampered with so a brief description
between encryption and like privacy of
data and anti tampering and trusting the
data so one thing is not not letting
everyone knows what your data is so um I
don't know how many minutes I've been
talking I know that it is and I can hide
it this number and make sure that you
can never see this number another thing
is I'm guaranteeing that I talked to you
for 19 minutes so far and this 19 is
like a number that I if I sign I'm you
have to trust it came from me and it's
19 so for us especially for billing
purposes it's much more important to
guarantee that the data is not tempered
with if people have access especially
depending on where our meter is people
already can go up to your house and see
the number there so that's not much
issue privacy is not so much issue but
trustworthiness of the data is much
bigger that I'm saying this I've know
that in Europe privacy is is a very
important thing for especially for
utilities related IOT and so people
don't want the others to know and you
can derive like from IOT from this
consumption the meter consumption you
can derive if the person is home or not
so you can go and an advice like you're
letting people being remote
BIRT alized and I said I don't think
that's pretty much straight forward like
that but yes you can profile house
consumption and see they're gonna be out
from 6:00 to 8:00 every Wednesday and
you could could potentially then go
there and hack them physically not just
electronically sir and so how who-who
and how this data is distributed is
stored is something very important as
well
and and knowing that you are being
hacked so that's another thing normally
people take a while to them to discover
their hacked and this is something you
have to try and cover as well so this
first part of the talk is just like
exposing IT security like in very
generic terms and but we're in Java 1
and so I want to show you how we can use
Java for a more secure IOT and Java has
I'm not going and there was a security
hands on a training on Monday morning
about the JVM and how you make secure
code and all that and you and then the
guy was from CERN and they have lots of
and then even tweeted that because I
found it really really cool they have
like secure coding guidelines and all
that well I want to show you like
libraries that you can use to make sure
you're doing you're using enabling these
things that I've been talking like
trusted trustworthiness and avoid some
attacks and all that and Java has one
thing that I wasn't really well aware of
this Java has the Java cryptography
architecture and I put a link there as
well because they it's very well
documented and it provides a pluggable
infrastructure for many different
providers and capacities and things like
pkcs sullivan TLS and others other
standards for security are provided
through that so son Alex and now Oracle
has like stellar implementations for
this they still call the implementation
son and I think it's even though it's
not readable here but you can see here
on this on the link and just this
implementation if you make sure they are
not you
something else there's there's like
bouncy castle framework that is a very
good implementation of these and if you
can't use this for any other reason you
can use that directly but sure you have
a very solid foundation in Java to
enable a lot of security measures and
that especially the pkcs 11 pkcs 11 is
what you used to talk to a hardware
equipment called secure element sure
unfortunately I don't have a device
where a diagram of a device here but you
can kind of figure out from these boxes
you have a host which is the main board
that is gonna talk to someone that is
I'm saying it's a secure element and the
secure element is a hole processor so it
has a CPU Ram RAM and all that and a
crypto engine that is going to provide
you a safe place to execute sensitive
code and it's a safety place it's a safe
place because it is like specializing to
this and it has Hardware measures to
prevent tampering and prevent that
someone can steal your code your data
and it's so it's the perfect place to
store private keys and when I was
talking with the person that asked me
about this security and said hey as I
said how do you exchange keys and I
don't exchange keys right my keys on the
secure element so the secure element is
the guy it's like a safe that has one
key on the other side of the system like
on the data center I have another vault
that has another set of keys so gemalto
which one is one of the manufacturers of
these guys and I'm are companies working
together they provide either on this
form factor so this is solderable or
like a SIM card so the SIM cards that
you're using on your phone right now
implement this infrastructure and so
they provide the private keys on your
manufacturing plant so Mike my devices
don't even have that might not even know
the data we are traversing like we're
reading from a sensor well as soon as we
read it or we can run our code safely
a secure element to read the data and
then send it to their host the host will
do a package the will package the data
will compress the data will store the
data send the data away and but we are
never seeing that so even if someone go
and someone girls and take to our device
and try to hack in they are not able to
do much with the data and as Al's so
enables identity because you are doing a
private key so PK I'm sorry if I if you
guys don't know peak public key
infrastructure but if you have a private
key and you can verify through their
public key and certificates as well and
identity you know you're talking to the
right person otherwise the data will be
garbage for you so you can kind of
guarantee that happening and I i've been
using the DS on my phone yes we are
using these and other devices as well
and that's what we think that's kind of
the future and I'm gonna show you sorry
if it's not well color coded but these
are like how you use our like the Java
cryptography architecture with a secure
element so you just get your provider so
we are using this standard Sun and
that's what I told you the so called Sun
provider and you have a pin which I'm
using on a device at the moment and this
is like a weak point this is not how we
would do and your your device if you're
using a SIM card it has a pin you would
ask like weak point where neighbor your
phone you would say to the user please
input your PIN you enable connection to
a key store and it keeps this store is
the same key store you use for many
different other keys sorry
not just not just pkcs but also for any
TLS and other other secure connections a
secure communication on the job of VM
and you what this is a provider and
after you are you a digital provider you
can ask
for an instance so I'm asking here for
our signature instance so that I can
then get a key by its alias and sign the
data so here I'm not encrypting the data
I don't have care if anyone sees the
data I'm what I want to do here
I want to guarantee that this data is
coming from the device that has this
private key and and that's that's I
think it's like the number one when you
talk IOT and especially on my use cases
what we see is guaranteeing that the
data is not tempered with on its way
home and and like this is how there is a
stellar called Java card and secure
elements normally implement this or you
even see here secure element because it
is again home complete stack and we have
a very small Java VM here that has
applets it's not the same as the browser
applet so let's not go there and it's
also not JCP related it's very specific
there is a forum like that rolls its
development and all that but there is it
is a standard and it's not here it's
here sorry guys there's a standard as
well a standard way how to connect to
these devices and to this Java cards and
you can have here as an applet you can
have whatever code you want it's gonna
be very constrained the api's are very
constrained but it's somewhere that you
know the data generated there and data
and how do you same transmitted on this
apt you came from these guys so there is
a lot of things that I could go through
like trusted execution environment and
all that but that kind of not so much
related to Java so I'm sorry about that
and now because this was the last
session I didn't want to be one hour
talking to you guys yeah I think it's
already tiring to be five days on broad
so I'd like to know if you guys have any
specific questions we connecting to Java
or not I'm here to show offer my
experience or we don't have a mobile mic
I guess so I will have to repeat
whenever you ask go
yes you work with bouncy castle is that
it because you said we rolled out so
that's what I'm just trying to establish
yes my identity you know I don't know
your identity okay cool
okay cool okay okay no because I don't
use Windows sorry maybe sir
yeah do you know if she's it's I don't
know if it's on the path between like
the chain yeah so that like the route is
invalid right okay I'm sorry I it's very
specific and I don't work with Windows
for many many years
really I use a lot so because our
development we work with development for
Java and me as well so Java SE and Java
ME and Java me is totally different Java
me doesn't have this architecture for
Java me we use once castle for Java me
as well to enable encryption and all
that and so
oh sure sure so if it's open to decayed
something very different yeah especially
because it's a very corner case anyone
else has another question or comment or
once you know more I can that I can talk
to otherwise thank you very much for
coming and I hope you enjoyed the
conference and see you next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
