now we're doing a periscope and
periscopes live as well good
hi this is Laura Ramsey with the Oracle
developer community welcome to the
afternoon here at Oracle OpenWorld 2017
and I'm here with good friend Connor
McDonald how are you Laura I'm doing
great how are you doing it's been a long
day I'm a little snooze during the day
it's a jet lag but other than that it's
okay we all need a little snooze so what
do you think of the beer demonstration
over there you get to vote for your
favorite brew beers not too bad I've I'm
planning on working my way up and down
several times as we yeah
as the day goes on early and often
that's what they say okay so we need to
catch up on a couple things first of all
we were going to talk a little bit about
ass Tom we're gonna talk a little bit
about some of your pet peeves but we're
also going to get a quick little sequel
demo that's right so yeah um one of the
things one of the talks I'll be doing in
the conference later on is about some
cool sequel features and I thought what
can we do over the interview format just
with a very simple demo showing the
importance of quality code so I'll flip
to the demo okay
so yeah what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say what kind of hardware you need
to capture millions of rows so I thought
let's set ourselves a target if I wanted
to capture a hundred billion rows a day
okay what kind of gear do I need what
kind of Heroes I said that's a lot okay
it's a hundred billion rows a day so
ready go let's let's divide that buyer
in two seconds that works out about 1.4
million rows per second that's what we
have to be able to do okay so I thought
I'll start with I'll connect a Scott
Tiger I'll start with my laptop so I'll
get the laptop ago and give it a chance
so little Dell laptop okay it's now
chugging along and it cranked out 3,000
rows per second now for a little that's
not too bad but it's not really at the
1.4 million that we're after so now I'll
connect to a database that I'm calling
Ora underscore cloud okay and I'll run
the same demo you know see where we see
how we go so it'll chug away for a while
50,000 rows per second so it's embed
we're climbing we've gone from 4,000 to
50,000
for a second cool so now I'll connect to
a different database called exit loud
alright and let's give that a go so
we've we've sort of scaled things up a
little bit now this one runs for a bit
and this one prompts out 1.9 million
rows per second Wow
so that is gonna easily exceed out 100
billion rows a day sure so what I'll do
is let's have a look at the actual host
let's query the host name for all that
and the host name is XPS 13 which is
interesting because this laptop is a
Dell XPS 13 and in fact if I connect
back to this local database it's also
XPS 13 in fact I've been lying to you
yeah all these demos were done on this
laptop you're kidding me I'm not the
laptop will do 1.9 million rows per
second if you write the code well no
kidding so this was a demo of poor code
medium code great code and you don't
need an enormous amount of firepower to
get these kind of performance now if you
want real performance because this is a
bit of a fake demo I do as in it is
really that many rows but there's no
indexes there's no constraints if you
google for high ingest rates Oracle okay
the extradited team have done a thing
with Internet of Things where they're
doing over 12 million rows per second on
a much more complicated data structure
so the reason this little demo is people
are so concerned with are you know I
can't use the Oracle database or I can't
use a relational database if I got
Internet of Things and high-volume of
stuff yeah that's rubbish if you've got
good quality code you can do incredible
things with the database and in fact if
you need to do Internet of Things stuff
you can do 12 million rows per second if
you've got which is over trillion rows a
day right if you're just good Hardware
right code good code so there we go
sounds my little demo for you I like
that even if it was kind of like sneaky
but they have good to the left off yes
is a great little laptop oh my goodness
all right so tell me
what's next on our little agenda oh my
here we go okay I thought we'd grab
something from the keynote yesterday
thank you so this is just a screen grab
I've done a lot of traveling through
India this year and in India hundred
thousand DBAs there's a lot of DBAs and
one of the common questions we have in
all the seminars we do there is as
they're more cloud databases come along
and of course last night's the
autonomous database mm-hm
am I going to be out of a job yeah
changing exactly and and I was really
thrilled that that you know mr. Ellison
put this slide up because it's the most
common question and and I thought that
the slide itself really captured the
essence of what I view as the whole
Oracle professional career and that is
for the same reason that when people ask
me is the cloud gonna take my job
I say it's actually the opposite because
every DBA is every DBA for airing on
Oracle professional has a whole stack of
really cool stuff they like to do yeah
and a whole stack of really boring dull
stuff yes and the best thing is
automation takes away all the dull stuff
yeah now if your so there's two kinds of
people out there the people who are
going this is fantastic because now my
whole job will be actually not the
mundane it's actually the stuff that's
closer to my customers closest to might
the people my business requirements the
things that people are asking me to do
so you actually get to apply your
knowledge of business nuance to actually
yo yeah you have an interesting job now
right the boring stuffs gone now some
people said to me well but all I do is
the dull stuff and and I say well to be
honest you don't want to be spending
your life doing that yes there's nothing
worse than going to work and going I'm
gonna hate the next eight hours yeah
so I actually see it as win-win yeah I'm
a huge fan of this autonomous database
and the automation and and databases
move into cloud because I actually think
it frees up DBAs to actually have a more
fulfilling career uh-huh so some people
may disagree and maybe I think I'm too
optimistic but that's how I think all
this yeah this is a great opportunity
it's not it's not a
bad thing it's actually an awesome thing
I would agree however how do you think
this autonomous database is going to
change applications because what we have
to build our applications in a different
manner in order to take advantage of
that autonomous database functionality
um I don't think so and I think we're
bringing pretty smart he would bring
fairly cautious we're starting with the
data warehouse ok data warehouses are
probably the easiest thing to build that
autonomy into because there's a very
common theme amongst all of it it's a
lot of scans of data yeah big analytics
big aggregation so the the use cases are
very common in in all data warehouses so
that's what we're going with first and
that gives us more time when we get to
the more mixed and more variable
workloads that's gonna take a lot more
complexity and intelligence on the part
of our autonomous software right and so
that'll come later ok so isn't that
where machine learning and AI and all of
that roadmap will start to kind of
converge with our database or is that
completely different no I'd say that's
the intention I'd say that the more
information we collect about how
databases are used the more we can
reapply that into actually the database
doing those challenges and those tasks
itself well how long because they keeps
your friends if this is Oracle 18 I'm
like 18 really ruin 12c man
yeah it's unless there's actually some
talks this week about the new naming
standard for record and 818 is I hate to
say it it's like a throwback to Windows
95
you picked the year in our case 2018 and
that's what you stamp on your version
number so I actually think it perhaps
makes it a little bit more add some
clarity to it sure because now we know
that our role 18 comes out in 2018 or
aqua 19 comes out in 2019 and we have a
nice consistent set of versions and
patches coming out now right
you look you know listen you don't look
convinced I am I I'm convinced that we
are going to be a very busy company if
we are going to put out one major
release a year we're going to be a very
busy company I think it's a it's a
necessary evil so to speak yeah in a
perfect world you do a release every 10
years and then we'd sit back to the
other nine and relax but the commercial
realities are you know companies need to
be more agile now yeah so I don't think
we'll be doing massive releases each
year I think we'll actually deliver the
same functionality and sort of a similar
time frames but rather than telling
someone we got this cool new function
and in four years you'll see it right
it'll be here's most of the the
important components that function early
right and here's the next phase of it
slightly after so it's getting stuff to
people sooner all right well I like it
kind of an open source build and you
know push the end of a model there and
and it'll be good you know I think it's
it'll be interesting because I was
speaking with some of our Java
developers last night and talking about
how they are going to shorten up their
release schedules as well and and how
they have to make some difficult choices
about you know when something as complex
as say jigsaw was can go in given the
time frames and so it sounds to me like
project management is going to be the
career path exactly I'm not in project
management
I'm I'd likely to ever be in project
management well thank you for clarifying
that then that is that was a very cool
part of his key his keynote so it's good
to see and get your perspective on it so
it's time to talk about our favorite
thing no not that but as tom is there
red wine wine beer as Tom passed on
let's new okay
Oh what is that control your excitement
Wow
this is the new ask Tom logo I'm sorry I
just
the web's web page set up and I don't I
I have to go back in and fix it now
so I'm yes ask tom has a new logo I like
them and it's I like in the fact that
awesome was always so upset at the side
for a while and there's all the nice
cleaner aqua logos throughout all the
products yes and asked tom has been what
I could scribble down in Microsoft Paint
so we've actually tidy things up a bit
now we have a nice nice new logo okay
but also it's actually the starting
point we're rolling out a new UI for ask
Tom it won't be ready until a few months
after open world what are y'all building
it in it'll still be in Apex don't go
one the one platform to rule on so it'll
be an application Express but it'll um
it'll look similar to what you see on
the developer Oracle comm portal the new
color scheme and the cleaner layout
because ask Tom is actually in fact I
might even have some stats asked tom the
first ask tom question was in the year
2000 so it's 18 years old Wow so it's a
bit long in the tooth in terms of UI so
it's been around in fact it's funny how
you see that yeah one of the columns in
the ask Tom system is time stamp which
is now a reserved word so asked almost
built before even the timestamp column
was invented Wow in Oracle so 18 years
of quality data in there but also an 18
year old UI so it sounded tired it up a
bit make it a bit more interesting and
hopefully make it you know more
functional for the people that use ask
Tom so we're trying to improve the
search facility trying to hook it into
some other facilities like live sequel
at Oracle comm great so there's a bit
more integration between a lot ask tom
and the other facilities that we offer
developers great and quick sequel right
exactly yeah good so while we're looking
at some interesting asked tom stats I
just thought we'd bring you up to date
with what we spoke about last year so
we're now it just cracked 23,000
questions answered Wow
so it's a nice little repository in
there we averaged about 300,000 views a
week and notice a lot of people who
don't know how to use no I'm proving we
just witnessed adding adding adding the
the finishing touches to their knowledge
way
yeah I'm not gonna be up here bagging
our customers and you notice I'm
using sequel yeah we everything
everything about ask Tom we store in ask
Tom we don't have anything else okay
it's only four gigabytes ask Tom it's
only four gigabyte size so you can
actually run the whole thing in Oracle
XE
so exci I hear rumors there might be XE
being updated sometime next year
yeah so yeah I don't know anything
official I'm not at that I'm not at the
level where I hear these things
officially so right I'm usually the last
to know
right after you but what I thought I'd
share with you is just some of the funny
things we get on us let's do this for
real okay so the other day we had helped
me with explain time that's a totally
normal question that's fair enough
but they wanted that for one of our
competitive products Oh super so we
decided you say we said we gave them a
link we actually helped them we gave
them a link to the db2 website listen
knock yourself out because Derek there
explained Flanders nowhere near as good
as ass nice well we had this one which
one to migrate off our record on the
sequel server as I can why would you
come to an Oracle site for assistance
for that so Wow
although one thing that actually one
really good result that came out of this
was we actually asked me - what's your
motivation and they listed a few things
and we said well you are aware that you
can do these equivalent or better in
Oracle using the following and they come
back and they said we're rethinking that
decision
good save good save let me get ones like
this Wow
what is wrong return here that's it
that's the question that came in then it
just says please give us the solution
and we said well yeah enough so we can
help you with that sorry yeah things get
worse we had ones like this the other
day you did not I'm gonna take that up
and I can't connect unfortunately we
went back and said core support at which
point they came back and said I need
your urgent response ASAP and the
answers must be as detailed as possible
you know I bet you that's how he treats
the waiter over it
- I want I want my taco sauce
immediately sorry
yeah that's already had so it's it's one
of those funny things though like people
yeah I see so many people with
conferences they come up and they say
hello and and you know most people are
just fundamentally last human beings
this is great it's it's a really good
community feel at the conference this
year especially this year actually I
think the new venue at the exhibition
halls been good it's more relaxed and
people are actually chilling out it's
pretty good yeah and when they give a
honey keyboard sometimes things change
so yeah we have a few things like this
sometimes in our time like I'm still not
getting a response although I hate you
for not answering my question really
they said that I think you stink that
was just the other day now you know to
be honest sometimes people go next level
on us as in to fart so I put the OH
okay everybody cuz the other day this
guy he says you March he's cut me at
dolls just cut me to the quick
I'm sure you put your sleeping you left
for the day
he's like the tears were flowing the
tears were flowing but hey that's why
people sometimes go on the other
direction really chrisx my colleague on
ask Tom yeah I mean he's younger than me
better looking than mean a cigar than me
so when he answers questions we have one
of his little followers just gives him
five stars gives them the love hats all
the time so so no so they're from India
she pretty much likes Chris Wow but what
we've been trying to do now and ask
Thomas we don't just try help the Oracle
community yeah yeah we take questions
about anything oh no here we go
he's like how do I build a house we had
that and rather than just blow them off
we thought well we said don't go with
sticks don't go with straw bricks
you never know when someone might come
huffin and puffin so ever now we had
this guy recently we're saying I'm using
word seven and I can't get rid of the
border around it and that's in Microsoft
Word Microsoft Word Wow
and it's one of those things where I
feel if someone has been that desperate
that they finally landed on ask Tom to
ask a Microsoft Word question they've
traveled the internet universe trying to
solve and I and I felt for him because I
use Microsoft products occasionally and
it's not a happy place so there's
probably twigged from guardians of
galaxy it's a good impersonation some
things are even that little bit harder
uh-huh because our website starts with
ask I think it often gets confused with
ask Dorothy
ask Betsy ask the Oracle you know people
come with their personal questions so no
no no and said will I have any more kids
in the next two years
just check the orb I didn't want to say
wrong side I said I said I hope your
ambitions for children work out whether
it be one to none or dozens well maybe
someday they'll come back and say okay I
have one more for you as you know Chris
and I took over from Tom Kyte all of the
legend yes one of the things Tom hated
was people using what I call text speak
or emoji speak in ask Tom so using like
tks for thanks or lol or stuff like that
and the one that he really hated was
when people said do you and just use the
word their letter U oh because you have
to save those two other key strokes
that's right so it's a database so we
can actually do some data mining to work
out so how many times did Tom lose it so
yes he use a sequel and we found a
hundred and forty six times he
absolutely lost the plot really we can
actually see some of those examples here
yeah we kept them all day and we
broadcast them out I do is this you
person quick
I did actually check with my good friend
Tom that we were allowed to use this and
he was he gave it his glowing
endorsement oh well good yes but that's
enough asked Tom time for me to throw in
some plates for you
good these are my talks for the rest of
the week I've been doing some talks in
the mini theatre but if you want some
real more broad talks right come along
to these ones on Tuesday and Wednesday
great and we'll talk about some cool
stuff that's fantastic
the other thing is we'll leave this up
for a couple minutes because people are
scrambling for a gum wrapper and a
pencil write this down of course but the
other good thing is since we have
included the session numbers you can
actually go to the Oracle OpenWorld site
and search on that session number in
about a week and your slides will be
available that's right all the slides
and yes and even we have a policy that
wherever we load slides to conference
sites we also put the same copy on the
ask tom website okay you can always eat
it from ask Tom that's fantastic if
you're looking for these sessions in the
open world catalog just type in Connor
you're the only colony Connor
Wow there you go that's pretty cool all
right well thanks for coming by
there's this pleasure I think we should
go ahead to the beer tent I think we
should we need to go vote okay okay
thanks so much see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
