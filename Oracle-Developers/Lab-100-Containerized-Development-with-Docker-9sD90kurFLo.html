development with docker hands-on lab
we're gonna start here today with lab
100 which is our intro to docker lab and
in this particular lab you're gonna
assume the role of Evan you're gonna
spawn up a development environment with
docker you're gonna go out to the docker
hub registry and download an image and
then get that image up and running on
your your local development machine now
to get started we've got our our virtual
machine here running Oracle Enterprise
Linux and we're gonna open up a terminal
window instead of our terminal window
the first command we're gonna issue is
actually to get make sure we're seeing
the correct version of docker
and you can see here we're on version 70
no 6.2 next we're going to go out and
issue a docker PS command this will show
us if any containers are currently
running on this image and as you can see
no containers are currently running on
the image after that we're gonna
actually copy and paste in a command
from our lab guide this command will
actually reach out to the docker hub and
grab an image called restclient from the
WV birder account and spawn up this
image on port 8000 to now for the sake
of time what I've done here is actually
sped things up on the download that'll
take a couple minutes but the important
thing for you to look for as you do this
hands-on lab is what you see you down
here at the bottom which is our status
code I'm going to go back out to
terminal window just so clear it out so
you can see a little cleaner and we're
gonna run a docker PS command and now we
can see that our rest image is actually
running
next we're going to go out to our web
browser in this case we're going to use
Firefox and we're going to see if we can
actually we're going to wanna see we can
actually access our method here that we
used for our container now one of the
cool things here is you can see a
baseline page and you actually need to
add a slash products to the end the
retrieve data from our product catalog
directly
and we're going to close this browser
and head back out to our terminal window
and next we're gonna do a couple things
the first thing we do is stop our image
so it will issue a docker stop press
client and then we're gonna start our
image up again with this command only
this time we're gonna start this up on
port 1800 2 as opposed to eight thousand
two so we're gonna start it up on a new
port just to show you how to do that so
we'll go ahead and start this image one
of the things you'll notice it starts
almost instantaneously as soon as we hit
the button there because we don't have
to redownload anything from docker hub
and if we go back out to our web browser
and enter 1800 - slash products we can
see that the new the same get method
works on the new port now last but not
least we want to go out and actually
issue a command called docker networking
stack and spec bridge and this will show
us basically the networking from running
for the containers at this point in time
on this machine on this host and one of
the things we want to do here is
actually scroll down and grab the IP for
our rest client container so that night
P 172 1702 we're gonna go ahead and copy
that I'm gonna just clear out this
terminal window and then we're gonna
ping that IP and here you can see that
our we're actually pinging the IP of
that rest service is what it is up and
running and that completes lab 100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
