with me today is rich bear the Ayatollah
of rock and rolla Grand Poobah of gfx
there you go all amazing city who made
all the slides creative okay so we'll do
just a very brief history of open GFX
because probably most of you are
familiar with it we're going to talk
about sort of the reality of project
where we're at and what we really want
to achieve and then the we'll talk about
iOS Android okay so brief history which
steve was on here for all the back back
back actually I was causing trouble over
at IBM and the clips in reeling
everybody so december two thousand days
a we sort of started this thing i guess
that's when we released a java flexible
dotto as you recall the 1 dot x series
was in a different language and didn't
really have very good interoperability
with java it seems kind of odd given the
name but that was the case so fast
forward to october 2011 when after
oracle acquired Sun and we had various
different you know communications and
they said why don't you just do it in
Java and we thought well there's a novel
idea so that's what we did it was more
or less light came on board because
shortly thereafter right because I was
appealing to like it's in Java now so
now it makes sense to me right and I
guess we there was a bunch of releases
and then we began open sourcing we began
open sourcing first thing like was four
years later yeah first thing was the
controls and eventually we got down to
pretty much most of the platform open
source so why do we do open source open
source is good because we like to allow
a free exchange of ideas the community
and the planet is much smarter than us
put together many eyes looking at
well you being the Grand Poobah the cans
yeah it's about Nora beans where you
know the product that we're building as
a developer toolkit and darn it if you
don't you know listen to your customers
and the darn thing is that there yeah
they can do this better drop the wink
and so why not work together all right
bill the ecosystem plenty of eyes on
code fix things right so I have some
experience of the clips with open source
so I guess the last thing is we're part
of the openjdk so we're going to be open
sourced it would be odd if we were not
open sourced as the Jacka is open source
be weird okay that was our brief history
mary had the lady on the wall oh yeah
let's go look at her again she's still
sitting here she says she's hacking FX
she's doing 3d on a mac no that's not no
it's not a mac you all right all right
really old ok so our sort of our open
source report where are we at today all
right so open GFX runs on windows mac
linux and vetted and vetted and vetted
uh I am listening ok King I'm gonna fix
a slide now oh you can it's it's
recorded they've recorded it it's going
to be on parlays everybody encourager i
won't do anything wrong juror no you can
follow dear if you want so um yeah yeah
so that's all the things open JFX runs
on and it's important to realize that
the open GFX is different than javafx
it's of course same code but when we
create javafx and ship it it's you know
it's different configurations for
different platforms and certain ones are
supported so in open GFX we run on all
these different platforms and almost all
of the code is already open sourced and
we are really close to getting the media
stuff finished at which point it'll all
be open source all the platform code and
the big question is when will the media
the open source in the complete platform
I would say by the end of the year for
sure
yeah I'm hoping for shortly after gentle
one but you know oh darn the lawyer
slide that says don't say anything oh I
forgot the lawyers i forgot the lawyers
imagine that you saw the lawyer slide
you've seen enough and everybody close
your eyes font is so small it's the fly
excrement want so you can't see it okay
all right ah right so we also have our
we have like a font code that has been
open sourced there's some font code
that's closed source that'll never be
open and it's not needed for Windows Mac
iOS or Linux and we're trying to make it
not needed for anything ever so that's
you know you don't actually care right
as long as your fonts are rasterize
nicely and they are rasterize like the
operating system which is looks good
right will you stop by so it's not the
situation like with OpenJDK where
there's one thing that's used in OpenJDK
in a different thing that's used in the
actual shipping bids we're using this
stuff that's open sourced amber the
fonts and everything and there's a bunch
of benefits to running the native
rasterizer so let's go yeah etc where
are we it should have been that's aunt
and edit and bedded there's a new term
today so and bedded a little mistake in
the guy foods includes the Raspberry Pi
and beagleboard and all those guys eagle
board yeah and you know it should work
on freescale and those things but it
will shortly we just haven't built on it
yet so
and bedded right so there's a running on
x windows or running on the frame buffer
of frame buffer those are the flavors
and there's also maybe gtk flavor which
is essentially equivalent to linux like
with the gtk stack that one I don't I
think is a theoretical possibility on me
yeah so like embedded is a general term
that we used to mean anything that's not
a normal desktop and mobile would be
like phones and tablets so the embedded
guys are the other things like whether
you're talking about in car dash systems
or home automation or you know whatever
sort of you're gonna have some little
chip some little bored that's that's
doing that work and so um I thought was
a question crash was what is and what
isn't bad and what is in it well that's
what I bet it is and each one of those
different devices have different
operating systems they're like all Linux
but it's some different version of Linux
Raspberry Pi has a its raspbian is like
a debian based but there's like all
different kinds and so how you write
your you know if you're going to have
Java fex run on an embedded system it
usually takes some degree of porting
effort if it's not the ones that we've
already done like raspberry pi because
how they deal with the graphics cards is
always different there's no standards
for that and so we can't always rely on
it being the same way and the good news
is as the coach open source so you can
go import it was a there was a off
yesterday last night Dave hill as the
guy you want if you're interested in
porting to a different embedded platform
so back to open JFX we've got the stuff
right yeah that so exists we're part
open JDK we've got all the normal bylaws
that openjdk has the good in the bad
back I didn't say that though it's
actually pretty good it's actually it's
actually really pretty
it yeah it's it's really pretty good
we've got a wiki with all of our stuff
the mailing list for all the general
discussion and then of course the bug
system it's all JIRA it's all pretty
good stuff yeah and we've got an active
codebase got teams in st. Petersburg
there's some doofus in Canada there's
the only one there's that but we got
people on the East Coast yes there's
people in the west coasts there's people
in st. Petersburg in France England New
Zealand Prague of course big one I
forgot so there's a big big team working
on this and coordinating and we have a
system where we have a master where the
final best bits eventually end up and
sort of two active repositories one
mainly focused on graphics one mainly
focused on controls and the change is
cascade through so the master is just
the stable release and nobody actually
works there so it's just the system we
have right now just pros and cons I
don't want to get into it it'll start a
religious war so and I'm hoping it to
make it change so so all of our source
code is organized into distinct modules
which are you know they used to be
really super fine grained but we've made
them so that they're sort of large grain
chunks we've got like seven of the main
modules you know five of which you
probably work with on a regular basis
and well this is goodness okay yeah
because when I arrived it was almost
impossible to find sorry it's almost
impossible to find out where things were
because there were so many little micro
things around and I suppose it's a group
hang right but there's break putting
things in modules modules is in quotes
because it's not real JDK modules we're
hoping it will be one day right but it's
really good because
the code there's a bunch of stuff in the
code that uses reflection because of
build systems things couldn't see other
things and you know it's it's easier
actually let's do the next slide because
oh okay fine I was expecting to see a
picture picture of modules but anyways
so what samajh it's just a direct train
your eye exciting come back yet okay
yeah there we go so those are your basic
modules and you can sort of see the
dependency graph between them base is
the base graphics depends on base and
everything else directly or indirectly
depends on graphics so graphics is all
the windowing and the in the scene graph
and actually drawing and all that sort
of stuff graphics is the biggest modules
you might expect JFX for a system like
a.j effects right and if you were going
to use if you just want to use
observable lists and properties on the
server side you could use the base
module but for any client application
your minimum is going to be base and
graphics and if you know you want to
throw buttons and things like that you
get any base and graphics and controls
and then if you're going to use F XML
blah blah blah right so there are no
loss rack up references as far as I know
so the thing will just fall apart and in
a sense then like pork what falls apart
look pork pork falls apart yeah on rim
so the thing is very similar to a rack
of ribs yeah and the builders is in gray
because the builders are they're all
different there they're getting along
over there over there over 50 so there
there you know so we do we need the
previous slide we probably don't yeah
like what is a module going to be other
than a directory you tell me every
blasted IDE it's a directory and if it's
not it's a binary blob of something then
and they all follow the same scrutiny
actually that is a good point there's a
standard naming convention and so that's
another thing that makes it better
because you can find there's a way to
understand where the code is right so
it's a lot better than it was previously
and all this was done at the same time
that javafx was open source this module
system was work together
I just figure it out and done so anyway
let's keep going here whatever you are
we right so things are in quotes because
a lot of this is just sort of folklore
and the way things work and it hasn't
really been formalized or written down
on on you know wiki's anywhere but I
mean if you think about it code does
have owners people who know the details
of it and you know can answer questions
and fix things easily in it and whatnot
and there is generally a single person
or perhaps one or two that you know any
particular yes slice right and there's a
one so there's usually a guy who knows
the answer to everything and it has the
final world there has to be a guy was
the final word how something should be
done or if there should be a semicolon
here or a space there are other
earth-shattering decisions but anyway
there's not strict ownership in the
sense of I can't touch the code that
Richard owns because he will get a
shotgun like that so and I guess
obviously there's cross-cutting like big
complicated systems have logging and
threading and stuff that just goes
across the modules Joe so here are some
of the owners and leads if you will that
should be in quotes to in java effects
and and it's probably news to my pal
Kevin that he is essentially the lead of
the I mean the technically of the
technical lead if you look if you you
know Kevin's approval on everything more
or less in that graphics area you know
but this is kind of by module and
there's its finer grain like functional
with within module yes it's the modules
are sometimes especially for graphics
which is it the biggest module there are
so many southern modules it so if I had
to choose a person who had the final go
a technic on the technical level right
so um this is a
no this is a working system not
formalized not yet formalized yeah but
we really want to formalize it so it
makes it easier for everybody else to
know what's going so cuz I know I have
this problem myself actually I go work
on something and I'm like I have no idea
who it is I'm supposed to even run this
thing by right right I've sometimes
surprised and sometimes it's yourself
that's like know it sounds well I
haven't liked the touch i do something i
was doing some such events stuff on
embedded and there's a few embedded
engineers but i don't know who's
responsible for that cuz it's not
written down anywhere if i have a
problem with that obviously everybody
else is going to have a problem that so
that's we need to formalize it and get
it all up onto our wiki so we kind of
know right so if you know this is kind
of folklore and if we don't have it
straight in our heads and we're open I'm
straight that's an overstatement but you
know how do we expect the open source
community know to come and harass
Richard when there's any problem in
concurrent right right so what do you
mean probably so we've got a build
system and it's modern and it's good yes
you don't believe it oh this is the yeah
the swing interop yeah it's not swing as
a whole that's all though artem is plays
a big role yeah as well which is why
he's the module ownership or loss of
that which part confusing I've got most
of it in my head so it's actually really
do most of it scary yeah which is why
I'm nuts all right um right build system
so that's another huge improvement that
came recently at the same time as open
source so when the code was refactored
two modules is also the build was
switched from ant to Grail and it's not
that the build systems are always awful
i don't know why they just always are
and I you know it's funny because well
no it's no there's a difference it's
faster and that's the difference line
it's a lot less code yes that's the big
thing if anybody knows why build systems
are always horrible please let me know
like I after the talk because it's
something I've always seen and the other
thing there was they tend to go oh he's
the build engineer put him there and
it's a big ugly awful thing and they go
oh he can't fix real cold will put him
on the build and it doesn't make any
sense at all that's why the heavy
rewrite this so it's flexible and
slightly broken yeah that's right it's
flexible and only slightly bro yeah yeah
okay so it works pretty well it's
described so so actually I'm very happy
with that and you can build it you can
go into the get this stuff and it's very
simple clone it go into the directory
honest you know the real trick is
installing all the native tool chains
but if you've got the native tool chains
then you're in business if you have a
Mac you have a Mac it's yeah you're
going to almost do it falling out of a
chair if you're on Linux it's almost
like a tanning up out of a chair and if
you're on Windows it's like getting hit
with the chair so I think windows you go
kill yourself on linux you type in apt
and okay incantation of garbage which is
what you generally do anyway on linux
and yeah call good everything is
beautiful and the icons are delightful
just know it's just the best so good yes
it is by gum by gum it is and I hope
you're coughing down all those URLs
because we won't never show me yeah well
it's true however it's a you know that
in the mailing list is your method of
communication well there are there other
methods but let's get on with it uh
nobody asked me that a binary stub was
and I don't care if I going to tell you
uh and you can run the test so it's not
like there's some cck or something that
can't that's right does not any there's
not hidden stuff so you can run all the
tests even all of the scene graph tests
that they ask you guys did with their
little robot that presses the buttons
and stuff like that is in there yeah and
I guess these are the kind of tests we
have and the 3d view where people ask me
about it in the FX booth and whether
they could get the source for it and why
not now there's also open source as well
so it's out there ah this is one of my
favorites uh you can use your IDE to
develop right away and that's really
good so there were ID agnostic around
here i hate eclipse ya know that the
it's a love hate relationship with most
things are too close to it have to back
off so i guess the employment important
point here is that some people use an ID
some people don't those that use the ID
ensure that the you can always use the
idea and it will always be working for
them because they were using it to
develop code and if it doesn't work you
know config file wrong then they can't
develop yeah it's one of those things
that you know as java developer you like
well why do they even have a bullet
point that says you can use the ides
yeah but you have to understand that
when you're building Java there's
certain things that are just different
the ides are not generally designed to
work with for example there are API is
that we can call in the Sun dot whatever
space that you can't call under normal
circumstances and we have to have
special compiler flag that allows us to
do that and not all I des let you
configure that sort of a setting um they
do but you can do gonna yeah and there's
the other problem which is the old boot
classpath thing right wrong thing you're
wrong right I don't want to go into that
d dive so there's a bunch of there's a
bunch of details so I made sort of that
more or less got it work and this is not
i mean i'm obviously a big fan of ids no
matter how much I joke about eclipse but
obviously you don't have to use an ID
you know yeah just go nuts right so yeah
all right and you can contribute and how
are you going to contribute well you're
going to follow the 766 you can't count
this the you know the six rolls my
favorite is the author which the slide
used to say what the heck is the author
do yeah and I found out so you know I
guess you can read it it's from lowest
to highest it's all like documented in
excruciating detail on the openjdk
website I should have two more things
that an author can do one is jeremy's
jbs is open you can add comments and
file button
oh thank you so much what a ridiculous
stop okay so um I guess the interesting
point okay so I ok the most interesting
role for a role for us is a sponsor and
that's I guess that's a place where we
need to do more work but we'll move
along her anyway the point is follow the
JDK system and hear the word it's
reasonable and become an author so what
come here so this is this is the
important you know so obviously if you
want to contribute you need to join the
mailing list the mailing list is like
the place and we try to keep the
conversation on the mailing list
strictly around the project and
developing on the project not about how
do I get help with this thing or that
thing for that there's the forums which
is very good so we want the mailing list
is really we discourage that sort of
stuff so that the mailing list will be
just about how do I develop on this
thing best thing to do right is to just
say I'm interested in this i'm working
on this and engage at that level and
yeah it was good yeah so I mean as I say
look for a sponsor oh wait go back the
bug report so after you've hit the
mailing list you know you'll you'll get
on there and you'll say hey I want to
fix this bug or I want to work on this
feature whatever there'll be some
conversation about it somebody will
always ask well is it in JIRA so or
sometimes you'll say is this already in
JIRA and some people say I have no idea
just put one in there or they'll say yes
there's these three versions and you get
you know all that information in JIRA
you can either fall if you need to file
a new one you can file a bug or a tweak
or a feature and then you'll coordinate
with whoever the committee is that's
going to sort of sponsor your work to
actually get it integrated into job
effects on the mailing list
and on the JIRA in order to get that all
finished so encouraged to work in the
open man yes and then sort of advice or
void private emails right so you can say
what these things okay so the difference
between a bug a tweak and a feature so a
bug Oh is the last one I talked about a
feature is a significant amount of work
that involves usually some sort of new
API but it doesn't necessarily have to
but if it's you know we have some metric
for it we call it two weeks and the
reason we do is because the process by
which we have to work with the testing
guys and the release team and all these
other groups in order to get some piece
of code into the product differs
depending on whether it's a small thing
or big thing so in JIRA we use the
difference between a feature and a tweak
to indicate which things are just I mean
you know I changed the parameter order
or did something really simple versus i
just added printing to the API so the
testing guys obviously are going to be
more concerned about the features that
are coming in light did say how could
you be adding printing two days before
we ship that's not going to work and so
so they need some way of being able to
track it so that's that's what the two
weeks is it's kind of a rule of thumb
but if it's any big significant new
thing it's a feature if it's less than
that it's a tweak and if it's a bug it's
just a defect it doesn't include a well
I think it should work that way it's
like well you know I mean unless we all
agree that yeah you're right it really
should have worked that way we we made a
mistake it won't be a bug it'll be
turned into a tweak or feature so the
bugs really reserved for you know it
really doesn't work
I just did a whole slide go okay so okay
fine so I would not always look anything
okay I'll say the first point okay so
you got to work with you work with your
sponsor and to understand what is what
is considered the good code i'll put in
quotes because there's a lot of folklore
around I mean not just things like
formatting and whatnot but naming and
you know you come to it's a significant
code base when you come new to it you
just don't have all those details and
unfortunately it all that stuff isn't
captured we hope hoping to capture more
working to capture more of that sort of
stuff so generally you're going to be
fixed when you arrive you have said I'd
like to you know fix this bug you're not
going to saying I'm going to implement
3d like that it's just not going to
happen unless you happen to be a giant
corporation with a horde of rabid FX
programmers in waiting so fantastic
organization yeah so in and for just
like really small things just attach the
patch to the JIRA but if you've got some
big large change you have to use a web
Rev to make something that people can
understand and that is the jdk process
yes we are at the jdk process changes we
will change yeah especially if they
change to something better yeah it was
what basis so this is the current state
of the earth maybe in that last name
product
I think he hit shift um so you know if
you have some code and you want to get
fed into open GFX you know once you've
got your patch you need to get some kind
of a code review of that and the code
review is not just a you know it's not
just looking for bugs but it's also
looking for stylistic things or other
stuff because obviously once this patch
makes its way into the code we have to
maintain it so we want to make sure that
it fits into the general way that we do
stuff and there's all kinds of you know
security implications on certain things
and stuff like that Bell means to get
reviewed before it goes in so so there's
a you know you have to go through the
code review and there's also if you're
doing anything that's a public API then
it needs to get an API review before the
code can go in so the public API doesn't
mean something that's public it means
something that the public can use so we
develop things and then if you can go in
there and then use it then it's
something that we gotta support so that
includes things like CSS even though
there's obviously no classism of the CSS
there's obviously the real API and as
we've specified is the JavaFX dot
namespace packages are all intended for
use anything that's calm whatever is
completely out of bounds will blow you
up right the java doesn't have friends
we don't have any friends no there's no
C++ friends so you have to use make
things public that you wouldn't ordinary
you ordinarily magic right and Richards
the gatekeeper of all API things right
so so I'm slow sometimes and i always
apologize for it but it's better than
letting random api show up and just I
mean I don't need to say these things
like naming our critical when you have a
big system and I mean we have a big
system because it's a it's just kind of
functionality yeah yeah I mean it's you
know so so I to keep it organized so
anyways hey kids just yeah because there
may be three different ways of doing it
they're all good but we got to just pick
one and just use
well I know lambda is the new way to do
everything yeah I had a lambda for
breakfast this morning okay now tracking
progress so there are Jared dashboard
we're talking about the way it is now
yeah we're still talking about the way
it is now and did your dashboards do
give you a decent amount of visibility
into what's going on so we try to keep
the JIRA up to date with all the latest
information what release the thing is
going to be planned for what has been
fixed what hasn't been fixed the state
of the bugs the priorities we try to
keep those and it's important for us it
at Oracle to keep all that information
up to date because our release
management team that's looking at the
thing and saying can we release this on
schedule and so forth uses all the same
data so it's it's pretty accurate we do
our best and we have sort of have to
keep up to date so there's dashboards to
keep track of how long bugs have been
open and everything else so we are part
of the JDK will be on the JDK milestones
and if you look on the JDK 8 you'll see
that there are a few GFX things that
have made it on there it was adding I
forget starting not calling main or some
calling main or something was on there
and but not all the things like javafx
printing shouldn't be and it's important
to have that visibility because if
you're waiting for javafx printing is
like I need to print my reports if I'm
you might might my system isn't viable
unless I can print reports for my users
then it's important for you to know when
that features coming in also if that
feature is going to slip so at any rate
that they're not fully integrated part
now but that's going to be repaired
right because up until a few months ago
we didn't have so much stuff open source
that so we couldn't really fit into the
open JDK milestone so easily but now
that were open source that's what we'll
be doing for all the night and stuff
Yeah right okay so and look we got this
nice girl again she's still got Tilda I
should have I bet to point out their
yellow she is yeah okay so that's that's
where where we're at but where do we
really want to be right open JFX we've
got some incremental improvements that
we're going to be making for example on
the wiki we need to do a better job of
updating the stuff that we have on the
wiki so that you've got really the
latest and greatest information that's
accurate both about the build system but
also about you know the architecture and
the design so that when people show up
and they want to I mean there's I like
there's a lot of code in the whole
prison thing and if you want to go work
on some of that prism or glass there's
you know you need to have some guidance
in order to work your way through how
that's all put together yeah you know
the current hosting is kind of you know
subpar in terms of its so it's like
mercurial point 92 or something like
that some really old version of material
so we get work done we have code reviews
stuff happens but I mean there's a more
modern development process that's coming
through of course this is these are what
we would like to do they look for a
large corporation you have that has all
kinds of requirements and constraints so
maybe I should have put that lawyer
slide by the way but we're doing a good
job mean all these things are things
that we're working on we're working I
mean we've got the JDS nows is it open
so openjdk has it has a jira that you
can put stuff in and then you know we're
working on code review tools and things
like that in order to make it all easier
yeah and then we you know it's not only
committers now but also cook authors
authors
okay I don't know when I'll thurs do I
just made it up but and in G so this is
go back so right now javafx has its own
jira separate from JVS but at some point
in the future that will get merged when
it does then the jira will be searchable
from google for because the jbs jira
anybody can go browse anything they just
can't write to it unless they've got an
account on the job effects jira nobody
can read it or write to it unless they
have it which is ridiculous yeah
completely ridiculous the difference is
anybody can get an account jump effect
but nobody can get in accounting so a
different laws soon there will be one
loses it'll be searchable level or flaws
that's right it'll be consistently wrong
we believe in consistent consistency is
consistently this good right so also on
the oh so OpenJDK is bylaws leave some
flexibility for how code reviews are
done to individual projects and so we
need to define formally what our code
review process is so that anybody who
comes in knows exactly how many
approvals they're waiting for or who
that needs to be invited to the review
and it's all and so forth so we've got
to figure out what the formal code
review process is and post that um I
came from eclipse where there's a single
master repository that's instantly
updated so if you're chatting to
somebody and you sick and you release
the fix its immediately released that
they can go get it and right now we have
the system where we're we're releasing
and that is replicated and replicated
through multiple repos and we're hoping
to move towards a single repo that is
live right so not having a whole forest
just a repo and then get to the point
where where we can just have one and not
multiple ones with team integrations
yeah so it will save the integration so
you save the integration but risk the
somebody releasing bogus code and
exploding destroying the universe Wow
and to mitigate that risk we're working
on this continuous delivery thingy that
will make sure that everything's
integrated safely before it gets pushed
in yeah yes wave your hands if it's hard
this is hand wave that's work yeah like
a cartoon character warming up all right
this is yours so no way you stuck your
you you put your uses your fashion well
look what are we doing now we're open
source there's a code base are we really
doing open development well we now we
are just now finding devil's advocate
here not everything is going on then
everything is transparent and if you
know we're bad boys you know the outside
world and I'm talking about you know
should be able to see or non committers
and should be able to see progress
people working because we have these
great teams do with all this work and
there's good stuff coming out 3d
graphics there's a fantastic new feature
that was added to FX 8 you know was I
able to see and which milestone that
would be delivered was able to watch a
progress well I could I could see in the
deers but I couldn't really you know it
was harder to follow what's going on so
um if you were going to get external
contributions and people excited about
your open source project they have to
see what's going on and they have to see
that in fact it isn't interesting and
fun if we will place to work and that is
what we are interested in so there are
some quote unquote open source projects
that are not actually interested in
contributions they're just making an
open source for publicity that's not
what we're trying to do we're trying to
make a real open source project with
real contributions and so we understand
this is something we need to do so I
mean I just think that says level the
level the playing field um you know
there are committers and all commenters
are essentially equal
you know of course committers need to
abide by the rules of the jdk and also
the rules that are you know owners and
components etc but you know right now we
have a situation where we you know it's
not level that's all I'm going to say
there and I'm going to move on and
there's that beautiful I with the
delicious colors let's keep going okay
so what does open development mean just
it actually means working in the open so
there's a lot of right now there's a lot
of private exchange of emails
discussions design discussions a lot of
activity a lot of vibrancy it's just not
visible right now and you see the star
there okay like you're not going to
every stupid idea or whatever you just
not going to but there's a lot of things
that just happen discussions of recently
a discussion about how to close a jeer
or what should be in a jira and what you
know what's a standard way to close a
jira so that people can follow along and
if the problem hop is again they can see
what code set what change that was
supposed to fix the problem and all that
the discussion of how what we were going
to do was all going on a private list
I'm I'm ashamed to say okay and that's
something that the community should see
because um you know they might have
ideas there but more importantly they
have to know how to do these things and
they have to know you know so um yeah
that kind of anger question gets asked
because you can get involved and
uploaded then you get
so we have the tools that we have are
right now is the tools that we have but
that's a great yeah good tool so I mean
the thing the thing was I'm talking
about my experience at at Eclipse and we
were working in the open and we were
accused often of not doing that it was
hammered into us when someone sent you
an email saying bug whatever or whatever
you'd say can you ask that question
again on the list so that if somebody
else I mean it's so that other people
could follow along they know the answer
or something right and so generally we
were moving people always to the wiki or
to open places where others could follow
along with the exception of people that
had like my product is based on this and
you know and obviously security now as
well right so you know I put no no no no
no but it's kind of an ideal and I mean
no private repositories obviously you're
going to have your tete some wad of test
code you're not going to want the Steve
junk code that tested whatever let's
just throw that our G to open source
it's there will be repositories of that
sort of thing that's just normal so this
is one that's coming up right now for
Java 9 and the update releases which is
planning figuring out you know we're
just we're finishing off the work on
eight so pretty soon we're going to be
doing the all the planning you know I
mean we've done some initial planning
for nine but we're going to be doing
like for real and you know we haven't
done one of those in the open before so
it's kind of a newt hands up if anyone
here who knows what's going into 9 no
hands Kevin doesn't Kevin doesn't know
either well who hands up and hands up
anyone i knows what's on the table for
going at denied okay so yeah so um you
know we've got some great ideas and but
it needs to be it needs to be obviously
available because people need to meet
them you know
no one's coming um the open status is
the really there's one for me you can
find out what's going on but you need to
dig right so um and you know when you
got this wrong and I got this wrong a
few times eclipse the you know the
community goes what you're doing that
it's like and then you know you failed
that I close yeah because you they
didn't get any warning yeah so yep right
okay level playing field okay developers
feel at home working on the project Dano
should be on the same level as Kevin and
Steve and rich danos a committer on open
JFX hey so he shouldn't be left on its
hey rich what are we doing or what's you
know all this stuff should be out there
and he should have complete visibility
and not just what we're planning to do
but who's working on what and he should
also feel like you know that he knows
who to talk to and the conversations are
productive and all that sort of things
so I mean generally I think the project
is a pretty friendly place so I think
we're in pretty good shape on that
except for Kevin thing everybody else
everybody's nice oh well hold on set
just want you all right go back right
this whole developers can influence the
course of the project I think that is a
very important point if you're if you're
a committer you want to be able to have
some impact on what it is this going on
instead of just always doing sort of a
mother may i but you know it's it all
works easier if everybody's involved
during the planning stages because then
everybody sort of knows and had input at
the time that all that was being done
and then once we set our course we can
carry on all right
we're just about the ends my friend and
um right so this was what I you know be
the happy hot a circle we need three
members of the audience to come join us
in the happy circle dance there's a
bonfire in the middle and what are we
burning swing that is so old it's older
than I am that's bad all right ah right
so I don't know this is the we wanted to
do better we're trying to do better we
have a giant it since we have a giant
ship it's been going along and it's been
working it's been it's been producing
tone churning called working code has
bunks whatever but it's going along and
it's work to be to do open development
it's extra work once you're into the
habit of it it's not but it is something
above just I fixed my bug and whatnot so
but we're just not going to get people
involved unless they can see the
activity and actually the fun that's
going on right yeah so anyway I think
that's about it oh ok I'm so mad about
this you wouldn't believe it I'm just so
mad all right your guys sick I'm gonna
SiC my god Johnno I'm yeah that's it
quick hi this is an open JFX talk not a
javafx talk I don't
no game room all right where are we okay
Wow so we put a lot of code out there
for iOS and Android and you know it's
sort of from an Oracle perspective it
was just sort of a research and
development I would say yeah but it
doesn't a darn good job so actually this
is typical uh having an initial code
contribution to bootstrap something up
and that happens all the time you don't
have an open source project you say oh
we're going to work on copy cups but
there's no coffee cup that's their
people have to see something started so
an initial code contribution working
code and whatnot is sensible and
reasonable and valuable and valuable ah
but you just know we have to run it on
right now oracle JVM for ya so but there
are there's BMS out in the wild wild
west of VMs cables are running on iOS
and of course Android is as as far as
the Oracles investments concerns desktop
and embedded work is going to get
priority it doesn't mean that we're not
going to you know take take the the
patches and things like that because you
know of course we love these platforms
as well but as far as what we get paid
for desktop embedded and that actually
makes sense because Oracle we are
committed on an open source project
Butler Oracle employees and we were the
head of work all because they pay our
salaries and you know so it's done it's
a darn thing that keeps anybody else
from not being able to contribute yes
platforms and actually there's been some
great contributions and the last point I
think is a really good one because Java
is used by everybody everybody wants
Java on these platforms this would be a
fantastic opportunity to someone to make
their names name for themselves because
immediately after I phone was first
shipped it's like where's the job before
it was the question and then the whole
political which we won't go into but
there's a ton of interest in there a ton
of interest there and it's a tremendous
opportunity for somebody to just grab
this thing and go right yep most of the
hard work has been done it's just
somebody's going to have to devote a
bunch of hours or to put it all together
and do something that works there's a
good initial code contribution in place
so and the last thing is true without
committing moments that's not going to
happen yeah current challenges so we've
got some performance problems there and
it's quite interesting you know
expecting a small device of perform like
a desktop is just not reasonable so
we've hit a bunch of these things on our
embedded systems some of them around on
on the smaller devices and that's the
nature of the beast and just some round
peg square I I know a lot about round
take square hole problems hugs but I
won't go to need any details there yeah
everything my dad yeah just it like
these are these are like fertile areas
for somebody who was interested in
contributing to this part of the problem
is investigating the performance issues
you know is it is it something that's
going on on the GPU side is it on the
cpu side what's you know where is the
bottleneck and if and if you attend our
other talk yeah let's talk whose name
escapes me at this point which kevin is
he made up a slide sorry wish where
where Richard will be spilling his guts
yeah and and we'll talk about you know
sort of the deep internal architecture
their design of these things but you
know the performance work is a is a
fertile ground and also necessary right
if these things are going to be viable
it needs to be worked on there and also
on the things like you know the web view
of media view and text entry and these
sort of things there's problems to be
solved in terms
getting the good native integration of
those so that's that's the square peg
round hole sort of issues where you know
there's work to be done there um right
you can't be you can't not use the
native entry right doesn't he just go
home with that right yeah so right all
right so get involved i'm involved get
involved yeah you know we will spend
however long it takes on the on the
writing like if somebody comes to me on
the mailing list and says i really want
to help on this particular thing but i
don't understand how this works I mean
we will put whatever effort it takes in
order to get that information how he
will write the answer in the mailing
list and I will tell you that you're
like what on the wiki yeah huge thing
and I'll give you data or whatever you
need to get you going point you in the
right directions all you have to do is
just be interested come along to the you
know to the mailing lists and ask
questions and we'll help point you in
the right direction and get you hooked
up with somebody who can help review
your fixes and all that sort of stuff so
there we go and I guess you it's a
meritocracy right so you ready earn
respect and one thing that didn't see on
your slide it
you have to sign the work
well if it's if it's a patch of any
significance it is to have it could be a
thousand lines but it's all just so
reformatting us that is it that is an
important that is an important point and
it was covered by the fact that we're
jdk and yeah and you got but but it does
it does it is worth calling out that
their IP essentially its IP restrict the
policy right we've like synchronized
when we did this earlier today it's next
time we'll do it on purpose I hope it's
not this is the wave on video no thang
happens okay question questions good
lord oh well so as far as i know will be
on material for until a long time well
personally I don't have any opinion on
it I'd be just as happy with get so we
don't have no opponent what's so wow I
mean I liked it I liked the fact that
get has got like the whole community
round about it at this point and there's
tons of you know third-party get stuff
streams and branches or whatever are
yeah they've got granted and usable one
anyway there's this yeah we don't want
to so we're not but we're yeah this is
the only going to war of get first is I
like it we're not get into a get versus
mercurial war we are part of the JDK the
JDK uses mercurial mccarroll is
reasonable like good yeah it's
reasonable so
I understand and and the way github
works as well for is fantastic but that
was a part of the modernizing stuff we
would love to do I mean weird yeah I
need like 20 lawyers there's another
lawyer slide and does anybody know a
good lawyer
what's the difference in your roles as
far as open
it's all open GFX the only thing is is
that we take a build of open GFX and we
test it and we call it javafx and
releases you know yeah the deployments
that won't be so I mean essentially were
there would be security discussions that
are not that would be there would be
Oracle private I mean stuff like just
like equivalent to anyone who said i
need this feature than for this you
wouldn't be telling their protea it's a
company private or what I can't think
the right words for it but every company
has company secrets that because they're
building stuff and planning to that they
just don't want that information out
except for for blackberry but anyways
absolutely yes absolutely we only have
one yes yep agreeing to take the code
happens within a committer who commits
and I mean you're the wouldn't it's the
same process well so that's going to be
part of the fun so up to this point
there is pretty much you know the
architect and the leads and the managers
and the product managers and the
marketing that all sort of get together
and you know whoever's been working out
the best it's their features and so so
you know we all figure it out you know
big product marketing guys have been
talking to companies and they say we
need this feature in this feature in
this feature and the developers say
that's great but I could only give you
two of those and by the way we have all
these bugs that we need to fix and this
other stuff and so it all gets sort of
negotiated that's always been just done
you know amongst people at Oracle or sun
before that so it'll be interesting to
see how this works now because I don't
actually I don't have like a blueprint
says this is how we're going to do it um
one idea is that every I mean what we
should do is everything should be in
JIRA I think we've done a pretty good
job of making sure everything that we
have on the table is in JIRA yes I I
think we should area and during the
planning process if we discover things
they will go into JIRA feature yeah it
would be nice if they were called out as
right well you got a little features in
big features right but the blanket
feature like this that's pick on 3d work
for example there's a juror that says 3d
work it's a feature right as we but as
opposed to tweak and bug be lovely to
least have those isolated some these are
the 20 or whatever well in the way that
the way that the jdk planning process
works is that you have these things
called Jeff
JEP s Java enhancement 8p pickle keep it
all a winner so they and they're really
pretty in depth they specify what the
feature is and what it is not and blonde
a la la la but it's basically just a
feature idea and then they've got these
things you know sort of shoved away in
some mercurial repository and then
they've got what they call the EF piece
which are the engineering something
something ok something's and this
basically all it is is it says ok we
sign up to do this feature and we're
going to pay for it in terms of
engineering resources and testing
resources and glow a lot so on and so
forth so when it comes to doing planning
for the next release one of the things
that's going to come up is this going to
say ok this great you've got some
feature that you want to do maybe you're
even willing to contribute the code for
that feature but if you're not going to
also contribute all the testing for the
feature then that means that that we
have to make a deal because I'm paying
for the testing and so now I need to
take a look at it and see if I actually
care about this feature is enough to pay
for it right so in that spare right this
is an open source project the Oracle is
putting a lot of money into and so the
Oracle gets to choose what they he wants
you know Larry gets to choose what he
wants his engineers working on and if
you want to work on something else
that's awesome we just need to make sure
that is you know going to be funded all
the way through so that we don't have to
know there's many open choices yeah and
there are many open-source projects with
big corporations behind them that are
providing the muscle doesn't it mean
that it doesn't mean that the playing
field is not level right I can all be
economical features or angle just I mean
so that's the that's the only thing when
it comes to the planning part is that
you know get it if it's some simple
little feature or something you know who
to put it in but if it's bigger and more
complicated then we got to make sure
that we've got all of the testing and
everything else all lined up and ready
to go way at the back
Oh
so you've got so you so you've done some
two or three picking before and you're
thinking right so you're like if I want
to contribute it into this how do I go
about doing that you know first step
would be to get on the mailing list and
then and then say here's a pointer to
our project this is what our project
does do you do anything similar to this
you know what suit because we have some
3d picking dude we make pick very public
API date no so that might be you know
it's sort of internally we're doing some
3d picking stuff so you'd come and you'd
say we've got this thing and these are
the use cases and here's the whatever
and when your conversation when Richard
says when he says internally obviously
means in the implementation yeah in the
implementation eternally there's some
private pic and code right well whatever
it just lettin us when it back to what I
was going to make our little before the
interview your agreement we don't work
very rarely will pay in this gambit area
code thanks for counting or very
occasionally we've done that that if you
go look in
openjdk our open JFX or space you will
see a few places where we set our I work
we're taking in this Apache License a GC
g string
perfectly
thank you it was this man here I there's
not that many I don't think that our
internal chicken wings in have security
ones so there are a few that should be
the art because we're not yet in the
habit they had to go through all this on
the aubergine cake list where our
internal sqe guys will file JIRA's with
internal URLs internal right if we could
convince them to stop doing that and I
think that's wow that is right and that
was part of obrecht's like the test to
make Tesla Mark yeah exactly so
yeah for most of those we still have you
I just ran into one today where there's
nothing in that bug report yeah because
yeah I know I'm and yeah yeah yeah if
you ask you that other open source
projects all work differently and our
policy is as Kevin describes yes yeah
yeah except you know at least there's a
bug report there says this thing doesn't
work just say put the description with a
little more generic and put that in the
confidential comment that at least about
it yeah but we can move we can move out
of that to having that stuff being the
stuff they reference also being yep
anyways then our hope is the default is
public somebody has to go out of the way
well applets are separate it's not an
open source yeah topic but I don't
understand the question really in terms
of how it impacts apolis but applets are
you know I mean they're there yeah FX is
part of jdk 8 so there's no yeah ND its
extension black haas loader thingy so
it's there and for you to soak in your
so can extend yeah
whatever how we doing on time anybody
must be are we over okay well thanks
guys and two minutes no we're over by 10
minutes yeah oh boo why wasn't going to
make it stay for two minutes good lord I
thought that's what yours no no fly be
free be free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
