drawing from we think it's essentially
you know Bob Bob and I are from the
Chicago jello users group you know we're
on day of the user group over there
we've a lot of help from other people
and we're going to talk about is
essentially what happens when you have a
user group that is actually growing you
know I mean let's do our looking you
don't have a hundred people now you
started have 200 so we have 500 and then
you're like wow different kinds of
problem and we're very simple people I
mean we really like three things we like
Java we like pizza and we like beer yes
so we're generally trying to maximize as
much of that as we can when we when
we're working within the user group so
you know dealing with these different
problems is going to lead to our success
to achieve those through things as well
so so yeah we're going to be talking
about our experiences and I think
probably the first thing we should
probably should talk about is how we got
here so what's our roadmap and why don't
you talk about where see Jack started
and and how we got where we're at now
definitely so so this is how the
presentation is going to go you know
we're gonna talk about our story first
then we're going to talk about how do we
grow our community you know so how do
you get more members how do you get more
engagement and then once you get you
know those members saying coming in then
we're going to talk about what does it
mean now to cater to these members no I
now that you have you know 500 members
right and some of the growing pains that
you're going to run into because I mean
with the more pizza in the more beer
you're also going to probably get some
more hangovers and things like that so
yeah working through that is also
important so just kind of rolling with
the punches that come with the bigger
organizations so yeah then let's talk
about see jug yeah so in the beginning
there was Brian gets no actually james
gosling the beginning there was james
gosling and he created job yes and then
fast forward 10 15 years um you know
Chicago founded its is you have a user
group you know our user group is you
know thing like 20 years old or not we
were I mean we were right it's right at
the beginning of Java so it's been
around forever but it
user group has his ups and downs I mean
it's we went through a period where you
know there was you know people signing
up because the language was new then he
went through her down because you know
people were you know discovering other
languages or they migrated away so when
Bob when I joined it's um we were on and
one of it down we're in kind of a bad
space I mean so Chicago as a as a
community still had tons of Java going
on within the enterprise space and the
suburbs and the startup space but as far
as community and having people working
together and coming to the meetups and
learning outside of say an educational
environment like a college they're
really the meetings were kind of on the
downswing I mean the guy left the the
guy that was running it left and started
doing Ruby so yeah that we had that to
deal with so we had some some damage
control to do coming in but the thing we
realize is we had to start with and get
back to why what the user group was
there for and what you know our goal of
having meetings every month or or doing
these activities was which takes us to
starting a mission statement and I know
it sounds you know so cliched and stuff
but one of the things that you have is
like you're trying to get your user
group to go from point A to point B and
the only way you can really do that
because it's is you can go many ways
about growing your guru so group but you
have to have a focus you have to have a
way for driving all your decisions
toward where you want to be and the best
way to do that is to actually have a
written mission statement and we
actually do have one and this is ours
yeah so for us that we have like three
big things that we're one hour user
group to do first of all learning about
the Java craft and what that means is
sort of like you know not just like
learning Java but the stuff how you
create Java how did you get you know
what are the new things that are
happening in the space you know where
are the other things that are being
phased out what are the news in the
environment what what consequence
ramifications are going with the Java
language all this we want people to know
you know and that's one of the first
calls in our in our mission statement
the second one is making a difference
which is
now that you know what what we're Java
is for you to actually you know be
actively contributing and making the
language better that's the big thing is
trying to make sure that Java evolves
our community helps evolve and lowering
the barrier of entry for people that are
just picking up because you can start
programming in any language all by
yourself and not have to worry about you
know and just learn everything
self-taught but there's always that day
that you did arise where you like if I
would have known this five years ago 10
years ago that would have really
accelerated my growth as a professional
and the Java user group is really the
organization that provides that kind of
tribal knowledge of what would be more a
more efficient way to start rather than
reinventing the wheel on how you learn
language yeah and lastly the last thing
we wanted to do is for you to grow as
you have a professional we wanted you to
be if your job developer what we want to
make sure it's in Chicago that you have
sort of like a safety net you know
professional you come here they'll be
you know if you're trying to you know
it's brownie opportunities or stuff we
make sure that if you're willing to go
out and you're saying I really want to
you know move up or a bowl professional
with that we are there to support you oh
the and with these three things then we
can actually measure every decision that
we have against them and right if it's
the right decision so let's start let's
talk about where we started so this is a
typical meet up that we had starting out
so this is a couple months after we
started working with the jug and I
believe this is a meeting about Magnolia
which is a CMS that we had see a lot of
open chairs and through some of the work
that we built towards achieving our
mission statement this is a more recent
meet up at see Jack this is Jim Weaver
earlier this year talking about Java 8
they had to move the tables this is the
same room so you can see that the
community in Chicago we didn't add a
bunch of developers to the Chicago
market but we started engaging them and
getting them involved in C jug people
are coming to the meetings and they're
there we're providing some of those
things in the mission statement where
people are getting the help that they
need and coming to
the other and having those conversations
about how to make Java better so just
some more numbers this is the the growth
from our meetup site where you've seen
where we signed up for meet up early in
2013 started at zero now we're up at
around eleven hundred members this graph
tells us a lot of things about our
membership so what we're seeing is we're
seeing a steady increase so as we've
progressed through you know we're adding
members every single month and we don't
really show any sign of slowing down so
great you know we've to do this you know
we've had some great speakers in 4c jug
some of those faces on there so Brian
Fitzpatrick from google who started the
Chicago office that was one of our
biggest talks I'd see Peter Lowry up
there Ted Dunning Venkat sup their uncle
bob martin raisa and these are all
speakers that we've had within the last
year that has helped drive our
membership because one of the things
that we always kind of harp on is that
you just provide great content and the
people will come so great we've also
added some sponsors so when you have
people you need space form you need help
achieving you know a location for
everybody to come together and you need
buy-in from the companies that are
employing people in your community so
we've been able to reach out across the
spectrum and work with these companies
to provide space for these meetups
opportunities to tougher developers that
are in the organization to talk to them
if they're looking for new work if
they're just trying to even figure out
what's in chicago a lot of these
companies are our companies that i even
knew we're in chicago when i started
working with the jug yeah and with more
sponsors comes more beer oh yes because
sponsors are buying beer you know they
want they want our community to be happy
they want to have a good name in the
community so that's exciting for us and
when you have beer the attendance tends
to go up it's just one of those really
interesting things that happens I don't
know why I usual from here free beer I
would join any computer
so great numbers are up but what that
brings me back to is are we actually
achieving our mission so the fact that
we've got more people involved is one
aspect of it but as you can see there's
other aspects that we still have to
strive to achieve so even though we've
been able to get this great growth we're
still not there yet as far as achieving
our mission so one of the things that
you saw on the graph before is even
though the overall membership was up the
number of active members seems to be
doing this oscillating this oscillating
thing if we go back real quick looking
at that is telling me some things and
and really it's coming down to trying to
engage and drive active membership as
well as the overall numbers so that
brings us kind of to the second part of
our talk where we're going to talk about
growing a large java community and some
of the initiatives that we've put in
place to help engage people in in our
community so and the first thing that we
did is essentially have a newsletter you
know what once you start getting you
know 100 200 300 people sign up you know
to your site whatever tool they use you
use meet up yours your own you know
WordPress whatever it is you do want to
sort have this pulse do you want to
always have this message you know that
hey we're still here you know hey these
are the things that are happening and
and it doesn't have to be something that
it's a must-read but just the experience
that they see like oh there's always a
newsletter you know they might not come
back you know they might not read it
this month or this this two weeks they
might read in the next two weeks but
that you have them Israel is a
connection that you have with your
community yeah and freddie is being
modest because when freddie sends out
the newsletter there's this there's this
effect that I call the Freddy effect
because when we have sign ups and
signups are kind of down Freddy will
send out a newsletter and then the next
day the signups always jump by about 20
or 30 people so there's something with
doing that newsletter and driving
membership and engagement in
organizations so it's it's providing a
that kind of extra push to say hey
you really should be making yourself
better I think and and you know the
content and the letters I think helps
you know engage people and say wow this
is a talk that really applies to
something that I'm doing at my current
place of employment or something I'd
like to get into because sometimes the
abstracts they're at a very advanced
level and you know putting it in the
newsletter of why it might apply to you
can kind of give that connection to a
developer that's maybe just getting into
that field or new framework or something
like that one of the other things that I
think helps us is having a very diverse
board we have people the Java ecosystem
is huge so we're going to see things and
web apps we're going to see things and
embedded we're going to see things in it
in desktops &amp;amp; goo ease and things like
that so all of these people have
different needs and I think in a lot of
ways you can kind of get siloed on a
specific thing like performance or you
can get siloed on just the web or just
working within the spring ecosystem or
just you know there's a lot of different
ecosystems out there and being able to
have a diverse board and people that are
able to tap into all those difference
those different communities
sub-communities will call them can
really help add to the diversity of the
presentations the approaches that you
take in engaging people and having
people from different walks of life such
as startup so me and Freddie could not
be more different in their working
environment or professional even though
we both do Java our professional circle
is completely different right Freddie
Freddie makes things fast so that's kind
of his specialty whereas I'm my
specialty is more delivering things fast
and helping developers deliver quickly
Freddie's in the startup space I'm
working more in enterprise space so we
have completely different ideas on what
the jug should be attacking from you
know topics but at the same time having
that diversity allows us to say all
right well we can get all the
algorithmic traders that
want to make things fast and things go
and we can get that great speaker a
Peter Lowry them speaks on that topic
and bring him in or in my space where
you're looking at productivity and
languages we can get a Venn cap to come
in and give a talk where you know
Freddie you know the performance aspects
of Venkat stalk he does talk on
performance but it's more about
productivity so having that diversity
helps I mean the other thing is just
judgment in the community so when you
evaluate presentations a lot of times
you do get unsolicited presentations hey
I want to go in and do this and they'll
give you kind of an idea of what it's
about it helps you evaluate whether it's
kind of more like add we're coming into
your organization and it is fun it's
interesting because yet sometimes it
will come somebody will come with a
technology that is not from myspace you
know like you know like i said like i
work on on in gate to a CI working to
financial industry trying to make things
very very fast and then suddenly there
is a you know there's a presentation
about some kind of thing that is not
open source that is ship that is
actually a paid product but i have no
idea what they are and then when i go
down and say hey Bob have you hear about
this he'll tell me no no those guys are
commercial they don't there is not going
to be is going to be a detriment for the
community would bring them in and you
know that that kind of you know like
diversity is what prevents you from
getting you know that that bad bender
that bad presentation and we're not
against proprietary systems I think it I
think the the note that we're hitting
here is that there are presentations
that are out there to sell things the
things that really resonate with our
community is the things that I can take
home and I can experiment with and a lot
of that lends to and do stuff with you
know so open source or trial where where
the presentation is really about how to
use it and you go out with more
knowledge than you came in with those
are the types of talks that we try to
target whereas if it's just selling and
it's talking about how much money you're
going to make and and in different
licensing strategies that mean that just
not interesting to developers so we try
to get steer away from those types of
things and we try to target the things
that are technically interesting to our
to our users
the other thing that it gets you is is
having a diverse board allows it
legitimizes your organization a lot more
there's a lot of user groups in the
Chicago community all across the US and
the world that typically have a single
company sponsor and one of the things
that happens when you have a single
company sponsor is that single sponsor
has a lot of influence over the group so
if your sponsor is let's say a web
application development company they're
going to go for the web app kind of
talks and they're going to have that
kind of influence over your organization
and if you go and try to approach other
sponsors or other organizations to help
out they're probably going to be looking
for that angle that you're trying to
make with them whereas if you have a
board comprised of people that are from
different spaces that have a mutual
interest in the community not just
promoting a specific sponsor or company
it can help legitimize that hey we're
we're just looking out for the Chicago
developer community we're not here to
sell something and we're not here just
to promote a single company we're here
for you guys and I think our board helps
promote that ideology mm-hmm now this is
okay so one of the things they happen
you know everybody knows Oracle versus
Google we come in peace we get probably
like ten seconds before they kick us out
but recordings still going so that's
good yeah but no one of the things here
is is is part of being a store of your
community is you want to to just just
you know you're not here to decide who's
right or wrong you're not here to make
any judgments on anything but you know
it's it's it's what can you do you know
and and one of the things that you can
do is just get the lay of the land you
don't have to be political about it you
don't have to be you know the big thing
with API copyrights was like you know
well we don't even know where where are
we standing now so one of the things we
have which is pretty cool is because we
have so many connections we have our
University connections we actually make
contact with dill essentially there's
software legal the park you know they
the loss goals the law schools and then
what they did is and you know we sat
down with that one or we'd always
they're exchanging emails you know what
does it really mean that's dreaming
anything about this that's latest court
reversal and they were saying you know
what there's still a long process that
is going you don't have to worry about
it because right now it can go anywhere
so there's no reason for you to lose
sleep over it just yet like it's better
just to sit sit back and wait to see
when the actual the final decision gets
gets cleared but these are things that
we'd never liked it authors developers
never knew like I don't know what what
it meant because you have pundits you
have all the internet is saying hey no
you have to copyright everything you can
have permissions for everything you
cannot look at any other and nobody else
because they have those meaning many
conspiracy theories going around and
just a simple email and simple just
reaching out to your and universities
then they say like you don't have to
worry about it just yet and then yep you
transmit that message to your community
just telling him hey don't panic yeah
and I mean from the community standpoint
from the jug standpoint you are kind of
there to inform I mean there's there's a
separate level where you know they're
there are potentially opportunities
where you're there to advocate for
certain things but just realize if
you're going to pick a side you have to
understand the implications of picking
aside so the safer thing is always just
to inform but that doesn't mean you know
if you feel strongly and your board
feels very strongly and the people in
your community feels strongly about
advocating for a specific solution or
legislation or something like that that
you shouldn't go for it but the key
thing is and Freddie alludes to this is
get all the information out to users
first so they can make that informed
decision and they can help you drive
those decisions the last thing you want
to do is pick a side and then find out
that most of the people in your
community are on the opposite side or
maybe it's a split thing whereas you
just start a holy war yeah we haven't
had any experience with with starting
thing like that but it's you know we're
getting to that point where you know
we're trying to give that information
out there and have people be able to
make up their own minds but we would
certainly be open if we felt that there
was an opportunity for advocacy if that
arises
Freddy already talked about leveraging
your school connections so let's talk a
little bit about track specialization
this is fun yes so at sea jug we're not
just here to advance the people that
already know that what they're doing
they've been doing Java for 10 years and
they already know what they need to know
if you're new to java come to see jug we
encourage people that are new to the
language to get in the user groups
because that is a level that we can
provide mentorship at it's a level that
we can go to people and and help provide
that information that what did I wish I
knew five years ago and give that to
them if you're a rock star your ninja
you know your don't even have a word for
you because you're so great we want to
engage those people too so we have an
advanced track that covers the bleeding
edge stuff will bring in guys from
around the country that will talk about
bleeding edge topic so I mean we had Ted
Dunning who is you know his PhD in AI
essentially a I topics come in from
California from afar and and talk about
anomaly detection which math honestly
went way over my head it's stuff that I
cut that I touched on a bit in school
but I mean this is a guy that's wrote
written papers on it and is a thought
leader in that so being able to bring in
thought leaders that are kind of at the
bleeding edge is going to engage those
people that are those 10 year developers
and this happens because now once once
you start getting 500 600 user groups
you know if you have you know 20 to 30
people if you started with 20 to 30 they
will just come to anything that you have
to offer yes you know once you start
getting 500 600 actually it's not that
you don't want them to come all the time
but but it's if they start being more
choosy about what they got get to see so
so one of the things that we do ya like
we say we have our different tracks
including we also have a track for
people that don't like to go to meetings
and listen to people talk so what we're
working on is and what we've actually
started is is a maker track and it's for
people that want to build things so not
just people that like to come and they
like to listen and they like to kind of
hear about it and maybe they'll go home
and play with it later but people that
want to show up and build things so this
is this is a video from our maker track
that we had in June where we were
basically building programs on the Lego
Mindstorm there's a way to root it with
Java we were writing Java on the
mindstorm as a way to try to get people
interested in embedded program we
they're smaller more focused groups on a
specific topic we broke up into small
groups different experience levels in
fact most people had not programmed on
this platform before but by kind of just
working with each other we just kind of
learned things and by the end of the
night we had six working programs on on
the the hardware that we had put
together we're scheduled to do another
one in October you know the idea behind
the track is to pick a theme and get
people to come together and build cool
stuff you know it could even be hey
we've got an open source project there's
this bug out there and the journalists
why don't we all try to solve that
journalist or by the end of the night or
it could be verified raspberry PI's you
know that's been a huge theme at this
conference is talking about the embedded
space Haley and how you get things iot
so it gives you a chance to actually
work with people in your community and
one of the things that I've noticed is
is working alongside people is a good
way to find out like what kind of
environments you like to work in because
a lot of times companies that are
interested in sponsoring these they'll
have their own people come to these
meetups and they'll work alongside you
and you know if I'm looking for a job
the biggest thing that I want is is I
want a match I want to be able to know
that I'm gonna get along with the people
I'm working with and this is a great
opportunity to do that in your community
where you know you can work alongside
different people from different areas of
expertise and different that know just
different things and then one of the
things there that was the the second
part of the title so i says JCP grand
plan yes and what that means
is is in our community first we're
trying to draw them out we're trying to
draw the people that build stuff and
then once they start building stuff and
they're comfortable with folks are going
to say hey let's go and make Java better
so the plan is is to get all these
people out all the hackers out get to
know them and then let them contribute
to the community yes so if you like this
type of thing and you want to do more
the other thing we've done this year is
we joined the adopt jsr program so we're
getting involved in the in the process
with the spec leagues to actually drive
things that are going into the the Java
EE platform so we're on the 366 so I
mean that involves both offering
feedback to the specification you know
once there are I the reference
implementations complete some hacking
and and some some working with the new
code so we're really excited to get
started on that again another
opportunity to bring the makers out that
people that like to build stuff and have
influence on the community and the
things that are going into Java in
addition to that getting more involved
in open source I don't one of the things
that shocked me is when I found out that
there were big name presenters in
Chicago you know you come from the West
you assume everybody's out on the west
coast or the East Coast that are are the
names no it's not true if you look at
the maps of open source some some sites
have it where they they have maps or
where the contributors are from there
are people probably in your local
communities that contribute to open
source and getting involved in open
source projects is a great way to
develop your career and do good things
for the global community so again
achieving our C jug mission statement of
you know doing great things for the
community contributing back so doesn't
matter what your flavor of open source
is we're looking to try to expand that
and get involved in open source that
fine so great some of that's really
intimidating and getting started again
the maker track is kind of in place to
do that I know we've kind of buddied up
on some open source projects too just as
yeah
I was I was a Guinea a pic in that way
where you know I usually don't
contribute to open circles because you
know we're running and see jug and have
day jobs as well but uh but apparently
bumped us in sleep so one of the things
that happens is you know like you know
he slowly drew me and like this is what
we do this is a community this is how
you get your Apaches project going and
and we're sort of trying to do the same
for our members you know we first drive
with me and now I'm a contributing you
know openly God like you know a couple
of little files contest yes a test man
they weren't Foreman's test I am a
committer music that I complete I'll
take it uh but yeah and that's idea get
get people involved and help them get
into into making Java better absolutely
so let's talk about making a running a
large community so let's this is kind of
more the boilerplate that what we've
gone through so far as kind of the
ideology this is kind of where the
rubber meets these are these are the
real problems are you so but let's talk
about the good stuff why do you even
want to run a good community or a large
community so there's some really cool
things that happen when your community
gets big because you have influence and
people will come to you for things
people that run conferences will come to
you and say hey can you help promote our
conference you know or can can can we
talk to you about how we can get in
front of our members and it's trying to
find situations where it's it's a
win-win where your membership wins and
you know your your sponsor wins
networking opportunities being able to
kind of get in front of other companies
if you're a consultant or you're not
just if you're not working on a product
you know that networking is really
important in order to sell business and
be able to find work if you're a
consultant so providing the networking
opportunities through a variety of
companies is one of the advantages of
having a large community because you are
more connected to things there's status
I don't know do we get special treatment
no I really I mean everybody knows what
I think it does happen is is you once
you you community starts growing you
know if you'd have more as fierce
influence
in the rest of the community you know
like you know Brazil has a tremendous
influence on the language you no longer
has an incredible influence on on even
the things that happen here you know and
again this is not something you you you
just body around but the status part is
mostly how are you going to drive your
members up you know it's everything is
never done for you personally is done
because you want to drive the community
you have forwards so if your community
comes and tells you hey we have a
problem with this jsr or we have a
problem with the way they're doing these
things we don't like them then you using
the status that you have for being a
larger group then you come and say hey
you know what I would really need to fix
this or we really need to to amend some
some of this and then things happen you
know like you know Oracle will listen
and then they'll say like all the next
release this happened you know I mean
they have been Ilona has being
instrumental in doing some Sofia with
their legal stuff like you know
rewriting the way they they they embed
Java and then learn and licensing so I
mean so I mean its influence too so I
mean with those conferences that come in
you know if a conference comes in and
that they may ask they will ask us
straight up is how do we get your
community interested in this conference
you know and that is an opportunity for
you to help drive the type of content
that's coming into your home town so you
know they want to sell the conference to
people we want great content for our
users so having that kind of being in
that position gives you a chance to have
a place at the table when that's going
on so that you know they're there is
some status to that I mean it's a big
responsibility sometimes because you're
trying to speak for 1100 people and
sometimes you have to just ask those
1,100 people hey what do you guys think
these people came to us and they want to
make things better go you know and beer
we may have mentioned that already yeah
you know again once you I think once we
crossed you know 500 members beer pretty
much became a staple of our meetings if
it's a lot of things done and people
that really get them each other but yes
with great power comes great
responsibility so I mean being in that
position puts you in a place where you
may be getting perks
and maybe not socializing community or
you have to make decisions on certain
things so so I'm Chicago right we're not
used to controversy or corruption or
anything right right right so yeah so
this so it's interesting because what
happened was there was the conference
that was being planned in Chicago and
and they did a 4 pi so what I mean is is
they did something that probably should
have done or they didn't think PR wise
if this was a good idea but it turned
out to be a very very hot button topic
and then then what happened is is you
know people start this associating with
this conference you know I like they're
saying you know what we don't we don't
want to be part of this you know I mean
we used to love you guys but right now I
think you did something very wrong we
don't like you right now and then they
came to us if the conference wanted to
promoter in the game to us and and say
hey you know here's some free stuff
here's some free tickets here some money
here's beer what do you want oh we do
want a beer yeah but L but we have to be
responsive out it and saying you know
what maybe we're going to take a break
from from from promoting the conference
this year I think it's not a good idea i
don't i don't think it's it's it's great
for the community right now and and
those are the things that you have to
always think about it it's not you know
what they offer but what are your
members you know being you know what's
good for your members right yeah i mean
and you know your members are glued into
these these things as well so i mean you
can pick the selfish decision to take
the perks and run with them and it can
backfire on you so it's just a smart
thing all around is you know to really
be in tune with what's going on in your
town in your city so that you can help
advocate again coming back to some of
the advocacy stuff you know you could
make a statement that hey you know what
as a community we don't agree with us
either so when those things happen you
know you can influence that it doesn't
happen again definitely you know as far
as larger meetings I mean this was a
problem that we ran into quite
unexpectedly
when we started getting bigger speakers
suddenly we needed more space and I mean
the worst thing in the world is to have
to tell people they can't hum it's funny
because yeah you have you know you start
your groove you know you have 50 people
100 people and they're like oh here's a
spay like you have sponsors the hotel
y'all we have a meeting room you know
have 40 people that's fine and then you
just keep doing the same without
realizing it's like actually the
meanings are looking bigger and bigger
every time like boiling a frog all of a
sudden you realize every seat in the
house is full and you know they were not
happy when they show up and they're told
hey there's no lag ya know it's so it's
it's something that you agree would
really now need to start having in the
forehead you know once you past 500 it's
not everybody can but it comes with math
I mean so after you've done a couple of
meetups you can kind of get a sense of
when you have a big name speaker what
the kind of draw is going to be if you
if you take a very narrow topic but a
very big name speaker you usually get a
medium to large sized crowd because
people have heard of the speaker but if
you have only a narrow focus that helps
limit it if you have a very broad topic
and a very influential speaker those are
the ones they kind of grow exponentially
I mean so Jim's talk Jim Weaver's talk
was like really really big because he
was just talking about Java 8 doesn't
matter whether your embedded whether
you're doing web apps you're wise to you
so having Jim come in and people have
heard of Jim so it you need to plan for
a big space and we were able we were
able to do that because we kind of knew
what to expect and the other thing is
you don't want to burn your sponsors
either because what happens is if you
get 200 people sign up and half of them
show up and they bought food for 200
people there's some really happy
janitors that go home at the end of the
day if the hell that food gets left over
but some very unhappy people in the
building was wait for it right so having
a calculation to estimate about how many
people are going to actually show up
based on sign up is really important and
I think we figured you know our meetings
are free so people sign up and they
don't think anything of it if
they're not going to come so you know we
see no show rates between thirty and
forty percent on specific things a
little bit more the bigger than it seems
to be close to the 40 the bigger the
meeting gets closer to 30 on the smaller
the meter gets especially and especially
if it's hitting that upper limit like if
we set an upper limit and we asked
people to unregister because there's not
space left then the the no-show rate is
much lower because the people that
aren't showing up are actually
unregistering this a lot of people want
to be good citizens they just forget
yeah but you know being able to talk to
your sponsors about what you expect to
show up help to keep everybody happy
because the other the other flip side of
that is you don't buy enough food and
we've seen both happened not having
enough food makes your membership pretty
upset because a lot of them are forgoing
dinner with their families or their
friends in order to come see you come
see a talk and you know when we tell
them we're going to feed them and we
don't like them to be fit hungry people
are angry so you don't you don't want to
angry people on either side of that
equation bigger speakers and yeah we're
not talking about how wide they are but
that kind of plays into the food thing
so yeah so bigger speakers I mean so
talk about you know what what we've done
this year with bigger speakers so so
it's it's it's again you know once you
have you your user group you you attract
big names I mean it's it's it's easier
to get them you know they say oh ok is
it Chicago job I users group you know
they have they have a good membership
it's easier for you to watch or
facilitate and get those speakers in and
you know we we we got you know so many
talented speakers coming out and being
flown out just because they're like okay
this Chicago is it's a hop we see that
they have a lot of a lot of people going
to their meetups they have a lot of two
people that they contribute then they
make the trip yeah and the big thing is
just not to get intimidated because just
see a big name speaker at a conference
like Java one and you know they're kind
of their up on the podium and you just
like wow this is somebody that has
written books they've done things and
you
if you're you're a lowly jug leader like
myself who has not written books it can
seem a little bit intimidating but just
a tweet off to them just sending an
email you'll find out hey guess what
these guys are regular human beings too
and a lice talking in front of people
and they like traveling out to places so
you know if there's companies that can
sponsor them to come out if their
company just happens to be flying them
out there for a weekend you know they
don't like to sit in the hotel room just
twiddling their thumbs they like to mix
it up with people so hey just do a talk
while you're in town and then if you're
in Java one yet reach out if you have a
user group yet reach out to everyone in
here today speaking and then CC who
wants to go to your user group because
they usually do it and and it's a fun
right yeah just a simple hello after
talks or just an email you know if you
go up to one of their booths if they if
they're advertising here and just talk
to them you know usually the sales guys
are right there and the other ones that
control the budgets of where everybody
gets flown out to market certain things
you can get a hold of that then you can
kind of work through the chain to to get
them to come to your jug to speak for
free um so it's it's you know the main
thing just don't get intimidated and in
aim high you know the last thing you
want to do is say well you know we can
only go with this this person because
I'm you know I'm intimidated to ask them
some shocked yes no don't get then get
starstruck dropping up volunteers so
this is this has been one of the more
challenging things to do even as even is
a bigger drug trying to grow the
volunteers and the people helping out
with the people that are coming and
being able to facilitate the more the
bigger memberships yeah i mean it is one
of those things where you know it's it's
hard it's do we do this you know
everyone there's a user group leader it
is is a little bit of a sociopath in a
sense because you know we for a big to
yourself yeah well it says that we
forego a lot of things you know and you
know like you know we can go home and
then do something fun I could watch TV
it could do you know play video games or
play music whatever it is that I do uh
but but we decided you know what we
believe in this thing and we won
to do something about it and and and you
know there's not a lot of people like
that and and and what you want to do is
is is what we do it is is you start
seeing the regulars you start seeing the
people that come you know you have
meeting every other other week or you
know once a month and you see them
always showing up and then when you see
them showing up then you start getting a
relationship you know you talk to them
and they see you they know who you are
and then you know little by little you
cultivate those I mean we did have one
or two you know we captured that and
having one extra volunteer you know
helping usergroup it like it's a tenfold
increase on moving on this stuff that
you do so they're very buddy so when you
find those people zoom in on them invest
in them make them know that you want
them to help and you know if you can
engage those people and find things that
they want to do you know let them help
revive drive that you know and people
that have tried to run user groups and
have their user groups you know not
succeed you know those are people that
have been through this and engaging
folks that are there there's they get it
and if you can provide to say hey look
it's not going to be just you running
yourself you know there's five other
people here that are going to be helping
that like blows a lot of people's minds
because I think one of the things we
have in Chicago is an extremely
fragmented ecosystem we've got a user
group for Scala we've got a user group
foreclosure we've got a user group for
different frameworks even you know where
it's just like why do we have a user
group for that and so much effort goes
into building a community and building a
user group that I wonder how all these
people do it you know it's it's working
within the CJ we kind of branded
ourselves is a jvm group so I you know
if you're using Scala that's great we've
invited people from the Scala user group
to come talk at our presentations
closure we've had closure talks you know
it we've tried to bring things together
and the more think people you can kind
of bring together the more that they can
kind of see that hey you know what we
don't all have to be going out and
getting sponsors no we don't have to do
this a separate way we can all kind of
grow together and work together to build
a better commute
in our town which is kind of I think one
of the unifying things that all the
crazy people like myself due to run a
jug is you want to make things better
for the future for yourself for you know
your kids which might be sticking around
those are some of the things that drive
that kind of insane behavior now as
you're growing up or your user group it
starts coming bigger one of the things
you started have to worry about is is
how your presenters are going to be
reacting and and one of the things that
happened to us is is not to us
necessarily actually but you know it's
it's you see it once the presenter comes
in if you have a group that already have
20 people and it's already a presenter
put something up that they shouldn't
then it's a it's oh well you know 20
people saw it and then they're like ah
that was still II just move on once you
started managing a group that is 500,000
people you know it becomes an issue I
mean it's it you're not small you know
people are people are user group carries
a lot of weight so presenters you know
they cannot do whatever they want and
one of the things that happen to us is
we decided for the benefit of the group
that we have a code of conduct which
means that if you're presenting in our
group you have to follow these
guidelines you know I mean and they are
very easy so you know do not offend
anyone just make a understand that you
know we have you know essentially us
values because we do get international
speakers that you know what language are
different and where they think other
things are normal we're like no with
these are these are actually like the
values that we have here in our American
culture so you know and that just helps
you you know avoid that email exchanges
yeah I think being upfront about it
helps because otherwise the person you
know when you're a speaker you want to
be yourself on the stage and you know in
different contexts what you say might
fly in certain crowds you might say
something and it's not perceived as
something that's offensive you know
people around you get it because they're
all same cultural backgrounds but when
you have a large diverse user group
there's different values coming in the
room and if you can set expectations
around that I read the document I can
see that ok I'm going to my presentation
has to meet this scope instead of this
smaller scope that I'm used to I might
be a little bit more sensitive to what's
in it and kind of go through with that
fine tooth comb to make sure that I'm
meeting the norms of the place that I'm
at so the formal the formula formal
document helps it and even having it of
your officers you know i think is
another good step why a footnote about
bureaucracy with what bureaucracy means
is is usually as your user group is
growing unavoidably you're going to
start having more people getting
involved in the leadership and it gets
to a point when suddenly you start
putting process in place and and process
is not a bad thing but then you want to
what what happens is you want to be very
very fair and very very democratic and
then suddenly you start putting like oh
we need to have unanimous consensus for
making all decisions we need to do this
you know sixty percent votes for this
thing and thirty percent votes for that
what happens is you are going to need
this but don't put it in place until you
see there's until you feel the pain and
the reason why I say that is because the
moment you add more bureaucracy the
slower that you use your group can move
because then what happens is again we
are all disconnected in the sense that
you know we we work we have a diverse
board they work some of them work in the
city some of them work somewhere else
and and to get together for doing a boat
is very very hard just because you know
if you have two of them is easy if you
have three of them it's okay a little
bit less easy but if you have 10 people
that need to agree on something and make
a vote and be there at a certain time
then that's hard and then what happens
then is you sort of like start drifting
and not doing anything and not making
any decisions for you group so it's I
think it will it's something that every
user group goes through but just bring
it not because you want to be fair bring
it is when you feel pains of you know
what we really
to start like we feel that that we're
not cohesive and there's really a need
for us to have a process in place when
you feel that paint bring it in but
until then if you if you guys are
yelling and then you're working great
don't touch it if it's not broken don't
fix it but yeah if you will find that
you do need bureaucracy I mean so the
sea jug is a corporate entity we have to
file taxes we were charity there's work
that has to go into that necessary work
for us to do some of the things that we
do but adding additional things on top
of that can be challenging yeah so just
try to keep things as simple as possible
and and you'll you'll be fine I mean
most jugs when you're under 500 is not
even worth having an entity or anything
unless you're trying to do certain
things with money but once you get
bigger and you're trying to do bigger
things that you know again it's need its
need needed complexity so as far as
sponsorship is concerned you know that
again plays into with bigger jugs so you
what you'll find is you'll get sponsors
that used to be able to work with you
when you were smaller but now they don't
have rooms they dont have space to put
people in they can't maybe facilitate
you know 100 people showing up for food
and you don't want to lose sponsors as
you grow really you want to be able to
brought in and make your organization
more robust so increasing the number of
sponsorship options and the way for
companies to help is one of the things
that we've done to try to keep folks
around and contributing so you know one
of the first things that happens is we
grew space for some of the folks that
we're sponsoring us constantly to those
people we've been saying hey well would
you like to buy food this company is
offering us a big space but maybe you
could go in for food and then you know
again you're still engaging our
community and you're and you're doing
good things for Chicago you know if it's
less than that maybe you just throw
money at us you know one of the things
that happened when you have to do taxes
taxes aren't free unfortunately even
though you know if you're sure you don't
pay a lot
axes but you have to pay someone to do
your taxes you know so that having you
suddenly have this need for money so
companies that want to be involved maybe
they don't have budget to do a full food
sponsorship they don't have room to do a
venue sponsorship okay here's three
hundred bucks we'll put your logo on the
site you're a friend of our of C jug and
going your way you get to talk a little
bit beginning because yep a little bit
at the beginning so I mean again you get
to talk to the community but you know it
you're you because of the amount that
you put in we're willing to give some
things back and even at a lower level so
staffing organizations we do work with
staffing organizations as well and those
tend to be smaller organizations and
targeting the things that they want from
our community and what our community
wants from them so kind of matching
interests is another thing that kind of
goes into sponsorship so staffing firms
may want your organization list and I
mean that's one of the things you have
to protect you don't want to be getting
people spammed on email but you also
don't want to prevent people from
actually hearing about opportunities
they may be interested in so one of the
things we do with recruiting
organizations is we try to take some of
that outside of the meetings with saying
look you want to be involved in our
community maybe hate after the meetup
we're going to go to a bar if you want
to buy the first drink you have like a
first drinks on me sponsorship and we'll
announce at the meeting hey we're going
to go to this local establishment we're
going to have a frosty beverage these
fine folks over here are paying for it
and if you need a job they might be able
to have something like that for you as
well so I mean the membership that once
that can go get it they're not being
forced to sit through it at the meeting
but and then the recruiting group gets
the people that are actively looking for
jobs because they wouldn't have gone to
the bar otherwise so just being able to
try to match interest where it's a
win-win situation where your membership
is winning and the sponsors are winning
is one way to get repeat sponsors and
you know even though we go to different
places every month it's great to have
people coming back from war saying hey
we want to sponsor this event how can we
get in
so that's actually I think all we have
to talk about but we have a number of
resources up here that we've used with
the organization just to help to run the
jog I mean so the very first one is the
jug leaders list and now freddie's
always very active on that I mean was
you want to talk about what you did this
year with your musical interests oh yeah
we organized the firs javab and Scott
the null pointers we're playing tomorrow
he says in a monotone voice even though
he's I think he's talked more about the
null pointers in this talk Sean oh it's
right there but yeah if you guys are
going out are going to taylor street
cafe tomorrow will be playing there at
five yeah have fun other things so i
really liked the book team geek Brian
Fitzpatrick was one of the speakers that
we had this year just on working with
other developers I mean needless to say
running a jug is a very social activity
and it's not something it always comes
natural for somebody in developers
because a lot of us get into this
because then we well you don't you're
talking to computers a lot of the time
and not as much to people team geek is a
great reference for how to work with
developers in any in a sustainable and
and kind of community building way
versus other ways that you can interact
with developers that are not as
productive and I think the the TED talk
over there the Nancy directors yeah
thats its yeah it if you're a jerk
leader and dude the presentations did
get her talk or do listen to her talk
read her book because she is a very very
good at how to organize and make sure
people understand your message so yeah
and then there's a double J's are you
know which is something that we
encourage any other user group leaders
to do yep and we'll have more to talk
about next year I'm sure after we've
we've been through it for a full 12
months yeah and at this talk so that's
the link just go ahead and and it's it's
open for anyone to get to see oh and of
course the people we've been talking to
at javaone so these are other jug
you leaders that we've gotten
information that run large job users
group so bigger than much bigger than
our some of them yep Frank Greco from
from New York bertman from the
Netherlands Martin ver burden yeah he's
London he's great from London but
there's a there's a host of people at
javaone that if you have questions about
running your jug that you could talk to
and they lie there are very very
generous with their time yeah you can
talk to us if you want yes yeah I mean
these are great resources to I mean and
people is is what user groups it's about
i mean it's its users you know that's a
group then and these are very good very
very approachable people that will you
no will entertain you yes absolutely all
right this is our you know Freddie and
Bob from the Chicago that's if you're
very interested you can follow us on
twitter and if you want to listen to you
know we actually have an active podcast
so you know we go you can go to java pop
has come and you know listen to our
melodious voices yes for having a beer
yes alright and that concludes our talk
I think all right yep so do we have any
questions yes yes
well okay so the question is how can you
reduce the Dino shohreh the no-show well
we actually have if you actually go to
the job of pub house website there is a
section we actually have this discussion
on the use of leaders and there's a
bunch of things they do the first the
first one is is is half of them just
work with it you do get a did you get a
cadence now you have you know your
number like you know every time I have a
meet up it's always thirty percent
people know don't show and then you just
work with like like you have thirty
percent people not join and then that
makes math very easy if you really want
to like get like even more firm numbers
um what you do is you do send an email
to your to the people to sign up and you
just pleat it saying please if you're
really not going you know just just let
other people go especially if it's a
meet-up that it gets fooled like he has
like constraints and it's popular so you
know if you have a hundred people and
there's a hundred people signed up right
yeah and there's people on the waiting
list and you do send it out and say hey
please unsubscribe is you're not coming
and we know things happen you know like
we told them that we know you two weeks
ago you thought you will be able to make
it and if you're not going to be able to
make it now just yeah and there's always
the mean so if it's if it's really a
problem I mean the nuclear option is you
make people pay oh that when we are
coming out of people's pocket they tend
to not like to let money go without
getting something in return even if it's
a very small amount we don't do that
because you know again our meetups are
we're trying to we're still trying to
grow and when you charge there's certain
people that they just they won't show up
and their way of your withdrawal and
we're trying we're trying to get that
person that it's maybe on the border to
come in and learn about it and you know
providing them a free option to do that
it kind of lowers the bar of entry so
that we bring in the maximum amount of
people yeah because numbers do matter in
this game when you when you're working
with sponsors and stuff like that
because that's the first thing that they
ask is it just a numbers game no but
numbers do help with influence and
everything like that
yep yes absolutely just well we put them
out on youtube or vemo or is what we
typically use for recording and we have
one that's actually a great question
because one of the other sponsorship
options we offer is just the video
sponsorship hey you've got a camera and
you want to record that's a great way
for a very low barrier of entry sponsor
that says hey we're going to provide
somebody that's going to show up they're
going to film the meetup and then post
it i know we ghost get it i'm posted so
yeah we're having a little collection of
videos actually we the lawn divert you
jog it's brother all videos yet all
videos so that so we we're going to talk
to them to about that so definite we can
help them I haven't found that it's
interesting though you so you've seen it
where it increases the no-shows if they
know it's gonna be recorded yes we don't
we don't record live but I've seen
whether regardless of what we do impact
no show rates when it's if it's snowing
I mean we get wonderful weather in
Chicago let me tell you so when there's
snow or there's rain or it's beautiful
out people tend not to chill out there's
the biggest sporting event it's hard
yeah we did we did one event unlike the
Monday the the first football game of
the season and and we had a very high
no-show rate for that that event that
was a that was a lesson but that next
time we do have to look at the calendar
see what big thing is happening yeah
alright question anything else or all
good all right
robot caster would Oh for running the
podcast is fun you don't make any money
out of it so you just do it because you
like it and you want people to learn
