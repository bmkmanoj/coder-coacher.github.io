myself my name is Rodrigo congedo I'm
from Brazil and I'm going talking about
sparring moody tenants applications
using Java EE technologies today so we
got and talking about the many uploads
about Susie the mutinous applications
inside of Java EE using JP a Forex
instance the persistence layer and how
to defer the tenant ID between our
customers and how are the strategies
related and we are going to talk about
some concepts also so if someone Arad is
working with moody tennis requirements
maybe the concepts are duplicated but
I'm going to talk about these concepts
also so that is not our goal for today
as I said my name is Rodrigo I'm from
Brazil this is my picture they draw it
in another event I was talking about
so I'm software architecture in a
company called integrities which is a
software factory company located in
Austin Texas and we are working around
the world with some developers I'm Joe
glitter of GU Java SC with a community
in our country I mean our city I have so
Java also in some problem I don't know
if someone knows it's a biggie community
in Brazil and this is my personal
context so this is our agenda for today
we are going to talk about the cloud
services model muy tennis requirements
are completely related with the cloud
model and we are going to talk about the
software-as-a-service e mark the mark
the char that is a big opportunity for
the future we already have a lot of
software running on these requirements
but we are going to talk about those
opportunites and also obviously we are
going to talk about mutinous concepts
challenge and strategy types we have a
lot of strategy types related especially
at the database side at the database
side we have some different approach to
persist the tenant IG which the customer
ID and we are going to talk about how
the Java offers some strategies and
configurations to persist the data you
know and also gonna talk first thoughts
about clouds and moody tennis related
that is our agenda for today so at first
when you look about clouds you usually
look those three models we have a
infrastructure as a service model
it's the comment and traditional model
that is offered by many cloud providers
around the the Internet
we have the Amazon we have the Google
and you have the Microsoft offering
basically all these services we just
have the VM you know the hardware will
paralyze it vm and maybe the operational
system and they are providing us some
services and pop off debt or so we can
have some SOA just on the top of
hardware and software related to
operational system and second one is the
platform as a service II it's a
different approach on this one we have
the servers I mean the application
servers like the Java ones JBoss at
Tomcat
we also have the data base stuffs we
have the caching services and some other
stuffs related and we have a basically
tools to improve our code not our code
actually but tools to work with our code
and at the end we have the software
as-a-service see that is why we have to
thinking about
muley tenancy requirements because the
software as a services has the
requirements to work with too many
customers around our software so we have
one instance share it for too many
customers so that is the deal about
mutinous some examples for software
as-a-service eat the bigger ones is
Gmail I know
everything has Gmail today so the
Salesforce and we have a lot of casing
the internet and the market share about
that this picture is very interesting I
we have the history about the market
share for the software as a service see
model if you look pictured this growing
up so he started just a few billion
dollars of dollars and for 2050 mm mm
and 15 we probably have 20 1.3 billion
of dollars opportunity in the market
share so that is a big number you know
and if you look for the future
those numbers are grown up so we need to
think about the this approach and how to
deal with the technologies involve it
you know to work with the software as a
service market share and Marie tennis
requirements are just about that so when
you talk about the military's we are
thinking on just one application code or
one application runtime not sharing our
code to mutti customers muley clients
you mean I mean sorry Marie tenants when
you talk about Mira tennis we are
talking about new music clients which
means Marie tenants that is pretty
different from the muley instance
architecture muting instance
architecture we are installing and
provided our software to multiple
instance for
customers so we can deploy different
servers and maybe we have some not good
approach for that so that is the big
difference between so mirroring instance
basically on this picture here we have a
one application for a customer a and the
database for the customer a we have one
application for the customer B and the
database for the customer B so all this
case we are not sharing anything
basically we can share the code may be
using some proprietary configurations
around but we're not sharing the
environment so if you like to play that
in the cloud for example we probably
need to pay muley dollars one per
customer
it's not not our deal right now so the
mere attendance is about share about
share our code our environment and share
between all our customers you know so
that is what we have for challenge in
our code and we need to think about how
to wrote our code between the
requirements the different requirements
for each customer I mean here we have
some difference between these two
approach the first approach which is the
media instance the cost it's a much
expensive than the mere attendance
because militants you can share so maybe
you can have it 10 customers running
inside the same infrastructure so we can
share the costs around that and Q reduce
your license for the software and if you
play the muley instance you probably
have one VM per customer
so you need to pay the same for each
customer if your customer is low is
median or is a large customer you need
to pay the same probably maybe maybe you
have different size of VMs but you have
to
be one per customer I mean you're not
sharing anything about research and we
have in the midst muting instance we
have a dedicated research sausage many
resources are just involved to the
customers on the moody tenant we have
the shared resource we can have the semi
database we can have the same JMS cues
for example we can have the same day web
application code using for all our
customers on this code on this runtime
environment I mean the operation and
maintenance model it's complex if you
think about to administrate all the
customers on one instance but that's ok
if you have some tools to improve that
and the scalable model it's the big the
big improvement here I mean muting
instance are not scalable at this time
so you probably need to look for out VMs
inside of our customers need to have a
big support team to support out those
VMs and maybe you can have big problems
around that for the military's you can
have just one environment is scalable
running at cloud for example and playing
with it last see stuffs like Amazon has
a lot of elasticity stuffs around that
and you can increase your reduce your
size according the usage for the
customers so that is pretty nice you
know cloud is completely different for
me retinas we are talking about you
think different higher right now cloud
is about environments and the last see
stuffs so if you play around cloud you
can use a single instance you can use
software which is not a military
software which is a simple software and
also you can play militant
is out of the cloud you can use your out
infrastructure to play militant
ancestors so cloud is about LSE is about
services is about infrastructure and
militants is about requirements about
software stuffs so you need to think
about how to plan our software code you
wrote between the requirements the
different requirements for each customer
if you have a customer playing with some
web services and another customer is
using different integrations model we
need to understand and figure out how to
play with two words you know and that is
what you need to think about in our code
need to figure out how to defer the
client II and client B and play around
that so those are the challenge here we
need that data separation model and the
database you need to figure out how to
defer the data number a and data number
B for each customer so you have some
approach here I were talking about layer
about that so we can use the same table
to persist all our customer data or we
can use different tables or different
schemas in the database we have
challenge for the UI and screens mean UI
you need to have different appearance
different logos or images or CSF
Easter's for each customer so we need to
figure out how to play together around
our code we need to thinking about
access control and security so usually
end the software as a service model when
the user logging the application we need
to understand what is the customer
related with this user so if the user
log it is from Amazon need to play
around Amazon or if the user is from
Google you need to play around Google
for example we need to work with food
source providing and that is very
important because if you have the same
environment the same chair environment
for our customers and for example I have
small one customer and a large one I
need to I need to figure out what is
playing around that you know how this
mall uses how the cost of my ismail user
and how is the cost for my large user to
have different bills you know to to
apply for those different profiles for
my code and I have a challenge for
integration stuffs challenge for a
piddly stuffs for example if you play
with the Facebook I think our if you
have has the Facebook you know so if you
play the Facebook and you log in maybe
tomorrow you can get a different
completely different screen know so the
upgrade is all for our customers if you
put a new a new featuring our code in
our software you need to put that for
all the customers we can defer what's
change for customer E or B for example
and we have many other challenge related
so what are the pros and cons what are
the benefits and the drawbacks related
the process oh please obviously is the
low maintenance costs we have low cost
to and put these requirements working
basically we can have just one VM or one
environment sharing across our customers
so that reduce our costs we have a high
scalability model using the cloud Alaska
steps so we can reduce your supporting
to put other services at cloud for
example and cons or drawbacks are they
come
axis the complexity is pretty hard or
the code you need to make sure our
proprietary you know need to play with
some configurations and some screens
different screens different appearance
for each customer
that's his complex if you thinking to
play with different customers and we
have more freighter failure here points
I mean filler risks related because if
he our application shut down that should
down you be for our customers you know
so if we have offline hours that offline
hours you'll be for our placement so
that is not good if you are thinking
about to share the same code for
everything so talking about the adoption
levels of militants we can have
different adoption levels mu detainees
can be used by different levels I mean
if you have some requirements like I
need a a pre different applications for
each customer maybe you can you can't
use all the levels for movie tennis
because you need to customize the code
so that can be a big challenge to chart
out stuff across of that so basically
there are they are three levels the
number one is the customized level
basically we have an environment shoe
and database I mean we have the level
number two it's configurable level and
the trees the scalable level so the
number one look in this picture here we
have three different runtime
environments one part per customer
I mean so each customer has a own
environment runtime environment and each
customer has
our database stuff's so we are not
sharing anything here maybe we are
sharing the code the source code related
so we can play different deployments
using XML our prophets file bring the
different data source or different
labels you know different stuffs for
each customer but we are running in
different runtimes we are running we're
planing different database we are
planning with different runtime
environments so that is the first level
of adoption this level can be used if
you are planning to start with mute
tenants if you are me get migrating some
application code to meet a nice model
you can use it this first level if you
look for the mirror instance at the
source codes not share it you know you
have different codes for example I'm
working with some customers and those
customers has some products and these
products plays with different approach
you know the products is so true the
customer name be a b c and they have
different codes to to mantain so they
have different development teens to
working on that is a big cost you know
it's not sustainable if you plan to the
future so formula tennis you are sharing
the code at this first level but the
runtime is completely different you know
the second level the configurable level
we have a shared runtime involve it but
with two planing with different data
base here so each customer has your own
data base but each customer share the
same environment so what you need to
figure out here is how to defer the
customer runtime you know playing around
the server
the idea here is using our ID this ID is
colored pen and ID which is a a code
like ID code you know you ID code to
differ
what is our customer and wrote this
customers to different database and the
third level is the scalable level so
this is the the last one the the most
important one because we can have these
fell ability steps related so we are
sharing the same runtime environment and
the same database for our customers on
this case so this is sorry yeah yeah I'm
going to talking about the database the
strategies right now and we have three
difference so one of them it's about to
share the tables you know or maybe other
approach so I have a question for you
guys looking those three adoptions I
have over here what is the bad choice
right now anyone what you play around
sorry yeah what's the best choice at
this time for that three levels the
sheriff wrote react can't be more
scalable yeah agree but the answer for
this question is the mix both right the
answer for this question is the
traditional answer for the informatica
stuff you know i t-stops depends depends
on many factors here so depends on the
data customization stuff so if you need
to have completely different data model
for each customer
that is a big issue you can have the
same database share it if I planning
with a customer a and customer B and
they have a completely different model
of data how can I mix that that's
impossible you know so depends on
depends on function customization like
the business rules if you have different
business rules for each customer if I
have different integrations so that can
be impossible so the answer is depends
basically I can play with the level 1
level 2 or level 3 you know but I need
to think about my requirements I need to
think about my customers and obviously
obviously I need to think about what is
the best for me right now so I need to
reduce my costs my operational costs so
that is what you need to think about in
the future for our codes about the
database we have different strategies
involve it when we are talking about the
database we are talking about the data
just the data if you think about the
requirements for our code the data is
just one piece of that we have the
appearance you have the business rules
but we think about the database we have
three different strategies here the
first one is the separate database so
the first one is the more simple
strategy because we have different
database for each customer usually we
don't have different instance of the
database but we have different schemas
you know in the Oracle for example you
can create one schema per customer using
the same data model but on this case we
have flexibility involve it because we
are in different schemas this the
strategy number two is about different
tables
in around the same schema or the same
database so we have different tables for
each customer this is the second
strategy and the third one is the shared
database so we are sharing the tables
also you know we are sharing the same
structure but at disturbin we need to
put a new column on all tables involve
it which column is colored tenant ID or
customer ID should defer which data is
for the customer a or which data is for
the customer B for example so those are
three different strategies and we need
to thinking what is the best right now
the same question what is the best right
now I did a graph here you know with
small faces smiley faces sorry you know
so if you think about the customization
data and the separated database and
separate tables are the best one but if
you're thinking about data customization
for shared database is not a big one is
not not good because we are we need to
play with the same structure so we can't
have different data about if you look
about security that is a issue also if
you are sharing the same table for our
customer maybe we have a big issue in
security service you know for example I
know some software's where the customer
has access to play SQL directly at the
database sometimes know so they can have
data they can look data for other
customers so that is the issue you know
I can we can work with different
approach setting some grants type you
know profile security that directing the
database but that is not a big approach
for that if
think about performance the separate
database and separate tables are the
best one also because different database
we can have different profiles different
policy reserves you know playing around
different database and the only feature
here if you are sharing the database
which is the best one is about the Shari
about the customer on board stuffs so if
you need to play to put a new clients a
new customer in our code I need to
configure a new customer for example and
you are sharing the same database for
our customers basically that is
automatically steps this customers just
need to insert his data all the other
strategies they need to create tables
are great scheme as you know and a lot
of stuffs related
actually that is just a few thoughts
about you know we can make some approach
like Oracle configurations inside of
that then make that scalable you know so
if you think about scalability our
models are scalable at this time you
know I can say that just this graph is
just to defer one approach of another
one you know but the separate tables are
separate database and sharing database
they can both have a scalable model you
know
yeah yeah yeah that's right okay so
let's about code now right we are just
talking about concepts and you know
challenge and other stuffs how Java EE
and Java libraries handles those stuffs
what we we have today to working around
that so in the Java side we have the
database to handle the persistent surfs
play different database or tables
related so we have the JPA y is using
the java ee so what we have today to
working about that we also have the
appearance customization I mean the UI
so we need to play around that also
using JSF for example and just a comment
here in the Java e8 they you working
again with the pods apart so I are add
read some specification code and they
are doing a good or a good a good job to
get again those requirements for
militancy stuffs and play and play with
the a GPS and JMS and the always
specifications related so you probably
get new steps in the future the Java e8
formula tennis and other requirements at
cloud so that is what our Oracle is
thinking about in the future at JPA we
have some libraries that there is no
standard at this time we have no
standard for militant ourselves so you
probably find some custom code for
different providers I least true ones
here in this light I list eclipse link
which is the the provider the reference
provider for JPA and I list hibernate
it's used for almost
our people you know it's hibernate
so eclipses link has supports using
annotations and different for that three
different strategies we have mutinous
annotation to using our entities and you
can use different strategies one per
each different database strategy as I
show it before for hibernate we have to
add some code to play around we have to
interface and different features to
figure out what is the tenant ID and
what is this schema or database related
to persist our data so looking at that
in the eclipse link we have some code
like that so this is a sample about
annotations so if you are using a single
table which means this sharing tables
across our customers we are is the same
table different the tannin ID on this
table using a column to defer which is
the customer we can play with these and
these mutinous annotation and they what
is the strategy type on this case did
strategy the single table strategy and
we we need to set what is its creator
column and related this column should
persist the client ID the customer ID I
mean so also you have that we need to
set what is the customer ID so we can
set directly at the XML file they
persist XML file or we can set inside of
the running code I mean directing our
logic you know we don't need to map that
column call it 10 and IG or customer ID
we don't need to map that the the logic
around that the
klipsch link we provide us so we just
need to set those configurations and set
the ID at run time and that's it okay
for second strategy if you are using
different tables
I mean tables for tenants tables per
customer
eclipse link has some different approach
here we have a different configuration
colored Murray tennis table pertinent
and you need sets
what is the tenant table discriminator
which you set the schema name you know
the database schema name so on this case
here you set what is the appropriate
which contains this schema name and at
the database side you have different
tables add in different schemas play
around that and this the last one
strategy for Eclipse link skullet VPD
which is a virtual private database
Virtual Private database
it's an Oracle side configuration to
provide us grant types and you know
security steps if you are planing around
the same data so this third one is
pretty similar the first one I mean we
have the same table with all data for
our customers but we have some grant
types
managed by Oracle database providing
security stuffs so that is pretty simmer
this first one but we have Oracle
helping us on this case in the hibernate
side who have different codes related as
I said there is no standard at this time
so at our Burnet we haven't any
annotation steps but we have some code
here
we can create a class Khalid mutinous
connection provider which is a class to
set what is the tenant we are using
right now so we can set this schema
before persist some data so this class
you'll be a kind of interceptor stuff
you know a future stuff when you persist
inserts updates or deletes any data
before to do that this class you set
this schema name and you can go directly
for that schema we also have another
class call it current tenant identifiers
over this class is actually related to
find what is the tenant ID our tenant ID
can be at the thread-local for example
or can be at the user the allotted user
object so you can get that data around
that and return to hibernate to decide
what should be done right now both
flights are configured at the hibernate
XML file which is the persistent XML the
standard JPA file but we need to set
some custom hibernate problems over
there to play around that
just one more concern about the data
it's about the caching serfs if you are
planing with JPA we are maybe using
caching serfs caching mechanism to keep
the data in memory for example so if you
have the same data I mean the same
database for our customer you probably
have the same caching system for our our
clients or our customers on this case
you have two strategies to working on
the first one is just disable the cache
that is the easy one
we can resolve our issue just disable
the cage the Cashin you can defer what
is the data for client what a or b and
the second one is also play with the
hibernate or eclipse link to defer what
sees dependent ID for each data inside
of the cash for example hibernate and
eclipse link can provide us different
environments I mean different factories
for per each tenant on this case we can
have different data being saved at
memory you know so that is pretty
interesting we just need to set that in
configuration files and they work
perfectly for us I mean at the web model
side I mean for the GSF side we also
have some requirements related we need
to figure out different appearance for
each customer we need to figure out
different CSS files and different HTML
files maybe for each customer
so the GSF already has a pretty good
structure to hand out no GSF as flexible
a flexibly software architecture involve
it GSF can be packed in different jar
files so we can have different
deployments runtime playing JSF
providers templates using facelets for
example so facelets is a big resource
it's a big feature to work at Meerut a
nice word joseph providers localization
support render kit so we have a good
approach there just looking at about
facelets facelets it's a interest
research
to play around mutinous you know if you
look this screen over here on the
facelets
we just need to define a template which
has these block blanks regions you know
these regions are not defined at the
first moment so each customer can define
which should put on that that place you
know we can put different logos or
different CSS files or you know so this
is a big feature I know
facelets is already use it by everything
you know but that is a big feature to
working around the mutinous features JSF
to tutor to has a new future colored
muted temple additives or muted facelet
stuffs so you can define different
templates for each customer
that is pretty interest because I can
define different contracts or I can
define sorry one contract but use it by
different customers so for for example
my cursor a can be a different implant
file for facelets and my customer B can
be a different template file also so on
this case here I can define those
contracts and I can split or me suite
those templates at runtime I can have
some model like this one you know I can
define in my code different folders one
folder per each customer on these slide
over here I can define a folder colored
music love you know which is a customer
with with he is our template our I'll
CSS file our JavaScript file and I can
have a different folder call it my
business
with different files over here so I can
separate the files for each customer and
facelets can handle that for me at
runtime I just need to set what is the
template name which I want to use right
now and this template name can be my
tenant ID you know so I can use my ten
ID to defer what is the the folder I'm
trying to loading right now so let's
play a demo about I have a demo here
showing the Eclipse link strategies this
demo is from eclipse link project so
that is available at github we also have
this link at Eclipse II site so this is
a pretty interesting case using militina
stuffs and playing with different data
at the database so let me get this demo
here
I just start my code here just to show
you that running first nope
then you can dig the code after
and you mean for the web application
side
yeah yeah actually if you have different
flows related you know different
business logic are different features
related you probably need to separate
that you know using some concepts like
key components concepts for different
customers JSF has a flow flows features
which you can create small apps inside a
big app No
so that can be a approach to work with
different screens or different process
around that but depends on your code
some stuffs that's not a standard at
this time I mean okay yeah
so do you want to upload a file for
different customers for example yeah
yeah at the database side we can defer
your customer by customer ID for example
and you can persist the the data file
inside of the database and defer by
customer ID so the database you can
defer this data but at the application
code you know if you have different
flows around the business rules involve
it that is more complexity you know so
we need to create some steps like a
modular code you know we haven't any
framework to play around that so on this
code over here I have a muted tenants
case about my sports you know so we have
different sports here different league
sports so if I click on the high tech
tech hock high tech hockey league I will
go to a different website you know with
different divisions related if you are
back and go to a mineral soccer league I
will get a different screen over here so
I can see different appearance involve
it I mean different logos different
colors like CSS files involve it
different data also but we are playing
the same code here using new retinas
requirements we are the same database we
are the same source code involve it and
sharing a lot of stuffs so that is idea
about these and demo over here so let's
looks at the code
looking at the database site
we are using the Eclipse link
annotations for example we have the
mutinous code here strategy code if I
not define the strategy the default
strategy you be the single table
strategy I mean the same table for all
data are related so you are using the
same table for our leagues here I define
also the discriminator column related
with the Lea ID solely IDs my tenant ID
on this case you know so if I open let
me open my database tool just to look
the data so if you look these data over
here we have the same table for all our
customers on this case my customer is
the Lea ID you know the customer ID is
the Lea ID
I'm defer each data using different IDs
but I'm reusing the same table here you
know the same structure oh and this same
code here is for our case I mean on this
case I just play around that and the
clips link is doing almost our jobs over
here
let me get just one more sample to show
you guys
I can have some class like this one you
know to set what is my tenant ID before
I persist so when I create my factory my
aunt manager factory which will be my
factory to all my persistent stuff's I
can set what is my ten an ID using a
proprietary context profit file so this
context property file will give me what
is the lis ID which would be persisted
over that column okay so in this case if
I'm playing around the the key FL league
I just need to set that context using
this key FL appropriate and that you'll
be persisted using that you know so my
time so must finish here and I'd like to
open for some questions so let me know
just repeat the questions okay sure
so the questions about we're having a
moody tennis stuffs playing different
customers a B and C and at the same time
you need to have some data which are not
playing with tenants right okay we have
like admin users - looking all the
tenants involve it all the data tenants
involve it
so the strategy at this time it's
basically create two kinds of factories
on the JPA side for example one side you
wanted to use the tenant context ID and
the other side you just not setting
anything so you can look for all data
not deferring which is for any customer
at this time you know that is yeah yeah
yeah one thing here is those features
about tenant just are adjusting in
progress right now so eclipse link and
hibernate projects are still working on
those and for Java 8 they are planning
to standardize those features at the JPI
specification so some things can be
changed right now and we have to improve
some areas like this one for example
okay
okay and the questions about you handle
the authorization out education steps
for security stuffs we have some
frameworks like spring security or the
JBoss picket link those two frameworks
already has support for military stuffs
okay but in the Java EE side if you
think about jjs the java authorizations
it's an authentication model we haven't
any support for that so or we can use a
framework like spring security or JBoss
picket link shoot different frames but
we can choose one of them or maybe you
need to code from zero this feature you
know that's not good
I personally I like spring security I
already use it in few projects plane
with military stuffs and that's they
have a pretty good approach to handle
that some annotations and configuration
stuffs you know you should include the
spring secret jar and more short which
are which are required also but not this
free the full spring ecosystem you know
it's three or four jars I mean I noticed
sometimes need to include too many files
in our code and our deployment is very
bigger at this time anyone has more
questions no sir
uid you mean its primary key for exam
yeah sure
basically we can use a unique strategy
for our customers you know not deferring
if these unique IDs for the customer A
or B or C but we can have some jumps
over that you know not sequence but
sometimes you can create a special
strategy to generate your ID I mean I
don't know if I got your questions quick
how would you handle the case where two
tenants
oh okay okay got it you mean about not
only the primary key but if you have
UNIX related yeah that can be an issue
actually you know for that strategy -
sharing the same table because sometimes
you just need to sequence that you do
not use and at the Java side we also can
have some validation rules around that
your being you know or entity be I mean
you can play with being validation API
you know doing some constraints like
community constraints
per tent but for the database maybe you
should use different tables it's a
different approach you know okay
everyone here are some reference you
know I think those this slide you'll be
provided by the Java one and
and
and that's it folks thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
