started here this name of this session
is coding for the future my name is John
checker Ellie I'm the director for
engineering at NetBeans at Oracle and
you can tell them from Oracle because i
have this slide so even though we'll be
talking about mostly open source tools
and so forth don't let that influence
any buying decisions you may make today
so let's get going so i'm the director
of NetBeans engineering oracle I've been
in tools for 13 years now and what we're
going to do today is today's not it's
it's not a product pitch and it's you
know although I will talk at the end a
bit about what Oracle and netbeans are
doing in this space but really I'm not
even here representing Oracle today
really i'm just here kind of to give you
one guys view of you know having been in
this industry for a long time or this
part of the industry for a long time
some of the developments that we've seen
lately and where I think our
opportunities for growth are and where i
think this the the tools landscape is
moving so let's do a brief recap of how
we got to where we are today so i
remember fondly the java ide wars of the
2000s man the early 2000s like tools
were like a big big deal right you know
and netbeans was open source in 1999 and
eclipse followed in 2001 and at the time
there were actually a lot of companies
that were making their money selling
tools you could actually sell tools for
big money Borland was out there forte
for Java and others right but it soon
became a two horse race between the two
tools between NetBeans and Eclipse and
that really the combined cost savings
for these other players other people who
needed to have toolings for their
platform tuning for their platforms
you know the combination of the cost
savings of just building on top of
somebody else's platform plus the price
pressure of now you're competing against
free tools right really you know pushed
a lot of people to give up doing
evolving their own tooling platforms and
just go ahead and build plugins sadly to
say as a net beans guy mostly for
eclipse eclipse really IBM and Eclipse
did great work in the partner space and
that led to a lot of people
standardizing on top of eclipse although
lately we've seen a lot more on top of
NetBeans with lots of people providing
plug-ins for their technologies their
run times in the NetBeans and then just
when you thought that open source had
sucked all the money out of tools Along
Came IntelliJ right and they proved that
you could still make money selling elite
tools and really I've got we have
nothing but respect for for the job that
the folks over at idea have done they
produce a tremendous tool and they they
really add value in an area of the
market that's that's very difficult to
monetize so um and so so at the same
time as all of this was happening and
you know for a while tools was really
really a big you know a kind of a
religious war another evolution came
that that made to was a lot less
important and kind of changed the
discussion from from religion to to
preference and that that was that more
tools came along that took a lot of the
the essential data out of the IDE and
put them in two separate systems that
could be shared that could be could be
versioned and so forth so when you had
aunt maven hudson jenkins and all these
things really took the project settings
out of the ide project and put them into
into things that could be shared by
everybody
so what happened was that now instead of
everybody having to use the same project
the same tool because that's what you
know you use to build it it can became a
preference and today you readily see
unless you're using specialized plugins
or you need to plug in that only is
available in one of the Ides you see
that it's a matter of preference and in
one engineering team you'll have some
people using eclipse some people using
NetBeans some people using IntelliJ now
outside of Jabba sorry outside of Java
what have a lot of the other tools a lot
of the other ecosystems such as Apple
Microsoft and IOT you know they've
really these guys as well have not been
seeing tools as a revenue driver they've
been seeing tools as as an enabler as
kind of table stakes the notable
exception is Microsoft because Microsoft
targets for everything right so if
you're in Microsoft you just you got to
pay the man so that's kind of like the
the early history let's look at what the
recent trends have been and really over
the last seven eight years the main
trend in the big java i des has the main
evolution and the big job ids has been
outside of java and it's been moving to
this polygon world right and bringing
the ide experience the you know of
having your integrated error handling
hints code completion you know debugging
and VCS bringing that entire kind of
integrated the eye and ide experience to
other languages like home and at every
step of the way at every step of the way
people have said what are you kidding
you're not going to get you're not going
to get people to use a thick ide for
insert your language here so you know
when we said we were doing reply Ruby
users use text me you know PHP users use
notepad and JavaScript I mean who would
want code completion who would want a
debugger how are you that's that's for
java guys right so every step of the way
there's been skeptics around that you
know just giving my Emacs in my command
line and
and that's all there is but the fact is
as it turns out lots of people do want
good tools even for their loosely typed
scripting languages we've been extremely
successful in this and when it and so
you can see some of the usage stats that
we have from our latest our latest
satisfaction survey and really the the
metrics that we collect back this up so
seventy-four percent of people still you
know use Java it's primarily a Java IDE
but the people who are using Java in
combination with other things is really
astounding and so Polly got really is
here to stay and nowhere is this more
apparent than with JavaScript and now
when we print reduce project easel three
years ago I guess it is now which is the
NetBeans tooling for JavaScript HTML CSS
we knew that there would be a large
uptick but we didn't expect it to be
this much javascript is everywhere and
the trend is really towards
transitioning even in the Java world
transitioning off of server rendered
content to thick client thin server with
the server just doing authentication
doing background logic and and serving
up serving up data through JSON rest
services and really having thick clients
like JavaScript clients doing all of the
rendering in the browser so and PHP is
also been tremendously successful so
with you know thirty five percent of our
users using PHP and if you look around
you can see others doing the same thing
idea has been pushing Web Store and
heavily and it's been very successful
there eclipse after the apt enough is a
project kind of fizzled out hasn't
really fielded a credible JavaScript web
developer product and it seems like
they're not really focusing on that and
that they're continuing to focus on on
the the more traditional languages that
they support such as the Java and
HTML and to a certain extent PHP
although even Zen studio i would i would
claim is kind of falling behind so the
question is is java tooling mature right
um and really since the mid-2000s all of
the basics have been in most of the the
main IDEs so you know you've got your
editor you got your code completion your
refactoring which was such a major
breakthrough when it first came out and
is now just considered standard in it
and all tools you have your debugger
your profiler your VCS integration your
may even support and your aunt support
right all these things are our standard
part of the tools and most of the
feature enhancements that we get are
really enhanced at most of the
enhancement requests that we get a
really more of enhancements than you
know evolutions or revolutions and top
of the list is always give me a WYSIWYG
for my WYSIWYG editors for my my my
client of choice or my technology of
choice and we did really well with the
matisse editor for for swing but some of
the technologies that were using that
you see being used today are very
difficult to do was ebook for like HTML
html5 and JavaScript and so forth and
then we always get you know as new
languages or frameworks you know come up
people you know request I want support
for for my new language or my new
framework internally though we I in in
just the installed tools space what we
get for every request that we get from
somebody to give me some new whiz-bang
feature right what we get is probably
about 10 requests that just say you know
I don't want new features just make sure
that the features that are their work
well and are really rock solid and
perform
so what we really focus on right now in
the main installed IDE is making sure
that we have top-notch support for all
the new major releases of Java and just
making sure that everything is rock
solid and that it's performant and and
because we do feel that the 8020 the
eighty percent of what people use eighty
percent of the time is well provided for
inside the IDE so if the evolution of
tools doesn't lie in the install the
Ides themselves where does it lie well
another thing that we've seen lately is
is a proliferation of the so called web
IDEs or the browser-based IDEs these are
editors code editors that you can run in
a browser basically and these skin
they're they're all across the spectrum
so you have things like Orion and code
mirror which are really more of
frameworks for building web IDEs than
web ID ease themselves you have jsfiddle
and runnable which are more of a
teaching tools and small scratch pads
and jsfiddle become incredibly
incredibly popular and it's very cool so
limited in its scope of what it tries to
do but it's so cool and you can see if
if you've ever gone through Stack
Overflow looking for answers on
JavaScript you know you'll often get
pointed off to somebody's jsfiddle then
you have more pure code editors and then
combinations of code editors and and
cloud platforms and nitrous I oaf it's a
little bit more into this into this this
category and even you know Microsoft
Azure which I didn't didn't put up on
the thing but they've now integrated a
basic web based editor into there as a
standard part of
their platform as a service so talk more
about the pleura for proliferation of
web IDs most of the web IDs right now
most of the uptake has been for web
client technologies and you can see why
that is it's a lot easier to tool for
JavaScript HTML CSS that runs in the
browser right I you know the code that
you produce can be run directly in the
browser you know there's there's no
compilation step although with
frameworks like less and sass for which
are compiled JavaScript frameworks
becoming more and more popular I think
even web technologies are getting to the
point where you you actually do need
some sort of run time the same thing for
if you're using grunt files to do you
know the quote-unquote deploy step of
your HTML Javascript apps where you're
running the all the minification and
everything else through a through a
grunt file or some other javascript
build system you kind of even for the
web languages this idea that it can all
be done in the browser and I don't need
to have any platform on which I can run
the tools behind it is getting less and
less tenable and the other reason I
think why it's been popular for web
client I des is that the feature set in
in a lot of the web client IDs is a lot
lower or the feature set that I think a
lot of web developers are looking for is
a lot lower than what Java developers
look for in that although NetBeans and
webstorm have been kind of pushing the
idea that that you should export but
expect more out of your developer tool
for web front-end technologies a lot of
people are used to just using sublime
text or a text editor and a lot of those
these a lot of these the
web-based IDEs are actually a lot closer
to a sublime text than they are to a
NetBeans earn eclipse or an intelligent
so that's why I think that they've taken
off for that these web IDs have taken
off for or moderately taking off perhaps
taking office is an overstatement but
but have had some success with a web
client technologies they haven't really
taken off for compiled languages yet and
like I said there's it's harder to get
feature parity with the development
environments that you expect you expect
a debugger you expect a profiler you
need to run the code somewhere right you
need I need to build this code somewhere
and you need a back end and I will talk
more about that a little bit later but
but how you integrate with those back
ends is a real interesting questions
that a lot of people in the market are
kind of attacking from different angles
all over although I think it's clear
that right now if you try to just
duplicate an IDE in the browser you're
kind of barking up the wrong tree right
now with the current state of both how
we do you know how we connect to these
back-end servers and and also with the
whole set of the features that are now
available in most of these these
browser-based IDEs your kind of giving
up a lot and and it's it's unclear
depending on which which platform you're
using you know the gains that you get
are are unclear and a lot of them and
the current state is really that
performance wise it's very difficult to
match the performance for day-to-day
routine routine operations that you have
on a brown on a desktop IDE it's very
hard to match that completely in a
browser and especially when you're doing
code completion and that code completion
can't be compiled all locally inside the
browser but needs to go back to a
back-end and hit a rest service and come
back it doesn't take a ton of time but
we're used to you know commands bass
boom there it is right and so it's it's
a difficult problem to solve 22 get the
difficult problem to solve to get the
the responsiveness of the day-to-day
operations I mean even a 10 you know
even a 10 20 millisecond lag and your
code completion if you do that you know
500 times a day you're going to notice
it right so that's a big challenge for
everybody who's trying to play in this
space giving up you know not being able
to code it all when you're not connected
to the Internet I could see how how that
could cause problems so really as of now
with the current feature set with the
current speed of the solutions we really
or at least I don't see web-based IDEs
being a replacement for it's not
something that's going to displace your
locally local locally installed IDE but
it does have a lot of possibilities in a
complementary roles so we'll talk more
about some of the pain points in the
development processes that these
cloud-based IDs can or development
processes that connect to the cloud can
bring again can help you solve and we'll
talk about some of the opportunities of
places where where they can really add
value in ways that just a locally
installed desktop ide can't add value so
let's talk about some of those
opportunities opportunities for growth
and innovation what are the main places
where I see the industry going and where
I see tools really needing to take a
different approach is when interacting
with managed systems so one of the
trends in the industry
is that more and more cloud services are
producing these managed systems where
they're trying to take infrastructure
maintenance lifecycle management and
even basic UI and base functionality out
of the developers hands and providing
them as a service so you no longer have
to install set up a server keep it
running you know do your maintenance of
that and then code an entire war and
deploy that war to the server and so
forth you know all of this is taken care
provided as a service right and you only
do your coding for customization and
extensions of the base functionality
that's inside there and there's
different levels of this so on the lower
end you can see things like amazon
elastic Beanstalk and Google App Engine
which take away the need to have to
manage your an app server in those
you're still though putting putting
together a war and shipping that wore
off up to the up to the up to the
service but you know there's a whole
other class of cloud services out there
that that go a lot further and so M bass
how many people know what ambassador
I've heard of em bus so what so that's
mobile backend as a service mobile
backends as a service or are starting to
gain steam here where you can basically
you take all of your old crusty soap
services right which are not very mobile
friendly and you know what we built all
are so uh you know implementations on
but now we try and extend those four
things like you know even web apps but
especially mobile apps and we're
realizing actually we need some we need
rest services you know that are that are
speaking JSON and our you know secured
by oauth2 so these mobile backends as a
service are coming out we're through
point-and-click you can input your soap
services you can spit out rest services
you can set up security and so forth and
you can do this all without a single
line of code and then in addition to the
this you have the facility to come in
and build and write your own services
and upload them to it especially what
especially people do is they do the
shaping of the services on the server
side so you bring in your soap services
and you shave them all nicely so that
you're only putting out the information
that you want for that specific app and
then you extend that and that's the type
of things you would do encode right
rather than setting up your own nodejs
server or your own java server and then
writing all the classes for that you
have this nice managed service and the
only place where you really need the
tools are when you input the code and
when you run it and when you wanted to
bug it but even more and one that I
think it has a system that's had a
profound impact on the on the market and
and we're going to see much more
movement into this space is really
salesforce com so everything from the UI
to the database to the app logic can be
done in a highly templated
point-and-click way all right and you
only do custom logic at you only do
coding when you do custom logic or
custom UI now this is a programming
model that most of us here at javaone
sneer at right you know I think it's not
even really programming really and and
you know if you want you know we can all
say ah these types of systems only get
you so far at the end of the day you're
always going to need to come back and
you know have a developer come in to
implement what you actually want soon
there will be a nice big building
downtown here to remind us to not be
quite so smug with the salesforce1 tower
will be looking down upon all of us as
we come in over the bridge to remind us
that that this model of programming has
a lot of legs and it's hard to
overestimate the demand in the
enterprise for systems that allow
business people to perform IT tasks
without having to go have I t do every
step of it having said that at the end
of the day you always have to get IT
involved it is true that you point and
click only takes you so far and at the
end of the day when you want to go
beyond just the basic crud
basic functionality that's built into
the point-and-click systems you have to
have someone come in and do some custom
coding and that's where you run into a
wall right there because these systems
are impossible to emulate on a desktop
on a laptop right if you've ever tried
writing some custom apex code for
salesforce com uploading it to
salesforce com and then debugging it you
will realize how huge of a pain point
this is and how much the tools have not
caught up with this new paradigm and so
really I think there's a heart bringer
of where the industry is going and you
know you need to have built-in code
editors built into buggers built-in
profilers right so that when you do go
in and try to do real programming
against these managed systems that you
can do them in place because frankly
those things just are not going to
behave on your desktop like they're
going to behave up in those up in those
systems so I think that's a real big
place in these type of managed systems
where we're going to see a different
type of tooling and that's really a big
place where browser-based tooling has a
real chance to be central to the way we
do programming in certain environments
another place where I see a lot of
promise is the combination with
developer services and you see a lot of
this going on right now so the
combination of you know really hooking
in your developer IDE with some of those
external services that we've talked
about so one of the one of the sweet
spots of integration is continuous
integration code analysis and get right
so for example you can set up the same
error and warning systems that you have
in your IDE that gives you warnings when
you code something right it says and you
can have your enterprise set of rules
like in our team we don't do this right
and you can set up your IDE to put out
warnings on that and then you can use
that exact same
system for doing error detection in your
continuous integrations right and then
if you have parallel integration where
each developer or each team has their
own repository you check into that and
then it does build and test and only if
it if it um if it passes those tests
will it get integrated into main right
in that case as you're typing you can
see before you have to check something
in and wait for your Hudson built to run
you can see as you're typing the weather
something is going to is going to break
the build and this can be as easy as
having fine bugs integration in your IDE
and then having the fine bugs plugin and
your Jenkins or your Hudson ideas done a
has done a very nice job with this with
teamcity they split out there there
there error enhance infrastructure
that's inside their IDE and they have
that running on the server side so
that's one place where I think that the
integration of tools and services it
kind of shines another place and this is
something that we're working on now is
continuous integration indexing and
maven one of the main pain points and
one of the main pain points that the web
IDEs try to you know or like to attack
right whether or not they've all
succeeded as a different story but one
of the main pain points is scanning
large projects right you know we would
like to push off intensive certain
things like scanning large projects
doing big builds do running big test
suites off to the server and off my
local machine right and really we want
to stop indexing static libraries we
feel like you should be able to push off
your indexing to your continuous
integration and you should just be able
to build those indexes as you build your
repository and store that information
with your maven artifacts so that when
you do your refresh of your maven
artifacts you're always getting the
latest indexing information out of the
box because so many times so many of
these libraries never change right so
why are we indexing them every time we
we we open up a new project all right
so that's something that I'll talk about
a little bit later where we're going and
another one is the combination of your
IDE with your source for which in your
bug tracker now obviously we have this
with Milan today Milan took the first
steps in this direction by doing task
focused development so as you're you
know so you know as you're in the IDE
and you've got one task you're working
on one bug you can have all the
breakpoints and stuff set up for for
that task you switch to a different task
you get your environment Taylor to that
task you can close bugs as you do
check-ins and so forth that's nice and
it's a good first step but we can really
do more and wouldn't it be nice right
well first of all and your gate
repositories you should absolutely have
all the code navigation that you have
inside of your IDE where you should have
all the find usages go to implementation
go to superclass all those things that
you have right view class hierarchy and
so forth all that should be inside your
git repository it shouldn't just be a
browser right a text browser over your
source files so in enabling syntax at
where code browsing and search is a big
deal right but we can even go further
and wouldn't it be nice when you're
editing a method in a library to know
hey this method is called by 200 classes
be really careful when you're editing it
or hey change sets that include changes
to this class break the build you know
break the test suite you know or causes
test suite to fail fifty percent more
than then change sets across across the
other ones it's this kind of deep
analysis or deep insight into your code
right and how you know how developers
work with your code you know the
opposite is true hey this uh you you've
got this method and it's only call is
called by two classes right you know
maybe you want to you know maybe this is
a utility method that needs to be
separate but maybe this is something
that you know you might want to join
into somewhere else so it's these type
of deep analysis
built into your both your source
repository but it would be nice if you
had communication with your between your
source repository and your bug tracker
and this kind of intelligence database
of what's happening in your repository
and have that integrated into your ID so
you see these things when you're when
you're coding right dangerous files can
maybe have a different color coding or
something of that measure and then
another place where when you know this
is one place I'm very bullish on is
configuration management and I really
feel like the the main the main promise
of the web I des is not in that I can
edit something in a browser but it's
that I don't have to set up my
development environment locally on my
machine ok development environment
configuration is painful but most of us
put up with it because if I'm going to
be working for the next 6-8 months on
this code base I'll burn two three days
two days or you know if I'm new to a new
company or whatever right you know I'll
burn you know how much of our time it
takes to get everything set up locally
even if it's really painful when when
the systems that I'm trying to emulate
the production systems I'm trying to
emulate don't lend themselves very well
to to running on a local machine you
know that can be just because my you
know big old beefy you know enterprise
app server that I'm running along with
big old beefy database that I'm running
are too big to really run performant ly
on my desktop on my laptop or it can be
just because we're using um different
you know I'm using services that are
only available in the cloud or I need to
be you know emulate you know
authentication login and so forth when
I'm testing out my code but for the most
part we do it it's a reasonable
investment on long-term project to have
everything set up locally and everything
working sweetly with my tools that I
have locally but what if you change
projects all the time think about
sustaining organizations who are
constantly having to evaluate and
bugs on past branches of code right to
constantly have to oh I got an
escalation from paying support con you
know it's paying support customer now
I've got to go back and figure out how
to you know build up you know get the
all the versions of the libraries and
the tools and so forth that this that
this branch that was from three years
ago was built on and I've got to figure
out how to set that all up just so I can
go in and find and fix one bug produce a
patch and then and then make it all go
away contractor heavy shops and
outsourcing firms where people are
switching projects all the time for
these guys this is a major pain point
and we are very bullish on the on the
idea of encapsulating the development
and execution environments and having
one click provisioning of these
environments for for developers right
and to make those environments as close
as possible to the to the actual
production environments you know but
going back to those kind of hard to
replicate environments that we were
talking about and really the the people
have done the best work in this area so
far have been the code Envy folks with
their new release the new code Envy
release really has a lot of it's a good
step in the right direction along having
docker eyes deployment and and
development environments that can be
shared so I and the and I think it's
also really important that you should be
but there's nothing about that
environment that says that you have to
go through a web-based IDE I mean
environments just an environment you
should be able to hook up to it from
your love your locally installed IDE as
well but there's serious challenges in
this and one of the challenges that you
see is what to use for encapsulation so
where if you're going to you know that
the actual process of encapsulating and
making these these
it's reproducible is is not a huge
challenge we have lots of tools with VMs
and configuration and containers to deal
with that problem those problems now but
um but the question is what do the
question of running those running those
environments at scale in an economically
feasible way is a difficult one so one
of the approaches that have been used is
you can just use a full cloud-based vm
here so you're a developer here's your
cloud me and it's got your entire it's a
full complete copy of our development vm
of our production vm right and then you
just your get checkup you get clone onto
that and you know here's your you know
the and then you have some sort of
back-end that serves it all up and all
your compilation and deployment and so
forth happens on that one vm this can
get expensive right um you know having
to pay for a full vm for each developer
can't get expensive and if you wanted to
access that from your local IDE to to
having your get cloned or your source
directory actually living out on the
cloud there's a lot of the IDS today
have a problem handling this so IntelliJ
and Eclipse have the idea of you know
you got your project workspace and
that's where your source has to be right
netbeans has actually done pretty well
in this and the driver of our change in
this was actually not Java but c c++
development and what we saw for c c++
was and and for solaris slur studio was
that a lot of times these these c c++
guys they're coating on windows boxes
right but their coding for solaris they
don't even have the compilers on their
local machines right they don't have the
debuggers on their local machines the
code that they are riding on their
machine cannot physically be compiled
and run on the machine that they're
working on and so we've built in a
system or the I should I say we but it's
really the team in st. Petersburg built
in a system called remote development by
which you can have your entire source
on a different computer on the computer
that actually is the target run time and
you can edit it from your local machine
and it'll bring the files back and forth
and when you actually hit run or debug
or so forth it's actually tearing out
carrying out those operations on the
remote system so they started with that
for C C++ and now we're looking at
expanding that to work also with java
based on a cloud we're your source
repository and all your tools and so
forth are somewhere on a on a container
cloud p.m. or somewhere not physically
on your local machine of course VMs are
passe everything's containers now right
the ends are dead containers rule and
containers do rule their awesome right I
think it's a great advancement and but
there are some issues come up when you
rely on we're going to just use
containers to reproduce these
environments um one of them is the whole
point is to have your development
environment look as much as your
deployment environment as possible and
so unless you're using can you know
containers for your deployment
environment right or you can fully
replicate the way that your your your
application looks in the prin you're in
your production environment excuse me
not deployment environment production
environment then your containerized
development environment will not match
exactly your your production environment
for a lot of a lot of folks this might
not be a problem right because the
differences are some minimal that you
have pretty good face that that what
works in the container will work on the
production environment but there are
cases where where there's that doesn't
really work another thing is the whole
idea behind containers is we can get
greater density right so hey if we just
use containers then we can have one vm
one operating system and we can run lots
of little copies you know we can run you
know four or five tenants off that one
vm and
of having each developer have their own
vm well that's nice if you're doing tom
cat if you're doing you know lightweight
development but i don't care how
containerized it is you're not going to
fit many more than one instance of
you're never going to fit ten instances
of weblogic on one vm right these big
fat you know enterprise deployment
stacks even though you've containerized
it you're not going to get it small
enough that you can run a lot of them
off alone vm so you don't really get the
density gains your back to this same
problem you had in the first one in the
first step where you were using a full
vm there are questions about security if
you're doing full multi-tenant where
you've got different tenants on the same
VN using containers it really feels like
docker is well on its way and the
container you know movement is well on
its way to dealing with those things and
you can't configure it configure it to
get better isolation but you know
containers are not VMS they are just
containers they don't buy themselves
offer full full isolation between
containers running on the same container
runtime and then another thing you could
do well if you want to get away from the
from the cost of running these things in
the cloud just run them locally right I
mean the whole point here is not so much
that it needs to be running in the cloud
the whole point is that you have one
click setup of your development
environment so why not create those
containers put them up on the put them
somewhere where the user can grab them
and you can just download that container
run it on your docker engine locally and
then connect to it from your local IDE I
think that's a good approach again you
know questions of size come into play
here so you know I think that for
lightweight development that works very
well and even for you know medium light
weight to medium-sized deployments tax
that works well it breaks down a bit
when you're using very large app servers
with a full sew a stack on top of it and
you know database connectivity and so
forth so lots of challenges here and I
don't think any moons really figured out
the silver bullet here I think there's
different approaches depending on who
your customers are and what kind of
service you're putting out there so
question is whose well positioned to
deliver in this space right in fact is
all those servers to power the cloud
builds the tests the compilation or even
just the servers to hold your source
code and provide the nice you know
looking UI and so forth this all costs
money all right it's very difficult to
it's very difficult to charge just for a
browser-based IDE you know to keep the
lights on so really it seems to be that
the sweet spot is with the the cloud IDE
being a value at or the the browser
based tool integration being a value add
to your primary value proposition which
is going to be something else right
usually it's a pass or it's another
suite of developer ALM services or
something of that nature is your primary
value proposition and and the
cloud-based editing tools are a
complement to that and really I see this
wepon spot is the intersection between
various cloud services just editing your
code in a browser by itself does not add
a lot of value and as we've seen
actually has some drawbacks but when you
combine it with some of these other
services then you start getting some
sweetness out of it and to play in that
sandbox you have to either have your own
full-featured cloud right which is not
something that a lot of these startups
can do you can partner with others right
or you can provide a bunch of components
that people can download configure and
install themselves so you know providing
the configurable components it's like
we're supposed to be making this easier
right and so if you're if you're if
you're your solution requires to have at
least within your team won admin dev
tools admin it was going to have to
configure income you know this your job
all be just services that come out of
the box all right and partnering with
others and we see people do this
a lot of the code the the online a lot
of the online editors have functionality
where you can push your your stuff live
into an ec2 image or so forth problem is
is that I think those those
infrastructure as a service providers
are starting to move pretty aggressively
up stack and and there's going to be
less and less space as these providers
start start kind of integrating a lot of
these services themselves there's going
to be a lot less space where these
external people can build a value add
that they can charge for on top of on
top of that that infrastructure so so
now let me take off my general meal
pundit hat and talk about what NetBeans
team is doing in general and how that's
plugging into some of the things that
Oracle is doing so we want NetBeans to
be the engine of cloud developer
services so one of the main things we've
been doing over the last couple of
months is splitting a lot of the core
libraries into headless services so
we've been splitting the UI from the
logic we've been adjusting these these
these tools to be run in a multi-tenant
server environment rather than
single-tenant installed locally for one
user it's been a great challenge I was
uh I was at the flux talk the other day
where they said that just we you know
just taking the you know what you had
for you know built for locally installed
architecture and just saying let's put
it to the cloud it isn't going to work
and they were there right you know it
takes some serious we are connecting to
get some of these things split out and
get them to behave performant Lee and
with the right kind of density in a
multi multi-tenant environment but we're
making really good progress the first
major merger that has
in API review now and I think is going
to go into the into the cert into the
NetBeans repo so the first round of
services that will be that will be
exposing will be source indexing and
dependency analysis will be doing error
checking and hints code completion of
course and maven based build and deploy
and the important thing here is we are
not forking NetBeans we are not doing
this as a separate behind the walls
project this is all happening in the
main repository and and so we will
continue to be investing and having one
set of these services serving both the
desktop IDE and the browser based
services so where will these services
show up so right now a lot of these
services are showing up and are making
their way into Oracle products the
interesting thing about these is that
while NetBeans IDE itself is something
that is primarily of interest to
individual developers the NetBeans
services will be primarily of interest
to service providers right so it's going
to be interesting to see how these get
filtered down or get down to the level
of getting in front of users the first
round of places where we're going to get
this in front of users isn't a lot of
the Oracle cloud services that are
coming up so the Oracle developer cloud
service went live that's our suite of
ALM tools has get issue tracking
continuous integration and a lot of and
automatic deploy to Oracle Java cloud
service for example so we're already
coming in and integrated the indexing
service into that so that you can have
syntax aware the syntax of where code
browsing is coming in and a future
release it's not in the release its life
right now but so that you have syntax
aware code browsing and you can do the
full class hierarchy and
and navigation that you would have
inside an IDE there is a code editor
that is coming along we also are
investing in browser based code editing
right now we're following the kind of
the Microsoft of super model where any
time you have a vm on oracle compute and
you have developer cloud service to
manage the artifacts that go into that
BM you will also have a code editor
where you can in place on that vm edit
and edit compile deploy and debug so if
you need to just pop in and do a bug fix
you can do it right in the environment
rather than trying to replicate it
locally so that will be coming out but
and that's more of a single-tenant
solution where where each user gets
their own vm and so forth but we're also
looking at more multi-tenant ways to do
this I would personally like to see this
for example in the Java tutorials we're
inside right in all the Java tutorials
you'd be able to go in and have a little
editor where you could do all the code
examples right there get hints about
what you're doing wrong and so forth
make it more of an interactive thing
than just the read right thing are read
only thing there are various Oracle
cloud services that are spinning up
where where we'll be embedding spot
editing of source and configuration
files and we're really going to take it
slow here you know we're in the the
working for a big company can be a pain
in the butt sometimes but it's nice
sometimes and that you you don't have
quite you you can take time to kind of
figure out what makes sense sometimes
instead of always chasing the next round
of funding and so we're going to take it
slowly we're going to build what makes
sense and and be listening to folks and
like I said all these services will be
inside the netbeans codebase so we're
going to be talking also with partners
and people who would like to integrate
these services or see other services
that they can integrate in there
cloud offerings and see where it goes so
that's basically where we're at safe
harbor once again because you can never
get enough of that and i thought i had a
Q&amp;amp;A slide but i don't so that's what i
had there's any questions happy to
answer yes
right
right yeah that's that's one level that
you can go to which is just sharing my
my settings right and and that would be
significantly easier to do than doing
the full configuration management that's
true and that may be like a step that we
can that we can take you know going
forward but more than keyboard shortcuts
and so forth right the real that and
that is a pain when you know set up
another computer you have to set all
that stuff up that is a pain but but we
really what from talking to customers
what we see really the pain is setting
up especially the build and deployment
environment and mimicking that
faithfully on different systems that's a
lot bigger task for sure yep yes the
what oh the browser-based IDE no I don't
have it here i can't i can't bring it up
right now it's it's still like behind
the fire it hasn't been released yet
it'll be released probably in spring q1
q2 of next year so i can't can't get
into it too
okay all right well thank you very much
enjoy the rest of your office</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
