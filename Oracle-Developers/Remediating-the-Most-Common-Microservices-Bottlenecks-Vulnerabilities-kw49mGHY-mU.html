know it's a long day right thank you for
coming here in in the next hour I'm
hoping that I can give you a slightly
different viewpoint a slightly different
angle to application development and
what's needed for developers to
understand performance and other
vulnerabilities right so with that in
mind a quick background on myself my
name is Vijay thought her I'm a director
of product management in the Oracle
management cloud group I've been I have
about close to 30 years of industry
experience about eight years at Oracle
and before Sun was acquired by Oracle in
2010 I was I was at Sun for about 22 or
years so you know doing systems
development doing their little tools
things like that so being through a
number of these trends and some of it is
just coming from that perspective and
some of it may is actually new are
things that we are all learning now
because of the changing trends you'll
likely all agree with me I think what
I'm getting feedback am I using both
mics or just my own there is the voice a
little bit okay let me let me see if
this is so is that okay yeah okay
perfect so thank you I will walk around
so that may be annoying but bear with me
so with that in mind
safe harbor safe and you've probably
seen this all throughout the day let's
let's get so microservices clearly has
been the talk of town it's been the in
application design and application
architecture it has been the the new
thing that everyone's talking about it's
taken the application architecture world
by storm if I'm if I may be allowed to
say that the term was introduced some
time around 2011 so it's not that old
and it bobbled around for a few years
before seeing some good acceptance in
2014 and there are some classic adopters
probably the most famous one is is the
granddaddy of of them all is it's
probably Netflix so there's a lot of
reference there however despite its it's
short you know despite its short
lifetime so far it's there's a lot of
mention out there in in you can google
for the term you can get a lot of work
and that's because the community has
been very open about what it takes to
create a micro services driven
application okay so there's a lot of
sharing going on so we are all learning
from from that sharing I would be I
would probably not be wrong in thinking
that most big organizations these days
are at least talking about how their
newer architectures can be micro
services driven not necessarily that
they will change everything that they
currently have particularly if it works
right so I'm not going to take the
extreme viewpoint that it's it's for
everybody but it certainly is the new
trend and it certainly is the thing that
if you are writing an application now
and if you are writing an application
with the properties that we'll talk
about that that's the right thing to do
so before we go down too deep I just
wanted to make sure with this slide that
we are on the same page in terms of
definitions there isn't a formal
definition for micro services it's
generally thought of as an architectural
style that structures an application as
a collection of loosely coupled services
if you if you heard Adrian Cooke
Cockroft who was one of the architects
at Netflix who's talked a lot about
micro services and he's often referenced
as well
he used to often talk about it as
fine-grained SOA right finally and so in
in and in terms of loosely coupled
elements that have bounded context right
so all similar ideas the second one that
kind of goes with it is DevOps DevOps is
kind of a clip compound if I'm sure
we've all heard of payoffs it's kind of
late not to have heard if you think 2011
is mature enough there
has been around since 2008 right that
was when the term was first introduced
DevOps is kind of a clip compound of of
development software development and
information technology ops and and it's
kind of a merge of the the Ops guys you
know in the good old days developers
kind of stuck to development and did
worried that much about how their
applications went into production but
they did want to we all wanted to bring
out applications much far at a much
faster clip then than we did in the past
so a lot of the processes that changed
and the development side were also
pushed on the operation side so that the
operations and production could could
keep up with the various changes that
are going on so that's where DevOps
comes from systems management is a
classic term for IT ops right and you're
probably all familiar with it IT offset
the guys who are responsible for keeping
your data center up and running running
you know trying and figuring out you
know a resource capacity and are we do
you have enough resources to be able to
do what's needed if you if you are going
to if you have demands going to go up
forty percent in the next year you know
do you have the kind of resources and
house to do that all of that stuff all
the infrastructure stuff all the
operational stuff so that's all IT ops
management or systems management right
so just a common set of definitions here
with that I'll segue into development
architectures as I mentioned I've been
around for thirty years and you know
when I started in the industry we used
to talk about things like structured
programming that was the cool thing then
right and then what came out of that is
in a structured systems analysis and
design methods right so those are all
the the 80s terms if they may be you
know for some of you in a dinosaur terms
that you heard however some of it is
still in practice right so it's not like
you know those terms have disappeared
entirely 1990 saw more of the object
oriented programming kind of thing with
other trends like rapid application
development if you heard that term rad
right we used to be a popular in the 90s
rational tools were a cool thing so that
rational design philosophy is rational
unified programming as it was called
back then and then slowly towards the
end of 90s he started saying more of
continuous integration kind of concepts
come in particularly
interesting thing called extreme
programming which you which advocated
doing lots of pushes during the day not
waiting for a long cycle before you
actually started building things in the
in mm agile kind of caught up you know
they called it agile unified at that
time the agile kind of caught up and
then as we went along another was so uh
web you know web web dot next or web web
2 or however you want to call it and so
uh programming that came up until the
2000s and 2010's are more of an agile
scrum so as the my point of showing you
all this history is that you know these
trends are coming on for a reason in the
90s and in the in the O's right software
development focused on getting product
suites out so the so products became big
they got you know well in they were in
well integrated with a number of tools
the idea was to show a lot of value in
in for the product that you are charging
at that point that's all changing with
the with the services nature of product
delivery now there's no need for you to
to actually do big products anymore so
the old waterfall model of you know that
kind of forced a certain discipline of
having QA a whole department of QA right
build engineers release engineers
program managers you know things like
that that all is now falling by the
wayside for at least for the new
applications that are coming up what you
see more is with the services thing
there is a certain urgency around
meeting customer expectations and you
there is no longer it's no longer
sufficient to wait 18 months to get you
know the next big release of you know
whatever of database or of Linux or of
Solaris or whatever right out there for
you to to be able to meet your features
so the idea is you know when Netflix
started this Netflix was the monolithic
app too so and in their story the the
you know they tried making it work it
didn't work because they were supporting
100 device inspected now they did
support over 200 devices they are on all
types of TVs that you can think of there
and all types of phones you can think of
they're on all types of tablets you can
think of there are all types of laptops
you can think of there they essentially
have to be there on the Roku sticks
there and you know chromecast whatever
every device you can imagine Netflix has
got to run on it I'm not necessarily I'm
not pointing at just Netflix but if you
look at Spotify you look at you know all
the web ecommerce stuff they all have to
deal with that right and that's where a
lot of the motivation behind micro
services comes in that is the new tools
that are used there are essentially used
because you have to respond to this
changing needs rapidly so the agility
with which you deploy is extremely
important and the scalability that goes
with it it was it's it's rare I mean
Netflix's has over a hundred thousand
hundred million users probably closer to
like 150 hundred eighty I don't know the
numbers now they keep growing but
somewhere in that range and and these
are not just guys who come in and say I
want to watch this movie so you know
download the movie for me no they are
online and they are doing it for hours
and hours so these are in a millions
hundreds of millions of users who are
online all the time that's what they
have to deal with so that's a different
level of scalability than having a
database that is you know many petabytes
big and we are doing transactions on it
which also is a difficult problem but
it's a different difficult one right so
this is why folks like Netflix and then
even even Walmart Amazon all these guys
Spotify all these guys went through
exactly the same thing eBay you name
them they're all big companies doing
e-commerce they all have to deal with
the speed at which they have to release
to to catch up with new devices as new
devices get upgraded or as new devices
are introduced
that's a tough problem in order to do
that the whole development methodology
changed from the waterfall model to a
DevOps model where you do continuous
integration continuous deployments right
the deployment part of it is kind of
still in the innocence it's lagging the
development part when you look at DevOps
the the thinking is still as a popular
paper called you know putting the ops in
DevOps back right so the idea is all
these rapid methods that are used for
development are not necessarily used in
on the operation side but the two
markets are the two different kind of
mark
are coming closer together right and and
that's an important point that's I think
an interesting point that I would like
to elaborate a little bit more on what
micro services now allows you to do is
now because it's more of a component
model where you are writing smaller
components self-contained components
that have less dependency on things
around it you now have the freedom to
pick whatever platform you want and
that's the top line there right you can
you know you can be deploying using chef
or ansible you could be in a you are
using Jenkins or Hudson in many cases
you could be using scalar you could be
using go as programming languages in a
polyglot languages is the new is the new
accepted norm in terms of streaming you
could be using Oracle database in the
back like for big data you could be are
using Oracle data is perfectly good
database but for certain specific or
specialized cases you could well be
using Cassandra for if you have time
based matrix that you are looking for or
if you are looking for relationships you
could be looking at something like neo4j
right so each component gets to make its
own decision so they have that their
freedom they have their flexibility they
have their own style in the sense in
that sense of developing micarta okay
which is all good and now to make the
delivery of that possible we now have
have containers read which are equally
flexible we have doctors we have
kubernetes now there's the whole concept
of lambda which is is even more
fine-grained than than any of these
right so all of these strains are coming
together when I talk about micro
services its micro services its DevOps
it's agile its scrum it's all of these
things that you see right so all of
these go together so yeah this slide is
is more about you know why are we
you know why are people going to the two
micro services a primary reason so the
two that I pointed out it's they want
easily scalable apps right and they want
to do faster deployments so the agility
and scalability so you don't have to
take pictures this presentation is on on
oracle.com slash code okay
just go to my session downloaded it's
already there okay and
don't have to worry about Saviour say we
are filming for film for other purposes
later so clearly that that's a big thing
right I mean who doesn't like cake right
that's the punchline there it's it's a
it's a it's a wonderful thing you have
the freedom to adopt what looks best for
you very often it's because you can pick
the languages he or you are comfortable
it whether it's Java whether it no J's
whether it's Python JavaScript could be
other things like go as we saw in the
previous picture right you can pick your
your communication protocols as well the
idea is keep this protocol slight that
that was that's the design principle
there right use your use your own
framework use your own languages but
keep the protocols simple right
however there are other issues that
start coming up and we'll talk about
those as well right so I hope that up
until this point you will agree with me
that you know this is kind of where
microservice is going right it's an
interesting it's definitely an
interesting trend that has come up and
this is something that all architects
need to worry about so you know being
here you know I was a developer for many
years as I said at the beginning you
know developers like the cool new trends
because you want to be on top of them
before they are on top of you that's not
that the situation you want to deal with
right so it's it's if you haven't you
know considered it you should start
seriously considering it's not something
that will go away that's for sure
because it's kind of part of the grain
of you know what we are marching towards
these days right there are challenges
even for a perfectly implemented micro
service based application there are
challenges right they're inherently
complex because you're breaking things
down into small pieces you don't know
how these pieces fit together right if
you do a really good job of designing by
API is maybe they fit really well okay
so the yeah but you have introduced
complexity as part of this you know you
introduced you know do people actually
test in production very few developers
actually test in production right there
is of course that joke about when i test
i test in production thing right but you
know the reality is you know there's
very little of that testing going on so
you know there is service discover
then you know there's fan-out issues
right so data D serialization you know
there's all kinds of issues like those
there are for some best practices right
and I actually made note of some of them
there's you know isolate your services
decentralize their services
I want the fan-out right by caching some
of the data this there's like a whole
about 10 or 12 things that that are
recommended as part of the best
practices many organizations actually
follow it and because this is still a
new discipline the current set of rules
that are in place that generally people
like agree are good are the ones that
people are accepting I mean they they
tweak them so you see you know different
variants on it but the core principles
are are the ones that are accepted these
days so I think the best practices are
evolving and and they're getting agreed
upon as we go along right but as I said
even in the best cases we have we have
issues that we have a lot of issues with
micro services distributed architectures
are difficult to debug you know if if
only we could we could do some topology
self discovery that would help because
it would help you give an overall view
of quality an application is doing not
only of what your application is doing
but how it is running in production
environments right latency is difficult
to pinpoint right because you don't know
in a long link of you know various
components you say oh my component I
wrote it really well it's very tight and
very very high performance right surely
it must be this other guy
okay so that that's an easy thing so how
do you track that here so security is a
con there's a slide on it later on right
security is something that developers
typically have not been very aware of
till now right but it is among the
things that I'm pointing out is security
I think Security's is something that we
all need to be aware of the you know
before this
presentation here there was a hands-on
lab that did real part of where I where
we had one of those as we needs use
cases that we walked through it's
important for users to know it's very
important for developers to know about
security so hold on that for the two
onto that question for a second okay
I'll come to it in in a minute so there
are various issues I won't go through
each one of them because I'm actually
getting to a point okay the point that
I'm making is this is a very complex so
we have increased the complexity of what
it is that we are deployed we are we
have increased the complexity of what we
are pushing into the data center not
just us you know there's a whole bunch
of other reasons why the complexity has
increased our classic data centers are
NOLA our the new data centers are no
longer the way the classic ones used to
be right there's no fortress there's no
firewall there is I mean there they are
all there but that's not the only
limitation anymore people are going to
cloud you know on an average they go to
six different cloud services so we've
created a problem now of complexity for
ourselves like as part of this so micro
services increases that complexity
DevOps increases that complexity okay we
have to recognize it I'm not saying
that's a bad thing I'm just saying that
has to be that's something that we
should recognize what we have done is we
took some of these problems and and we
said how can we tackle them so that in
the future as we manage these these
problems become more easily manageable
the number of system administrators in a
company is not growing you know most of
you will agree unless you're in the
really new company or a small company
system administrators is not growing the
number of security professionals in the
company is not growing the amount of
data that is that's coming into this
into a data center is growing the number
of apps that are coming is growing
because people are dumping out not
dumping releasing apps at a very frantic
pace right dealing with that you know
you have 17 variants that are used by
different people right of the same
library that stuff what you see
happening in the data center is there's
a lot so the one problem we don't have
is we don't have you know a dearth of
data we
we have a lot of data all these various
layers whether you're talking about
application or you know middle middle
tier or whether you are looking at VMs
or whether you are looking at data tiers
or whether you're looking at in all of
these infrastructure tiers all of these
generate tons and tons of data right
you get millions and millions of log
entries every day you get metrics for
performance you get server matrix you
get diagnostic logs you get you know all
of the things that you see in addition
to that you get security threads you get
you know a whole bunch of things that
that are available now all of these are
are pouring into your data center every
day and the job of the poor system
administrator is is becoming
increasingly tough so what happens the
system administrator knows what he or
she is doing and they continue doing
knowing you know doing the things that
they know on an average about only about
6 percent of the data is actually looked
at the remaining 94 percent gets
archived if there is a problem in the
data center then post-mortem they'll go
go back and look at you know what could
have caused that problem right this is
this is a difficult problem to solve so
what we have done is we have taken all
of that weave this area will get all
these streams will get millions we get
gigabytes of logs right typically in
during the day right we take all those
gigabytes of logs from disparate sources
right there's like something like 1,400
different log formats these days this is
what I hear right and I'm sure the
number of log formats is growing - what
we do is we try to unify them you put
them in a unified platform so that we
can correlate between them and then
instead of having a system administrator
take all that and stick it into an Excel
spreadsheet and and do searches or do
column column searches right what we do
is we we can actually run machine
learning on it right because what you
want to get to is that needle in the
haystack where do you have this huge
amount of data what you really want to
get to is anomalies what you really want
to see is what are the clusters what
what are the clusters of of behavior
what are the trends what are the
outliers that I'm seeing a machine
learning algorithm is able to do that
much much better than we are as human
beings no matter how
we try and that's what we've done we've
taken a lot of this information we
created a uniform platform and then
we've put machine learning on it powered
with machine learning as we say right
and on top so today's world is not just
you know your own data center but it's
heterogeneous here getting data from AWS
from Azure from Oracle's open Oracle
public cloud you know all kinds of
places maybe other clouds to you so it's
intravenous it's open and and that's
what leads to the complexity that you
see the complexity is not necessarily
bad it's just that we need to get to a
point where we get on top now why is all
of this important for us all developers
you know one of the assumptions that I
made when when we did this walking
through the presentation is DevOps that
is the world of development and the
world of operations is now getting
together it's all you know getting so
close to the gather it's tied at the hip
so what used to work for ops our
facilities that now can help developers
as well and developers had better know
how their applications are deployed in
production too because this long you
know problem that we've had four years
of you know it works in my environment I
don't know why it doesn't work in your
environment is not a problem that that
is it's a problem that's getting
increasingly harder to solve and now
with cloud it's becoming our problem too
that is it's not just you know it's not
on somebody else's premise it's um it's
on our cloud right that that's what's
driving this okay so developers have to
understand how how deployment of their
of their application set this is where I
think a number of system management
tools that we have been developing over
years can help developers over time and
as we as you are just pointing out
security is is a big issue - don't
forget about security right you know
about so the - in recent Intel bugs
right meltdown the inspector right you
know about those guess who has to deal
with them it's us it's developers okay
the the OS guys you know they I will not
describe how the Linux developers have
described the fix that David that they
need to
make fun it the the acronym is not
something I can I can spell out in a big
forum like this okay
it's it's a difficult it's really a
difficult problem for us all but it is a
problem that is imminent for all of us
it's facing us in it's staring us in the
face all the time okay these are some of
the top security concerns that we have
these are common concerns these may be
data center concerns but remember
developers also have to deal with the
same thing about two years back we ran
into the heartbleed and venom which is
what we are talking in the previous
session right buffer over-read and
buffer overwrite problems right in to
some extent melt melt down inspector or
also buffer overwrite promise you take a
certain you get into somebody is a
memory of one of the processes that's
running and you can then walk over into
the buffer of kernel buffer in the case
of meltdown right once you get into a
kernel buffer you can you can do pretty
much anything you want on the system
right these are difficult problems
buffer overrun is this is something
software developers had to deal with
it's not something that typically
Hardware folks deal with now there are
exceptions you know when when I was in
the SPARC platform we actually had a
spark chip that did silicon secured
silicon in memory and it did secured it
did security in silicon so sorry so it
had protections by which you could
separate these buffers out but that's
that's not something that that's easy to
design it's as in software engineering
it's much easier to do that for us to
design these buffer protections
ourselves right so these are the
right-hand side are some of the
techniques that you can use to protect
yourself there's a new thing called
grasp that's that may actually be a cool
thing that many companies including
including Oracle I developing right
there is the runtime application self
protection so ways by which applications
can protect themselves against harm from
outside right we are all learning from
from the various security threats there
are and and we are developing new
methods to protect ourselves against it
something that I think absolutely
developers need to to be cognizant about
yeah
it's an offering it's it's a product
yeah so yeah so what we'll do in the
next in the remaining part yeah it was
there a question sorry on the run time
so it's still a new concept the idea is
you can you can put your application in
in a in a kind of mode with a moat
around it and have ways of protecting
it's like thinking of isolating your
application in a certain environment and
having enough protections around it
right so you can you can look that up or
I'll give you more details on it as we
contact so I think this is this is any
type of application right now it can be
a web application can be job yeah so I
would like to spend the rest of the time
that we have on walking through some of
the some of the use cases right so what
do we need in order to overcome some of
the performance issues that we have in
some of the vulnerabilities that we have
first of all we need to understand you
know how can we monitor our
infrastructure understand topology this
is understanding topology is probably
one of the central concepts behind it
okay and then you know how do we
understand how to look at logs that come
out and how we can relate that to some
of the problems that are in our in our
applications right the the tools also
give you a way by which you can do end
to end transaction tracing and also look
at not just the server so you can do
server side and you can do browser side
as well that's what step 3 and 4 are
step 5 is kind of you know there are
things that developers need to do which
is what one two three four are your
managers typically will not be impressed
when you do steps 1 2 3 4 because
they're to protect yourself managers are
interested in understanding if the
functionality that you that you have
implemented how well does that work and
show me right that's what step 5 is how
do you do synthetic monitoring right and
and provide that data to to your
deployment folks right and then there's
auto auto detection of performance and
anomalies that that we can do so if I
can get that far but monitoring all of
your infrastructure
we have an application performance
monitoring tool that basically can build
out a whole topology and can get you
your infrastructure topology from the
ground up it's done by a combination of
APM and infrastructure monitoring I
won't get into all the services
themselves so let's do a quick what do
we need in order to do this right we
need to understand how you can do
discovery in configuration right how do
you discover how how the thing is put
together can you do monitoring and
alerting right and then on top of it can
you do a Analytics rate so so a quick
look what we can so the infrastructure
monitoring tool that we have basically
gives you a dashboard of everything
that's running in your that's related to
your application
everything that's running in your data
center that's related to the application
it gives you at a glance what's up
what's down are there any open alerts
you know is is everything working as as
expected right so this is at a glance
view very quick way of understanding
that there are things that ok the same
way you can do this for CI CDs that is
for continuous integration continuous
deployment infrastructure this is a chef
environment in which you are doing
continuous builds where you where you
see a similar dashboard with all the all
the metrics laid out again at a glance
you can see if there if there are issues
with with their non-metal ok in in the
in the Oracle management cloud we have a
facility by which you can do topology
self discovery essentially what you are
doing is you're looking at where all
these we call them entities you know
where all the whether it's a software
application or whether it's say a
hardware property right where are they
you know how what's the relationship
between them so much of it can be auto
discovered much of it can be discovered
from from the way they call each other
ok and the idea is once you have the
topology of an application including
your infrastructure in place
you know what the relationships are
between each one of them right so if you
are in the microwave micro services
world if you can actually do something
like this
then you are not going to point a
performance problem on to somebody else
because you can actually go trace which
part of that is is actually causing that
if you can figure out with how these
arrows are connected to each other okay
so this is a dynamic graph that we have
any time anything changes in this
application whether it's it's a new
component or something in the host
changes or you put new containers in
there you know some new deployments and
they're the the map will automatically
update okay so so this is I think an
absolute must in this case okay next I
wanted to talk about a pretty cool
feature that we have that you know looks
at it's a great debugging tool it also
is good for understanding where the
potential performance bottlenecks are so
let's walk through that what we have is
a weir so this is an an order
application right that is multi-tiered
is is micro service driven has lots of
components to it and there are steps
involved right so there's the browser UI
that talks to application server talks
to database that in turns out so the
payment system there's all of those
components then there's a delivery
system that it talks to as well so there
are lots and lots of what's called step
names in your steps that are involved in
each of the order lots of logs as you
can see in a 1.2 million log entries you
know collected over a short period of
time the reason I'm showing you this is
because we know there's a problem right
they have told us that there are certain
orders that are not going that are going
extremely slow question is how do you
debug it you have all these logs there
you know you're not going to look
through 1.2 million logs we have a
feature called links that basically what
it does is it it will link all the
entities that are involved or all the
applications that are involved what we
call all the steps that are involved
with a particular order right so it
looked through all these logs and say
AHA this order number or this order ID
the 1 2 3 4 5 matches with this 1 2 3 4
5 matches with this one so they must be
all parts of some steps right and then
based on the time stamp it will tell you
which step came for
which came next which so you can do that
so you can create a linkage of that type
once you create a linkage of that you
are essentially converted 1.2 million
transaction logs into 70,000 entries
right so these are your business
transactions and you can see for each
one of them what steps are involved with
it for each one you can see how many log
entries you saw not only that how many
you know what's the start time what's
the end time and how long did did that
particular event take like so clear
enough but this doesn't get us any
closer to solving the problem ok we can
do this this doesn't mean that you lost
the details you can click on any one of
these entries and when you click on them
you get all the details of the log back
in case you ever want to go back and get
more details from the log itself log
entry itself you can always do that but
you know you as I said you know that
doesn't solve the problem for us the
problem still exists so what we do is
there's this that analyze button on it
we send all of this data to a machine
learning engine that basically takes
this and says ok now convert this data
into clusters of different types right
so tell me which clusters are working
which ones are outliers right so that's
essentially what we do so the moment you
do that it basically gives you a graph
of this type so what it's done is is
that it's taken all the data and it's
created these various clusters in terms
of what the event duration was if you
can't read what's on the what's on the
x-axis basically they're seconds what
it's saying is that in the in a vast
majority of the transactions the amount
of time required is is you know maybe a
few seconds to maybe 10 seconds or so 20
seconds at worst right but you see
certain clusters you see those 3
clusters that are to the right right and
those are problems because those are
taking much much longer so that's where
your problem is likely to be now how do
you figure out what it is you click on
that and when you click on it you get
you get more details about that cluster
right you see what part of it is
actually causing a problem here so this
is a shipment issue so this may actually
not be related but think about this
enter
of microservices I think in terms of
components you just figured out that
there is something wrong with one piece
of your entire application flow right
and we did this in in minutes as opposed
to looking at transaction in a 1.2
million transaction logs so this is the
power that you get out of analyzing logs
that that come out of all of these and
be able to run it through a machine
learning algorithm that can then cluster
it for you can find out outliers can
find out those anomalies that are like
way out there right and those that's
that's a needle in the haystack that's
the one that you are looking to to go
and analyze yeah sorry
is it a Mac oh yeah so you can do that
to some one of the later steps will show
you that right so you can deep dive and
you can figure out if it is that is this
a server request is a you know yeah you
can deep dive to a point of where in
server code is the problem you can in
fact pinpoint the line number as well
this was automatically help your
stitches of this field correct correct
so this is locked but this what I'm
showing it is log you can relate this
log to application performance
monitoring where you do a lot of
sampling right so you you sample your
run as you go along if you can sample
those runs then you collect the data and
the sample data gives you traces of your
stack right and when you look at that so
will if I if I have enough time we can
we'll walk through that right you can
look at the instances that will point
you with a stack trace where the issues
are okay so yes it will get get you to
that level of detail so once you do that
now you know that you can you can focus
in on certain transactions right on
uncertain you have a server a call tree
of types that that you can then get as I
mentioned you can integrate this data
with with application performance
monitoring data and and by doing that
understanding what the call tree is you
can go down on both on the server side
as well as in the client side right so
the next couple of slides are basically
along those lines right so with
performance monitor with application
performance monitoring the one of the
things that you get with it is it's it's
a graph right so it shows you what the
performance has been over the past
whatever period right over the past week
or the past in a month over the past you
know two days whatever however you want
to keep it so there's three aspects to
it you know you can go back and look at
performance issues that you had in the
recent past that it has captured you can
look at the problem as it's happening
now and in while you are doing all this
machine learning you know algorithms one
of the things that machine learning can
can point out is what are the
performance issues that you run likely
to run into by doing projections of it
it's not it's not no magic there it's
only forecasting right based on the data
that it sees it's extrapolating in some
cases it's it's able to point out the
problems by showing you you know where
the memory leaks can happen right and by
understanding whether the memory leaks
are abnormal or or normal you can you
can understand if you run into something
in the future right in the immediate
future right so that's the that's the
power of of APM application performance
monitor some of the some of the slides
you see are basically intended for that
so here you know we can once you
understand what the aggregate
topological performance across these
various microservices then you can drill
down into the country and understand go
in terms of interaction where what's the
path for these errors ready you see
these graphs on top right the yellow
line yellow and and then you see these
calls and error so right right now there
are no errors but you can use that to
track that as well you see a tab there
called it's called instances it's this
last word one tab before alert right
those are all the profile events that
that you have taken right so you can
actually look through each
profile events you don't want to look at
all of them because there's just too
many of them so what you do is in you
narrow it down to a certain you know in
a call tree you see based on the size of
the link that you see that's how much
time is taken so you can figure out what
the latency is based on the size of the
link so you narrow down on that link and
you say okay show me that link show me
what's causing you know in this call
what what's the component that's having
that issue then you go look at the
instance itself right to figure out
where those issues might be so we look
at that there are three three different
instances that that occur here that have
very very high latency here so we can
drill down on any one of them right so I
will pick the one that's the worst and
when you see that you see you see a full
trace so what you will see in the trace
is to your question is you actually see
all the line numbers there too so you're
actually tracing through through the
stack calls at that particular time as
these instances are being recorded right
so you can get that level of detail you
can also get sequel IDs in this case it
you know the sequel IDs don't really
matter because that's not where the
problem is so you can deep dive in and
see where the problem is there right so
when you click on as I mentioned when
you click on one of those events you see
this whole stack of you know if this is
where the problem is including this is
the line number this is the application
you can go deep down into the code
server-side code to figure out where
where you are running into into those
four issues right in we are there is
also a feature to actually dumped out
JFR I don't know if you if you are a
Java programmer then a lot of the data
for Java comes in in the form of Java
flight recorder data similar to the
profiling data that I mentioned
typically Java flight recorder data is
is fed into Java what's called Mission
Control so that's the application that
can analyzer your your flight recorder
data or analytics data if to simplify
that terminology we can do this
the APM itself right you can dump all
that information and you can get at a
glance you can understand if there is
going to be a memory leak somewhere
right if there if there's an impending
you know what the GC characteristics are
we can get some of that in a PM also so
it's a it's a very cool tool to
understand the performance and you get
reports right I mean the reports here
sorry the font is like really bad you
and I can't read it here on this but
it's essentially trying to say you know
how much memory is being used what's the
application you know are there reasons
it's whole thing is there GC pressure so
the second red thing is is you know
there's 100 on the scale of one to
hundred there's a 100 notation on GC
pressure so you know you can do things
like that with JFR dumps if you are not
familiar with Jeff Adams don't worry
about this right it's just another level
of detail for Java applications to
understand
joelly afford to understand garbage
collection and and memory issues right
so you can exactly the thing that I
mentioned on the server side you can do
on the client side as well right you can
trace down page page level data you can
trace down Ajax calls and and do you
find exactly the same level of
information as well up feeling I'm
running way over time am I so I won't
necessarily you know this is exactly the
same flow that we see on the on the
client side that we saw on the server
side in in the tool you can actually
figure out where are these page calls
coming from you know what geo what
browser type is being used to access
access the site you know what devices
are being used to access the site looks
like that right so you get all of that
information at a glance and you can use
that to kind of narrow down on your
February question and follow that path
on the client side as well how are you
know what client calls are making the
thing I'm making things worse on the
server side again this is the call tree
that you saw earlier as well so and you
get get tracing data as I mentioned
before so I just skip over this sorry
this was the instances data
as I mentioned we collect all the
instances we have narrowed down to one
particular anomaly during that anomaly
we know all the instead all the probes
that were on the profile probes that
were taken
what's the instance data there right so
we can get down to that level of detail
and get traces for that right so all
good stuff as I mentioned there is a
there is a way to get to do synthetic
monitoring which means you know do you
run your tests when you run your tests
to prove that your functionality
actually works you can capture that data
and this is this is stuff that you know
your deployment folks or your management
would be happy to see right that hey
things that you claim to the work
actually work the first four things are
are more more of developers own actions
read to help debug performance problems
on the development side so with that
I'll end this with this so with this one
slide we have as I said ways of figuring
out where these anomalies come we apply
the same algorithm to regular
performance data you see a certain trend
of performance and and what it can do is
it can pick out anomalies based on the
trend not based on some static high and
low bars that you said you can do that
too if you want right but what it does
is it actually understands data as it
comes along and it says compared to what
I saw a week back which is what your
trend was I see this is a high point
right so there's automatic automatic
detection of performance and anomaly
zero that would be so with that so
that's basically what I have I think
many of these tools we are using so the
Oracle management cloud is a tune that
we use in-house both on the Oracle
public cloud as well as in in several in
in all of our development groups as well
right to debug these problems so in a
sense we are you know flying our own
planes or you know eating our own dog
food however you want to call it right
so highly from my point of view highly
recommend that this would be a very
useful tool for folks to use and then in
the new framework right so that's what I
had I know I spoke a little fast
hope you didn't mind any any questions
here to which to Jennings oh yeah yeah
so I showed one of the dashboards was
was a continuous integration continuous
deployment scenario right so yeah
absolutely right
Oracle management cloud is a is a cloud
service that you feed data into right so
you all you need to do is feed data into
it whether it's performance monitoring
data or logs right you just you send
that data to the management cloud and it
gives you all the analysis that that is
just saw so it's not a management cloud
in the sense it's not a management thing
in the sense of managing your
infrastructure it's a management thing
in terms of managing your IT yeah yeah
exactly yeah put them on this machine
automatically there's no yeah yeah yes
this is heat regina's it's it's open we
we have logs from AWS we have our logs
for assured we have logs from all the
non Oracle entities I should say on the
world is big but we have several non
Oracle entities as well and if we don't
have a log parser for the kind of log
you're looking for you can write a parse
that we have api's for it it's actually
fairly trivial to write a parser so I
would say no because I'm from Oracle
right so it's it's a cloud service it
depends on it so the cloud service is up
in the cloud you don't have to buy
hardware you don't have to buy anything
right just feed us the data let us do
the analysis the cost of it depends on
two things
how many entities are you monitoring how
many hosts how many applications into
that kind of thing
and
second thing it depends on is how much
how much log data are you giving us
right just based on that so there's
there's a certain pricing thing so you
know send me an email I'm happy to have
the pricing discussion with you it
depends on who you are comparing with it
could be it could not be right it
depends on the use cases there are cases
where I can show you it's 80% cheaper
doesn't mean anything if it's not for
you right the pricing is a different
discussion there's all these cool things
and there will be more cool things as we
go forward with this later
so that's what's happening here right
you can drill down to the instances but
they're all collated together yeah right
so I I think it's time for the next
folks so thank you very much I
appreciate truly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
