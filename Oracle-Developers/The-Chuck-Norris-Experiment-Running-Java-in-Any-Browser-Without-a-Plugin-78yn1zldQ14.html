about the chuck norris experiment a very
interesting experiment for running java
without a jailbreak on the ipad and on
android and in case you're wondering
about my clothing i just i just read the
Oracles instructions for speakers and
they say like you should wear casual not
business but casual clothes and actually
this is how in Munich where I'm coming
from we dress it casual Fridays so I'm
Tony apple from epic IT consulting in
Munich basically a very small
consultancy we're dealing mainly with
javafx when their beans platform and
swing applications and here with me is
yellow stuff to LA the founder of
NetBeans and well I'm also a little bit
associated with netbeans since i'm on
the nevians dream team so we we meet
like once a year in January usually for
for a course that we do at the
University of Linz in Austria and every
time I come there yarda brings a cool
new project and last year it was the
cool new project was back to browser and
we are going to talk about that now and
since I've got a little game engine I
thought oh well that sounds interesting
i want to do something with it and i'm
basically the first user of his api and
i will show you a little bit of what
what i did with it so if you have a if
you want to introduce a new technology
you always have to have a problem
statement a problem that you want to
solve with it and our problem is clearly
JavaScript who of you is doing
JavaScript are you also doing java who
is doing JavaScript and Java ok so what
is easier do you think it's easier to
code in Java or in JavaScript for Java
JavaScript
due to person oh that's gutsy that's
Kathy we will convince you that it's
well JavaScript well javascript is
really uh it's to get serious it's
really in a lot of projects getting a
problem because it's very hard to write
maintainable JavaScript if the projects
get larger that is really a bit of a
problem because you can do so many
strange things with JavaScript and it's
hard to enforce a nice programming model
and you have to a lot have to do a lot
of testing because there's no static
typing so you cannot really make the
compiler chair look for the errors but
you will find out through tests and that
costs a lot of money so maintenance is
going up and there are in the meantime
even conferences that are just there for
how do we solve the prob we get rid of
JavaScript basically there was one
conference last year that was really and
they were introducing a couple of
different techniques like for example
typescript which gives you a nicer
programming model or GWT which allows
you to compile your JavaScript at your
Java to JavaScript so you program in
Java language that is very easy to
program in and that is very safe and you
create in under the hood you create
JavaScript from it but we would like to
introduce a different solution and yeah
the second problem that we have is that
Java which would be nice statically
typed language does not run on all the
interesting devices I mean it's stable
but but it's no room for a long time
it's it's no works write once run
anywhere but you have very limited a a
type of devices where you can run java
on on the desktop and that is actually a
problem so we would like to bring those
two together in some way in order to
solve the problem so you can write nice
clean java code and you can still
leverage you can still run on all of the
interesting devices
so the solution for a solution for a
problem like this you really need some
very very strong person and that is
basically Chuck Norris because chuck
norris can do anything chuck norris can
instantiate abstract classes he uses
generic since Java 10 he overrides final
methods and he can run Java on an iPad
and Android without a jailbreak no well
that's the question if he can do it we
will try to find it out so the goal is
to run our application written in Java
in one hundred percent of modern
browsers so any modern browser like on
an Android device iOS whatever you name
it and for that we won't know plugin we
do not want the NSA to tell us that we
should uninstall the plug we cannot run
the application on in our browser we
want no plugin minimal minimal
compatibility issues we want to get back
to this model write once run anywhere
and we do not want to be limited by a
certain programming model like you have
you have certain widgets that you can
can work with certain model that is
enforced of us like for example in GWT
where you have a very strict certain
kind of applications that you can create
very easily but it limits you in other
ways and in order to do that we also
want to run pure bytecode so we do not
want to cross compile we do not want to
compile to JavaScript we want to run the
same bytecode in a hot spot virtual
machine that we can run in the in our
browser we want to package our
application as a char so we can just
like use
library use it in our project and just
edit in a maven project or something
like that any dependency so the plan how
do we solve that how do we get there
that's a lot of stuff we want java on
all of these devices but we don't get it
there we do not get a virtual machine
installed there there are certain
limitations on just-in-time compilation
and stuff like that that the the vendors
of those operating systems that are most
interesting prohibit us to use so but
what is on all of these devices is
JavaScript so why not run Java on top of
JavaScript and that is the approach that
a project is taking that is called back
to browser and that yard I invented so
it's basically his pet project and I
think it's really cool so the idea is
not to compile Java to JavaScript but to
have a virtual machine it's a real java
virtual machine that is written in
javascript and that runs in the browser
because all the modern browsers support
javascript yet it is not written in
javascript it it's written in java right
sorry sorry translate the DHS translated
to javascript sorry do deployment model
is loading javascript yeah you're right
for the virtual machine when it's
running its JavaScript yeah okay okay
that works and basically what we need is
the the chuck norris flying toronado a
roundhouse kick and that is back to
browser the back to browser project was
started in 2012 and I learned about it
shortly after that by yarda and
currently the version number is 0 dot 8
and if you want to after this talk I'm
pretty sure you will want to learn more
about the project you go to back to
browser API design arc where you can
find more information and where you can
also find where you can download
the project have a look at the sources
because it's really interesting we had
to talk earlier today where I learned
more about the internals of off back to
browser I mean I have the project on my
on my laptop and i'm working with it but
to get really at the guts of it i really
learned a couple of things today well
that's probably because i don't have
time to write documentation i need to
write code so well that sort of big
behind well in a way no I it's okay
we're just like you were showing the
internals and then the internals
basically don't need to be documented
because you never you never used them
but they are interesting so I think so
the idea is to create a really small jvm
and the chai vm currently has around 200
k and in javascript and it behaves just
like a normal JVM or that is at least
the plan and yarda refers to it as a
profile do you want to ok so I refer to
it as compact zero profile and because
you are here at cha one one of the most
one of the biggest messages at least for
me was the interaction of jdk profiles
the ability to slim down java to be
smaller and to fit into any device so
the official profiles that are supported
by jdk are compact one compact two and
come back three and then the full JRE so
well the thing that we need to balance
when we are trying to get java to the
browser is a richness of implementation
together with speed and performance and
well the smaller the compact is the
easier it's to boot it up and run it in
the browser so right now the supported
profile is even smaller than
compact one profile and well I sort of
call it compact zero profile the
essential part of Java that you need
when you want to compile code for Java
because certain classes are needed
necessary for the compiler compiler for
example knows about exceptions it notes
about string string buffer about auto
crucible and other certain elements of
our classes in the Java library so these
are essential so what I was trying to do
is to create a small subset of Java and
boot it up and not under virtual machine
in so compact it'll basically and
compact 0 really has some limitations so
I also ran when I used used it into some
limitations but there are two basically
two ways around it the best way is to
write a test and submit it and the other
will take care of it and fix it and
implement the functionality or most
likely and and the other way is like
fiddling a bit with the cold like for
example I had I had a physics engine J
box2d it's called and this physics
engine is really very cool it's used in
games like for example Angry Birds uses
this physics engine and I wanted to use
that in in my games and it was like two
lines of code that I had to change in
the source code fortunately it's open
source and after that it ran perfectly
in back to browser so there are
limitations but they are but but is that
big there is nothing special on doing
this for example well this is something
he will face with jdk 8 8 profiles as
well for example i was trying to run
grizzly HTTP server on top of GD k 8
compact to profile and it just crashed
because it was compiled or and written
originally on jdk 7 and it's contains
about three lines referencing java x
naming initial context so we just needed
to put put try and catch around this
block and just ignore
the discovery in case this class is not
present so these are the kind of changes
we will all have to do to our libraries
to make them run on the smaller java
okay so minimal version to support is
java 6 that's where we start from and
currently the implementation of
effective browser is based on jdk
openjdk version 7 openjdk 7 built 148
well I needed to put some choose one and
at the time I was starting to work on
the emulation of the g-code Java
libraries this was the newest one so I
took it and then I'm basically needed to
implement its native methods to be to do
something else in a browser so basically
those are the main packages that are
supported but not all of them are I
think fully supported there are a couple
of methods a couple of classes missing
I'm not sure it was just that that
presentation is is like two months old
or something definitely down missing
missing methods and I'll java.util
concurrent for example we'll have some
missing classes probably it doesn't have
to but because it's easy to implement
concurrency in JavaScript then because
it's single threaded a Christian L do we
support reflection yes we do we can look
up classes dynamically create instances
find their methods and invoke methods
based on reflection GWT does not all
right this is this is supposed to be
real virtual machine not just a
Malaysian and piggy that piggybacks on
the Java language this really works with
bytecode classes so the it really tries
to emulate the behavior
of the core libraries really one by one
so you you should not really notice the
difference and in case there are
differences well I think there's slight
missing okay in case there are
differences it's easy to write a test
exactly well I think that's throughout
the slide well okay so back to browser
runs unchanged in hotspot so back to
browser code runs unchanged in in
hotspot it makes heavy use of
annotations so if you want to work with
it you will work with annotations which
is great because yarda is is really very
good at writing adaptation processors
and he will also provide like for
example completion items that you can
that any brought any IDE that supports
has nice support for for annotations for
annotation processors will provide to
you so you can have code completion very
easily without having to create a
specific support for for back to browser
so that is really cool like NetBeans for
example is an IDE that is very good at
that well we need to do some few bug
fixes but right now basically all the
annotation purchasers are based on
standard support in jdk so Java Sea
pursue system normally and that means ID
understands them as well so the whole
project itself is built by maven and it
has also maven archetypes that you can
use to get started and create your own
project with it and we will switch to
first demo so how to create an
application from made an archetype and
simply run it so this is NetBeans 7 dot
4 which is going to be released next
month plus minus six months well this is
the common Oracle warning that
we cannot promise the delivery of
anything so and i installed one
additional module which enhances the
NetBeans functionality and it's
available on the plug-in center you just
can install it if you want as well but
even if you don't have 7 dot for you can
you can just use the maven archetype and
create a project from that that's true
so yeah basically what this does is a
just nice face to existing maven
archetype so you can do anything back to
browser from a comment line if you want
because it's bill all the tooling
support is based on maven ok I have the
I have the plugin installed and now I
can go into new project wizard select
html5 and here is a little item called
HTML with Java logic let's name it
somehow and it generates a project and
this project consists of some sorry
sample web page and also of classes of
java classes no well and this way I can
do with it is to run it so I started in
the back mode and this will bring up
javafx the view which is going to show
my HTML page and what I can do here I
can basically modify something in the in
the message window and it move it okay
and it immediately modifies modifies the
rest of the page so and this is
relatively easy to do because in this
example I'm reusing knockout jes and
here is a bit of animations so well it
it moves and when you are tired when
something doesn't work for you you can
put a breakpoint here and for
example say okay stop and it stops but
not only the animation but also inside
of the IDE and you can do debugging so
now that we're that we're at least three
demos ahead of the schedule okay I'm
sorry I I don't know if that one's it's
really cool ah yeah and the next stuff
that we have if you saw the keynote then
you might notice that the NetBeans has
really good support for HTML and
JavaScript well this is HTML so let's
use the same support as well so for
example here is a dumb browser which is
connected to the running application and
shows me to content of the of the HTML
page the structure of the HTML page and
I can switch to a selection mode and
then go and select something and it
selects and shows me here what we're in
the Dom tree this element is and I can
go to the source and modify it or I can
inspect the same element here from the
CSS styles and modify it as well which
will then propagate the changes into the
sources one still store I can go okay
fine so you have just seen java code
running in a browser but well the
original Chuck Norris promise was to run
in any browser and this is not it
because this is a specialized browser
it's very useful for debugging but at
the end when you are done with your
application you want to deploy it
everywhere and to do so here is a little
combo box which you can choose and
switch to profile may even comes with
profiles which are basically a ways how
you can customize the bill so back to be
also profile they're just will not
change the code but it will change the
libraries with which are packaged with
the application so i will do clean bill
doing green is probably better because I
change the set of libraries now it's
finished well I I can also run the
application and now we are relying on
the chuck norris effect because now her
own browser should start and here is it
or your default desktop browser but ya
know back to browser is optimized for
for it's optimized for for we ate VI
exactly because I'm general I know how
interprets the bytecode so I'm basically
generating just stuffed of a v8 can
understand it and then turn it into
effective native executable code well
it's true it takes a big time to
bootstrap the whole thing because well
we need to download and initialize the
virtual machine but then the behavior is
completely the same so I guess touch
until my demo okay so first Chuck Norris
demo and when you develop with these
pages what you get is basically you get
an HTML page so in this project there
will be an HTML page and there will be a
Java class and this Java class has an
annotation this page annotation where
that points to the index HTML page and
he finds a class name so in the
background an annotation processor will
take care of creating a class for you an
index class that you can then use in the
code and that is really very well
supported in netbeans so in the index
HTML page then you can have for example
buttons that have an ID you can have
like a canvas something like that and
you can work with these with these
elements so in the background the
annotation processor will have a look at
the Java file and at the HTML page and
it will create a class for you and it
will create
it the elements the named elements that
are inside of your HTML page for us Java
classes so you can work with them in a
type safe manner so you can for example
there is a canvas API that I've created
for for this project and you can for
example create a point a paint on this
on this canvas you just like get the
graphics context from it and yeah I'm
clearing the rectangle now viewing the
screen in order to draw something and
the interesting thing here is the
annotation up there you have this
annotation at on which registers
basically this method for an event and
it will pass in the page so you can
really work with the model you can
really work with the model of the page
and you can do something in response in
this case i'm using the the canvas from
i'm getting the canvas from the model
and paint something on it and now we
will have a demo sorry where you can see
how this on events are working ok to
illustrate or your examples i have a
sample application that is supposed to
do a calculator here is a table and it
table complete some buttons just to show
you the page how it looks like this is
the static view of the HTML page now
inside of the application I don't not
only have the XHTML page but also here
the calc implementation and it uses the
page annotation Tony described so the
page annotation basically instructs the
annotation processor to go parse the
HTML file and based on the content
inside of the file generate a calculator
class same name as the
the name of the page and here we have
the calculator class in use and I can
use code completion and I can see all
the elements inside of the page that has
been annotated with ID annotation the
idea is the name of the field and
because we are in Java we also know the
type of the field so if the if the
element in the in the page is input we
will we would have a type input with
appropriate methods on the element and
if it's a button well we have people
have a button I can try it button and it
has methods so disabled for example
which is something else than input would
have then don't it also talk about the
event annotation so again we have
annotations and we get some code
completion you can see the list of
actions we can react to but not only
that in case we try code completion on
the ID element we also see the list of
ID elements inside of the HTML HTML page
I guess you have seen this kind of
support from any ID but I promise there
is nothing special in netbeans to do
this this is plain java because Java
since Java 6 has support for annotation
processors and I often call annotation
processors as a cheapest way how to plug
into any IDE because annotation
processors not only can generate some
classes but also can provide code
completion which is exactly what I'm
doing here so in case when your program
with IntelliJ very clips depending on
their support for annotation processor
it will have the same code completion it
should be that of course so right now
I'm running the application and waiting
for the browser to start and start to
load the page again well five seconds
delay i would expect right now
says but it's strange that the buttons
don't show up yet because it was waiting
for a for the host I have some problems
with DNS so it's longer than expected
resilient it is fast maybe usually and i
can i can click I thought I can click is
that just a matter of time like two
Bruce's not define spoiled demo oh I'm
sorry but basically it used to work so
you have to trust us don't we look
trustworthy okay one other thing that is
really nice is that you can very easily
create AP ice and bind due to static at
a bind to two native methods in
JavaScript and in html5 and one very
popular library is a knockout
knockout.js and the order has
implemented very nice support for not
knock out GS and the way you have like a
couple of annotations in your
application can you have a couple of
annotations that map basically your
properties to computed properties in and
that you can bind to elements in the
HTML page like you can for example you
in your index.html you have these
properties in your elements like data
bind and here you can bind the text to a
hello message which is a property that
is defined inside of your java class and
you are de is going to demonstrate that
okay you need to switch the projector oh
that's a good idea before I demonstrate
knockout.js so here's the failed them
all once again and actually it's public
so if you have internet connection you
can go to Delphi dots easy by the way is
elf I was the original name of NetBeans
because it was
netbeans status as students project
called self I so self i don't see that
is the original domain and then / back
to browser and you will basically get
the calculator that i promised and it
really should run on any device okay and
now back to knockout.js so we have the
generated project and it contains well
as every project it contains the HTML
page which is regular HTML but with
special data binding stuff and now
question who knows knockout.js 11
personal 33 okay guys I love you you are
java developer because knockout.js is
one of the free most popular JavaScript
libraries and it's really good I hate
the JavaScript but well knockout.js is
good and it allows you to write a
business model of your application and
then and it does not need to care about
the HTML Dom at all it's the way around
HTML cares about the model and can pull
think from the model and modify itself
22 according to changes in the model so
and it's done using the data binding
attribute so again we are piggybacking
on the fact that netbeans has a really
good support for HTML and JavaScript so
we take the HTML part and we have good
support for knockout.js as well so these
bindings are rich very rich and that's
what knockout.js shines at however
before we implemented this code
completion I was hanging on knockout.js
website all the time and studying what
is the what is the syntax for these
bindings I don't have to anymore I can
use code completion it works well and
actually this one is in
that in the ID it's not it's not a
notation processor so it basically says
we have input field and its content its
value should be bind to a property
message on our model and then we have
another property called on which guards
the state of buttons and here is another
property called words and that property
basically is an array of strings and so
we can do for each loop and repeat this
line this lie on this line as many times
as there are elements in the words
property in the array now I should
probably switch to the source code how
do we initialize the stuff no that's not
it this is it so basically this is this
is the initialization I will call up
everything else ok so this is this is a
method that gets called as soon as the
page is ready we instantiate our model
class set some property on it and then
call apply bindings apply bindings is a
knockout way of saying okay now go chic
do dom dom tree and do the bindings
connect the elements in the Dom tree
with my model okay and now let's see the
model well that's horrible you would not
like to write this code and luckily you
don't have to because this is all
generated the real model is here so it's
about 40 40 lines with comments and
imports so probably 20 without them and
the model annotation basically is
processed by annotation purchasers that
generate the ugly class I just showed
you before and it and the property
annotation instructs the processor to
say ok we want data class with
the message and getters and setters for
it of type string property owned and
here the computed property stuff
basically says okay there should be also
a getter for a property that is based on
a value of property message and then
splits it into six words and here is
also the methods that you can then call
back from from the model so just to show
how it that it really works that the
annotation processors really work and
help you be productive is I can invoke
code completion and this is called
completion on the class which that sure
doesn't exist it's that just being
generated during the compilation and you
can see it has the getters and setters
and apply binding so I thought I guess
that's enough okay so as you already saw
back to browser already also supports
debugging your application so you can
debug your application by using this web
view component together with hot spot
and you can jump a bitch between Java
code and JavaScript code and you can put
your you can set your you can set your
breakpoints and and they will and you
can actually really debug very nicely
your application and later on deploy it
and in the browser as you already saw so
we will skip that demo I guess I'm sorry
yeah I did it before okay now I know
what went wrong with the slides I
actually accidentally duplicated the
slides vector browser wants to emulate
the core libraries one by one and if
sometimes it's it's it's it's hard and
and and if you have native bindings
maybe it's not that easy and something
might go wrong but this is enforced
through inconsistency tests so if
something really goes wrong it can we
will catch that problem and you can very
easily write inconsistency tests and
these inconsistency tests actually run
the code inside of hot spot and the same
code in the FX pro in the back to
browser java virtual machine
and it will compare the results that's
something new that you are created for
that and if you want so right now you
saw knockout.js so there is already
support for knockout.js but that's just
one thing so the basic idea behind back
to browser is if I understand it
correctly to enable you to very easily
create your own programming model it
doesn't want to enforce a programming
model on you but it allows you to work
with libraries that you like for example
create bindings for them and do
something to end one of the things yeah
I wanted to say that originally I wanted
to stay away of writing libraries I just
wanted to show a way how to do it but
well add annotation processors and the
knockout.js just got me in and I could
not resist but really the purpose is to
allow anyone who lost some JavaScript
framework to create Java bindings for it
and that's very easy and there was also
when I was in lids with Giada we set
together with a couple of beers and he
showed me what to do with back to him
how cool back to browsers and stuff and
I was talking about my projects I have a
little game engine that I created that
can run games in javafx on the raspberry
PI's or even on small devices it runs
quite nicely a couple of simple demo
games for that and yard I said and why
don't you port it why don't you port it
so it also runs in back to browser and I
said well this is javafx and and then I
said well javafx canvas is actually
quite similar to the html5 canvas API so
if we create like an abstraction and
have two different implementations 14
back to browser that binds to html5
canvas and 14 javafx canvas node then I
could run the same games in javafx and
in the browser so I said ok that's a
good idea let's do that and this is how
i created
we basically yarda showed me how to do
it and how to how to use his his support
for binding your old libraries and this
is basically how it works so I create a
class canvas that extends element the
base class that is already available and
in my class I when I want to implement
certain methods what I do is I use this
ed JavaScript body annotation and in
this app shell script body annotation I
can buy I can do native bindings to
JavaScript code so as you can see it's
extremely simple to bind a java method
to a javascript method and this is an
example from the base class from the
converse and the most important thing
that you do with the canvas in html5 is
get a graphics context from it because
you can do anything with the canvas so
if you create graphics context which is
the natural next step then what you do a
lot of times or what you need to do a
lot of times is pass in a JavaScript
object the original javascript object so
you can cash it and wrap it in there and
then if you want to call a method on
this graphics context you can use it
like you can see here in this chava
script body you have the arguments that
match the arguments of your method
signature here the set fill style and
you have the body and the body is what
is really executed so I can call this
and it will refer to my to my to my
object here and sometimes you need to
work with these enclosed objects so with
the objects that are wrapped in your in
your in your Java object to pass it to
other methods because because the API
requires that it requires an object
JavaScript object in order to do
something so what we usually do is like
create this Gator
this object Gator that you can see here
for example in this linear gradient I'm
holding a JavaScript gradient and I can
simply access it where this object
method so it took me like like one
afternoon to create an API that allows
you to really render to html5 canvas
with all the methods so it's really
really very simple it's mainly a stupid
copying of some methods from some from
some reference pages that you find on
the web and then you can use it it's
very easy so like here for example we
have a click event and on this click
event I get my canvas from the page
that's automatically created for me and
I get the graphics context and I can
just like simply render to it that's
very easy and you can you can see if you
know Java fix and if you know Charlie
fix canvas this is really really very
similar to the code that you see in Java
fix there a couple of things like a font
east if defined a little bit different
but other than that it's very very
similar um yeah and actually I run a
little conference in Munich that was on
july first and it was a great success a
lot of people who are in this room were
also at this conference and on this page
if you go there you can actually see an
online demo and I hope this is running
now you can try it
yeah it was sold out I'm very proud okay
here it is so this is a game that is
written in Java running in my in my
browser and it's just uh just standard
Java and I don't have oh thank you I was
just like I was wondering watch what's
happening here if you want to really win
you have to stay at one point just fire
so if you want to try that and if you
have your laptop up here and again you
have a nice internet connection at the
moment it seems to be quite good you can
play it and you can try it so this is
this isn't just a canvas API this is
just using the canvas API and the game
is actually very very simple so but this
is this is not yet using the epics game
engine my ethics game engine is an
engine that is written originally in
javafx and it now also supports back to
browser so you can just decide if you
want to run your your game just in Java
fix mode which is a little bit more
performant so if you have if you have
games that require a stronger machine
then you might go for the java
acceleration but it's also possible to
run these games on on in back to browser
on smaller devices that's no problem at
all and i'll show a little demo do we
have time so here is back to browser
it's a modular game engine really very
simple it's it's basically for Rachel
style games it has some bait and basic
module that is called game engine one
module that is called physics engine
which is box2d I mentioned that I
included this and I've got a tile engine
and the tile engine is really nice for
creating these RPG games and stuff like
that maybe I can show one
so something like this so because you
have there are a lot of editors it
supports a certain formats the TMX
format for for tight sets and so you can
create these little games with support
of this kind of editor are also get a
tower defense game and one game I would
like to show you is space invaders and
this game is doesn't have a very very
cool map here but what I'm using it not
for the map I'm using it for this I'm
using it for creating tile sets and I'm
using these tight sets there are those
are white so you can see in see them on
white background but I'm using those
tilesets to create animations tileset
animations and that is the the most
recent advance in the port of my game
engine to back to browser I also support
like loading resources now so you can
create all this games that i created
with back to browser with ethics game
engine now in in vector browser and i
would just like to show you two examples
or one example that we should see
what I've got here ok so I think we yeah
we're running pong now ok so here I just
have my game on event I'm just
dispatching the event to the to the game
engine and just instantiating pong
somewhere here let me see it should
somewhere be oh no no no that's the
wrong project sorry for that
that's the timer environment that fires
the poles for the game so here I create
a new poem in my class that is that is
bound to a page to the index HTML page
and I can now run pong
hopefully i can run Punk that's okay
it's a very complex game so it takes a
while to load all the AI and and the
textures and bump maps well the initial
startup time is something I have to work
on so but you see it works and actually
this is this full is total overkill here
because what I'm using here is a physics
engine i'm using j box2d in here too to
write pong and I can actually no problem
and I can I can prove that it's actually
a physics engine behind that by opening
this game here so here we create the
physics engine which is totally
pluggable and we add some gravity minus
4 it will fly no it's okay
yesterday the gravity was for now it's
minus 4 I think it's my just maybe
you're right but she will slide out so
you defying gravity into a box dy 0
vectors and I've got a couple of
convenience methods that help you create
bodies for the sprites so it's pretty
easy to win against the if you add
gravity to this you can also read
rotation to the objects right now I make
them behave like they're very stiff them
they can't rotate but you can add that
as well and I can also run I think space
invaders which is my original demo where
am I here and this is the latest that
once i'm very happy that is this is
working now because this is the first
demo that uses the tile engine so you
see I I defy i use tired to create those
tile sets and in in theory also the the
other game will run the RPG game that I
shown you with a little guy walking
around but there I still have a problem
I have to copy all the resources in a
certain directory and I didn't manage to
get it ready in time so I hope space
invaders will be good enough
ok so it's compiling building a zip it's
good
okay so you can guess where the the main
character is he's hiding somewhere down
here seems the screen is a little bit
too small so but you can see the game is
running and it's running smoothly
animations are nice you have these tight
set animations in here so uh yeah oh the
question is whether you can make
callbacks from the browser somewhere
else so probably Tony switch to my
computer yeah let's I shit let's show it
I have well the initial version or the
initial product project that I created
for testing whether i can make easy
connectivity with server-side using json
stuff is basically twitter twitter
project and how adults that's because i
was playing with it and the morning i
guess so let's river let's leave my
modifications okay so today how I
designed an API and guess it's
annotation base API for talking to
server so the only thing that you need
to do is to say it on receive and
specify a URL and in that's in this case
you can also say okay this is Jason
Pickel on and Jason P is special Jason
version that wraps things up and you can
do cross site checks current site
queries so this annotation basically on
a page model that's the model class
generates a method credit query weeds
and this method then connects to the
server a synchronously as soon as it
obtains a result it callbacks your
method here and you can do whatever you
want any form of processing so now let's
try to run it
and that's the ethics version okay so
now you can choose different different
people and here is loading and the
reason for I was just saying did you fix
that in the no loading this okay it's
it's still broken but it's not my fault
because because I wrote this I wrote
this I wrote this application three
months ago and two months ago Twitter
discontinued the old protocol so they
don't know anything about API design
today well this is this is what you get
when you are using services in a cloud
sometimes it's just go fa yeah so but
otherwise I compared this this
implementation to java implementation
together with a with original javascript
implementation because knockout.js has
its own original implementation and work
that order the part that deals with you
I model was similar of the similar size
but then there was hidden file in the
JavaScript implementation of about three
hundred lines doing the communication
with the video traitor server and here
you basically we have all the
communication on 57 lines so yes you can
connect to server and since version of
back to browser 0.8 you can also you can
not only use JSON but you can also use
web sockets which is more effective for
most cases so I just saw you've got an
ipad which is perfect because i didn't
bring one and my next slide is this okay
so so now on the ipad so you can either
do you want to show one of your demos if
you guys have an ipad with you you can
go to this URL and you can just try to
load the game I tried the problem with
with the ipad is that the key events do
not come
come to so you cannot play it with the
keyboard that I created a special
version for the ipad of the of the space
invaders game so you can try to if you
can load that or on any Android device
so we can prove that it also runs on
your iPad and on your Android device and
one more thing to add is you notice that
netbeans currently support the
development of phone applications where
you can really take your JavaScript
application package it and deploy it on
a phone well and then you get icon like
this and your application may start and
make those who are closer here may
realize the keynote application running
on ipad as native up so I guess Chuck
Norris won't again I guess we're done
Norris did it and we actually would like
to have more people try it out play with
it report bugs and well maybe help
create your own ap ice for it and grow
the project and that's true for the back
to browser project as well as for the FX
game engine just in case you're
interested in gaming you can also go to
this page and have a look if you find
something of interesting so questions
urs are important very good thank you
questions there's a question
so very good question when we compile
Java code in the browser not right now
but I know it's possible because I
probably should mention that I'm not the
only one developing virtual machine like
this doppio for example is another
project which does the same and they can
compile they can run java sea I want to
do it as well but right now it stops at
the local class it's surprisingly really
high class with a lot of methods and I
will need to implement them so it's a
bit a bit of different approach that
they do in top you because they want to
really have one by one java so you can
basically write swing applications in
javascript but here we want we don't
want to do that but we want you to
create your leverage the javascript and
HTML that is around and just like
provide a very nice Java interface to it
okay more questions there's a question
so oh good good comment the comment is
that a JavaScript has webbed workers and
that's exactly how I like to do
parallelism so I rather than trying to
simulate frets let's create a new API
where you can spin off new web worker
make it run it runs in separate memory
space basically some let it run and then
do message passing but not only that I'd
like to also provide a hotspot
implementation of the same API so
basically we can all around against web
workers on our desktops browsers and
embedded devices
well your comment is about code
compatibility if we create new API I
have well my goal is not to run existing
libraries well this is the same
situation as with compact profiles the
smaller profile you get you need to do
some modifications and make sure that
the application around because the
problem is if we really try to support
the whole Java this whole thing will be
completely bloated and well if you are
seeking for that try to appeal they that
zygo not mine okay no questions there's
a question back there do you need
something on the server side to run back
to browser know this is completely
client technologies so you so we
generate static static web pages you can
upload them on a via FTP on any server
and it will work so you can see that in
on the on the page with the little game
and the in the banner that is also just
static content
so this how is the performer is the
performance well you probably don't want
to run a complex matrix computation on a
browser but otherwise for the UI stuff
it's quite a quite good so from the the
only problem there is the bootstrap
before before the machine starts I will
try to do something with that and but
otherwise when it runs its performant
enough you could see that on the games
they move so I think we have no more
time for questions but you can come up
afterwards and maybe we can also do I
don't know did you do a crowd garden
because there's this concept of Rhoda
Arden here and it would be cool if some
of you would come and we can show you is
we can show you stuff or yard I can show
you stuff that you can do with back to
browser so good garden is in observation
area and okay let's move there right now
yeah we can move there right now if you
want I'll be waiting for you ok stir fry
so thank you for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
