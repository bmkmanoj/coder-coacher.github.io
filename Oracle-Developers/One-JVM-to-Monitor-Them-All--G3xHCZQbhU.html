inspired what we what we do just very
briefly is we try to control application
software a lot of problems out there say
a petition performance management really
all they're doing is pretty much
monitoring the humans do the management
because they have to react later someone
has to see a problem and then alter it
change the code or change them setting
what we try to do is to do that within
the application is to make the software
self-managed and that basically what the
company does is a self managing kind of
run time that augments what the JVM does
now but I'm not going to talk about that
today I'm going to talk about have well
some of my well I will discuss today and
I wrote it leveled it demonstrated this
morning I got to talk about the future
because it'll we're changing the
platform the platform is going to be the
future and the future is easier to
change especially we have a past a
history we can predict what's going to
come next and we also have an ability to
influence what's coming next of course
if you have a big marketing budget you
can we can make big waves and you can
change what it's actually quite hard to
change the present it's it's quite hard
to change what's happening now when you
own your learning about it and you're
meant to react in real time to that so I
got to talk about okay so that's that's
it's not harder I mean we know anything
about the presence easier to change
because you're in the moment you're
changing but to change something else
while its present to change something in
real time to change the behavior of
software that executes is quite fast
compared to how we can click on a button
and try to kill the JVM which is
typically the only control that most
people do today how do you control a
system that has two tells and jvms
running how do we take control of that
so that's actually quite hard to do that
in the present
quite easy to do that in the future
because you just simply doesn't apply
two thousand avms that would be one way
of doing it and another person is the
the past aspect how can we change the
past so a lot of what I'm going to do is
is is ask you to rethink the way we
execute our code today and to take about
space and time as well I want to
demonstrate as hell we can try to alter
the way we our execution is and alter
the dimensions on what space and time e
no space to you could probably mean
where is the code executing is like in a
distributed environment so it might be
which JVM is it executing typically
today you know when we want something to
happen within some method is executed
and we want to acquire integration to
something else call it we make that code
happen within the tread context but what
if we what if we didn't do that what if
we want that to happen but we didn't
want it to happen in that application
could we do that could we have to have
that happen somewhere else in a
simulation and then the other thing is
of course what happens if the pass has
gone by we want to relive the past and
maybe relive what we didn't do in the
past do you perform that action which is
changing time so we say that you know so
the view of the I mean so so it holds
concept of space and time compactive why
and off nothing like forward to be fine
wipe the big by why do they happen this
is always the big question now there is
a theory and it relates to hell we
perceive reality which is perception we
perceive reality and this is why our
dreams feel so real because of mind
creates the reality it gives us that
experience ever we're in that reality at
a time now then the view is that
computation is reality and of course of
computation is reality that they may be
this itself is a reality the mind
creates the reality true computation
maybe this whole environment is a
simulation of such a computer system now
another sense of it crazy but the view
is that we're probably in about a
thousand years we will have the ability
to create simulation systems that can
simulate a universe in create now if
that's the case could we already have
happened there how do we have already
gone there is this the simulation that's
correct that someone has already passed
several thousand years how could we
justice I helping we know that this is
not that period where the initial
simulation is create so in fact I'm is
already gone by and someone's already
created the universe and they created it
like this they simply write a simulation
okay so what is the simulation then what
does to talk to simulation one
simulation is where you create something
and these rules in the simulation world
which create other simulations you know
derive new events present a simulation
is driven by events so if one event
triggers other events because the rules
are some kind of code that's actually
good in some kind of context then that
can create a whole recreate new events
so they propagate but there's another
type of simulation which is mimicking
something else is happening an
assimilation can be it's a recording of
something else and it's playing the back
so we could have a case where we can
replay life or replay the experience by
simply
simulation and of course this is what we
always have virtual reality as long as
our senses our brains can see these
signals because it's fascinating that we
you know light comes out of and color
comes at us from wavelengths but we
don't see her eyes computer and turn it
into color how we perceive it but it's
not that's not the way it is in the
universe and it's not the physics so
that's what we want to do so if we can
if we can make something appear real
then it's probably Israel at least a
real to the observer and that's what I
want to do is create an environment for
that now I'm not going to talk about I
grow some Java code to dissimilation
what I want to do is create a matrix for
the JVS because the problem is the J
games are done every time they start up
they have to relearn everything they
know they feel spirit they don't
self-awareness they've no past memories
now what happened how can I observe a
whole world that's a large number of
JVMs I can't go to each one but if each
one projected itself its image to
another world to another universe and I
could make that universe be observable
to myself like if you if you if you
consider like the stars are shining on
us when I look up for this guy we see
stars but we know they don't probably
exist anymore but we've see the
projection of them and we can understand
the world by looking back even though
that's a different time so if that's the
case what if JVMs projected themselves
to another DVM and what have all the
jamie has predicted themselves to wound
area and that jvn
pain the application that we want to see
what if our applications didn't
concerned themselves where where they
execute really act but we could observe
the world via distant JVM which is the
matrix I what if those applications when
they disappeared because someone Hilton
in operation so they didn't like your
response on that matrix still existed
and had some state that had a where they
still of itself no it's not going to say
I'm going to kill the humans not like
ask ina it only understands it's it's a
matrix for JDM to communicate I should
probably put a social aspect that I with
you we could tweet the each other foot
that's the view so so what we can do is
is create this real-time simulation
where threads I going to demonstrate so
I have a few ones here so I think it's
better to demo first of all and then
we'll go a bit more of the concepts does
anybody know about acha you I've okay
yeah okay so I have it I have a few JVMs
here I'm going wrong is then I can come
out of pocket example I have a processor
how the time and I'm putting in some
information in that every time the trade
is created it creates a growth think of
the role as a threat and every time it
pops something often on the stack it
goes up and down and this is our main
trick slow yeah I'll give a demo just at
that so I'll just start this will knock
first just to give you the view of what
it would look like okay so that's that's
the matrix out of the air with this data
so we have the columns here is actually
four or five trans deer and the f
name four methods I didn't want the
stock frame to have so i'm at the stack
frames on a canoe particular symbols
they could have been any type of C but
I've just put effort in and in there I
have some code i'll show you that but
I've what I've done is instrumented a
JVM I haven't changed i can we put an
agent in that just says I I will notify
this plugin that this is happening and
and the plug-in just basically printed
and you see that a little bit i can make
the front of the bigger okay so and i
could do that for multiple JVMs but
before i'm going to do that i'm going to
start up a JVM that is it since what we
call a matrix and this has the same
plugin that's the inside of the real
application so I've taken a plug-in that
works in real and real job vm inside the
academic application and have installed
it in a matrix and the matrix is the
application itself because everything
every time the application does
something it's replayed in the matrix in
real time so I've got to start this one
up of course nothing's there because
there's no client drop and connected so
if i connect up the service you see he's
printing and if i go over here he's
changing i'll bring this out to another
window shortly okay i bring up another
processor part which is another JVM and
then if you look at the seams I don't
know if you could see it I can make the
front again beer wait other way
you can see that there's kind of a
border that's actually two jvms and each
of those columns is a thread and the
frames their live frames and the
flashing means the code is being
executed at this moment and now I'm
going to run a client who's going to
communicate with the service and the and
the processor and of course a lot of
activities going to happen but each of
these windows has their own thread view
but the matrix view has all the treads
lie that's the stack that's all the
treads running and that's because and
that plug-in doesn't know it's in the
matrix it doesn't know it's in
assimilation it believes the application
is made up of all of these threats so
what we've done is is recreated every
time does a new tread created in the
euro JVMs they saw the JVM creates them
and mimics them and then this little
tool is plugged in is simply just just
observing the treads there's a
lightweight trade in this one it's real
the thread I can do a spectrum but
you'll see it like that's right it looks
like the other track but there's no
difference the only difference is of
course I can see more of my environment
does everybody see that if I kill one of
DJ DJ bm's like this one you'll see that
this will still getting some feeder
because the other things still shutting
down and it's now saying there's only
two of them and everything's gone quiet
so if I go there there I kill this one
this is still down and then
that's been gone for supper bring it
back on he'll come probably back in harm
i refresh here like they're so the
matrix itself lives beyond the
application life cycle which is very
important because we can now observe
something and when it crashes there's an
essence of it's still there and what
happens then when the reason Ischl eyes
for change to the application could ask
what was I doing when I crashed the last
time oh oh oh yeah that wasn't good I'm
not going to do that again it can have
it we can store our signals in there
which can change the way for example
what was the right read full size well
the last time I ran but what about if I
asked the sims what's my ideal triple
size instead of you writing that number
when you're in an editor you have never
seen your code wrong the simulation can
and it can give you a hint so we never
have to put the code in there we just
say import simulation tread pool size
something like that okay okay so now of
course if you're ever demo something
that's very new idea you always have to
do hello world isn't every programming
language has a hello world so I thought
this morning oh I should have a hello
world because this is really a game
change well I mean I believe it so what
I've done is I've created the hello
world example it's a bit more than a
hello world of course but i wanted to
dilute and one of those is it's going to
do prior nanoseconds listen to do sleep
pretty sleep bring a loop around now you
notice it doesn't say hello world
because it developer forgot to do de me
so I guess I'll just run it up this is
the hello world and this is just a real
version so you can see the real version
because the princess here now I can run
it up just to show you what's happening
with tracing which is kind of like the
showing the instrumentation a bit like
what we did and so what i did is i just
created an interceptor and i want to
show you that this piece of code will
get fired in the simulation and mopey
any changes to it so this simulation
just says I want to intercept frames
beginning and ending and I just print
something that's a powerful question
yeah there's nothing you don't have to
put it in your code that the agent will
instrument and then we'll call you in to
your interceptor I just tell it in the
config of the trace I just tell it to
install the interceptor and there so I'm
going to run out this is the real how
old again because we can see that says
this is real and you can see that and
this is probably something I didn't
think about in these console output at
least it's popping and pushing yeah okay
so that's okay but what if I did it in
the simulation what if I just run the
hello world so I run the hello world
this seems I'll first of all start up my
sims service I've got my sim service and
in my sim service what I've done is I've
done something because you know I said
you know what happened there we never
said hello world we just said this is
real but i forgot to write hello world
okay so i can't change that application
but i could change the matrix that's
running in simulation so what if I now
run up I lee i have this running my
simulation but I've been told it I'll
run up the hello world the sims it's not
going to print anything there's nothing
in there it's going to just communicate
with the same so here's the hello world
it's not printing anything it's doing
the frames but let's look at the same
service it says hello simulated world so
every time something happens in the real
world I've now put are corrected the
present by not being there I've
corrected it in another universe in
parallel someone now you might say ha
why would I want to do hello world in
another universe or another another
terminal because it could be an
integration to something you forgot to
integrate it into it you forgot some
events that you were meant to do your
metal logs you know someone wants a lot
you don't want to do that production you
can do it in the simulation now you have
a new tool set where do I put my coat
what if and what if the code some
could be located in the real environment
for what if it could be just totally put
in the sims but I never had to change
the code on both those cuts so this if i
look at the Interceptor here if I look I
whacked ed I wrote this little sims in
class here and all i did is every time
it was an event I just says is this
hello world's being called I just said
give me a name if this name of this
probe that's been created this hello
world then every time he goes beginning
then I'm gonna say hello simulate world
now I could have put that in the I could
have changed the other conflict in the
trace and put that in there and then I
would have put it in the real world
hello simulator even though it's not
real it was the real I didn't have to
say that okay so that's great I can
change no the present but I change it
with space yeah have a lawsuit okay but
what if i can change time what if i
could say well you know yesterday we
didn't say hello world that wasn't good
it would have been great for you could
go back and replay all of that so and i
did this by the way this morning so it's
not really that hard to do and so let's
do that so how i can do that is i'm
going to i'm going to because simulation
is a recording mechanism and the
simulations basically streaming over and
the playback is in real time well it is
in real time you can always go to a file
system it could be street anywhere and
of course if you can be streamed
anywhere then it can be replayed at any
time it doesn't have to be replayed at
this time so let let me run up and the
recorder so and all it is is the hello
world by the way all at this setting is
just simply it's the same piece of code
is sims hello nothing's changing hello
and I'm running the recorder what I'm
doing is I'm telling you to record the
behavior of the JVM this is not a flight
recorder this is a real recorder this is
something that plays back it's not
soundly
re creating reality it's a flight
simulation it's not simply here I
collected metrics and I'm renaming as a
recorder system it really is a playback
mechanism so this has been running you
haven't been seen the printing hello
world is it ok so it's recorded
something and I don't know how many
times what you guess how many printers
without have been so we can now go so if
i look at how I sleep for about three
seconds I probably did about five hallo
worlds and then I shut it down and I can
go back to the recorder and I can play
back the recording here's the playback
here's the recorder and it just says
playbacks the streamed system and I can
run that and what's happening this is
running the same piece of cold and it's
saying hello simulated world now what
I've done it this by the way is I've
actually done something unique because
remember I told you about time while I
can also check change a dimension of the
universe i can change the speed so this
is actually played back there but in my
playback setting I told it to sink where
time itself but let's not do that let's
live the world again but fast forward it
let's go through it fast there's hello
simulated world it's all over the
universe is being created and dropped it
so we can change that part too
so so what's happening is we're
simulating we're doing a metering fee to
the other gym yeah it's a real JDM
there's nothing new and in replays now
it's not going to replay a database
transactions because it doesn't change
the world what it does is it replays
behavior so I'll take about it like a
dancer let's say I go to a dance class
and I'm my i'm looking at a teacher what
am I going to do I'm going to do these
rooms I got a mini kiss movements and
tried to copy them now imagine someone
looks inside at the dance class and sees
me but doesn't see the instructor and
sees me doing you the body called body
and copying some guy who was a dancer I
had the dancer he doesn't even know I'm
getting instruction from something else
so the realities of the observer is you
are the dancer you are real but I love
doing is mimicking something so we can
create a JDM of mimics all Virginians it
can mimic long or can mimic older and it
could mimic and memory of another JVM so
we can actually really operations if so
in operations the first day when you
join operations what you lack is the
abilities to see health problems unfold
in production what if you could go in
and say could I live through that moment
again when everything just crashed but
live it the 15 minutes or 30 minutes
before it and I could watch our
monitoring dashboard what did the
console that I look at didn't know it
wasn't a what didn't know what it was
observing is a simulation of a past
memory and what a bit with all of those
events whence it in time I could relive
every single crash in an environment of
a company and I've had that knowledge
and probably they won't because what we
do is like a video recording is like
experience that sits in our greatest
we've seen it it's beat the charge
here's our charges have been crashed see
the problem is we don't get that
emotional attachment with it when we
experience it happening real and we feel
it's we were fooling ourselves that this
is real we then learn from that because
we also see the dynamics at their
environment
we're chastity I just show you this is
the way it went but you can see what's
happening in between at the movements so
what we're doing is saying that's not
too big data anymore let's do big
behavior that's if we stop storing there
but instead we played it so my view is
that the world should be just replaying
everything data should be moving and
that data should move to environments we
should replicate behavior so today we
replicate storage but what if we
replicated behavior instead and what is
that behavior executed and we listen in
and we extended we augmented that
behavior in our reality
so if you think about it it's a bit like
you have off of offices we want what we
want to do what we're trying to do is is
to compress space into a flat plane for
so monitor jobs air so when people say
house companies such operating like
Apple they don't say how is this office
up operating which office but that's
what we do with JPM we say where is this
JVM rain and really what we wanted and
which one is the applications do it I
don't care really is and the great thing
about that is you can give develop for
access to a JVM but it's not in
production you can't do a heap though
because the heap is not there so we also
have security we don't have a date we
don't have the passwords but he can
observe the system finally he gets to
see what his code does in production but
he can't perjure production itself and
in fact we can replicate that and we can
filter out all the way to and have it
that replication of behavior integrate
for different system so developers and
each simulation can take a chunk of an
application maybe your component
developer and you only want to see your
component you don't see big management /
board in operation you want to see the
behavior of your code well the
simulation can filter that we can have
multiple universes and each of those
universes is your environment so we just
want one JVM that's all we need run
everywhere observe in one location
something like us and that's what we've
done that's the big idea and we can have
parallel universes parallel worlds
wherever you can have seen the sims and
each
transforming it you can also collect
data so for us like hey we can the book
about the idea is that we wanted to add
collection into a JVM but we didn't want
to incur an overhead all right I was
like whoa we need to dictate it at the
source but what if we change that sort
of good simulation we can have the
overhead in the simulator you can add
clear we can change the more dynamically
that we kinda in production what happens
when you want to change the production
you have to wait is it changing of
Christ or something like that but what
happens if you have your simulation I
can restart with a different
configuration a different rule I wonder
if you had an alert mechanism so today
when people say something went wrong the
production we should have had an alert
enough and you say okay i'll put that
Alaric Cody and I will check for this I
mean this happened it will do it now the
question is would you'd apply that code
how do you know it works because you
won't know until it goes live again and
then the problem comes up and let's say
you're that they didn't work but what if
you could replay that and then see your
code did alert on that behavior so it's
a new way of testing and we could just
aggregate as I said you can have
multiple Sims and they feed into a
single since we can have it go like
apartment it's like organization
reporting go for one building or to one
region to that and each can be a silly
name with world of all of these JVMs all
services and then they finally go to HQ
or the mother ship or the Oracle so
so discrete event simulation is trying
to do is that every time you execute
this piece of code it sends it all we're
very careful how we do if we have an
intelligent filthy City ages to only
send over what support so coming back to
the dancer when I look at so examining
and it's like with the robot when I was
talking you have anything to
demonstration on top the robot inside
well you see the robot doesn't you can
plug into that robot and you can listen
to our movements emotion movements but
you're not getting our every pint change
yeah you're getting at the major
transition and that's the same with
dancing when I copy someone I feel like
I'm not like monitoring every pixel
change election my dashboard I'm
thinking of the basic team and our agent
can do that and can send it over so it's
not all of your applications but it's
the essence of your application and it
can an assess that based on just simply
the performance of the system because
you can we know humans can only observe
at this resolution so what we have to do
is make the agent send out a resolution
that's suitable for do for your display
until we get faster at that of course
your simulation could be a computational
system and then in that case you could
have another higher resolution and of
course we could do this across any
language we can java can conquer the
world and all of these I mean our
simulation engine can simulate any type
of foods polluting is always there's
always a threat so think of the trade as
a user there's always some kind of
activity think of as methods in future
an inner in our simulation when we
create these stats and friends to call
that the methods are empty we're not
performing to work so because someone
helping you do it hongdu JPM's in a
single day yet I can't even get my own
data at the startup I need this fixed or
heat but we don't have to do that we
don't have your memory we have been
watching your behavior we don't have
your staff we don't have to go down if
you go to underneath that we don't we
have an employee we don't have the java
stuff as such we have a Java stuck with
monitoring tools connect but it's a
different stuff because it's nothing in
there and also comment to CQ consumption
we're not consuming if you because I'm
working for you so if my dancer for my
instructors doing something I'm just
waiting for the next move in the eye of
zared been in meantime why he's sweating
I can go just at the mall or not I pick
it up again so i don't have to consider
that you because you do noted the code
in the method I'm not doing it the
thread in this gym yet is simply saying
is he going to come out with as metrics
I'm I need to go back in again and
that's all he waits it's constantly
waiting of course we don't go into way
doesn't drive at red way because I was
too slow to wake up but those are kind
of it doesn't have to consume the CPU
that way so you can do a hundred jvms in
one day via and you can watch them all
how many of you were ever wanted to do
distribute suck though where you can do
it at this year this is only one and all
the treasure in it and you can see all
their applications in there
and we can also plug in so let's say if
you wanted the load balance you know
let's say you wanted a low fat low
balance across the deal yet but you can
plug into the sins and the sins sees all
the threads as a wood so it can ask the
question about these threats doing what
are the ability what can I predict
ability because I have a model here I
have priority into their work he can ask
the question is the problem is with low
balances why can't we send it over to
you they don't know what's in your queue
they sent some worthy but they do not
confer the tongues has gotten to
processing all the dolls but what would
the scenes work for the scenes world has
already tom has inside of it and it
knows each tomcat and he knows where the
thread is in the execution and you
probably can predict a symmetric profile
what how long is going to take the
finish it so then the load balancer can
be placed in this simulation engine and
I can feed back to the load bars it's a
real time analysis and it's real time
because it's looking ahead because it's
not the behavior that I just fired that
hates you people president compact but I
don't know what Q is there I don't know
where it got in for it might not be
deducted it onto the process of you but
it is seems I would because he will say
I'm here it's a right because the tread
would be doing in if the tray is not
doing it then I can see that I conceived
in there in the queuing we can plug in
in this environment so every time you
look at so what we what I do and I don't
I'd like this to be done in the world
but in my world every time I look at a
feature that we need add an Apollo I try
to think where do I place this execution
cops should I place it in the range
place it in the simulation do I need to
execute it at this time I can even query
recording so i can play back the
recording and safe filter the recording
down to the part that I'm interested in
and I can relive it and the recording
thinks it's a job application it is a
job application the recordings just
replaying well the real application did
and it's not like we playing as in it's
really great creating the application we
don't need the code which is great have
you ever sent code to your customer and
then they say well you know we had a
problem yeah well i mean i can't i can't
reproduce the problem how can you send
your database as well i mean we have we
have companies out there who are saying
we need our Oracle database from our
customers the replay because all the
data is in there and we can't see the
code like all wrong you can't introduce
a problem they kind of is because the
recording can be played back and did a
developer can sit here in the custom you
know the vendor can watch how the code
involves and by the way and that was the
problem with everybody for releasing
every 15 minutes everybody's like I
can't regrow that I can't reproduce that
project as I don't have the last 15
minutes piece of code I don't know what
part is not in you know operation of the
customer comes it comes to my hat well
you don't have to worry about that
because hopefully do is send network the
signatures of
they don't have the courage we create
your environment just to get the code to
reproduce you can look at the behavior
we don't have your we don't have to have
access to the to the bytecode it's
replaying the system but it's not
recreating it doesn't need the class
code what's also great about it is and
this is what I really would like is that
for a BG and there was created today
there's a little meeting me and he is
observing this jb m sorry Tyrese title
Virginia I think we should have a
supervisor divya this is the third like
I'm watching it's like a watchdog but he
can be and what we stand on watch it
because they're probably watching is you
don't know the sound of Harrison you
know you might just watch are you all
for you down radio freedom that's a
typical one phone but what about if the
watcher was the person so like I'm a
manager also drive so what about if I
could imagine myself being here and
doing the movement the dancing what if I
was that then I could say I don't like
reducible to do or don't like what I'm
doing now stop that so because I can
mean it because the jth
Virginia asked the question of itself
but just have to go to that gym you have
anymore said well that's a bit strange
to do that I don't think I don't think I
should do that and he can use that for
supervision and also what happens when
that JVM crashes because he decides with
your estranged movement or something
well the other guy is frozen Disney and
all of the transit there is third in
stasis at that moment when you know this
when they all we stopped getting a treat
so then we'll be going to Diagnostics we
have this JVM it's not the real alien
but it's the GBI that we can ask the
question of how are you doing before you
crash there's no more heat comes anymore
we don't need thumbs this is JP and
there it looks like it that's what we
need so we can have these supervisors
that can monitor so you can put your
supervisory code in a flying issues you
can put your alerting it it can decide
I'm going to kill this JVM so we don't
have to have operations anymore doing
the killing the GBA can kill the DMV
it's very powerful and can restart it
and of course what's wonderful is expert
is the learning to be able to observe
something happening again so let me show
you then oh well let me just go back to
that slide sorry so part of what do
their learning and multiple different
experience
so learning and is a concrete experience
about concrete experience reflective
observation that comes conceptualization
and experimentation know what the
problem with that is you know it's kind
of basically ran into doing it that's
that's as our community like do it and
you learn it but we can't do it because
you know it's like when we come into
operation we would like to experience
that so we can use the assimilation to
do that and i'm going to show you so i'm
going to show Cassandra starting off
hopefully I i close on my terminal
windows just before we came here and I
had it all set up and I had to like
panic them to do this book so I've got
Cassandra here running and got what I'm
going to run it and I'm just going to
check what I'm doing first I'm just
going to check my settings so on ok I
don't have no simulation in this forest
so let me just change that I'm going to
turn on the simulation so we will
instrument Cassandra on startup we're
going to run a simulation here somewhere
do this
so I got to just navigate up here to
Cassandra
hopefully I could just
I think I can just run it like that all
right okay I'm just running a different
this is the axioms but I'm just I'm
running it with a different car
picketing ok so I'm going to start up
Cassandra I'm going to start to the
console so this is a monitoring console
that's connected it looks like I've got
a sales running somewhere get that one
ok hopefully i'm just going to kill this
one to make sure i'm connected is your
right one yeah ok so we run there so
this is the sims so 15 15 is this
simulation jvm and I gotta run Cassandra
here this is Cassandra 20 and they're
going to run it here and hopefully
cassandra is going to connect to Sims
yes and and i'm going to run up my
console if I have somewhere my console
is connected now if I connected so this
is this is a Cassandra and they're
currently doing something this is warm
though yesterday and all so that's the
console connected at the console is
actually connected to a sims that's the
sims 1 here's the real one this is the
real one ok now what I got to do is I'm
going to run up to consoles so we can
see side-by-side so how real the sims is
up to real time and I'm going to have
this one and I got to put this one under
15 16 and I'm now going to do it in a
tres stress test with Cassandra just to
insert some records I don't worry if you
can see but it's just basically
distressed test tool with Cassandra and
that's going to load up I hit load on
the server of Cassandra so you can see
that hitting now it's getting busy I'm
going to refresh that I'm going to go to
the other room and refresh that if I can
refresh these both very quickly I just
need to get to the process method all
right I need
this one okay so one of these is it
seems I want it is is is the real jamia
an iron molecule doesn't know I'm
version since the separate part our
monitoring tool case is connected to
Divya instrument and all of this by the
way this is actually this method here is
it behavior in real time like which
there will go and these what these
numbers here or the treads are running
so all of these treads so this is all
the treads are cassandra is running at
the moment you can see the thread ids
and this is the tread IDs in the real
Cassandra yeah and I can see the
behavior so when this system stops doing
Cody's will stop doing it this is this
particular method if I click on this
method will see this refreshed across
here now if there's any feed there's no
fee coming in for click here no feed if
I go back here now probably the insert
is finished so there's the insert
finished it's sampling but these are
sampling into jvms one of them is real
and one of them stuff but we can't
observe her from the from the console if
i go back to duty insert again you'll
see both JVMs running and the tables are
even updated each of the tables are
changing and behavior so it's possible
because always the question is can you
really do it real time how real that is
the wow that seems real a lot to me it's
quite you know it's not a slider it
looks the exact same behavior and even
though there's something they're calling
over and give me some day their second
I'm still getting it
hagar these charts look the same on the
transitive the transition into work but
do the exact same behavior because i
have less cpu probably because i'm close
always yep okay
as
this weather
yeah but not for every week we adaptive
engine so we figure out where after we
land we do like more hospitals we
basically figure out where the hotspots
in terms of what the simulation need to
do in your system and then just what
needs to be sent over so we don't want
to send out like every single get set
what we'll do is it system will we learn
itself you can set thresholds and all
the typical what level of granularity
that you all but generally it will send
over you know anything
you know 10 microseconds will be sent
over that kind of generation but that's
all that's what you need because you
can't observe a quicker like if we send
it all over it would just be lost unless
you wanted some kind of playback kind of
a debugger but that is a working
production this works on production
despair
watch the roller
oh of course there's always overhead I
mean this number two percent you know
the tickets is always overhead it's how
you put it so our system is intelligent
and a handle it you can specify what
your foot it is I'm really limit the
overhead so angry says two percent it's
like they just hope you have a database
problem that's the general two percent
means you have a database from what we
say is no we give you a quote you tell
that the budget is in the overhead and
we will tune in to that so the
instrumentation the measurement will
have a base enough and we eliminate
dimension so this is a whole adaptive
engine I mean I had a talking up with
orbit of mercury but ok so and of course
let me go back down
ok so now I'm going to do
now
I just changed my config and i'm going
to say instead of seems i want to record
it let's say let's see what Cassandra
does on recording on startup so because
I we talked about we living that wasn't
relive it that was experiencing in a
different monitor but what if I could
relive that again so just let's just
dude just get rid of that let's start
this up and let's shut it down
and I've got this right let's relive
Cassandra starting up if I get to my
monitor quick enough this is Cassandra
starting up
of course it's over because that but if
I did it so let's let's do a little bit
more because you probably don't believe
me I just want to show that is so let's
let's start it up let's we'll do it an
insert we shut it down in the insert and
get started up is it yeah let's do that
what
it done some work okay
and let's play it back the playback is
at GBM yeah so let's play back hopefully
it's created at this time this still
we're still doing something okay let's
play back if I can get into this JV and
monitor quickly he's connected all i see
i want to see all the threads this is
just a mains as future ads running here
this is not this is now Cassandra doing
stuff here's all the treads coming on to
see it's I'm living it that's the insect
behavior for go and do a refresh on the
inserts here's the insert behavior
coming in there's the process method
that there is false fine and you
so I can relive the whole experience and
the tools will not have to change and
that's great well I think so because I
feel see what what you're missing all of
that and it's something I didn't show is
that ok in the real one we didn't
collect some I can collect more data so
i can actually say that i would like to
see some add different information so
let me just change that so i could say
let's enable in the this is the playback
i hope it is let's say I didn't have
stack information so i didn't have that
in the server at the time i would have
liked to see some stacks how long
something's on a stack i would like to
see some quantization like how it is the
distribution but i can play it back I
could do this in the sims or I could
play back in this so let's do playback
playback and I can now get more data
hopefully even it connects you'll see
there's a few more columns down arrows
here and this is this tread stock depth
so if we go here wait till it gets there
these are the treads and their depth
well I just have to get to their live
here wait it gets to the request so
here's the process request and I can now
monitor the tread stack depths and I
didn't have that and the quantization
across it so this is the quantization of
the request across different buckets
that's the information there in those
buckets so i can now experience even
more day in this simulation even in the
pipeline so can actually collect ate it
in the scenes but they do the business
of priorities in the compensation of
that particular request that i clicked
on the road so i can look at any probe
and a person if i didn't get what I
wanted I can go back again to aid again
I can find at which progress should we
look at which method and I can augment
it with data that wasn't collected at
that time so i can de faire all my
operations to another space and time and
that's called application memory
synchronization we want to go back and
relive it like in the assassin's creed
everything else is great we got
synchronizing that's it number eight and
we did it again the course was great
about this is the valkars gates what
they really want which is real Jamie and
behavior real insight live wouldn't it
be great as you're typing code the
editor says I wouldn't change that line
of code because you know what just
happened in last second with that you
could have real-time feed on lines of
code that you're after change because
that's up with the quench every time I
see
our change in quadratic and when comes
is that executes introduction other
knowledge is changing because that's the
risk he's like I'm I just treated and
hopefully it works and that the testers
will get that but what if you were
changing the code you could ask that and
that's what we missed a day operations
won't give us our feet but if we got
that feed we can be a completely
different till sense it's really changes
so this will give us at aunt so that
what we want and then just make sure I
go over to tiny leah with too many steps
isn't it then some questions what we
need then so what we did need to do is
so we could this become with this to the
matrix okay so tune in to the matrix
what we not their lowly than the past
you know like I need to buy a helicopter
all the time well what if the
application could store his memory his
behavior and some signals inside of this
jbm what is that JDM was already there
and every time I started up irie
synchronized with the matrix and I just
can't became upon it just by that the
information I became a better JVM I can
become more resilient because I have
some information and I can have anybody
seen the momentum and mentos Philip
where you you put tattoos on your body
well you put the tattoos in the matrix
on on your avatar in the matrix and then
we is sick and I say oh what's that one
of you i sent my skill set oh that's me
because i dinna training the last time
so it's rigged it will change the way we
can see the system's what we need to do
is just be able to have a grid or some
kind of simulation environment okay
there is one problem and this is this is
a topic for a put it in gear so the
squeeze it in class amazed
is that we lack in information so today
when the thread calls and method and not
met because another method we don't know
the method returns a result let's say
it's a function but what we look at that
that's all we get is a binding practices
here is a body but we never know what it
is so let's say hashmap games hashmap
get what do we do hashcode table scan
the linked list yep what about the
linked list was a medium elements
where's that information helping that
method tell me now when you wear as
humans we solve this problem because
when I when you come over for if you're
above your manager just might not that
would be interesting moment imagine when
I asked you to give me and you know do
some work and you come back to me you're
not just going to fierce the work you're
going to give me signals you're going to
tell me well you know okay I hear the
work but it is no school I have to be
dis and have to do that don't do that
again don't give me that type of work it
was God right so we have these signals
and we don't have soft because that
software doesn't do that today here and
it doesn't even remember what it is the
last time and even like you might say ah
you know I don't want to take that work
just imagine like your own customer care
service what happens is when someone
rings up and you find out who it is and
you're all my contact nutcase and what
you do is you change your behavior
because you have a signal there's
something that says I remember that
person and here's a warning and you
alter your behavior so software doesn't
have that ability now we believe there's
something missing in JVMs and it's
called signals like the way we
experience a life and it's a big subject
but basically I'm trying to back into
the matrix because what we can't do is
so let's say a hashmap every time hash
map kraze we have to give it a number
the capacity sighs what happens if
hashmap they could do that what happens
if hashmap knew who was calling it and I
had some reverie somewhere the
conversational memory and it says it's
this person now okay what is up Harrison
when he looks he has the call flow and
our press it's what we call to the
vendor don't think there is a call sigh
he's not accepting that but it's very
similar to suspect things but what about
if we nested up context and so when the
hash mark is cravings for us to create
itself new variables in this kind of
environment and it predicted what its
numbers should be and that's a problem
we coated a code is not understanding
its who is calling it but if you knew
that and how could it recognized to be
the guy above it what i could do is for
typical example let's say it's a call
style every time you do you match my end
of the call sir that's one way of
identifying the caller I mean you would
do something like that but then of
course you still can't identify a column
because what you need is is you need to
know what you did do to you the last
time so what you can do is have signals
you can raise the signal within the
scope and that signals is propagated up
into a conversation of context and the
next time you swimming talk to you the
signal is pushed back till and you can
look at your signal set and say it's him
I'm not going to go with 16 / raised
because he always has an immediate so I
can resize it so we're missing that the
jvm misses the ability to on to Crate
signals to spur them and push them back
down as
to drive its own execution behavior and
we and so what's a signal it simply it's
very simple and the software just need
have to understand it it's simply a a
name I don't have the update sorry I
besides I have it it's a name it's a
number so it in today so in terms of has
not get that that signal will be links
and the strength of it would be the
number of an element sir I interacted
the frequency of it was the number of
times that happened so i could use
frequency is number times a diddling
scan the links can is the strength of it
which is number of elements i didn't do
it because you could do it multiple time
scales I want have to save up 0 / 2 Nell
above the collar of this code can now
take a signal sir signature look at this
performance profile when it's normal
look at the performance profile would
indeed gates and that say what signals
are different what does this guy doing
when he deviates bitanem and twenty
percent what signals just pop over and
it doesn't need to know what the signal
means they're just a name and you put it
in your coat so every time you it's a
you'll probably their language change
here we just go to our signal yeah
that's going to take oh how can I today
but we're so you would find at signal
okay is there any questions I don't we
have a sickness don't ask a question on
signals that was something but I wanted
to show that this simulation system is
also used for business how are you do
experiment we do experiments okay sorry
we do experiments and we replay them
around the world so today they're done
in Sharon is it and they're replayed
around the world in different
laboratories and what did they use they
use simulation they restore the events
as an event stream and then in each of
these labs people replay that in
assimilation to look at some aspect for
they're trying to find so it's this kind
of technology is nothing new in that
world what it hasn't been used is for
machines to learn machines today we're
using machine
learning to learn about humans and it's
time to machine probably and about
itself ok any questions I think about
yes yes all the transaction well yeah
it's not a restore it's really kind of a
journal of it you can think of like a
transaction log probably you know it's
it is a kind of a behavioral log I mean
the logging mechanism is just a way to
get to the behavior what happens is is
that ok you could have that log data but
you can't look at the data because the
simulation has to interpret that log and
turn it in to recreate the world so if
we look at the world of warcraft it's
recreating this other world and the end
that's what i wanted to also show is
that already today we have simulations
inside of maybe dissimilation so it goes
all the way it's Turtles all the way
down as I say so we can neste so in this
is really it's just a stream of thoughts
and those are just the art is not
getting the stream the art is the
reconstruction of what that reality is
so it's a bit like a video quarter we
think of it as a codec you know like you
got the recording but you need to Kodak
to replay it and so and then the of
course has to recreate what that is now
what we're doing to do is not just
recreate a view of it we're trying to
make it as real as possible so you can
exist in that world so we're in a video
recorder you can't jump in unless you're
really wonka you know you can jump into
the video playback but if you if this
was a real environment to your code and
it just was driven not by user
interaction book by a feed that was
either real-time or a recording then
your code would never have to change you
I don't want to create another mechanism
another distinction I don't want the
distinction between that because it's
not only just for code reviews because
we need to understand like I want to
know is where is the call coming from
what is this thread I can create a tread
local in this environment and it will
operate the way it would operate in the
other environment so I don't want the
kind of because messaging across does
something like that where you publish
into a message queue is stores and then
replays and you thinking but every time
you have to push it off its we creating
that it doesn't recreate the stack so I
what I was trying to say is eliminate
messaging and it looks like the stock is
there the tread is there it's doing the
work and it's it's it's not a diss
disconnected behavior it's just a
behavior of augmented in a different
universe i sat siri this works I mean
this is nothing this is real I thought
it was real already simulator
simultaneously under low bail yeah yes
you plug in yes okay well that comes
down to it well the first of all you
have to know understand is is there a
difference so being in this environment
you can ask that question easy because
all the treads are there they're all
life and every trade will have there is
an environment object reached red and
you can ask it what real where what is
real representation like where does he
really exists but the question is always
to be able to accurately ask it nail the
nail this is what we're trying to create
the question the ability to be able to
reason in real time the present across
all of those if you to go to each jbm
it's past its over the event is gone but
if you can say split second down and
your code is not complicated anymore it
could operate in a single environment or
could operate and assimilated but you
can now ask that question across threads
and get an immediate response and that's
what's critical so that's the first part
the second part is control and this is
what we actually do we have quality
service adaptive control mechanisms and
we put them in the agent inside the
client now what we're using is signals
we generate signals in the simulation
and the signals go back to the real
environment and they kind of it's a bit
like learning a new skill or something
that you've let
did in that environment like virtual
reality you experience it there so we
can actually make it JVM we can send a
signal back to it and the real JVM is
still signal based but it doesn't know
the signal came from a sims environment
and I'll see that signal say I need to
control I need to start shrinking we
have a valve technology that allows the
you can have any number tread pool size
you want it can be a million but we will
actually control your threads what is
the optimal level now of course we can
do that but there's always a part where
we have to learn about it but what if
the seams could give us hints to what
was the upward optimal level on that and
that's where sim says and also Sims is
your way of doing a policy where you can
specify the policy in the virtual
reality or the simulated world but
propagated backwards at the moment on
what I've demonstrated to you is
unidirectional forwarding the spirit but
of course it's a bit like your dreams
you you experience a dream and then your
next day your change man like I got up
today I assume you're gonna be tell some
people here and I was feeling good
coming down so that was a dream and that
was able to trigger my behavioral change
so you can we can have those there and
it seems and there can be we can
recreate those dreams there because
sometimes it ever ever wrote some code
and you said like I was the I feel
inspired now of course I companies
called Jane sparkle like sometimes you
design something you like someone else
was a designer because Hempton hell did
I get that right and you felt like
someone put a suggestion in you know
like inception someone put that idea in
there a dream and that has come into
this but you don't you don't know the
difference but it's all to your behavior
so what we'd like to do is that Sam's
becomes a kind of the brain for our
environment and I know this sounds crazy
but it works today you know it works in
my environment at ease and it works in
companies there's companies of course it
doesn't do what doesn't work is people
don't get it you know it's hard it's
hard to give up that control it's hard
to imagine there's a machine somewhere
else that's it's a machine of another
machine but then think of think about
her city
it is that I do the robot that's like I
could do the problem but look at that
that's a robot what am i doing a robot
is trying to mimic me he does a robot
dance I know mimicking the robot
mimicking me that that's weird and
everybody thinks that's cool so to me
that seems crazy but see was that so
okay so it works it's the issue is is to
get for everybody to imagine to think up
a sand time to imagine his design
systems to augment them in a different
way well given which is a very practical
example we had the customer had love for
Jay had some integration were amazon
they had employed with the s3 and then
they had that wet fear and I had both
had love for Jay problems you know there
was a lot for JD Erin Laura Jane dear
and they couldn't run this integration
together what did they did they put the
integration in the simulation because
log4j is not in that simulation so they
put one particular library in the
simulation and they did the integration
with amazon true the simulation and
there's no class problems they didn't
need i was it osgi that's a good so it's
a way of partitioning it's a way
partitioning in that way but but keeping
your flow you know not disjointed it's
still the code like I would look if if
you're cold with the lookup it would see
it at red stack that looked like the
tread stuck in the real application and
that's really cool thing because it's a
new tool a new way of approaching it and
this is just the beginning
any other questions
okay William loud is there some I just
go back in case you forgot anyway you
probably see it you can just if you have
