with this is the first dev live session
after lunch
I'm your host Javed Mohammad here for
another session of Dell live at Oracle
called Sydney and I have as my guest
today David Peake who is a senior
principal product manager at article so
David welcome and also a speaker at
today's event so you're going to be
talking low code no code what's what's
all that about
so my session others I gave it earlier
today and it was a low code database
first development so it's teaching
people about the benefits of low cloud
solutions which are basically where you
know either citizen developers and power
users or IT professionals can use these
tools to very quickly and easily build
solutions and so instead of getting into
low-level coding instead it's abstract
it up so they can concentrate on the
business solution and be able to build
out the applications they need with you
know it provides efficient state
management it interacts with the
database it you know provide security
and all those sorts of things so that
the developers are more interested in
okay here's information I want to get
out on a screen on a report or a chart
etc and really you take a lot of the
complexity so it's a basically they're
focusing on a business problem without
having to worrying about knowing how to
code exactly and as opposed well low
code it means you need to do some coding
but a lot of the functionality is taken
it is already there for you so for
example if you want to report you just
going to say okay I want to report and I
say okay what do you want the report on
and just select that if you want a chart
then you might have to write a little
bit of code to actually provide the
input or the chart that sort of thing no
code is where you don't do any typing
any code at all you know our solutions
are generally low code where a lot of
things you don't need to do any coding
but
to do things like validations and
queries in behind charts and things like
that then you need to potentially put in
a little bit of code so if someone is
wanting to write an application a web
application a mobile application how
would they go about figuring out its
kind of the three different scenarios of
someone wanting needing to actually
write code versus doing low code versus
no code we what kind of applications are
kind of better suited for these kind of
things like roads very suitable for
where you're you're trying to prototype
you're trying to get applications out
very quickly and with tools like
application Express or apex or a bcs
which is the application builder cloud
service then you know you're starting
out from using Wizards and drag and drop
and that sort of thing to build the
application if you want to take it to
the next level then you can and that's a
hallmark of some of the better load pro
tools is that they can also go to high
control so for that when you're starting
out initially you don't need 50
validations initially you just want to
get the screens out get the user started
to use them and then you want to go in
and add you know tighten it up and you
know make sure that they're doing things
correctly and and that sort of thing and
so that's what locos tools allow you to
do is to get an application out in front
of your users get them to start using it
and then see you know what's most
important see where they need to be
healthy navigate around see you know
where we need to tighten up to make sure
that you know they don't put in a higher
date that's future dated and you know
simple things like that you start you
know improving your application and
increasing the complexity slowly but the
key thing is that you're not going in
and writing you know low-level code
where you know for everything that
you're doing instead like oh I want this
concern you know control I want a list
of values or I want a button and you
know basically you just drag a button in
and and then tell it what you want it to
do with the button rather than having to
try
dude I want a button type thing and it
needs to live here Kevin you know those
sort of things of a difference between
low code and what we call high control
okay all right
we were talking off-camera actually last
night at dinner about developers and
obviously article code is targeted
developers any insights in terms of like
how how do we get our message out to to
developers out there I think one of the
key things is that there's a lot of
different ways of solving problems and
you know Oracle is often seen is
difficult and hard to work with and
that's certainly you know was
potentially true years gone but these
days there's a lot of alternatives for
developers and we're trying to open up
their eyes and say hey look you know we
do a lot of open source we're involved
in a lot of different communities we're
trying to be more inclusive and you know
see that there's different parts of
Oracle that can really make your life
easier and then we're about is to try
and empower developers to be able to do
the simple stuff quickly and easily so
they can concentrate on the more the
harder stuff that really needs an IT
professional ok all right well thanks
for sharing that the other thing is you
get a very interesting background get an
Australian who lives in America what
would now that you're back here and say
what what do you miss more what do you
miss more so when you come here but what
things is that you really want to check
out when you come so there's certain
food items if you just can't get in
America like meat pies so the first
thing I do whenever I land in Australia
is I go and get a meat pie put a bit of
tomato or ketchup or tomato sauce you
know I have family and that that still
lives in Australia so great for me to
get back here with them it was actually
my father's birthday so that boredom
very well
and you know the the other thing is you
know
walking around the street and hearing
Australian accents rather than American
accent it's like well hang on a minute I
feel like you instead of standing weird
all the time so yeah that's it's nice to
come home okay well welcome home and
thanks for sharing your time and your
insights thank you thank you David</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
