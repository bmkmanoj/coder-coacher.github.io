lounge here been the the neighborhood of
Oracle OpenWorld in Java Wan I'm Bob
brew Bart with the Oracle developer
community and my guest for this segment
is Martin Jarvis Martin thank you for
taking the time to talk to us thanks Bob
thanks for having me you realize this is
an absolute ambition of mine to get onto
your show all right well I'm glad to I
could I could be a part of that tell me
what you do for Oracle and what sort of
trouble you get into there okay so I'm
partly the product management team for
mobile and BOTS that's the the new chat
bot solution that we've got that we
launched just a couple of weeks ago and
we've got lots of demos here and I'm
here in the demo area and with customers
showing up all of the the new solutions
that we've built so you're involved in
if correct me if I'm wrong two sessions
here at open world yeah tomorrow we've
got our bots panel and we've got some of
our customers who have been early
adopters so we launched the product two
weeks ago but we did a smart thing which
was to give a number of customers who
were really interested in it an early
access kind of eat our own dog food and
giving them a load of docker containers
that they deployed themselves before it
could go into our cloud which enable
them to run pocs internally and now you
know we can kind of showcase those
solutions here open what great and and I
know I should mention also that there's
a Oracle developer community podcast
available right now that is a panel
discussion with two of the people who
are involved in that early pilot program
matt horn um and leon smears that's
right and there's another podcast coming
up next week with several other people
who were involved in that same program
some really interesting stories to tell
about their chat bot development
tomorrow we've got exelon and who else
we got so Capgemini Leah Lian will be
there as well and I know I'm missing one
of them but we've got three customers
who will be there showing us their the
solution it's nice so tell me about the
intelligent but platform what does it do
okay so are you familiar with a chat bot
yeah okay right so you know the thing is
that if you talk to most people today
how do they actually communicate with
each other
how do they talk to their friends it's
always through a chat or a messaging app
the idea with a chat bot is to automate
that so you can actually chat with a
service in some way right and we can
then provide you know connectivity some
back-end systems so we provide
transactions or data in a conversational
style so instead of having to her go
through screens whatever on your at your
application now you can chat with it you
can have a conversation and what makes
our bots intelligent is that we've now
been out to add AI into this so we can
use machine learning and quite
sophisticated natural language
processing so the end user doesn't have
to learn a set of keywords which may be
the sort of chat what you've seen in the
past now the bot understands how people
want to talk to it we did an awful lot
of training around that with natural
language using things like Wikipedia and
Wall Street Journal to teach this thing
what sentence structures are like and
great things so to build a bot it's
really easy because you're building on
top of that platform that we built you
just need to give it sort of ten 20 key
phrases that the bottle understand
that's unique to your domain and you'll
have a functioning button no time in
fact you had Matt do a two minute talk
yes he built about in two minutes if you
remember using that very same PR that
temed horton did a really great two
minute tech tip that's available on
YouTube right now where he he
demonstrates a bit of chat by
development
chat bot development is unique
especially with compared to the visual
UI is that that people are used to using
in terms of people who are in a
developed chat but how does the
intelligent but platform help them make
that transition it's definitely
different you're right so where is it
you know in the past maybe you are
thinking about fonts and colors screen
layout and your whole brand was how you
delivered it through colors and layouts
right now we're thinking about tone
voice we're thinking about
conversational style you know is this a
friendly but as its turn is it
professional is it chatty so all of that
design needs to go into
kind of a personality at the bot is
something that used to come out
we do have a visual tool for doing this
now so you don't really want to be
coding personality in lines of code yeah
that's not the greatest way to get to a
personality so we do have a visual
design that way you can design the the
flow of the conversation if you like and
what what makes our solution unique is
that we can actually have different
states within a conversation so you can
jump around so I'll give you a classic
example of this out of how this works so
imagine you're talking to your bot and
you say right it's a banking but I want
to pay some bills say I want to pay the
babysitter $20 from my savings account
and the bot says actually I said what I
should have said the slightly wrong so
maybe I said if I want to pay the
babysitter from my savings account and
then the bot says how much because you
forgot to say but instead of giving it a
number you say well what is my balance
so you've jumped out of that flow into
another flow it can tell you what the
balance was and then you can return back
to that other state so it's a much more
natural way that you can talk to the bot
instead of getting stuck in in a kind of
a siloed conversational flow and that's
why users find that much easier to deal
with and interact with now how do
developers people who are interested in
using this tool how do they actually get
intelligent bot how is that available to
them so what we've done is combines our
intelligent BOTS platform with our
mobile platform because there's a lot of
similarities and the way in which you
want to connect your bot or your mobile
app to a back-end system you know a
mobile app or a bot it's pretty useless
unless it's got some enterprise system
behind it
unless you're building horoscopes or
something in your chat box you know you
really want some proper enterprise data
so by putting it inside mobile cloud
service or what now we've now launched
his mobile cloud enterprise which is a
combination of what we had before with
mobile cloud service and our intelligent
BOTS you've got all that kind of rich AI
natural language processing get behind
it all so the API catalog and all the
kind of nodejs coding that you can use
to connect your back
systems so when you talk about
developing so when you're developing the
front-end you're developing the book you
know that's where you're thinking about
the conversation and we got a nice
visual designer design the conversation
but when you actually come to the
connectivity so how do we actually get
that data out of that database how do i
navigate through these kind of Roth or
security layers whatever then you've got
the full power of all no js' and all the
libraries and modules that you've got
there to call upon so it's a great
combination of the two is there are
there other distinctions too Oracle
mobile cloud Enterprise beside the
intelligent platform image I mean as
compared to the previous version of
Oracle mobile cloud the other big thing
we got is new version of analytics okay
so before we've always had analytics in
the in the the the base platform so you
could measure how effective your mobile
apps were being but we took a step back
and said you know what if we're talking
about kind of mobile web mobile apps and
our chat was you know you need a
analytics tool that's going to give you
insight across all of those channels
so that's we've now built into the new
products and we're calling that CX a
customer experience analytics and from
there it's basically a big data platform
that we're collecting all the data from
all these channels and you can follow
users across those different channels
and see what they're doing when the chat
BOTS for example it means that yeah you
know when you train about to understand
certain phrases maybe you didn't think
about everything maybe you didn't
actually guess how are your usable to
come in but you can see from the
analytics you can see the types of
questions that the users are asking and
you can say ah okay I need to go back
and refine that so the analytics is
giving you the tools in which you can
continue to improve and refine your box
and make it even better for your
injuries let's change gears for a minute
I want to talk to you about your
involvement with a group called code
Club okay what is code club you've seen
my badge I see the badge that you're
talking about is I have another batch
for you you need to wear this
all right going right on this shirt we
call them badges in the UK you put pins
here with his pins right yes so I mean
vote Waco Club is the other thing a very
passionate about
in fact I think I'm more passionate as
blazes is creating the next generation
of computer scientists and the the idea
of code club is it's a an organization
that's part of the Raspberry Pi
foundation okay they recently merged and
raspberry pi kind of uploaded all of
their educational activity to Co Club
but they're not tied to Raspberry Pi
they'll anything that schools and
education departments can use to treat
children around computing they'll go for
and so lots of scratch lots of website
development obviously some things when
Raspberry Pi and the thing I use is one
of these I don't people to see it this
is called a BBC micro bit in the UK it
was a BBC funded project and they gave
every eleven-year-old kid one of these
well and it's a single board computer
it's not as sophisticated as a Raspberry
Pi a little bit better than an Arduino
in terms of functions but I love it with
the children because when they look at
it I say to them you know that laptop
this in front of you is everything isn't
that laptop is on here but we get to
kind of say well there's the chip
there's a CPU and they can kind of read
it all and it kind of breaks down those
barriers and makes them kind of realise
that it's quite fun and quite cool and
how old are the kids that are involved
in this program I have nine to 11 year
olds in my group but Co Club just
expanded to up to 13 euros and and what
sort of projects are they involved in
and Co Club themselves got all sorts of
wacky things like putting technology in
space and yeah you name it there's
different kids doing different clubs but
so maybe I just enjoy I'm just a
volunteer I'm not you know organize it
what happened was I heard about it I
thought that's what worthwhile thing I'm
really quite interested in this whole
idea around education in schools so I
went on to their website and kind of
just said I'd be happy to volunteer and
then within a few months really one of
the local schools contacted me and said
we'd like to do this but we don't really
know how to get started or what to do
would you come and have a talk to us so
I went in met the head teacher and
that's how we got started from there and
now I spend an hour or so every week
with the children it's great it's great
it's a global organization so I talk
about the UK but a Coke Club is
available in any country it's a bit
intimidating to think of
what sort of what sort of coders these
kids will become haven't gotten to this
very early start I know I overreacted to
talk to a lot of people and and many of
them you know talk about how they were
teenagers when they first got involved
in you know deconstructing games and
things like that I wouldn't be here
without that's how I still like to think
about kids you know eight or nine or ten
years old getting involved in it is it's
imposing and it'll be it'll be exciting
to see what happens in the future with
this and the most rewarding thing is
when your son in a class when she's
about ten year old girl there's girls
and technology she's about a ten year
old and she finished a project he went
yes awesome coder right that's it my
job's done great that's great well
Martin thanks for stopping by taking
time to talk to us
welcome won't you do that I can tell
everybody to come to our booth and come
and see all the things we're doing are
any sergeant bots please do yeah all set
to go to on our website
Oracle comm / mobile I'm glad you
remembered oracle.com / bots and
cloud.oracle.com / mobile and let me
give you another URL that's developer
oracle.com where you'll find all sorts
of great content for developers for the
oracle developer community i'm bob
Robarts thanks for watching and stay
