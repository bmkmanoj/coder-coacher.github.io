prime face prime time with JSF with
prime faces five this was originally
supposed to be presented by jatai
seviche who's the prime faces lead but
he cannot be here so I'm doing instead
my name is Kido I'm the principal
consultant at Virtua we do training
consulting mentoring architecture
related to JSF Java EE and Liferay I'm
an official u.s. primefaces partner and
I wrote a book a long time ago has
anyone read this book it's like 10 years
old anybody all right so few people
that's always very curious are you the
same few people I've seen this week or
well I run a website called JSF central
where you can find some articles about
JSF and also some interviews with people
in the industry which are transcribed
assualt but there's also audio as well I
also participate in the enterprise Java
newscast which is a podcast that I
encourage you to check out it comes out
every couple months or so and it's me
and a couple other guys that talk about
everything related to JSF Java EE Scala
you know just enterprise development in
general so I encourage you to check that
out it's you can get it on iTunes as
well I speak a lot to conferences and
I'm a member of the Java community
process mostly right now involved with
JSF and portlets so that's pretty much
me I didn't want to get a bit of a sense
of the people in the room how many
people here are currently using JSF oh
wait wait let me just how many people
are not using JSF anybody okay so we've
got a few newbies in the room okay and
how many people are not using primefaces
currently okay all right so good
I'm assuming the rest of you must
actually be just gonna stuff
okay how many people are using ice faces
okay how many people are using rich
faces and how many people are using I
don't know patchy Trinidad or something
okay
alright so so for the newbies there's
like basically those three components
wheats for JSF and there's also idiot
faces rich client anybody using that
okay so one person okay which is an
Oracle product so let's start out a bit
with a little bit of information about
who else uses prime faces so front faces
right now is pretty much the most
popular component suite for JSF these
are just some of the companies that use
it there's a pretty good list so
basically picking it is a pretty decent
choice you're in a pretty good company
with some larger and some smaller
companies as well okay there's more okay
so there's a decent number of companies
in terms of popularity it's been
interesting to just see the interest in
time it's actually comes from Google so
you can see basically primefaces came
out around 2009 whereas the other
components we started earlier so they
did pretty well for a while but what
sort of happens primefaces just in a way
at a lot of their market share over time
so this is pretty much looking where it
is and the other ones are declining
although you know I still work with them
I still see some interest but uh parm
faces right now is pretty much the most
popular one it's also very global the
company prime tech behind it is actually
based in Turkey I'm based on the East
Coast
and in Virginia and this is a picture
from some guys in Columbia that were so
into primefaces they actually had these
bumper stickers made so I don't know
these guys but I always thought this was
a good picture
so so it's a pretty pre global
phenomenon and I find you know even in
Europe there's a decent number of people
using it so it's essentially a suite of
JSF UI components so if you're not
familiar with JSF basically JSF is a
server-side component framework for JSF
I mean for job
ee but essentially what what the deal is
is you to find review in HTML or
basically XML tags and some HTML
depending on how you're doing things and
you interact with the server with event
listeners and the components generate a
lot of markup HTML CSS JavaScript to
give you a rich UI and also JSF does the
heavy lifting of the backend integration
okay so JSF is a good way for Java
developers to build a rich UI and
primefaces has over 100 different
components everything from you know a
simple table to you know simple form
elements and actually the table is not
really simple at all it's actually very
complicated components but it's one of
the most powerful ones and you know drop
downs charts calendar scheduling
component there's even a mind map
component so there's there's lots of
stuff in there you can also create
really advanced UIs excuse me I'll put
them all of it when we get to it it's
it's a nice component this is an example
of one thing you can do this like a mock
Mac OS desktop these are all prime basis
components now I haven't actually seen
anyone try and do this in production but
there's something you could do
theoretically it's also some handy form
components so so JSF comes
out-of-the-box with basic form
components you know your input controls
your text areas you know drop-down menus
and foreign faces has enhanced versions
of those components that have other
features and they generally do a lot
more JavaScript and CSS and basically
you know in order to get a list box or a
drop-down there's basically doing a lot
of JavaScript and CSS where is the
default components just do you know
here's an info control and then let the
browser do the rendering all for it so
so you have more control with these
components and there's pluses and
minuses so when you build an application
using the web these days there's all
these different technologies you have to
keep it in mind
right there's CSS there's JavaScript
there's Jason Ajax and one of the things
that primefaces helps you do is hide
some of this complexity for you so you
can concentrate more on building your
applications and it still keeps the
flexibility though okay so it you can
still override CSS there's a full
JavaScript API so any primefaces
basically every single client faces
component has a client-side widget okay
so in cases where you do need to
interact with the widget and on the page
in JavaScript you can there's a
full-fledged JavaScript API for doing
calling methods on the server getting
Jason back
there's client-side callbacks for pretty
much every component and like I said
there's a DES callbacks as well so
there's a lot of stuff you can do so in
this example this is a tab view
component and we're basically saying all
right every time the you change a tab
let me call this backing bean which is
essentially a controller class on the
server and then I want to update some
other component in the page this is
going to update the Ajax okay so so all
of this this markup here generates a
decent amount of JavaScript HTML and CSS
for you so let's take a look at a
standard primefaces component so here's
the page so inside your page this is the
scheduling component it gives you sort
of a calendar that you can add events to
and things like that so here's a piece
control so this is saying let me define
this schedule component let me give it a
value so somewhere in your application
you have a backing bean in some scope
like view scope or
Qwest scope or something and it's
returning a model object that this
scheduled component understands okay and
we also are declaring a widget bar so
this basically says that if i want to
access this component in javascript this
is the name of that component on the
page that i can use to access it okay so
this muse is for any any component you
don't have to find the widget bar but if
you want to give it a name that you you
can using in your JavaScript without you
know an automatically generated name
then you can use the widget of our so
the mark-up would be something like this
generate a div with the ID actually ism
doesn't match here but button ID based
on what you what you set there and then
you also will get some JavaScript
generated so this is basically the
JavaScript Forge for creating the
primefaces
scheduled component sending in the
different parameters that you set and
some default parameters as well and you
may notice this little dollar sign here
anybody know what this means
yes jQuery okay so one of the key things
about primefaces is that it's built on
top of jQuery so if you use jQuery it
makes it very easy to add functionality
if you need to okay ultimately very easy
to read the JavaScript code if you need
to as well so part basis supports you
know pretty much all the modern
standards supports html5 it makes a
heavy use of the data attributes in
html5 forms the media attributes canvas
it supports you know and this all
depends on the components you know every
component doesn't use html5 canvas right
only and only a few do because those are
the ones that actually need it uses
WebSockets for Ajax push which we'll
talk about later so makes use of html5
where appropriate
and one of the other key things is a
really really strong support for Ajax in
general right so JSF 2 and higher has
had Ajax built in so it's been in there
for a while and I actually I'm just
curious anyone not using JSF to using
JSF 1.2 or something okay so a couple of
years a prime base is pretty much gonna
require you to use JSF too so you want
to use it you should gonna have to
upgrade um so but primefaces uses some
basic I'm sorry JSF includes basic
server-side JavaScript or Ajax support
there's also client API s as well which
are in jQuery okay so the difference
here is on the server when a request
comes in from a prime faces component
via Ajax it is you know the whole normal
standard JSF stuff works like it works
JSF has no idea that primefaces is using
jQuery okay however internally the
actual Ajax transport mechanism the
primefaces uses is built on top of
jQuery okay so this has some some nice
implement implications basically it
means that if you need to do some you
know it's kind of hook into the way the
Ajax stuff works in a way the primefaces
doesn't expose to you you can just use
the underlying jQuery api's okay I've
done this a couple times where we needed
to change some settings that weren't
exposed via primefaces and I could just
use the jQuery API directly to change
how the Ajax requests were being handled
okay in standard JSF there is an F Ajax
tag and F Ajax just basically you know
lets you decide which component you're
going to update on the page and an
initiate an AJAX request based on some
client-side event like a like a change
event or blur focus whatever okay and
the fhx tag is pretty functional pretty
handy primefaces has an extension to
that tag called PHX
and it has some additional event
handlers which are very handy
so it has a non complete on air on start
on success so basically for your Ajax
request you can fire some Java scripts
before the request starts you know after
it's done after it's complete etc this
lets you do some smart things like you
can actually say okay on success I'm
gonna call this JavaScript and then if
that return false the the Ajax request
won't even happen right so that lets
just gives you a little a little more
fine-grained control sometimes after the
ajax request is complete you want to do
some more JavaScript manipulation if you
want to pop up something maybe you need
to update some other components in
JavaScript for some reason so it gives
you that level of flexibility which is
very nice you can also decide something
is asynchronous or not so pretty much by
default primefaces queues all requests
so and that's sort of to keep the
ordering right so if you click on four
things on the screen and they're all
doing Ajax requests it puts them in a
queue and sends them in order right but
if you don't want that you can turn you
set it sink to true and have them all go
asynchronously okay
global will allow you to control to
basically integrate with global status
indicators which is handy sometimes the
one caveat I will say with this is that
if you are using primefaces you pretty
much have to switch to the PHX from Ajax
because it I find it doesn't work you
doesn't really work very well so pretty
much you have to change your whole
application use PHX but it's really not
that hard of a thing to okay so this is
what f Ajax looks like in jazz standard
JSF you say F Ajax the events is blur so
uhm blur I'm gonna render this component
which means I'm going to update it so
basically change them you know update
the mark-up with the result of the ajax
request okay and then i am also on the
server i want to execute this component
which means that on the server i want to
process the input or the
this component on the server and handle
things so basically what this is saying
is based on whatever this component does
wherever this
Ajax is I want to update this component
okay so that's standard JSF to use rich
faces they did have an AF a4j attack I
think in the latest versions you can use
the F Ajax tag if I remember correctly
but it used to used to look like this I
had a rerender attribute primefaces has
a slightly different syntax so you know
the P Ajax admit part is the same but
instead of render and execute it's
update and process so it's just a minor
difference they actually had these tags
you know for a long time and just they
you know didn't really change the the
name of the attributes okay so there's
lots of Ajax extensions PHX we talked
about there's also Auto depth auto
update so there are some components you
can update automatically like the
messages error messages etc so you don't
have to manually say update this
component on the page it has some
enhanced selectors nice callbacks
Ajax status partial submit which we'll
talk about in a second and their request
context which gives you some extra
features for for dealing with Ajax
requests
so APEC status so the Ajax status is
pretty much that indicator that you know
you can have usually as some sort of
like pulsating star thing right but
essentially it tells you that you know
you're processing in Ajax requests that
you probably should wait a minute okay
and you can use whatever graphic you
want so there's a fetus from different
ways you can use it with farm faces
there's um you can have a start and end
component or or just you know text you
want to display okay so in JSF you can
use a facet to sort of have a special
name for one or more component so here
we're saying when the 8th when the Ajax
request starts I want to display this
image and when it ends I want to output
to the text so if you do that you can
also do this programmatically so you can
say on start I want to pop up a dialog
to a be a kind of a strange thing but
you could say hey you know I'm
processing a request you can make the
dialog modal if you wanted to all right
I'm complete you can hide and also what
one of the things you can do with this
is that
PHX actually starts or is used for if
you wanted to it can handle every
request if it's if they're Global
requests so you can actually put some
logic that you want to be executed on
the client here for all the Ajax
requests if you want as well so it's
sort of a hey any way to do that even if
you're not displaying anything if you
just execute some JavaScript so Global
is that ability to sort of integrate
with the px on a global scale sometimes
you want the indicator to be associated
with some components and not others
sometimes you want to be global for the
whole page so you have that level of
flexibility also something called the
request context how many people have
used the request context and curious so
a few of you okay so let's say you have
a page and you have a command button and
the basically what this is going to say
is you click on submit and you call a
method in your backing bean called safe
okay and you house will have a dialogue
with the name dialog widget okay in a
dialog which it again is the client-side
name of the JavaScript object there's
some interesting things you can do so
inside of your backing bean you can get
an access to there's this request
context very very similarly to how you
can access the faces context right and
you can actually execute some JavaScript
and obviously this is not going to be
running on the server we're not using
Nashville or anything like that all this
is saying is that when the request comes
back to the client run this code okay
there's also other things you can do
with this as well you can add Jason sim
back to the to the client you can add
just written just a few parameters and
so it gives you a lot of flexibility
okay yeah so this is another example
this is the same page and here we're
actually doing partial updates so now
we're saying alright when you update
when you return back to the client I
want you to update this component and
this would have some some client ID
essentially I'm I'm really not too keen
on tightly coupling like the JavaScript
with the Java and the IDS here but it
does give me the flexibility if you need
to do it and this is pretty much since
these two are pretty much the same thing
so this is saying you know update Val
this is saying update Val - you can just
do it in two places
okay
you can also do scrolling with a request
context so this is just saying when the
request comes back to scroll to this
component as well another handy feature
and there's also other stuff in there so
I encourage you to check out the request
context just you know your day to day
programming to see what sort of features
you can use from it so we talked about
Auto update and that's the ability to
automatically update a component based
on some Ajax so so here you have Pete
growl growl is one of the messages
components and we're saying whenever you
click on this button we want to update
the messages whenever you click on that
button so that's something you often do
and it's sort of tedious because it's
like okay anytime I do anything I'm
gonna update the messages component can
I just stop typing it over and over
again so that's what auto update is it's
basically saying alright this will be
updated every time there's an extra
quest so you don't have to actually say
it repeatedly okay
all right so another feature is partial
submit so if you take a look at how an
AJAX request occurs in JSF you know
let's say your site you want to update
what you want to execute one component
like a button or something and then you
want to render a cut another component
coming back okay what JSF used to do by
default is it would just post the entire
form right so even though it's only I'm
gonna work with one component on the
page it posts the entire form so we
noticed this was a bit of a bottleneck
or maybe just some extra traffic going
back and forth so one of the
enhancements is partial submit which
only submits the values which have
changed okay so this is helpful in cases
where you have large forms I have some
clients where they have you know one
form for the entire page and the page
has like 10 tabs and you know it's a
really huge form so submitting the whole
thing just to process one or two
components is not really overhead it's a
lot of overhead so it's so this has been
a handy feature this is actually in I'd
like to say JSF 2.1 but parm catch is at
at first actually because of one of my
clients and i noticed that we really
that it's kind of a lot of extra
overhead so it also has some some nice
keywords for doing Ajax updates so in
JSF when you specify which components
you want to update you can say you know
this to update the current component
formed update the entire form and none
if you don't want to update any
components primefaces has added these
other nice keywords so you can say I
want to update the naming container
which is usually like the topmost
component that maintains a namespace so
an example of a name and container is
like a form or a dated table or
something like that so you can just say
I want to update the naming container
above me okay
parent would be that the absolutely the
parent the component right above you and
the component tree the one that actually
can contain
that component composite would be the
the composite component so if you're
using the positive components this is a
handy way to refer to that component and
then you can also reference children
directly previous component and you can
even say all right well I want to use
the widget VAR basically I know what the
widget VAR is but I don't know what the
name and the ID of the component on the
pages okay now she saw I have one client
that actually does this a lot and I was
questioning it but you know it is sort
of a way to not have to worry about the
actual ID of the component if we know
what the widget of our name is and you
know there are any collisions in that
namespace you don't have multiple widget
bars for the same name then this this
might be handy a handy option yes yeah
well it will be in the IBM aside but I'm
gonna put on SlideShare as well so if
you if you want me to let you know just
find me at Quito 99 on Twitter and I'll
I'm sure I'll tweeting when it's
available but I can let you know
directly yep there's also a unique
feature called primefaces selectors and
this lets you use jQuery to decide which
components update now it doesn't I think
it does actually use jQuery internally
but um basically the idea is when you
want to update a component you can use
this syntax using the jQuery selectors
so these are actually a jQuery selectors
so you know dot UI data table means the
component with the or the element on the
page with a CSS selector UI data table
and you know this is any info control
that's not a select this is just the
form this is pretty much the same as at
form form first this is basically the
jQuery selectors that you could use for
update as well okay this can be handy I
mean actually I don't completely
understand how it works but it does do
things more on the client than the other
methods so the other methods will look
up the client on the component on the
server side component tree this uses the
client side component this client side
elements a little bit more so this is an
alternate approach you haven't seen this
use too much in the field but
is an option okay and if you basically
all you in order to determine what
expression E is you just go to the
jQuery site and look at the selector
documentation and you can do pretty much
anything that you can do or the jQuery
selector okay so it's kind of handy so a
resource handling so time faces can do
some things with resource handling is
just to make life your life a little bit
easier so when you know let's say you're
using a lot of primefaces components
you're gonna be basically sending down
lots of you know CSS and HTML and
JavaScript so during the build process
primefaces actually puts all of the the
different components in one JS file and
minifides it and basically makes it
available so all the components are
going to use is this very nicely
minified JS file but you can load it on
the fly if you want to okay which is
also very helpful for debugging okay so
another thing parentheses has our themes
is very popular and JE set the opponent
suites and there's lots of different
ones out there some are better than
others but there's just a decent amount
to look at and you know it you don't
always end up going directly with a
plain theme out of the box but it's a
very good starting point and I do how
clients that actually do just you know
they pick one of these themes and it's
it's fine for them okay so so there's
lots of choices out there and installing
a theme is really easy you basically
just take a jar file throw it in your
class path and then add a context
parameter and you're good to go okay and
basically what happens is you
essentially have your your whole you
know looking field change based on that
you can also change themes dynamically
at runtime if you need to okay so you
can just you can actually see this in
the prime faces showcase you can just
change the theme and that just means all
those themes are in the class path and
then you can basically use the API to
change the theme so it's pretty handy
the way the CSS is designed this is
basically more behavioral CSS selectors
for all the components
that specifies sort of the the basic
sort of layout the part and then the
theme there's a lot of the all the look
and feel and the images and things like
that
okay so so there's a really a nice
separation between what the theme does
and what the component really needs to
look as something like the actual
component okay and what's nice is the
themes were actually built on top of
theme roller so how many people here
have heard of theme roller before
alright so a decent number of you and so
theme roller is part of jQuery UI and it
basically has this nice little builder
so you can actually build your own theme
there's actually some very specific
steps you can go through to take your
theme roller theme and then turn it into
a prime faces theme so it's another good
starting point you can go to the theme
roller site and start from scratch if
you want to make your theme turn into a
prime faces theme and then you're good
to go so there's also some some fancy
looking themes as well I guess these are
a little a little slicker than some of
the other ones so let's take a look at
the actual prime face to showcase and
which is really really the the best
place to go to get a handle on sort of
what what the components are actually
like
all right so this is the prime faces
site and this is the showcase okay it's
been recently updated it's very nice um
so there's a little search menu you can
find stuff if I want to find the data
table it's in here okay so the data
table is probably one of the best places
to start basically use your standard
sort of tabular way to display data
right and you can specify it like this
this is pretty much how all of the
standard or pretty much any component of
sweet does what the data table you
specify the variable which is what the
each row is referred to when it's being
displayed so basically what's gonna
happen is this is going to grab a list
of cars from this object and then when
iterate through those cars
it'll be exposed as a variable see AA CA
are inside of that you can use inside of
an expression okay so here we're going
to display the ID of the year the brand
in color the car which is what we see
here
okay so usage is pretty straightforward
the view basically just returns a list
of cars okay whoops so it's pretty
straightforward but the component itself
has lots of features so let's see so of
course you can do sorting and pagination
those are pretty standard things and you
see this is an example down here of the
Ajax status indicator just pops up for a
second there okay you can do scrolling
which is of course a important things
that you could do vertical and
horizontal scrolling or both and all of
these things are just different
attributes that you can specify so it's
also frozen rose which is a newer
feature so you see these first two rows
here are frozen and then down here
there's frozen columns
the first column there is frozen as well
so also there's on-demand data so you
see basically when you get to the bottom
of the scroll list it's going to load
more rows from the server okay this is a
common technique you see now in newer
sites where they're basically you know
we just keep on scrolling forever and
loads row and more rows dynamically okay
so all this is Suns it's basically by
specifying which attribute you want to
use so scrollable is true here let's
scroll ball is true
here we are scrollable sets at you here
as well
and see it's all just normal markup and
you just basically specify you know what
after peach you want to support I'm here
in this example you see we've got school
rose and more stuff but just really cut
off there but there's a lot of stuff you
could do there also there's things you
can do like expansion so let's say what
you want to do is for each one of these
you want to display some details and you
see it's actually in this example going
back to the server to get those details
for you for the ones you expand because
you probably don't want to send this all
up front you probably want to just grab
the the sections that people expand okay
and you can see down here we've got the
Pierrot expansion thing and then you can
put whatever components you want in here
that usually will be grabbing data for
that current row okay and so there's a
lot of stuff in here
one this is one of the newer features is
the cell editing so you can basically
say that a row is cell editable and then
you can basically get nice little
editors this is a lot nicer because then
we know we've been in situations you can
do an editable data table without using
this feature but it's more of a pain to
do so this is nice to have a built in to
use pretty easily see here we're doing a
click right click so there's cell
editing and row headings this is an
example of row editing this is an
example of cell editing
so and again all this is pretty
straightforward you see here's an
example of using repeating checks so
we're basically the sitting on row edit
call this listener and then update we
scroll down and make sure I don't mess
up the display here update the messages
in this example on the page or update
any messages here so we could also have
used auto update messages as well for
this you see basically what we do is for
each column we you can specify a cell
editor and then you specify a component
display for input and a components
display for output okay so it's
basically how it works and then
depending on how you've configured it
that component will be displayed based
on a single click or double click or you
know or whatever it is and here's that
context menu that you saw so context
menu is another component and you see it
says for cars - ok cars - is the name of
not that data table but this one ok this
is saying this is the context menu for
this data table ok you can Patrick you
can attach a context menu to all sorts
of different components so that's how we
get that that context menu when you
right-click that will go and let you
update the that cell and you see what
what's happening here and this is sort
of an example of the power of primefaces
is that when you click that edit right
you are you wanted you can go back to
the server but in this case all you're
trying to do is start the process of
editing a cell right so using the
client-side API you can just say get
that component with this widget VAR name
okay and then call that editor we call
that method which will show that the the
cell editor okay so that's an example
there's lots of stuff in the data table
I don't want to take up all the time but
there's a lot of stuff there so this is
obviously one of the quintessential and
components out there there's also lots
of info controls so you see we've got
autocomplete
you know which is actually pretty
popular and so there
so with autocomplete you can basically
there's lots of different events like
you know you can handle stuff in the
server you can force selections so let's
say I am what's in this list I can never
remember okay it's dynamic right so you
know I can pick up there and what is
actually doing is going back to the
server a call calling a specific method
that does the query and then returning
that back okay
so force selection here it basically
will only let me select something from
the list and you can control how many
results you're returning you can control
the delay which is how long it takes
before it actually pays attention to
what you typed in you can control the
length that it worries about so since
you're going back to the server you
don't really want the to start going
back to the server like when they've
typed the first character you might want
to wait to leave typed in a few so you
have a better idea what to let's search
for so you can change that value as well
so I'll type in M it doesn't do anything
if I type in min then it does so there's
lots of options there and again this is
all just standard jsf you specify your
autocomplete component and then
different attributes and what you're
returning in your view is really just a
list so these are listed to do the
queries where basically is saying
complete this thing complete that thing
cetera okay so this example the event
listener says operate for
so someone asked about the mindmap
component so let me see if I didn't find
that
all right so how many people are
familiar with my maps in general anybody
good good so my map for really a great
way for basically visualizing thoughts
okay I actually use them when I'm doing
a new presentation I use a mind map to
sort of map out how I'm thinking or when
I have a hard problem so for example I'm
a big getting things done practitioner
so I which is just a Productivity method
and whenever I work on a new project
which might be something and I know
something I'm doing around the house
something at home like right now we're
about to move so moving is a big project
and it also applies to work as well I
usually sit down into a mind map to help
me figure out you know sort of what I'm
thinking about what things I need to
worry about so this is actually my map
component and you and your model can
find all these nodes and how they're
related and then you can also define
sort of the hierarchy so google.com went
into here right
and now I've got these notes I can move
them around and these don't have any
other levels I guess yeah but you gotta
sleek an go levels deeper if you need to
this is a nice way to visualize
different you know elements works well
if you're doing something with
networking etc so here this is a PMI map
component and basically all it's doing
is getting a server-side model on
selection it's calling a listener on
double selected or something different
okay and on complete it will update the
detail so that would be a if I double
click on this I get the node details
here popping up
she doesn't really tell me much but if
it does pop up alright and the model is
gonna be something like this it's
basically a node a node structure that
you have to create and then populate in
that you can provide back to primefaces
the non node select we go back and we
can update the model if necessary okay
so that's the mind map component there's
also panels so you know we've got your
standard accordion panel which is a
pretty standard sort of component to use
something very new is the grid CSS
feature this is actually a parm faces
five feature and so what's popular these
days is responsive design right well
this is also a big question for JSF
developers just like okay I need to make
my my page responsive so it looks good
on mobile devices and I've always JSF
components and they do did a table and
grid table layouts so I'm having some
issues so the basically there's
different ways to do respond to play
outs you can use bootstrap each other
things but form faces also now has its
grid CSS a library so this grid here
basically you can specify how you want
to lay out the different elements
instead of using a table or a panel grip
okay so here you can use ordinary CSS
and HTML and basically based on the CSS
selectors you've chosen you decide that
okay this is a column of size 1 comma
size 2 comma size 3 etc so the CSS
selectors are being used to do the
layout ok this is a way you can do
layout for you know forms or your entire
page and not have to worry too much
about having a table based layout and
have it actually be somewhat responsive
so if I take this screen here and I
shrink it note that it is actually
changing based on the size that I'm
showing here right
so it looks and that's what responsive
really means okay we're starting to roll
out grid CSS support in some of the
other components as well so grid CSS
actually is not a prime Frances
component by itself you can use it
without primefaces
but the some of the layout components
are starting to use grid CSS internally
so if you use like a panel grid I don't
remember which was the first one that
has support but you you can now take
advantage of this feature as well okay
it's also you know standard tab view
component as well and lots and lots of
other stuff I could spend all day doing
demos of all the different components so
I encourage you to check out the the the
showcase okay
I wanna get back to the slides and talk
about some other features since we are a
little short on time so another this is
a new prime basis 5 feature client side
validation so in JSF server-side
validation has always been sort of the
the mainstay right obviously that's not
really always required in a lot of cases
you can get by with client-side
validation you can give your users a
much more rapid response so primefaces
has integrated client-side validation
but they've integrated with the actual
JSF framework right so here you've got
an example of validate client for this
particular component and what this means
is when they click on the button it's
going to validate these fields using
client-side validation okay
this is a really nice feature here's
another example basically you're saying
here we've got a panel and we're saying
inside proves input and text we want it
to be client-side so we're using a
standard JSF validator right it'll still
do the server-side validation right but
it also will do client-side validation
for you if you use P client validator
okay
here's another example inside of an
input control and you also this is
associated with a particular event if
you want to so here we want to do
validation on every keystroke which is
probably a little excessive but we can
do it probably more common to be blur
and here is another example where we're
basically doing validation for the form
okay so what's nice about this framework
is that the messages are fully
integrated so if you have server-side
validators to have messages they're
fully integrated there's a really nice
API for writing custom validators and
client-side validator so you can
actually write your own client-side
validators and you can also of course
write the server-side counterparts right
it also exposes the locale object in
JavaScript so that's important because
you may need to change what you're
displaying based on the locale okay so
this is a really nice new feature that's
in primefaces 5 there's also a bean
validation integration right so how many
people here use bean validation okay so
these a number of people so here's an
example of bean validation which
basically is a way to declaratively
specify the validation constraints for
properties in your model okay bean
validation is not only JSF it's just the
JSF has a good integration with it it's
a really nice part of Java e6 I believe
her I think it came out in 5 so so here
we're saying for this particular object
we want to say this particular property
is not null and the max max length is
dirty okay
so just by doing that you say input text
being a values bean and then it will
basically do things like say okay well
the values 30 okay so so very nice had
that that sort of integration and JSF
this is asked a little bit further than
JSF goes by default so it's nice some
other features in a prime faces 5 talked
about the JavaScript API accessibility
is a big thing ok so this is actually
one thing one of the areas where it's
very nice to have a component suite how
many people have had to worry about
accessibility in their projects it's a
decent number
and you know it can be difficult to make
sure that you actually support
everything needs to be supported and a
lot of what accessibility requires is
basically having a lot of extra
attributes on your in your HTML elements
to make them work with screen readers
and things like that okay and there are
certain standards like 8w ai Aria for
JavaScript widgets there's um I believe
rules they've got what you're supposed
to have in the US and different
countries of other laws so accessibility
is a big thing and primefaces has made a
pretty good effort to provide
accessibility for all of their
components so and that means things like
making sure that you can actually tab to
each component on the page maybe never
just data table things like that and I'm
actually working with primefaces with
one of my clients to do even more
accessibility so I would expect that
they'll become even more accessible in
the next few months it's also a
right-to-left support there is a custom
exception handler which just makes it
easier to handle exceptions there is
also a dialog framework um
so farm faces has you know a normal sort
of dialog component that'll pop up you
can make it modal etc but also on there
is an ability to have sort of define
sort of a flow within a dialog within a
few different steps in a dialog and
there's a nice little framework for
dealing with that as well page
authorization that just means basically
that there's some additional expression
language methods that you can use to say
okay what's the user principle you know
just to provide a little is this user
authorized to do XYZ et cetera so just a
little bit of extra extra help for doing
authorization there's also another
project called primefaces extensions
okay and fine phases extensions is
pretty much it says it's not by the same
makers it's not by prime tech right it's
by another group of developers but they
basically are components to build on top
of prime faces so the general rule that
I follow is that if there's some
component that I need that prime basis
doesn't have I go to prime basis
extensions first
because all their components work very
well with primefaces their time with
their releases they have a few things
that primefaces doesn't have and
sometimes there are things that they do
first and then they end up in prime
basis later so I encourage you to check
that out how many people have used this
product project before secure EOS -
please - never fear okay okay so another
topic is primefaces mobile so primefaces
also has support for mobile devices and
I talked about this earlier Monday Anna
on a minion mobile session but basically
it has a component suite that works well
on mobile devices there's eight core
components there's over 20 primefaces
components supports gestures mobile
navigation etc and the programming model
is exactly the same right you get oh wow
only five minutes left oh she said ten
okay good okay so the usage is the same
they're different components okay so we
have p.m. mobile I'm sorry we have to
say F you render kit equals primefaces
mobile to basically turn on support for
mobile and then you can do things like
specify multiple pages that the users
can move in between so often especially
on a phone you kind of have a few
different small pages so this lets you
sort of specify a few of the small pages
in one XHTML page which is nice and it's
actually supports all these different
devices it has very good support for
different mobile devices and it's boats
on top of jQuery Mobile okay so the core
primefaces components are built on top
of jQuery the standard jQuery low-level
library not on top of jQuery UI okay
they're basically all custom jQuery
plugins part basis mobile though is
really built on top of the existing
purposes of mobile library so if you use
part jQuery Mobile or if you're working
with primefaces mobile you can you know
basically learn a lot by going to both
sites because it's basically the jquery
mobile components wrapped with
primefaces and then with some a few
additional primefaces specific
components okay so I will do a very
quick mobile demo since we're short on
time here all right so this is the iOS
simulator and this is the mobile
showcase and you see here I've got the
little standard menu options so there's
a lot of these standard components like
you know that basic same accordion style
panel right there's you know a data list
style component so you see we're just
listing different elements here ordered
etc so here we've got more of a data
table set up and you see we can should
be able to drill down to these put them
to be working and again all of this is
just again standard JSF it's really
nothing special this actually does use
the P data list component
okay and you know there's tabview panel
where did all this stuff this is an
example of that multi-page so to go to
this to navigation these are different
links so this is actually a page but
it's actually defined in the same XHTML
page right so here we have the APM page
component and we're seeing outcome is PM
: second so this is basically going to
the second page that's defined here so
this is handy way we have a lot of small
pages to sort of define the navigation
between those pages okay of course you
can still put normal links and things
like that in there as well alright so
that is the mobile stuff again the the
whole the mobile site is a good way the
the Showcase is a good place to go to
see more of that
I don't let you fix that
okay so another feature is primefaces
push and this is the ability to push
data from the server to the client so in
this example you see they've got a few
different mobile a few different devices
a couple of them are mobile a couple of
them aren't okay so basically one of
these computers or machines does
something on a page touch the jsf app
jsf app uses the primefaces push API and
then pushes out the result to all these
different devices okay this is a handy
way to sort of automatically update
different pages based on what the server
does and internally this uses atmosphere
how many people have heard of atmosphere
before okay so some of you so atmosphere
is a framework another open-source
framework which basically allows you to
do push but what's nice about it is that
it sort of dynamically decides the best
way to do push depending on the devices
and/or that the software involved okay
so if you're using Chrome
it will probably let's say you're using
Chrome and a latest version of GlassFish
it'll probably do websites right if
you're using an old version of ie and I
don't know an old version of Tomcat
it'll probably do long polling so
basically it tries to pick the best
option based on the server and the
client that you're using okay so the the
basically the result is still the same
you get pushed behavior but it does it
as efficiently as possible depending on
the client you're using
okay so primefaces wraps atmosphere but
has very very good integration they've
worked very close closely with the
atmosphere team so it's not like they're
just bolting something on it's actually
very well integrated they also provide
support for it as well so here's a page
normal JSF form I've got action listener
here and then we're using this special
component here piece sockets so we're
saying on message handle message send
update this channel okay so handle
message here is actually a callback to
actually okay it can be in a call back
but it's not actually here but basically
we're pushing it up to this channel this
is the mapping beam actually this is a
call back on a client I'm sorry but this
is the backing beam so here when you
click on this button it's called kind of
call counter view increment okay and
this is going to use the the prime basis
push API okay so it gets an event bus
and then it publishes to this channel
that value okay so it's basically just
increment increment in the number and
then sending out the data back to this
particular channel and this name here
maps to this name here okay but there
could be different pages with that
channel okay doesn't have to be the same
page and then what's happening on the
server as well so this is the backing
beam right but also what's happening on
the server is this endpoint is actually
being defined okay so here we're saying
this is the endpoint counter so that it
responds that endpoint we're specifying
the JSON encoder so that we can send
Jason back and forth and then what's
happening is it's actually going to send
that count value back whenever on
message is called okay in JavaScript
that's where that handle message is is
sent is is is executed so after the the
data is sent back from the server that's
when this method would be called in here
is just doing some jQuery to update the
client could use parm faces could use
something else
okay so I'll do like a two minute pushed
him over here okay so go back to
showcase here
oops to do I refuse to push cuz this is
that same example right and you see I'm
hitting click here right so if I go to a
completely different browser okay
me
that's really annoying okay
okay that was the problem all right so
if I in this showcase here if we go to
the same showcase
okay so you see I can click here and you
see it's updating there and that's
pretty much the idea is that you're
essentially pushing out that change and
see these browsers don't know anything
about each other but they all subscribe
both those paid to subscribe to the same
channel and I can also do this do this
on the phone as well or any other device
okay of course there's more complicated
examples but she gave you an idea
alright so thinking about out of time I
will wrap up there's also a portlet
support as well using the Liferay faces
for the bridge there's a decent manual
doesn't cover everything with a pretty
good overview of all the features what's
available there are several books on
primefaces as well packet has been
really good about publishing them so
several out there there is a community
forum you can't always guarantee an
answer but there are there's lots of
stuff out there on the forums Stack
Overflow is also a great place to look
first up - it's bundled with NetBeans
which is nice and prime tech the company
behind primefaces to provide support
training and consulting in the US
basically if you need someone on site in
the US or need someone us-based I help
as well but if you just want normal
support our training consulting you can
also talk directly to prime tech as well
alright so that's it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
