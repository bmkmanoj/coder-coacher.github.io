New York City I'm Bob revoir with the
Oracle technology Network and my guest
for this interview as a reservoir man
Reza tell the folks were you working
what'd you do there
I'm a senior architect at the consulting
Dominical kepta consulting we're
national something a company essentially
we do sue pronunce everything in IT I do
mostly Java stuff obviously not
surprisingly so you're speaking on micro
services and vanilla Java EE tell me
about what people are going to hear in
that session those two key messages in
the session number one is that
separating the hyper-reality
of micro services and really thinking
about when do you actually adopt these
and if you do adopt them how do they
actually look like
that's one message and the other message
is if you say it's just to take a more
pragmatic view of micro services the
kind of micro services that most blue
color organizations IT organizations
would adopt what does Java EE have to
offer and in reality actually Java EE
does have quite a bit of work quite a
bit to offer as long as we don't get go
too crazy with the micro services
government so if there's one takeaway
that people who attend your sessions
walk away with with what do you want
that to be it would be micro services
isn't anything outlandishly new that you
don't know about
it's actually just a variant of what we
already I think well know which is
service-oriented architectures as well
as distributed computing now the
abstract your session mentions that Java
developers already know a lot of what
they need to know to work in micro
services in your experience what are the
what are the things that they don't know
what do they still need to learn the
biggest thing that they need to know is
the is nano services as an anti-pattern
in my view that's where the dog mind of
micro services is going a little bit out
of control it it looks at this point in
time that the way the dogma looks like
and the way the sort of the people that
are evangelizing actively evangelizing
micro services look like that looks a
lot like old-school distributed
objects and that's not really very
appropriate for most organizations it's
going to be it's going to wind up being
an anti-pattern for most organizations
really that needs to be scaled back into
something more pragmatic and an
enterprise's can successfully it up and
that's more like old-school it's away if
you will do you have any other speaking
engagements or events that you're going
to be talking at and you're on your
calendar yeah quite a few it's similarly
in the year but I'll certainly be
speaking at a few of more of these
Oracle code things I'm speaking at DC
next week okay potentially be speaking
at a few others over overseas ones and
here stateside as well I'll certainly be
a Java one and probably a few other
European controllers later later in the
year around fall usually great and I'll
be in DC - so you're there if you'd like
to attend an Oracle code event log on to
developer Oracle comm / code for a
complete list of upcoming events there
are 17 more in the cities around the
world where the Oracle technology
Network I'm Bob brew Bart thanks for
watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
