can download database image from the
darker store to Oracle container cloud
service under a minute let's head to the
store and grab Oracle database image on
the darker store after you log in try to
look for Oracle database top of the
search world click on it
get to setup instructions from here
capture image name let's head to the
Oracle container cloud service if you
are familiar with Oracle cloud dashboard
as a customer or you're trying our trial
service you are familiar with this
dashboard get your client a near cloud
service click on container console give
your container credentials here
on the container - were you only have to
do two steps the first one is registries
this one already exists click on the
Edit just to give your darker store
username and password
validate and then save it the next step
is going to the services tab if you are
coming here for the first time you would
want to click on the new service I
already have a service click created so
I'm going to show you what you would see
when you first click on the new service
this is the screen you would see the
service name you can give anything that
is descriptive enough for you next
scheduler and availability pick the top
one on the drop-down image name this is
what we got from the darker store copy
that one and on the environment
variables I'm gonna leave most of them
default today for the demo but if you
prefer you can create a database s ID
domain name and password something that
you can remember versus the defaults
next to the port numbers the one that
you need is 1521 you would want to click
here add 1521 for the host port as well
as a container port protocol you pick
the TCP here and save it when you save
it it's gonna look like this once you
have this new service entry created just
click the deploy under one minute you
will have your database deployed onto
Oracle container cloud service you see
the status go from stopped to running
that's all it takes for you to deploy
database in a container let's go to the
deployments we have two of them running
here the one we just deployed minute
back this concludes the demo of
downloading the image from the store to
container cloud service now that we
downloaded database image from the store
to Oracle container clouds that we
successfully I'm going to show one use
case of for how we can use the database
installed let's go to the SQL developer
running
your laptop connect to the database
running on OCC s connection name that
I'm using any connection name I'm trying
to use the SIS password default password
i'm using ora dark underscore DB 1 and
then role I needed to use 60 be a host
name I can show you where we can get
this IP address this is a IP address of
your database running on a container
on the port name to connect is 1521 si D
can be nothing and service name Oracle
PDB one dot local domain and save the
configuration test it it is success that
means you are able to connect to your
SQL Developer running on your laptop to
the database running on the container
cloud service this concludes the demo if
you have any questions leave them below
