have you all here to talk with a tour
session which is go reacting with vertex
in or a complication container clouds so
it's just one of the possibilities are
going to talk mainly about vertex and
vertically that's so flexible in a
framework or application or took it you
can run it anywhere on premise in any
kind of clouds including Oracle cloud so
I'm at cienaga I'm a director of
developer experience at Red Hat i'm also
a java champion and a macro solomon be
and to present the session with me i
have here today my great friends
brazilian to other ignite of each and i
hope i have said his name right for the
first time he's also a senior software
engineer at red hats he is also part of
the program committee of qcom san paolo
so i hope you can deliver it with some
great content for you today i always
like to start my talks with this
sentence from forbes now every company
is a software company i used to say that
people you don't work for an industry
you work for a software company you
don't work for a bank you work for a
software company we live in a different
word we different we're leaving a
different economy so in this digital
economy does have today we have some
different things happening and some of
the examples that we have today is that
the largest car transportation company
in the world owns no cars which is uber
the largest lodging company in the world
owes no real stage which is Airbnb the
largest online retailer in the world
owns no stock which is Ali Baba the
largest content network in the world
produces no content which is facebook
all of these companies have something
common is that all of these companies
only exists because of software so
software changes the world and we here
as software developers particularly Java
and most of us enterprise developers
I'll i also like to introduce myself as
a software pressman and the best
definition that I have of the sort of
craftsmen is that someone that cares
about his job of her job and I care
about what they do what I do because I
know that we can change people's lives
for the better with softer we can also
make them miserable but I prefer to be
to to have a choice I me to do the right
choice to make people
life's better and we can always create
better and crafts better software that's
why we're all here today and for that
we've been discussing a lot in the last
a couple of years a couple of months
about DevOps and micro services and now
reactive programming you're also a hot
tub to discussing today because we're
talking about distributed systems
message buses scalability portability
and everything else but so reactive
programming something that every
developer is looking for maybe I should
start to try some reactive programming
to craft better applications to support
the new kind of applications that we
have here today and a very interesting
option for using reactive programming in
creating reactive vacations use vertex
which is a clips of foundation project
and we have a lot of red hat engineers
working on that relics have has evolved
a lot in the past few years so we
strongly believe that vertex is the
right platform for delivering this
reactive application that we have today
but we're not just going to tell you
that I hope you will be able to convince
you that because we can have a very cool
Dima to show you yeah and if you think
about just wanting to learn here about
vertex is the first thing is what is
vertex is five important points first
vertex is application for platform it's
a general in the general way you can
create your business your web and you
know in video games your mobile software
your financial systems and in a way
there is agnostic you see in that top
that you can write your applications and
a whole lot young a lot of language in a
lot of platforms and take the advantage
of each one and also that's why we are
here vertex runs in JVM so I'm a Java
fan fan and that is a real important
thing to meet you have these
kind of support that we've seen that dog
in vertex and also vertex is viewed in a
synchronous API at the par and why today
that's so important you have to wait a
few minutes but we show that in the demo
how you can we can transform your
application with the synchronous api's
and also vertex a pole is poly blood you
can write vertex in Java JavaScript
ceylon in vitam and Ruby in a lot of
language using the same developed model
and also for me is the most important
one is that vertex is really simple it's
simple but not simplistic in a way that
can we can write better software in a
cleaner way but without removing the
power for the developers I think that
the first opinion that people have about
reactive programming maybe this is a
back-end thing because people are saying
about distributed systems but vertices
are so flexible to that you can use to
develop applications you can do web
applications you can do back end
applications you can integrate with a
lot of different stuff so you can use
verdicts for almost anything that you do
your thinking about and we're going to
show you a demo of some very common user
case that you look that you can use
verdicts to solve so don't thinking only
about distributed applications are back
and applications because vertex can be
applying a lot of different scenarios
and also that we have to be clear why
did is the reasons you use vertex the
first one is you can create as a red
said your general apps and solve similar
problems that you sold with nodejs with
a kaka and we'd play but i think is a
better way why because vertex has a
great set of car AP is like tcp ssl new
client and server you show that also
HTTP https support in web sockets are
great event bus api fail system file
system API and all that quality is at
one-hundred percent
sorry about that all that API is our one
sorry all that FBI's are one hundred
percent of sync and so that's me no
blocking in any way but you can also
have your own API is blocking it without
special vertex vertex file and what do
you see that would so you're telling us
that even though their texts are
reactive application platform you can
also use the existing Java libraries
that most of them block in and you can
integrate in the work correctly yeah for
sure you will see that in for some
minutes but we can talk a lot about that
but as a developer I always want to see
some code so we try and we have to pray
with me to the demo goes because you a
lot of moving parts here so the first
one is the hello word for vertex what
I'm trying to build here is to show how
to create sorry thank you here we go how
to how to build a simple HTTP server
using vertex in the line 22 you can see
I create and listed in the part it
should be part then I created 15 of a
take a vertex instance then i create a
HTTP server and i add a sink request
handler that's the base for the vertex
AP is always handlers in a sink way then
when i receive a request i build a
response calling the hello world vertex
so it's almost 10 lines to create a full
HP server Iberian rear realm here 10
language could be doing that into okay
yeah and different land other vertex can
generate a fetcher for you to run your
application since everybody seems to
like fetch our today but I like other
options like drop wizard spring boot and
what flash swarm where the fetch our can
be a bit fat yeah like consuming like
hundreds of megabytes the vertex is a
very very very time generates a very
very tiny I don't know if we could
even call that fetch our because that's
a ginger that's a very small jar for
generating like a rest endpoints so it's
a full web server in just some lines of
code that come back to the presentation
the next why to use vertex is you have
to understand what is the vertical a
vertical is the security unit of vertex
you can see how a vertical work here in
a Java but you can write your vertical
in Java JavaScript Ruby Ruby and usually
your peak lay your application will be
composed with a lot of verticals so you
have a lot of small vertical small units
of code running in the vertex
environment and providing is isolation
you are you have no shared state between
the verticals that's one of the most
important part of the platform so you
have conquerors for free and in order to
to bring our vertical
my next helward here here you can see a
vertical to create a veteran java you
have to extend the abstract vector and
here we are showing out other feature
that vertex you have the eventbus you
know that part here that i show you is
just to create a a cow each second and
publish in the edict bus in which Q the
Q hello bus and public this message
hello word from Java here I consume the
same event bus in a Dakota the club it
away and do I made a system log for that
event bus because we are creating not
our main applications you are creating
vertex we have to run that with vertex
sorry
wrong folder hmm wrong further just a
second all that coats in is on the
github my github account we can check
the code in just like 10 or 15 lines of
code that's because we're doing a lot of
carriage returns there you have a
distributed message bus you're published
into a message queue and reading for the
queue in just a very small and slim jar
not a charm or very small slim jar that
you can run or you can even run by the
the command line in yard to run in
command line of vertical you do vertical
run the name of your vertical we will
start to publish mash it message and
receive message these I gid here is just
to using the next example is our handle
number to show vertex in the cluster
away so it doesn't pay a ticket too much
on that from that point but you can see
how the the verticals works and that's
really nice because I can make small
units of code in a simple way and have
the threat model for free
all the important thing about vertex is
that vertex implement our threading
model calling reactor pattern for
someone who knows how long the GS works
nodejs implements a kind of same pattern
but you have a thread loop I haven't
loop inside a cord of a processor but
just one thread and you are switching
the verticals in case of vertex to be
executed but the issue is with no Jas
with only can use one processor that
time frame with each which is with each
instance but with vertex we implement a
different reactor pattern we call it
mucci reactor packed a pattern that when
you run over text for each car of your
machine it creates an event loop in our
event loop are connected so you can use
your hardware in a better way than know
Jas and makes application more scalable
ok let me try to explain you how this
works using a very common API that we
were most of us at least I used to like
the servlet API when you have a servlet
to create a servlet we just extend HTTP
servlet so we have this configuration
the request method anything else so the
traditional application model it just
instantiates a large pool of threads it
doesn't matter how many cords you have a
processing you just substantiates a
large pool traps and you just keep
recycling the request between these
threads to reach you're single you're
single servlet instance in your
application server so usually the state
that you have to run your applications
inside your your stack okay so each one
of these texts is a separate thread so
you know you don't have it you don't
have the shared state between the each
one of the request but since we have a
lot of different threads trying to
accessing just a small amount of cars of
course you have context switching
everything else vertex is a different
approach for scalability that's why it
scales much more much better so you have
like you can configure your
you're running instance to have like I
want to consume four verticals each one
of them is going to run in like four
different instance running different
course so each one of them has its own a
synchronous threading model for process
the request and that's one of the
reasons why vertex or prefer Matic it
performs much better than a traditional
thread model using it in application
service and you think about how that
works we already told that everything in
vertex is that they are synchronous but
we are not a leading goal although the
synchronous library that we are having
had in Java like GD bc and other stuff
or for instance to write a file in that
kind of stuff vertex you can create we
have the regular they are sync the
verticals that runs in there having to
look over to loop threading model but if
you want to block this is the with a
blocking API you can create a special
vertical call it work vert worker
vertical that work vertical vertical
runs in two separate isolated threat so
you don't have to block your thread
model in the vertex ap is yeah comparing
using the examples again is like you can
you use a motor reactor thread model
using verticals in vertex but for using
this legacy api's which are blocking you
can use the traditional threaten model
what you have a very when you very have
a pool and is each of these threads are
recycling and executing the blocking
code and also we have other cool feature
of vertex in my opinion that's one of
the best ones is the ulti scaling I will
show you the demo that's the best way to
show how that works
let's find the right directory here you
see the same kind of hello world that we
did in Java but writing a vertical
improve JavaScript see that the message
handle here and the heck rest for the
adat or a DAT part so the best part for
me is that you write the same code in
Java in almost the same code in
JavaScript because you are following the
same vertical programming model so if
anybody likes the pain of programming in
JavaScript it doesn't have to run to
know Jas you can do that inverter yes
for sure and especially to use the best
tool for the best job you see in the
demo for that some use cases even better
to use javascript and you have to open
the option to that but the fun part that
the fun part for me our vertex to run if
I want to run the this button putting on
bigger if I want to run the JavaScript
code to create HTTP server it will be
the same how to do it with Java but if I
want to scale that I put instance and
for that will you create for instance of
my vertical running in my machine and
when an eye open and my coats here I see
hello world my same hello world and with
our random number there but if I open
that Firefox I do the same hello world I
receive other number you know why it oh
that's a good question why this happens
because the vertex instance make
load-balancing should be for free for
you each request is reaching one
vertical and you are have auto scaling
that's really good for micro servers for
instance when you are in a high traffic
day you can run more verticals and put
connect everything together auto
balancing so you have a slim jar that
can run anywhere using the JVM you have
a distributed cluster you have a message
bus you have an HTTP server that it gets
you scaling now to balance it for free
in just as line of code is exactly
and talking about the distributed a
event bus of the vertex is one of the
best parts also sui debit bus firm is
amazing because you can have the effort
to bust us just in our machine you can
have a yard able to buzz distributed as
your room is showing the demo here in
the same machine but in different JVMs
with the JVM space you imagine each
other and also you can have distributed
in a lot of machines in the network
because vertex can connect in a cluster
the way all the machines and past events
and machines I will show that how to do
that just have to find the right
director again
if you remember that is all last code
for the vertical I run the same code in
a cluster the way how I do that vertex
run hello world verticality java Nino's
Nino's cluster that will you start a
cluster of vertex are you copy the code
here see easter is passing message with
the same ID not idea handle it not rboyd
just for the demo and is the same
because it's just one machine when i
create the red director other machine
other Jade not is the same I mean the
same machine but in the different JPM I
will start to run the code connecting
the cluster and then this machine is the
15 they will start to exchange message
and pass the message to the JVM that's
really cool for me you can create
closers even in different machines and
have we are distributed a bit buzzed
when you have two different process two
different JVM they're exchanging message
for metro bus but you didn't configure
anything how did they find I have to do
to manage me a dash dash cluster that's
everything okay for sure you can expand
that configuration because by default
user has a cast but you can use other
closer provider Les Deux keeper and
other kind of stuff there was a lot of
implementation you can choose but what
by the file you are using here the day
has 0 cast but the cluster goes beyond
of what is show here because I can
extend the cluster to my browser how can
i do that i can create a vertex a
vertical that can run a bridge from my
vertical to a javascript browser and
that's really cool to make rio app in
rio wrote a real-time applications for
instance for a game of our financial to
see stocks because I event passing nut
cluster through the JVMs can be
transported from a browser and I can see
that in a real time you have to wait to
see that happen when you do that not the
Emma because if you stop here we don't
have
time to show everything let's go to the
demo yes please little water that's the
base architektur e for our demo is a
little big and absol told me to put that
picture at first at the right is right
you can see a lot of leg assistance that
you want to integrate for instance in a
scenario of a migration of data and that
that legacy season to be consumed it and
being really use vertex to create a REST
API in Oracle cloud okay then that I'll
you create use vertex to create a rest
client to communicate to that systems
and then reboot that message inside our
cluster everything I left in the left
side it will be a one big cluster of
vertex that will you have some processor
to the routine some out dating some
breed for Jas and a bridge for a log
okay let's do that yeah so first part
and we're going to I'm going to check my
coat here okay
we just created a rest endpoint using
verdicts so for the sake of this demo
it's not connecting to any legacy
systems but just to show that you can
you could do 0 your connectors here to
connect to a legacy application and
creating publish your own rest with JSON
endpoints here we are just creating some
random data yeah it's just a bunch of
numbers and strings in the file so that
we can publish anything in the boy
somewhere maybe in the rope account so
we have this application going to get
here
rest api if you get to see the pawn dot
XML it's not we just configure that
generate a fetch are we just use it some
tweaking in the Navy impound examiner to
create a man class if we package that
you can get the dependencies if I get to
see my drawer you get to see the review
you have now two jars the traditional
jar and the factor that we created here
just to check the size you're going to
have I have a fat jar we only 14
megabyte to deploy everything that we
were providing and for the deployment
parts I got to show you the application
container clouds particularly we want to
deploy everything these days in
containers so I want to show you the
Oracle approach for the plane
applications in their cloud basically we
have a lot of different services this is
the main pane of the Oracle application
container cloud you have a different set
of data centers it shows i have chosen
one previously i also have the point
some applications here that we're going
to use later in fact would like to thank
our engineer for helping me to set up
the this environment we had some issues
but they're evolving fast because it's
getting program corrected fast too but
for the approach the deployment model
we're talking about applique oracle
application container clouds but we're
not building container the traditional
way that we think because everybody is
talking about docker and everything else
mostly likely Oracle is using docker
inside the container cloud but for us
for the developer experience for
creating a container it's much different
from what we used to because the
packaging and the base images they're
provided already by Oracle so we don't
have to create our base me image which
is a good and also a bad thing because
we lose the flexibility we can only use
the provided images which is the case of
Java we have Java 7 and Java 8 as the
default environment for choice and how
do we choose our base image as
as we would in a darker image we have
just a JSON file with the manifest Jason
Jason I can only choose the major of a
show that I want to use seven or eight
virtues in Java 8 around that and the
only thing that I can configure to is
the comment that I want to run to run my
my image so we have to Java that jar my
fat jar and some properties that are
going to use in our rest endpoints so
that's the only configuration available
because all of the other properties are
just like nodes release version
everything else but for the for the
concept of creating an image of a
container to be run of the cloud that's
all of the parameters that we need to
configure so having of that we don't
have a two to build that so the standard
packaging format it's a zip file or a
tar file so we have to just create a sip
file which contains the manifest Jays
are in the root and everything else we
have to package inside the zip file in
our case we're using a fat charm so
we're going to just put the fat jar but
if you we could be using like an
application server but it would have to
be packaged every time and again using a
zip container so I'm going to zip
example dots if my manifest and my jar
the fetch are one with the zip file also
the only option that I have to create
application I have to go for the
interface gratification oops great
application
it's okay i choose java you can load no
Jas and PHP you know bad life choices
and you just have to wait and for my
experiencing test in the oracle
application container cloud performance
see fluctuates between the days in the
weeks and i guess that all of the Oracle
guys at work on work must be diamond ed
doing demos with that that's why it's
taken a lot of time they have two cells
home and you get example and you have a
simple application a default one which
is an HTTP application you can use a
storage path which is something that I
haven't tried because it's too much work
you don't have a CLI for oracle
application container cloud so i have to
use curve to update a file to the Orca
storage and then it doesn't i have to
provide the path inside of storage to
deploy an application I thought it was
too much work so it just chose to upload
directly here for the web interface I
choose the file example and create and
that's the part that usually in 228 it
can take like 15 seconds to 30 minutes
at least today so we're not trying to
we're not going to wait for the
deployments to run successfully we're
just going to use the tube privilege
deployed and points that I've deployed
with the point like half an hour ago
let me try here okay I'll set and now
you have a red butte vertex or that the
right side the rest at the point that
integrates a lot of systems and can
image how much season anyone and
integrating our Linda that single rest
ending point then our next task will be
create a rest client that connect in
that end rest endpoint and then
transform each type of customer that we
are being generated by our legacy
systems to a message in nervous the name
of the message will be system dot
process dot in let's do that here is
what we do we create a period kitchen
yeah very well you use the periodic
function in vertex just to pull both the
Jamaica cool in the rest api is in a
different time just to show in the demo
that we are connecting a lot of
different systems and then you get the
data from their rest of the ice we use
here the gap now the ICP that receive
their the full response but if you want
to improve that you can use observables
because vertex already support jacks and
eric's java and then we process that
data how we process that data that is a
debug in your test apply and then for
each JSON that are receiving here i
create a new message in my system dot
process dot in that will you put the
vertex team at the json that are taken
from the legacy systems inside my vertex
let me inside my distributed bus let's
bring that the debug we have put that
like half an hour ago because we were
the point in the lower complication
container container cloud and we were
testing application but the end for each
container that to the point or content
application cloud it exposes a port
which in this case an HTTP port but if
you expose through HTTP they
automatically
upgrade that to HBS connection that's
why we were only testing where HTTP you
know develop and production things
issues so is it that's HTTPS it wasn't
working that's why we have to configure
HTTPS in vertex which is very simple to
because we just had to create an object
with the parameters say that's SSL
enabled and it just works and now we are
consuming the api's and creating the
rest the message inside the distributed
event was one important point is that I
already told you is everything now left
to be in a closer way so when we follow
with it we fire event inside the bus
with a JSON from the costume in the
system thought process that include
everything that will be globally
connected in the same cluster we receive
that message our first task will be to
rate a processor vertical what that
process of vertical does they till you
take for each legacy system we will have
one at the SF separate q why because
it's important to have these squeals
after you have the ability to consume
for each server a different event so we
take a big system process in event and
split that event and three new views 1q
for each server let's do that practical
how I do that that's important part are
you run as our cluster vertical because
I can ruin that in the main or you can
make a abstract vector here vertical
here and run in command line and what we
do we consume the system process dot in
May aquiel and then for each server we
take the system from the JSON because we
put in our other parameter in the gist
of our customer the system that they are
connected and we create a bus in the
dynamic way you see because while you do
that when you put a new system in there
in the right side and you a new Legacy
sees that we went integrate will you
create dynamically Anubis in that way
you can extract and can use a lot of
things let's run that so I can see in
the code that basically this process
server go it just gets some messages
from the input queue it just checks the
source of the of the message and
distribute leads to another Q that's
kind of I don't know maybe it's too much
for a vertical to last it couldn't get
that be done in the the rest client
murder one yeah that's a good question
right so but is that really reason that
I love that kind of approach for
programming that vertex vertex follows
you can write your verticals just to do
one thing you know when you do one thing
well for instance you have one vertical
to consume their stp eyes and create the
first message and we have another
vertical depth earth takes the message
and split and different crews and why is
the reason for that if he in a real
world with macro service if you are for
it will have to be very falling in a
high traffic day for instance you are
selling a lot of stuff you can run more
from your verticals to connect in that
in that that is a booted cluster and you
can for instance you have this diesel
becomes low you can create 10 more
verticals as you
in the process a HTTP you can create
more and scale in an insulated way and
in my opinion when you can create
microcircuitry microservices really
small and just doing one thing well you
have the ability to scale up or scale it
down Rebecca service and that's why I
put just one thing to do and wanting to
do right in which word so it seems that
some concepts that we have in the
software development board just gets
just keeps gets recycled so you're
basically telling me that the single
responsibility principle from clean code
applies also to reactive programming
where they also for me to my preserves
in my opinion because in that way you
have the free to do whatever you want
and scale how you want your micro serves
in case any of you are aware of
enterprise integration patterns we just
implemented the Cinco router in this
process process of variable the next job
that we have you have to write out its
vertical because some customer comes it
was and say on some server there is
someone that probably hacking are
stealing some stuff you want to log that
thing that will be the real reason
because we will create that router to
split let's create an audit vertical
that list and for so many events from
some verticals and you can process that
data that is really easy let's create an
open a new one everything still running
what is the main purpose of our of our
audit vertical will connect in the
cluster and then we receive a message
from sister one you know when we receive
a matching for system one we can do some
processing for instance putting under
the database or five some alarms or do a
lot of kind of stuff let's run that you
see everything plugged in a dynamic way
I run my auditing here and you start to
listen for system one and system two
events see and what is the best part of
using that programmer model in a
clustered way if I finish my my my
auditing process or I already have a lot
of sample data and is enough for me to
process I just come here and stop the
vertical off or if I want to scale up to
create more verticals in order to make
more more audit I can create more
verticals and build a lot of kind of
stuff yeah that's sorry right when the
queue is the integration point between
your verticals you allow the your
architecture to be really logical
loosely coupled instead so you have a
high cohesion lose a loosely coupled
software and as much easier for you to
integrate new stuff or to remove the
things there's just like I understand
everything is the couple that you can
upload your micro servers and pollute
your stuff in a way that you want and
scale everything the best part for me i
will show you right now is how i can use
ajs breach from vertex in order to send
the events to a javascript we will
create a new Jes bridge vertical that we
take our events and put in JavaScript
what I do here this is create a HTTP
server I go render the cluster vertex
and come here and see I create I HTTP
server and in in part 9001 ok then I
will put on looting I will create this
halt for the assets because vertex can
also provide you a way to share and to
have static assets inside your HTTP
server are you just serve in that file
in the index.html file they have a deep
deep fur logs will use that in some
minutes and one pattern the other
important thing here is that I create
our route for the event bus that event
bus will be the WebSocket that the
browser will connect to my distributed
buzz for the vertex and other important
part is here in order to use and consume
the masses in JavaScript I have to add
the outbound and the permitted quiz that
will be exported in that web socket
vertex does that to make the web more
secure you know because we are not in on
same server and you what don't want to
share everything that that ever message
that pass inside you are you are closer
for the shower screen so in the back end
where you have supposedly secure
environments you have everything allow
it and when you go to the web using Java
to particularly maybe you have to allow
each one of the cues to be exposed yes
let's run that let me see where I am
that well thatÃ­s SSH is just I roamed
the fetcher and when I go to the here
let me open for you fjs I consume the i
connect to the avett bus ok and then
consume the cubes here in the same way
that I did in Java for each message
insisting that one I add in app total
and draw a sharp let's say so the same
events that we're producing the back end
using Java your are you telling me that
they are being consumed in messages are
being exchanged in javascript is
actually that's weird let's see if that
works did you run that
I'm gonna here let me try
tension moments yeah
me
is the program yes just a second a
traditional
x
just you have to check
as we said lots of moving parts we have
like four or five things running at the
same time and just Chucky fur or is the
consumer thank you
do
right
people and now thank you I was running
the wrong example here what has happened
I taking the message that i received an
in the distributed cluster from the
vertex parting that in the bridge for
javascript and and just counting in
using google char em developer not a wax
guy and that graph is horrible you see
the x-axis is increasing for instance
now is 60 and 65 but i can count it's it
out of scales it's a future ESL teachers
my gratis que ref here is the number of
the message that I'm receiving the
server one and number of the message
that resilience a virtue and the total
of the message so what's the great part
of that theme that part of demo I take
in the right a lot of legacy systems
integrate that into the club could a
group of the way I can put any time any
number of the service that I want and
then i create a REST API then a creator
with vertex a client to rest api in a
cluster and then I start to consume
everything I create a lot of message and
created distributed bus for that that
Fermi is awesome because the same
message direct path to the cluster can
be consumed in JavaScript and the last
one is a polyglot thing my my my my boss
told me that you they want to log some
vertical you know I read create the
message and I want to log the message in
the MongoDB the best to at least my
opinion to connect in multi be is
JavaScript so vertical a vertex let me
why javascript in hi mom would they be
in particular use case because the
random point is poison Jason which is
basically JavaScript you're consuming
and processing the messages in the back
end also in JavaScript so I mean
particularly in this case makes sense so
why can we use the same data model in
the whole stack so we also storing this
log messages in JavaScript using what
would it be but the main point is as
vertex is polyglot I can consume in the
best way that I can have you know
the best tool for the best job and have
integrated environment so I used a model
that is a plug-in for vertex that
consuming Mongo clients and you see when
adjusted javascript is the same API of
the eventbus that I you connect in
system dot process that in a quill and
then save the message in the MongoDB
okay and I'm seeing JavaScript again I
can see a pattern do you like JavaScript
ah little just for some it's something
my dirty secret and let's run that the
same thing the same way to run vertex
run mogo bridge duck cluster it and then
that's the Oracle cloud okay see they
started to consume the same message and
start to save in the MongoDB in a
polyglot away so I can have a lot of
different way to consume mass message my
main point here with that demo and with
ads on is to show you that with vertex
you can plug in and plug out a lot of
stuff inside of our bus when you
transform your data in your Jason's in
message you can be creative and
innovative to create to navigate to a
lot of possibilities in a lot of
platforms so that's what I had to talk
about verdicts so we I hope we had we
have given you a very introductory
session about vertex how you can deploy
that easily in many different clouds
including the Oracle application
container cloud I also hope we have
provided some of the concepts of the
deployment between the Oracle container
application clouds we expect that to
evolve mainly because some of the tools
they are not optimal for development and
nor deployment and if you if you are
interested in vertex we recommend you to
check some very good sessions they're
going to have this week at javaone so
we're very lucky to be here today at the
first day because the rest of the week
you'll be able to check some sessions
like reactive micro several vertex with
bird and Thursday you're going to have
also a hands-on lab in a session by
Clemmie on wednesday in thursday so we
have some very good experts of redhead
providing some great sessions about
words in the last week and i hope you
can all join that and also we have to
talk about a macro profile i don't know
how many of you have passed in the booth
or departing the expo today but you
might have seen some very cool t-shirts
of talking about micro profile
microfiber has been launched and very
recently so that's something that
everybody must be talking about since
we're talking about java ee have you
seen the keynote yesterday so that's one
of the reasons you might really want to
check the macro profile sessions
microfiber presenters and you get by the
red
boof and get a folder and you get like
four stamps you'll be able to get one of
the very cool map of fire goodies that
are being distributed there I got mine
already so how are we to get yours and
some nice shirts and I also like to say
that not only vertex but we have we at
Red Hat we're creating a story around
DevOps and micro services and call
computing and best coding practices and
everything else reactive programming in
the also on one of these topics and
we're publishing a lot of tongue or
contents at developers redhead com we
also have made all our software stack
available for free for development at
the site you only have to rest earth at
and if you want to provide us some
valuable feedback our Twitter handles
are either I GN and at y anagha so feel
free to to come and talk to us because
we would we would love your input about
about our session about our content and
that's all that we have to show you
today and thank you very much for now
and we might have some minutes for
questions if anybody has any questions
we're available
ok
okay I'll just repeat the question so
it's being streamed live so the people
can hear at home so basically he say his
me work working with where to go for two
years yeah okay so you have an
architecture where you expose the rest
endpoint but you have a lot of different
data sources that you need to deal with
to create your your arrest response so
now so now you have a vertical and we
were talking about the single
responsibility principle so we said that
maybe it's a good prayer to split the
logic of each one of these pieces
instead I have just one big vertigo we
still believe it's true but then you
have a deployment issue if you just keep
one of this instead of just exploring a
huge eight point if we provide that one
at the point for which a lot of things
you can't bind HTTP celery one of this
each one of the sports then it generates
a DevOps problem because people don't
want to multiple ports being having to
be managing everything else ok so that's
a question and one of the answers for
that maybe each one of these endpoints
could be a micro services we're talking
about microservices so there's no reason
that they could be they are required to
be in the same jar it could be each one
of each it's each own artifacts so it
could be the point independently so your
Philip line depending in just one house
container you have the problem of the
ports so maybe you have to create like
multiple bindings and expose that this
service works on these services works on
that which if you do by hand can be very
too much work for for being done that's
one of the reasons the ops guy might
complain and they might be right too
because maybe that's not the reason one
of the things that you can do instead of
integrating all of this logic using rest
you could use it be using the vertex of
event bus for exchanging this kind of
information because HTTP in this case is
just one of the protocols that you could
be using to exchange information so you
could be using the vertex event bus for
that too that's why the point but then
you're incurring
that stability system synchronous
communication then you might want to dig
into the world of eventual consistency
nothing else which has this was this
whole set of problems and solutions to
so just pick your poison and but if you
want to manage automatically these
multiple artifacts in production
environment we have to without having to
manage the sports one of the things that
I could recommend is that instead of
having multiple moving parts we expose
it to outside you just create an API
gateway it can aggregate all of the
information behind for you to not have
much trouble aggregate engine generating
the ports everything else if you're
using containers you could be using a
platform as a service layer of course we
recommend openshift for you because runs
on top of Cooper need ease and you get
all of that for free yeah i'm not saying
because of a shift is red hats project
and product but because Cooper d C's
openshift runs on top of communities
lots if not of many or all of these
problems that we describe the managing
artifacts and ports and routes and
everything else they are already served
on Cooper nidhi's and possibly in other
container expression platforms in the
markets so maybe the path to solve these
problems instead of doing all of this
infrastructure by hand is to just create
a pic one we recommend coburn it is okay
to be running on your infrastructure
yes yes the comment is to resuming just
a compact version of what it says it is
to create a new vertigo which would be
an API gateway then aggregating the
different of their sources using the
event bus yes yes perfect we'll come
back we'll come back we will convict
recommends Cooper is yes because Cooper
nice can orchestrate any kind of
artifacts then what is running inside
doesn't matter to Cuba nearest as long
as it's exposing or doing something so
it's a perfect match for verax tune
okay the question is why we should be
using vertex because we have different
the question is what is the special
about reactive and what's the difference
between being non reactive on a vertex
point of view let's try this one no
vertex implement it is a kind of
controversy where exactly is reactive
programming some some in some place you
call reactive just I event and tribute
event in that kind of architecture that
you are right here but also that other a
point of view for the reactive when you
use of observables when use promise with
friends with or rx job we don't show
that here in our demo but vertex also
support Clementine ethics is a
conversion 30 the RX java yeah we have
it you can have observables and instead
of doing the the foods we call and
receive the response you can connect the
observables and then take that result of
def observables and putting the event
bus so you can it's your type of
question is why if i got the correct why
is reactive depends on the point of view
for some I outers that what we show that
with the event in its tribute event bus
where you can connect a big system is a
reactive but also for other guys that we
have to have observables and programming
that programming model and also vertex
support in which reacts yes ok I'll
answer that question to using a
developer point of view instead of a
computer science point of view of
distributors in San point of view since
we're one of the things one of the ways
they can see reactive programming is
like I like to say that you're doing
callback basis programming you just
passing a comeback that will be in
buckets when something happens it may
sound weird these days because we've
been using Java EE which dissolve
synchronous for many
years but you get back to the roots I
don't know how many how many of you are
old or young as much as me okay but we
use in the past programming different
programming language which were
interface desktop interface basis so
everything was called back programming
because you were just creating handlers
to be vocal doing something happen and
you never knew that we just you know a
software development the usually the
concepts are very psychical because you
always keep going back and forth and now
we're getting back to call base call
back basic programming because of
different requirements and now these
requirements that blocking operations on
this with this huge amount of requests
that we have today are not enough we
need a way to scale better our resources
so using a synchronous programming which
is harder than synchronous programming I
won't lie to that about that a sequence
programming is harder than that but we
need some parts at least of our software
to be written in a reactive way so we
can handle at least this huge amount of
requests so if we'll have to say why any
developer should be using reactive
programming and verdicts not because
it's cool but there are some kinds of
workloads that the only reasonable way
of solving that problem is with reactive
programming without paying too much to
your cloud provider okay then we are out
of time but feel free to talk to us here
and we have a lot of vertex experts here
clÃ©mence included is the one of the
guys that does the make the thing work
so thank you very much effect very much
my brother was watching live hope have
enjoyed thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
