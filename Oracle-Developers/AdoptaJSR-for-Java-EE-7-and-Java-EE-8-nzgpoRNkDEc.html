adopt a JSR for Java EE we're going to
have four speakers today talking about
adopted jsr for Java EE and the JCP has
been around for quite some time we're
celebrating 15 years so it's been a
little bit of a celebration this year at
javaone so hopefully some of you had a
chance to come to our party last night
if you didn't have a chance we're going
to have a little mixer for specifically
for adopt a JSR participants tomorrow
before the concert the appreciation
event at Treasure Island so you can come
up and see me if you're interested in
coming and i'll give you the details can
continue to celebrate with us the 15
years so i wanted to introduce our
speakers today and i'll go ahead and
start with Ed Burns I just let him
introduce himself you can either come up
here or for ya hello my name is Ed Burns
and I'm very happy to be involved in JCP
for not quite 15 years but at least 10
and my involvement in JCP is primarily
with the javaserver faces specification
but I've been on the expert groups for a
number of other technologies portlet and
being validation and a few of the ones
that went south such as jess are 273
design-time metadata for javabeans
components one of those ones that fell
by the wayside but you know you win some
you lose some and you stick it the game
and eventually you'll get some good
results and I that's the moral of the
story for adopt a JSR you have to be
persistent with it if you just tuned in
and then lose focus then that doesn't
benefit anyone so we'll get more into
that okay our next speaker on the slide
I'll go in that order we have resin oh
hi I guess I'm officially now a
evangelist at Oracle Corporation for
java en los fish I've been in the stro
forever about a couple of years but I'm
not mostly not a newcomer to job IE and
not a newcomer to the JCP either i
actually was an observer for java e5 and
ejb 30 I was an expert member for ejb3
one
and as well as Java EE 6 and I was an
easy member for JMS 2.2 ejb3 to and java
ee 7 so it's been quite an interesting
experience with the JCP I'm certainly
very proud to doubt it and I hope more
of you will will get involved in the
same way that I did many years ago
thanks Rosa we have Mohammed come on hi
my name is Mohammed Amin actually I'm
very happy to be part of this adopt ESL
program and gcp in general i have just
get involved from two years ago and i
worked a lot with heather and the JCP
community and the great community with
radha I was Ed and I have been promoted
a lot of stuff I'm AC member now
representing Morocco Jack and I'm on
board of ed Jack because I'm Egyptian
I'm not Moroccan because it's a little
bit confusing for people I'm
self-employed I'm sorry I employed for
companies called a finance and the
systems architect and design supervisor
responsible for the architecture of the
applications and mainly java
applications therefore you'll find most
of the application we are using java ee
7 java is a java core java is a most of
the Java Sea branches and I'm very happy
happy to participate ended up GSR
because I get a lot of information a lot
of Technology awareness and I'm going to
share this experience with you and
presentation yes Thank You small hamid
and i'm heather van Kira and I work in
the JCP program office I lead a small
team of people that keep the JCP running
and interface with the community I'm one
of the leaders in the dr j our program
it's a Java user group based program and
I help to facilitate that program with
the javi's or group leaders as well as
the JCP participants that are members
and part of the expert groups so today
I'm going to talk a little bit about an
overview of adopted jsr what it is
and then we're going to hear Ed Burns
perspective from a spec lead in
participating with some of the top DJ's
jsr participants in the past and what
he'd like to see in the future and we'll
hear from Mohammed as an adopted jsr
participant his feedback what he's
gotten out of it and what what he would
like to see happen and then we'll hear
from reza who as he said he's an
evangelist for java ee and he'll talk a
little bit more about the new jsr s that
have been proposed recently and how you
can get involved with those Jaya stars
moving forward so as I mentioned the JCP
is now 15 years old and it's evolved
quite a bit over time we evolve the JCP
through the jsr process and over time
it's become more and more open right now
we have all the schedules for the jsr is
public and updated regularly we have
read and write wiki's for every jsr that
the public can read without being having
the requirement of being a member public
discussion boards that are archived so
anyone can come in and read out what's
happening in the expert groups as well
as a feedback mechanism not only can
anyone read what's going on in the
expert group they can comment about
what's going on in the expert group and
the same for the issue tracker every jsr
has a public issue tracker that anyone
can comment and provide feedback on that
issue tracker and all of the votes are
public to as a JSR goes through the life
cycle in the JCP it's voted on by the
executive committee oversight board
three times and the results are public
and all jase ours have three open review
periods which is different from how it
was in the past so the JCP is now more
open than it ever was before which is
great news for the community in terms of
moving towards transparency and
participation and being more agile it
makes things easier for the community to
see what's happening and to get more
involved so around the same time as we
had these changes evolved in the JCP to
make everything more open we also had
the london java community and so Java we
have Daniel here from London java
community so
they kicked off this program called
adopt the jsr so that was two years ago
I'll hit Daniel take the picture before
I Stitch the skin picture there dr. jsr
so infographic there so it started at
the end of 2012 which is right about the
same time then we had these two things
happening together the JCP becoming much
more open and the Java user groups
coming together and really encouraging
user groups from all around the world to
participate in the development of
standards to have an impact on the
future of them versus waiting for things
to come and happen after after they were
already final so it really did take
those two things coming together to have
the community participate and have the
JCP process be more open and have the
leaders and the jsr projects work in a
transparent way so you can check out a
doctor jsr on this link here and I'll
have links at the end as well for
resources so it's a jug led initiative
and as I mentioned we do have jugs from
all around the world participating North
America South America Europe Africa Asia
the Middle East so if you are a Java
user group leader encourage you to get
involved and I'll promote your logo as
well I know we did with java ee 7 at the
launch we promoted all the Java user
groups that had gotten involved so with
java ee 7 this really adopted jsr really
got started at the end of the prod near
the end to more towards public review so
the jrs had been submitted previously
when adopt a JSR started so a lot of
these or groups got involved in this
infographic that we have for you at the
back when you leave shows there was a
six hundred percent increase in
community participation in java ee 7 vs
java ee 6 so can take this poster it
shows you some of the cool things as far
as the community members that
participated in the technologies so it
really was the collaboration of the
community that made it happen and I
think that Oracle did a nice job of
highlighting the work of the Java user
groups to make that possible as well so
there is been a benefit there as well
for your jug
so we also had some major releases
happen revolutionary releases of Java 8
Java 7 as i mentioned java ee 7 and
significant community contributions
through adopt a JSR and as i mentioned
it is a two-way street so that's why
today we want to get the perspective of
both the spec leads and the adoptive jsr
participants to talk about how you can
work together to be successful in the
future with java ee 8 as we get things
started so at this point I'm going to
turn it over to Mohammed and he's going
to tell you about his experience with
the adopt a JSR program so he'll talk
for about 10 minutes thank you ok we
have 10 minutes so i am going to share
my experience in two points how is our
program helped me first then how I
helped at GSR adopt GSR program to get
promoted if you're all weak up ok good
ok first it bring it allows me to bring
my voice my community voice my jug leads
my professionals ok to the community and
add what we are going to look forward to
see in the future of java from the EV is
from the perspective new GS ours what we
need ok to the community at the same
time we get involved in that latest
technology so I'm knowing the future I'm
just not working with what I have after
releasing no III knowing what is the
going on or what is the future of the
GSR with an new stuff and therefore I've
no I tweaked my experience to work with
ETS ours for sure gcp contribution and
this year old helped me to get my
customer repetition this has happened
and especially in the United Nation
project because most of the people
worked in the United Nation I have met
one of them it's called matias it's a
Congo jug lead and worked as a technical
manager for United Nation and when
he see me and during the meeting I get
recognized and I know you're easy member
you participate it and you want the
price and every thank you good
involvement so which we have a trust
because we know that you are going to
work with a standard as a way of
reducing project risks and something
like this and for sure we get awareness
of that latest GSR sometimes we looking
forward to certain fixes certain new
features and GSR because we are
reviewing GSR involving the dub GSR
program so we know what is we're going
to be released they're going to building
the next feature so I'm okay we have gs
are going to be raised and next few
months is we can use it because we and
because we know we know these features
and we don't like to to use any other
third party to to learn and add it to
the products for example for for get
awareness and get your head your hands
dirty with the code the most interesting
point here working with GSR coding and
testing is it you know the others coat
healthy yep you learn it just not you
the I'm architect okay i am putting my
perspective for my colleagues in our
works but that here you are working with
most of the talented and professional
coders and architects and talented guys
from all around the world so you get a
lot of information now that if i have to
code how to architect hell you know all
this stuff and the most of them using
the latest technology to develop know
will know an issue and avoid while
developing the next project that would
happen with glassfish specifically when
we have major some minor or major bugs
and we know that work around so we can
use the project and till defects has
released like 4.1 and we can use it and
we can make great it normally there is
no problem the other point it's allow us
to tweak underline our experience a very
interesting point in the city
and this is actually I get em packed a
variant interest in my CV and my
LinkedIn profile from just participating
at the program and is your own and gcp
because you're working behind the scene
to develop the technology not using just
not consuming the technology mmm resume
yes Sevilla cv it's a curriculum vita
for prolong life history of your
professional work and everything you can
talk about resumes two or three pages
that you have to describe yourself again
a very huge knowledge because II when
you work with Ed be with GSF you read a
book about and you work with this here
you are viewing mini mini mini GS ours
to get adopted and you will hear ok hit
this GSF aligners java ee 7 i would like
how it is a line tight because i would
like to test the alignment this kind of
stuff allow you to review many many
minutes or so you'll get a huge
knowledge about the technologies are
there hope you know the technology geek
and profession like you for sure it's my
pleasure and like this guys get involved
with them I can talk with it about any
certain project for any certain point
for GSF for example I would like to know
too I get the feedback guilty ok and you
have the mailing list now you can send
any meal any of the professional can
respond to you prefer we know technology
roadmap and what's going on next and get
recognized by the community as I have
111th gcp award-winning as outstanding
job GSR program and this year i got the
tube Choice Award for the project thank
you for this ok how I help it the
program what's my involvement and the
program ok i am visualizes many of JS
art and I speak about in many
conferences and hack hack days in egypt
or morocco and
and summits and and on my blog and in
the other plug like java.net ds1 the
Java code cake and most of them we get
the feedback and most of the feedback I
can submit it again to that expert group
and members especially when i get
participated and web sockets and jason
processing jax-rs java ee 7 general most
of the feedback of the other judge
members our leaders professional
feedback new features proposals for
anything we submitted then back and it's
added to the JIRA so they can see their
suggestions put it in some mullets and
not wasting them and for sure for atop
device Eve I adopt openjdk program but
it's been in fish cad program and the
reporting good number of bugs and the
enhancement and we have when work it
with Morocco jag we have added the
showstopper issue that prevent jax-rs
from production and the the guys take it
seriously and solve it the problem and
it was very as we were very very very
happy to to get the response and feel
that you are not just talking you even
it's a small thing they did I cognize
and take consideration of okay a
frequent application of the article as I
have said I have advised the adopt GSR
page so that we can get most of that
talented speaking Arabic guys and don't
aware an English Portuguese we have
multiple multiple pages translate to
mini language I have translated the ARB
beach all my hands on experience and the
projects and demos are added to adopt GS
a-- program under key tab you can find
it i have found it included the AGA jug
gcp program it's responsible for two
things for a dub GSR program okay and
the other side I'm ECE member and we
have to review the GSR s before voting
forest for the against the GSR for yes
or no or with sometimes with any
comments actually is this program for
revision it's
prodding was more ago Jack because we
need more talented people to do to work
on certain GS hours and I have but to be
in the next group members a 4g sr3 358
354 363 and 364 ex we broke member and
would contribute for sure for Jason P
one of the most GS are we waiting for
and we have may have been asked to add
the GSR and the this stuff many many
times from the fleet and we have new GSR
he jax-rs new version websockets MVC and
GMS sse sir % event as well as open G
decayed and my professional level we
have used java ee 7 as you have here
before and you end project we have three
projects running in class fish for using
java ee 7 and g decade this is a result
of the adoption the wfp wallet for
programming when a technician project
one the tube choice award we have the
mobile application that using back end
as a restful web services serving the
client ok 46 million users and we would
migrate to glassfish 4.12 SGD key 8 for
our national switches that serve or the
point of sales and ATM thank you
thank you very much okay okay so now you
heard from Mohammed a nuts perspective
of someone who's on the supply side of
the adopted jsr I'm on the demand side
of the adopted jsr I am in the very
fortunate role to be a spec lead for
some technologies and I am trying to go
to the community and say okay I need to
get this done how can you help me out so
I'm going to give you my perspective of
before during and after that is going
forward with the adopted jsr so we were
doing me adopt a JSR thing before there
really was such a thing and I would like
to point out that I feel very fortunate
that we have such an open process here
and it's not something you can take for
granted those of you on the outside
might just see okay open source of
course it's open sores everything should
be open and easy to access but it has
been a long hard battle first with the
Sun bureaucracy and then with the Oracle
bureaucracy to get things as open as
they are and I'd like to give a tip of
the hat to Heather and her colleagues
for that it took a long time to actually
get to where we are so please don't take
that for granted because with large
corporations such a level of openness is
something to be treasured and really
leveraged but with the openness that we
had we did make some inroads to get the
community more involved so a couple of
things we did was have these contests
right so we had this we wanted to have a
logo for jsf so we felt well what should
we do to get a logo let's give away a
book and we use the jira which we only
had because of the ability to go open in
the first place we used the jira to
collect all the entries and then we had
people vote and we got 31 different
entrance on this and the winter got a
free book and so the JSF logo that you
see on this slide it's a poster right
here right there was contributed by the
community and it's the official vanthu
logo another thing we did before there
was adopted jsr we had a voting for
issues too
so once you get all of your issues into
the issue tracker the problem then
becomes how do you decide which ones to
work on first and we ask the community
to help us understand that at the
beginning of JSF 2.2 in 2011 before we
really got started we collected the
feedback and ask them to help us
prioritize and it turns out that those
two kinds of things issue tracker
husbandry and organization and logos
there are good examples of the kinds of
things that adopt a JSR can do well now
here's the lessons learned after during
the adopted jsr we tried to use it for a
specific nice to have technical task jsf
is a funny specification in the sense
that it spans lots of different kinds of
interface technologies specifically
programming kind of interface
technologies you've got the Javadoc but
you also have a tag library to deal with
and we added some support for Ajax so
then you have a JavaScript API and all
of these things have their own tools for
generating the documentation but we
wanted it all to look like Java doc so
it's all one hyperlinked body of
information and in order to get that
same look and feel we thought why don't
we try to get someone from adopted jsr
to make the CSS style sheets from all
these four different tools work together
so that it looks like it's all coming
from one place and really proved to be
too difficult and not well defined
enough of a task it required lots of
mentoring from the spec leadside to get
it done so in that ended up not getting
done so that was our effort with adopted
jsr during the 2012 spec run for jsf 2.2
so the lesson learned there is you
really as a spec lead you get out of
adopt the GSR what you put into it and
the tasks must be small and
self-contained
that means there has to be very little
context required to do the task you know
you want to be able to have people come
in do some work that provides value and
then get out there's this thing that is
called amaz Amazon Mechanical Turk right
there and it's a fun system where you
basically can sign up and get paid real
money for doing silly things like
decoding captions or little kind of
silly tasks like that you might get paid
you know five cents for doing ten
captions or something but people do this
and they can make money you know if they
stick at it long enough and they the
tasks go up in complexity so I think
it's a good way to characterize the kind
of tasks that work well for adopt the
jsr they have to be a small kinds of
tasks I think I have some examples on
the next slide mm-hm as a spec lead I
have to tell myself I need to remember
that adopt the jsr is for people who
want to contribute you know they have
the will they have the desire that is to
contribute but they don't have time to
be a full expert group member so you
have to respect that people are doing
their day jobs then they only have you
know a half hour a week or something the
focus time to work on that so given that
constraint these are some of the tasks
that I think it's worth considering for
adopted jsr during Java e8 again I
mentioned the JIRA issues that's just a
really important thing so given a big
collection of JIRA issues assu ensure
that they have the right metadata the
nice thing about having a public issue
tracker is that anyone can file stuff in
there but that cuts both ways because if
people any old person just goes in and
files an issue in the GRE it might not
be even well refined enough it doesn't
have enough information on how to take
action it might be something very vague
so having the adopted Jess are people
and say okay here's a collection of like
30 issues can you please sanitize these
and that means setting the component
correctly in the sub component and if
it's an implementation issue
sure that it has a simple self-contained
compilable executable so in the case of
jsf that's a war file you know when we
really insist on if you're filing an
issue against the JSF implementation you
provide a reproducer and we provided a
maven archetype to make it easier for
people to do that but even so even with
making it easy it still requires extra
work on the part of the reporter and
unadopted jsr could help by taking these
issues which we suspect our actual real
problems that the community would
benefit if we fixed taking these issues
and refining them so that the
implementation team can really get
started quickly and do the work of
fixing it in and get right to the chase
right because most of the time with an
enterprise system when you are fixing a
bug it turns out you spend almost as
much if not more time on providing the
test driven and automated test for this
thing then you do actually fixing it so
you know it's important to have that
simple self-contained compilable
executable example also these are higher
level ones define use cases for
potential new features one of the things
we're doing in servlet four-point-oh of
course is providing support for hdb to
server push and me as a JSF co spec lead
I know what I want from the feature but
servlet actually serves far more and far
wider range of applications than just
web frameworks so I would love to get
some adopted as our support for saying
okay you have some problem domains that
are different from building a web
framework how would you use server push
as we're developing the specification
we're writing it using a pros English
text so having some proofreading of
different specific portions of the
specification would be nice and finally
advocate for non supported platforms in
the case of jsf we have a very
well-defined set of
Tanner's that we use of course being
Oracle we run on weblogic and being JCP
we have the ri which is glassfish but
there's also Tomcat there's also jetty
there's also Google App Engine these are
platforms that it's really not efficient
for us as Oracle employees to be
investing time to make sure they work
well but we want it to work well for
those platforms so having a community
involvement to make sure that works in
the specific case of jsf jndi is a
technology that we need to get some
things done but that's not present in
the Google cloud platform so we have
asked the community you say a vote for
this issue in google code to get jndi on
the whitelist so trying to raise put our
voices together with them and make a
bigger stink and hopefully they'll
support that okay that's all I had to
say Reza
alright first and foremost thank you
very much for coming to this session I
see many familiar faces and I think
that's to me that's only very
encouraging so I encourage you to stay
involved and you know hopefully the
people that aren't here you know by word
of mouth you can tell them what we're
trying to convey here and help them help
them get on board as well so principally
what I'm going to talk about is a bit
more forward-looking it's going to be
about specifics about how it is that you
can get involved you know with the with
these java ee 8j s RSV a top two gs are
so one thing that for context that i
want to want you to put in is an
understanding on your part as to how
important this is we're not simply up
here doing lip service you know this is
something honestly quite honestly we
have struggled with for many years it
was very frustrating for me personally
as an expert group member for many years
the boy in terms of both the quality and
quantity of participation in the JCP
this is really quite fundamentally
important and I think we're going to try
to do our best to improve upon it I in
Java yet I think we've made great
strides in java ee 7 we need to continue
the momentum and certainly our hope in
the java ee team is to make a java 8
perhaps the most community-driven java
standard that has occurred so far so we
have actually we have a head start on
this already even before we started any
of the set up to GSR stuff hopefully
most of you are aware of those efforts
already so actually job ie8 is a first
you know platform release where we
started with with community and input
okay community input was front ended and
the way we did this is through a series
of surveys that we conducted three
surveys in particular the first two of
which were asking about specific things
that we had on our mind as to what we
could think about for java 8 as well as
free form input where folks in the
community via this survey could tell us
okay all right I like this feature don't
like the
Fisher and by the way oh I really think
you should consider x y&amp;amp;z that's not
necessarily you know not necessarily
addressed in the survey in the third
part of the survey what we did was we
correlated the input from the previous
two and try to prioritize well what is
actually the most important things that
we need to address it's just too just so
our own purposes and to assign some some
appropriate level of importance because
not all of these issues obviously are
created equal so we got a very good
amount of response it could have been
far better in my opinion but a very
decent response about 4,500 people of
4,500 input points all across the board
and a various type of companies various
geographies and actually the result of
all of this is published out there for
you to take a look at if you haven't
take a look at it already you really
should and believe it or not this is
perhaps the key driver of all of the
work that will be doing you know going
forward in in the next one or two years
right so this is very very valuable and
hopefully it's an indicator to you as to
how valuable your input really is ok so
what are the job what's what's the
upshot of all of this water what is it
that we're looking at in terms of Java 8
possibilities I think I'd mentioned a
few of them I'll mention just a few more
so personal these are the principal
seems that we're thinking about for java
8 at the moment so first and foremost
we're going to continue on the effort
that we started with java a seven in
terms of aligning with the evolution of
the web web frameworks was a very key
part of i think keeping job I e on the
cutting edge in many cases actually
believe that we were far ahead of some
of the other competing frameworks that
claim to be you know perhaps more
advanced than than Java EE so what are
some of the things that we're thinking
about here first and foremost HTTP 2.0 I
think it will be leading up majority of
that with servlet for there's a number
of interesting things going on in HTTP
2.0 server push
ed mentioned already and various there's
various other nice optimization
techniques that hopefully will make the
web much more scalable server sent
events is another one for those of you
who are Jersey users your will probably
be fairly familiar with this feature
already it's a sum if you will it's the
middle ground between completely
stateless HTTP and completely stateful
and bi-directional web sockets okay so
we've had that support in in jax-rs for
some sometime or in rather in jerseys
for some time we're hoping to
standardize that we're hoping to improve
upon the JSON support that we introduced
in java ee 7 right now we have a
low-level parsing api in job I yet we
hope to have a a nice much nicer binding
API that integrates very well with the
rest of the technology stack similar and
just a just as things like jack's b &amp;amp;
Country integrates very seamlessly
across mr. stack yes Jim so whatever
frameworks that it makes sense so most
certainly JSON be will integrate with
the endpoint AP is so mostly jax-rs and
what others you know that's TBD will
determine that you know as we go along
and again this is areas where we need
input and this is where you know dr. GSR
really comes in in my mind right an
action-oriented framework actually
Manfred in the back is co-leading that
if you have any questions around that so
this is a it seems to be a I think
certainly to my personal surprised a
very very hot topic and people are still
interested in this the reason I'm it's a
surprise for me now is not because I
think this isn't unimportant it's just
it's good to see that despite all of the
action oriented frameworks that are out
there already people are still
interested in standardization people are
interested in seeing a standard
compatible option compatible portable
option for an action-oriented framework
even in this day even now right so
that's a very positive indicator in my
mind the other theme here a sort of
clownish theme is cloud okay the reason
I mean I'm
meant cloud issues I'm not entirely
convinced myself that these are features
specific to the cloud I believe these
are generally useful features that were
sort of putting it in a convenient cloud
bucket so some of these things are
things like security simplifications so
for those of you who follow the standard
we port it from fully container managed
in a sort of admin console driven
approach to defining things like data
sources and JMS resources to an
application manager way of doing that
the annotations so things like data
source definition and JMS resource
definition and the like so we're looking
to do the same thing for security
frameworks so imagine in your mind's eye
in an annotation that says ldap secured
or database secured and that is all you
need to do to secure a job IE
application going forward visibly the
existing mechanisms which is you know
basically go into the admin UI go into
some proprietary apps apps or mechanism
to secure your application declaratively
or programmatically we're looking at
some multi-tenancy support so whereas we
have these resource api's like JPA or
let's say JMS making those making it
possible to properly use that using the
proper isolation levels for a multi
tenants in a single application rest
management and monitoring this i think
is also going to be very interesting to
those of you who are into DevOps or have
some admin roles in addition to your
development roles perhaps so this is a
REST API to basically manage and monitor
your application server start stop
redeployed get some run time statistics
things of that nature instead of using
again these proprietary api's or gmx you
can essentially use rest so imagine in
being able to interact with your app
server and fully standard way using curl
okay so using something as simple as
colonel we're going to continue down
hopefully and we're going to actually do
a much better job than what i had hoped
for in e6 and e7 of CDI alignment so we
really want CDI to be a first-class
citizen and be extremely well integrated
if you will become the glue for the rest
of the platform so the fundamental
building block for that is of course an
advancement of the CDI standard itself
we've had some modest progress in with
job ie6 and java ee 7 hopefully with CDI
two-pointer will see far more
significant progress and then again this
is an area where you can help get
involved in help define you know what is
it that is needed to push dependency
injection as a concept forward in the
platform continuing to use more ejb
services out of ejb so we were
incremental eep old stuff out you can
now use transactions you can kind of use
security but not not much else so
hopefully we'll put up a lot of things
like a synchronous processing scheduling
and all of the other rest of the useful
ejb services and make them available to
CDI so that if you don't really want to
you don't have to use ejb at all you can
simply use CDI as your central component
model I believe same thing for gsm as
well i think it is planning on
officially deprecating the managed bean
model and moving to our CDI again as a
central okay prune that's even stronger
a word I'm saying deprecated has a you
know an annotation on it and we have
some very strict rules in Java EE about
what we actually can put that annotation
on so the best we could do is say you
know don't use this in the Javadoc
because we have a very very rigorous
process for actually deprecating but
what I'm saying specifically is the JSF
has had these non CDI managed beans
because we were doing dependency
injection you know in 2004 so but now we
have CDI and that's the preferred way to
do it so we're going to make it so that
in jsf 2.3 CDI is the way that it's
always done so okay and of course we're
gonna stick with our you know or bread
and butter which is you know enterprise
features like Jay cash and configuration
and next revision of JMS again I guess
so JMS stuff in my mind is really more
along the lines of CDI alignment but we
will see what happens there alignment
with the SC platform ok so i guess for
the most part we're very lucky that ACH
is fairly backwards compatible you can
use SC 8 with java ee 6 application
if you so wish and certainly for java 8
7 applications there are some areas
where we could improve upon the
integration with java acsa so these are
some of the general areas for that we
are looking at hopefully some of this is
identifiable to you and strikes a chord
with you as to what what your particular
interests are in digging into a drop the
GSR that is yet TBD you can assume a c8
for now but we will figure out you know
how all of the timing works out and what
what is that we can finally do a
dependency on but the safe that is a c8
obviously yeah right so there's a bit of
that already and as I was mentioning I
was actually going to develop a talk on
this by and large you can actually
already do it certainly with glassfish
for one we've written some internal
tests to test out various ACH function a
c8 features like lambdas with with EAP I
is already and by and large it's a it's
a fairly seamless mix and a few you know
in integration gotchas that we found we
fixed with things like web socket 1.1
that's included in glassfish 41 so to be
honest with you lambdas in particular I
don't think there is much of a paradigm
mismatch it's really more a question of
can we adopt the lambda style functional
style in Java EAP is ok so that would be
the next if you will to Avenue avenue of
exploration
okay I'm not sure I quite follow the
question but basically one of the
mandates of CDI 2.2 is to make it run in
se but I'm not really sure that's a
addressing your particular concern or
not yeah CDI has been the the model tier
for jsf since it came out and Jersey has
always old jersey in jax-rs of presented
kind of almost took to alternate a model
and they like to keep that standalone
way but we've definitely been working
with the the jax-rs and Jersey
implementation to make sure they
leverage CDI much more going forward but
there's this tension where like they
want to be standalone and lightweight
and CDI is kind of seen as not so
lightweight unfortunately though it
really is but people have that
perception so ee8 alignment will
definitely have CDI more as a part of
jax-rs going forward we're aware of that
problem okay so a very brief preview
into the GSR that you can expect okay
mapping generally to the road map to the
things that I talked about previously so
job ie8 jsr 36 36 6 that's already
launched CDI to isla already launched
json bjs 2.1 jax-rs for jaksa servlet
for jax-rs 2.1 mb c 1 point 0 servlet
2.3 but there are others in the pipeline
that you will see very very soon so
things like security risk management
perhaps a revision of JSON p a minor
revision of WebSocket a minor revision
of JT a minor revision of batch division
of JP a 2.2 and concurrency okay so
these are generally the things you can
expect the one very good resource that
you should tune into is this page on
glassfish that i could come now for
online
all up we are not online I don't believe
you're killing okay that's sort of
unfortunate but let's see if this loads
up but that is a key URL that you should
keep in mind if you want to get involved
in Java e 8j sars job agent is ours in
general it should be fairly
self-explanatory okay and self-guided so
logon is brilliant okay so here it is
here's a page here's some guidelines of
how you can get involved you can read
that by yourself it hopefully is fairly
straightforward the thing that I guess I
want to bring attention to is this table
here this is a key portion of where you
need to get involved okay so these are
all of the respective jsr s that were
launched the JCP page for it each
individual jsr actually has its own
website okay and it has things like
JIRA's and user forums and the like so
all of those links will we've listed out
and also what we did was the third
column is perhaps the most important
okay so if you click these links you
will find out what the specific items
are that a JSR is actually looking
currently looking for input ok the other
thing I'd like to point out is if you
don't want to continually keep track of
this I highly recommend following the
aquarium blog okay or the GlassFish
Twitter account because what we will do
is as these things come in we will
actually publish them out on the
aquarium and tweet them out into our out
to out into our Twitter account so you
can keep track of exactly what is going
on one what it is that you can
specifically contribute to by using
those channels okay so I think I'm out
of time so I'm going to hand it back
together thanks Rosa so that's actually
a good segue so yeah one of the things
as Reza mentioned that we're doing is
I'm working with the spec leads to
update this page here where will the
link to what the spec leads want I did
put some filler there for now some
suggestions for you if you want to get
started now but i'll be updating that on
a regular basis so make sure you come
and check that regularly and i'll go
back to this
show because I have a few more links to
share with you so this main adopt a JSR
page also linked to the GlassFish page
so if you missed that URL earlier there
is a link to the page on glassfish org
where you can go directly to the Java EE
specifications but our general home here
for adoptive jsr is on java.net and it's
there and of course you can always find
information on JCP org one of the things
that we're going to do different for
java e8 that we didn't necessarily do
for java ee 7 is make sure that the spec
lead requests from the adopted jsr
participants are on the JCP org pages so
makes it a little bit easier to have one
central place will link to it from the
adopt jsr pages but JCP org page will
also have for that specific jsr the
tasks that adopt a GSR participants can
help with and there's of course the
twitter accounts and IRC for adopt the
jsr i know is monitored regularly so if
you like to use IRC that's also a place
to do it we have a mailing list that's
used also very frequently by the Java
user group members around the world so
you can join that that's through the
java.net mean wiki there's a link for
joining the mailing list so I encourage
you to join the mailing list if you're
interested in participating and I'll
also update the mailing list there with
new things that come in and right now as
I mentioned earlier in the talk there
are some more opportunities for you
immediately following this talk so in
about 10 minutes I'm going to give you a
couple minutes for questions but in 10
minutes when the session ends all of us
are headed over to the hilton where
there's a hacker garden in the exhibit
area so and exhibits area and the Java
hub there's a hacker garden so we're
gonna walk over there so if you're
interested in sitting down with us and
getting more questions answered and
getting hands-on you can do that and
we'll be there for about an hour and a
half starting at twelve-thirty and
tonight there is also a birds of a
feather session that I'm doing with
Daniel Bryant who I pointed out earlier
leader of the
blended java community so that's tonight
at 9pm in the hilton that's in the
yosemite room so i encourage you to come
to our boss and if you're more
interested in learning how things are
involving in the JCP how we're evolving
things there's also a panel that you
could come too so we'll have some of
those topics that I talked about early
on about how the JCP is evolving we'll
have a panel on Thursday immediately
following the community keynote so that
starts at eleven thirty that was the end
of my presentation so I will open it up
to you for questions so i'll go ahead
and repeat your questions if you want to
ask questions to any of us please go
ahead and do that any questions that we
can answer for you Daniel yeah okay sure
does so Daniels comment is to categorize
the tasks into small medium and large
and this will help people who are coming
in if they really just want to get
started and only have a little bit of
time they can take one off the stack and
do it right away you are coming okay now
so there's the question about the Li
legal requirements for international
property and such for adopted jsr can
you cover that Heather because we didn't
mention that and that's a very good
point um well for adopt a JSR you are
encouraged to have your Java user group
join the JCP but you don't need to sign
an agreement as an individual unless
you're planning on joining the expert
group so if you're going to join the
expert group you of course need to sign
the JSP a and then if you're going to
make a contribution to the RI you would
need to sign whatever agreement the spec
lien is
is using in there are I if they're using
an agreement so right so there's for the
thing so I listed here a few things so
for these new jsr that just came out the
ones that Reza mentioned they're just
approved last week I think by the
executive committee so they're very new
and we just have a few suggestions here
but as things evolve we will have some
of those easy medium harder tasks and
obviously the harder one would be
getting involved with the ri so if
that's something you want to do there
may be some IP things that need to be
addressed but for most of the tasks that
adopt the jsr participants have done in
the past couple of years they've been
things that don't require a separate
agreement things like helping out with
the documentation translating things
into local languages like Mohammed
talked about bugs track in yet testing
yes right so a good question for myself
to ask is if it's a benchmark question
if it's a good adopted jsr task or not
ask yourself does this require the
creation of IP if the answer is yes it's
probably not a good jsr i've probably
not a good adopted jsr task although
then there were some things like in the
I think in the keynote on Sunday the
strategy keynote Cameron highlighted
that be jag one of the be judged
participate participants Johan Voss
actually did develop a sample
application and it was included in the
Java EE SDK so that's obviously a very
high level task that's on the harder
side but for the most part the things
that Java user group members can help
with and they really make a difference
are a little bit easier and as ed was
talking about breaking it down into
smaller tasks that people can do because
it is in their free time for the most
part so and even just as Mohammed talked
a little bit about evangelizing that's
great talking with your Java user group
members about the jrs and educating them
on what's happening and seeing if they
have any feedback and then figuring out
a way to feed that
into the expert group through adopt a
JSR is great and has question well I
think you remember that particular
really up to get involved is maturing
and one of the things that we've seen
with the adoption of SEOs is having I
years which are capable of working with
the new standards even before they're
out is very important now obviously
that's customers on the relation and
London which is taking place outside of
Oracle's by piece there with you said
nothing's ye plugins you know these are
understand how co-dependency works these
which we were crimson your API that's
very much scary quite be okay Leon
exactly one other area which i think is
really important to fun we just have to
decide that the the list of the big
bullet list of jrs okay slide 26 yeah
excellent so some of these things
actually definitely overlap with SC so
in particular JSON and HTTP two or two
where we might be something to clarity
that where I won't ever to take place
because certainly does that there's a
jack for a foot but for most of those
and mr. Jason does need to be reconciled
again so district my career as well but
H 252 is intended target s9 so that will
take place presumably go to any cable
well I mentioned this in the technical
session yesterday but briefly HTTP to
serve up four point oh java SE eight
okay job e8 also the client-side API is
a part of java SE nine okay so it's the
server side for servlet is going to be a
c8 I'm sorry I keep saying s ii ii ii ii
eight that's pretty much how it's always
been but yeah well it turns out that
under the covers we're going to be I
intend I sure as heck don't want to have
to write this code twice I'm going to be
intending to use the code from openjdk
to do the binary framing and the H pack
each pack is not a fun thing to
implement so I'd like to let them do it
particularly with H pack it real quickly
it's going to be a very popular attack
vector so anytime there's new code
there's going to be the people they're
looking to violate that code and we want
to really have one team maintain and do
that and the SCT was very well
positioned for that
you have the days of telnet to port 80
are done okay i think we probably have
time for one more question and I don't
have a hard time to like and then please
go to this place and have all the
tooling old information all the reasons
that he needs to learn about Java EE so
you have like the Oracle tutorial which
degree and then you have my job showing
that you can use Java EE but you still
have to like know about those two I know
who work in such they know where to find
them and go samples are spread it out on
the web for me about to say but I don't
know if you guys have looked into the
spring io website so i would like to
have like something like similar thing I
also Java EE and i feel that i still got
catfishing i'm not sure if anyone is I
do Manfred
sure I do want to help out I'm just
wondering you feeling the same good
point spring I launched back seated now
it's spring one actually and they
prevent brand in an FST quality
marketing but livid okay any other
questions or comments so just a reminder
we're going to go over the hacker garden
at twelve-thirty so we'll be there at
twelve thirty we're basically gonna walk
over a grabber lunch will be there and
as I mentioned if you want to come to
the ball tonight please do so it's at
9pm we also tomorrow are going to have a
mixer for adopt a JSR participants so i
will give you an invitation at the
hacker garden if you're interested in
coming to that yes when we're okay one
more question
in
mama that's a good question for you yes
so if you don't speak English yeah how
do you involve the proud native English
or not an English speaker and we do on
java.net actually the Java user group
leaders can translate the the wiki
material and I've published nine
different languages so far on the
adopter jsr wiki so the adopter jsr
online that link there's content there
that's been translated and then if
people want to do more content
translations they can and I know
Muhammad has done a lot of translation
so I let you speak about why they've
done okay first of all we have got
invitation from hitherto to add more
translation and you will find mini mini
translation you'll find English you will
get a template okay and the template you
have to translate it not translation by
mean word by word try to understand the
meaning okay and translated for your
natives so they can understand that the
thing has things going on easily yeah
you know most of sometimes I found some
guys translating or by old so it's not
not not going to work with your language
because you have many expressions
something like this we have template and
you have to translate this template and
you can deeply if you'd like just the
first page you can translate the first
page and there is a links for different
how to use have to participate how to
the most asked each level for the tasks
okay you can translate them if you won't
find that them relevant but you will
find the template when do I think
Heather we are going to to help buy this
for sending the template for you to
translate and Heather going to manage
publishing of this stuff with your
language at the beach and after that you
can evangelize this page to your all of
your Jack members yes and I think that
was done through the the mailing list so
you can join the mailing list but in
addition Mohammed's done a lot of
translation of just materials to educate
his user group so they're comfortable
receiving that information especially
especially
in something like in Egypt not most of
the schools learning English especially
the or low level English okay so most of
the people need to know that materials
in Arabic and most of them asked an even
if there is an technical books in Arabic
you'll find this is a little bit hard
because we don't have a lit of
translators and most of the translators
translating that not the meaning because
it's not relevant to translate for
example something like hard disk to an
Arabic it's something it's called like
driving wheel it's a meaning yes so I
think yet okay one word google translate
so maybe you could talk to mom and if
you're interested and find out some more
offline because yeah we need to wrap up
the session but thank you for your
questions thanks for coming to the
session hope to see you tonight or this
afternoon thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
