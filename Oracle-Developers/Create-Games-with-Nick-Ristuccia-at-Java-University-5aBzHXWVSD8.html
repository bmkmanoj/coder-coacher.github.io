today i'm david lopez for java one and
i'm here today with nikris to sia to
talk about java university and if you
don't know java university is a great
way to start off your duffel and
experience with a full day of free
conference training on Nick session is
entitled creating engaging games with
javafx eight a case study nick is
currently a job a curriculum developer
who's worked heavily with java SE eight
and he's a video game designer Nick
thank you for joining us today I'm glad
to be here well so could you start by
giving us maybe a brief overview of your
session at Java University oh sure so
it's a case study for our game we made
in javafx it's a game in java meant to
teach java concepts such as a class
design object oriented thinking
inheritance lambda expressions so so the
session looks at how the game was made
in terms of both programming javafx apps
and some of the game design decisions
that were made um looking at it from
like a software development perspective
ok so will you take us from blank screen
to finished product no unfortunately the
game the game took six seven five six
seven months to curate that would be way
too complex to do that but what I can do
is do like little bits and pieces
dissect that and then get people started
creating a javafx app gives show them
where to find the resources like if they
have any question like how do I do this
how do I do that just so you know get
them started and be able to come away
creating their own with the framework
they need to be able to create their own
application javafx Oh fantastic so for
your audience for this are you looking
for people who might have experience in
game design or experience with Java
effects or is this sort of come and
learn the skills that you'll need a look
at the anybody um so it may be you will
notice a couple extra things if you have
a program background but but you
definitely don't need one or two come
away having learning having learned
something so it could be it could be
anyone oh great
um so you say they'll be certain skills
you'll be learning about this process
could you maybe tell us what a couple of
those would be and if people aren't
liking to go into game design should
they still take this course and maybe
the skills transfer to there a lot of
work oh they definitely do transfer so I
like I like against because like we we
have the game already so if we know
great to show off but aside for that
games are just like any other kind of
software and the development processes
is very similar so if you need to
transfer those skills to any kind of
software whether it's you know at your
payment enterprise you know it's it's
still the same process still the same
but you have to do testing if they do
val development you have to have your
requirements you have to document plan
hai are going to design your code oh
that's still applicable definitely great
and will you go over steps of the
process like troubleshooting um pitfalls
you'll be along the way we do so i'll be
talking about the spiral model of
development i think that model clothes
best follows what we did with the game
um just software development in general
i really like that model and so I do
have older versions of the game as it
was coming along so you're able to see
how how it developed how things changed
since I was what I did develop it I can
explain why those things change while I
decisions were made was some of the
plate testing results were ok so in
games you call play testing but for any
other sub horse its more common to call
it user testing for lice a usability or
to find bugs or any of that okay so
getting in the hands of users hmm oh and
it's dumb watching what they could be
watching where there's where they
struggle or seeing that there's anything
they do that mixing application explode
very fair um so you mentioned the spiral
method of development how does that
differ from some of the other methods
out there okay um another look so game
design it's a very iterative process
where you have
like you think you know who are going
and so you do a bit of development and
then you circle back and I think you
know what could we change should we
still do some of the same things another
version will be waterfall where you just
have everything planned out at a time
and you just go and do it which I've
done that in the past that isn't quite
as on um you also don't have an
opportunity to capitalize on some of the
opportunities that present themselves or
some of the mistakes that or I guess
I'll say warning signs that come up but
you start to get a feeling of things
that you shouldn't do this you're with
this farm all you're able to iterate end
and catch those bad things before before
you build on an unstable foundation I
use that before okay so you start with a
broader idea what you want to do and you
0 in 0 and y 0 and until you get to the
finish product um you could say that
yeah because you definitely where you
think you're going to be where you think
you're going to end up isn't necessarily
where you're going to be in the end but
you still need to have this overall
vision and so you gradually are
realizing that vision and you're having
more and more features come into
existence okay cool okay so I understand
you brought something called the Java
puzzle ball that's a game do that sure
would you want me to demo it or just
talk about it first if you could
whatever you like if you'd like to talk
about it over a screenshot of the game
or you can just talk about it and then
we can go to the devil sure um I guess a
little background when we wanted to try
and find a way to make some of our Java
courses more engaging so we have a java
SE 8 fundamentals java SE eight new
features of the game was originally
designed for and so we was designed to
see teach object-oriented concepts class
design inheritance and then we had to
expand that for new features we had to
expand that to incorporate lambda
expressions as well so it's a it's an
educational game done in javafx to teach
java concepts
although it's not like see one of the
things that I hand about educational
games is where it's like this glorified
quiz for the quiz you to death but that
doesn't actually help you learn so this
game is a much different than that where
you're able to learn by playing so I've
shown this game to like I think my
youngest tester was like 50 15 my oldest
tester was 68 in nsl fail I'll ask them
a question like what is inheritance and
after they play they end up coming back
to me with a pretty good definition of
what inheritance could be so after that
it's just a matter of translating it
into Java Java terminology and applying
the Java syntax so in that in that
perspective is actually really has been
really effective so those who attend
your job University session don't get to
see the game in action definitely yeah
so I wanted to one of the things that I
don't like about when I had classes like
I only maybe sort of get things from
from lecture right it doesn't really
click with me until I'm able to get my
hands dirty so the approach I like to
take is to offer people that opportunity
to get their hands dirty much sooner and
much more manageable size challenges so
i'll never be including demos of the
game and programming apps and javafx
right well let's dive in let's see some
Java possible all right all right so um
this is the latest version of Java
possible and there's three game modes
which are each designed to teach java
java kossoff so basic mo teaches object
already thinking class design just an
introduction to that entire ten springs
and inheritance mechanics lambda mu goes
over use cases of lambda expressions
which would include lambda expressions
in GUI applications and in place of
anonymous inner classes for sorting
through collections all right so i'll go
into basic mode and i'll choose on the
first oh these are che to torial puzzles
ah sleet ramos something juicy ass ghost
that goes the juice man
so here in basic puzzles I'll choose one
that's probably good a debt that's
pretty good at demonstrating the
concepts so the goal is to get this ball
into Deeks love cuz he wants to play
catch with you Oh so in order to do that
you know you and play you run your code
you see the ball bounced around it's up
to you to distribute these behaviors for
deflecting the ball on two different
objects on the field of play which would
be the blue bumpers or the red bumpers
so say for instance we drag this
behavior for deflecting the ball so you
notice that we we had this behavior here
and this same behavior for deflecting
the ball is it appears on every instance
of the blue bumper so it's just like
riding a method for a class where that
method becomes available to every
instance of that object and so on this
game of your challenge becomes how do I
design these classes how do i distribute
these methods for deflecting the ball in
a way to achieve my goal so in case of
this level this would be the solution
victory yep so be cool like there's some
features that i want to instil it so if
I could have some like fireworks in the
background or something that would be
awesome but all this to be the case with
games where there's always like this
little something you want to add
something that you think would be cool
but there's just never enough time to
get it in and I'm sure other software is
the same way we have these features that
would be great so then you should patch
or something because the crux of
development in general yeah so I'll down
a level level 2 that should be a good
one um so here the same challenge you
want to try and get the ball into Dukes
glove in order to do that you have to
distribute these methods for
selecting the ball was different here
though is that inheritance mechanics are
applied so here you have you have the
blue bumpers and you also have the green
bumpers you'll notice that this triangle
behavior for deflecting the ball we've
assigned it to the blue bumpers but it's
also inherited onto all the green
bumpers as well so that's one of like
the key principles or key mechanics of
inheritance when you're programming Java
classes is that what you write for the
super class is going to be inherited by
the subclasses so in this case the blue
bumper would be the superclass the green
would be the subclass but on top of that
you're also able to write a unique
methods on to the subclass so for
instance we've added this fan here so
that's what inheritance mode is this is
the same puzzles but we're just
introducing inheritance mechanics into
it offers a new challenge let so the
last one I'll demonstrate around a
puzzle as well so there's a couple of
use cases here for lambda expressions
and what we had to do is somehow adopt
the game mechanics in a way to offer a
tougher unique puzzle that would
demonstrate totally different concepts
so here instead of trying to get the
ball to Duke instead the goal is to
destroy every blue bumper so this puzzle
here is demonstrating mound are
expressions in GUI applications so for
instance here we want to try and set the
direction of the ball so it looks like
we should probably have the ball the
blade go north in order to destroy this
so let's try and set the direction here
direction north give it a try so let's
click that yeah okay so now I got to try
and get the one below there we go and we
did it
so one of one of the reasons why I
wanted to do it this way is I noticed a
lot of people's teamed again and they
seem to get bored and the previous
versions when they were just watching
the after they set up their solution
they just watch the ball bounced around
so I wanted to have some sort of I want
to ink somehow increase the level of
interaction so I thought oh let's click
the ball that be interesting which
actually works out perfectly because
alums that lambda expressions can be
used in place of anonymous inner classes
to have to have that interaction so in
the case of javafx that could be buttons
it could be it could be image views like
we have here with the ball so that
worked out great and there's also one
other use case which is sorting through
collections actually soaring through
collections so this this whole game mode
is about sorting the blue from the red
in this case here we have three blue so
if you want to have the ball go little
story to blues and then hits a red so we
somehow have to do something to remove
that red we have a way of filtering
through this entire collection based on
their properties and the property could
be the color the number or the shape so
it's something that may be unique about
the only one to get rid of is that it's
red so let's say color filter through
the colors when it's red you want to
perform column method on all those once
we filter through the less to that one
red bumper we can call a method on it so
let's just shift it up north so we
shifted up and then we're able to filter
out all the Blues from the Reds on the
collection I just as an aside you
mention that you were colorblind yes is
it red blue or green blue or it's like
it's a lot of different things um like
blue purple green red green brown red
brown pink grey just throughout the
spectrum a bunch of weird stuff overlaps
okay are you are you able to tell the
difference between on-screen aerials
tell the difference between the blue
bumpers on the red ones yes but I would
have said I would have said like blue
and green bumpers uh okay hmm so that
was that was actually that was another
challenge of developing this game oh so
before it was easy to differentiate
between between all the bumpers because
in addition to a different color we had
a different shape so even if you were
called a blind you could still tell the
difference but now um what's different
in this game oh is that you could have
different shapes so I somehow needed a
way to differentiate between the two so
for that I had to add in this glowing
effect to all the blue bumpers so I hope
that's coming through good long
affection is definitely coming through
awesome yeah so that's this next an
instance of ye was important to test why
usability matters because there would be
it would be a bummer to have this game
out be go out to people and if their
color bud had them not be able to play
so usability like it's important in
games but it's also important in any
other kind of software that you develop
yeah well thank you for keeping that in
mind I can't tell you how many games
I've tried to play that uh end about
being able to hey I'm glad I weren't
interested it looks like a great way to
order to teach especially to like the
younger generations hey that's so that's
the thing um so the game the audience of
the game most resonated with was the
younger audience people people in their
teens in their twenties um but I did
have idea of people in their 50s and 60s
who who really enjoy it as well so
that's not to say that that audience is
I reachable um it's just a bit more
challenging at times um but no it's
still enjoy it so founded in july though
it strikes me as this thing but it takes
coding from being this big scary concept
that you've never heard of and you don't
know how to approach and it breaks it
down to this fun little game with
playing catch with Duke and moving balls
out of the way um yeah so that was that
was definitely another goal like how do
you how do you make how do you make all
the technobabble and
code that could make people cross site
how do you make that lesson too many how
do you make it fun engaging how do you
design a class of puts people in a
situation where they can feel like they
they can learn and be successful and
feel accomplished and feel that they're
building their skills and those are all
qualities that are important to game
design so I wanted to try and apply that
to to Java possible and apply it to the
courses that i was developing and to go
even deeper into that game design
background so that's actually that's
what I studied in school was game design
and before before I can to Oracle is
working out a bunch of game studios but
I for about three years and then I came
to Oracle as a college higher cool well
um yeah thank you for joining us today
it's been thank you I'm glad to be here
yeah and if you're watching definitely
check out job University definitely
check out next session to hear more
about Java to hear more about game
design now it should be a good time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
