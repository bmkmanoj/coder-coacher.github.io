to spend this day with us.
We know that it is a very large universe,
and, at the same time, that with Cloud technology
we can create an application in one day.
Well, imagine the time spent
that we recognize and we thank you for being here,
we are going to learn a lot of things here.
Throughout the talks and the lunch.
These are really important times
for those who are developers.
Remember that, approximately,
20 years ago
we didn’t have access to the tools and resources
to create applications that we have today.
During the last four, five years
the capacity and technology
that enable us to be more productive
and to create better applications
and better user interfaces
grew tremendously.
During this talk,
we are going to speak about containers,
microservices, massive learnings,
chat bot and all the new technology.
Let's review what happened here
all this time with the development part.
Everything has changed a lot.
The developer perspective
that consists both in having its components,
and grouping the components,
in bringing and building applications.
Piece by piece.
But bringing the components ready,
it is a different experience.
Also the part of the development cycle
completely changed,
because in the past
it took all the planning part
and took a year or two
to create the application.
And now, we set faster
with zero time.
Well, it takes all sorts...
“Get Posh”,
and the application is ready.
The part of the equipment
has also changed a lot.
With Internet
and remote work,
everyone at home,
it is not necessary to be in the same place
to create applications.
And also the technology part.
In the past, we had to choose a single language
to create an application.
And now, everyone can choose
how to work.
Even without knowing each other,
it is possible to work together,
with interfaces, APIs
and create an integrated application.
Also to work
with manual components.
With all that,
a functional unit
with apps and microservices is formed.
Another point is also
that the way we integrate
functionality and value
for our user
is not only about having an application,
but also about looking for an interface
that is really interactive, engaging.
That can offer
a better experience.
And a pretty big change is also
that before we thought
about what functionality we were going to deliver,
now, on how the information is
in the resources that one is putting,
independently of which application is going to be used,
what interfaces we are going to use.
So, we are going to see the model part that has changed
and which new requirements emerged.
One wants to work in a polyglot way,
i.e., multiple languages.
You can choose, for example,
that my interface will
be with note,
but I have services
that will be Paysol.
And in that way, I build my microservices.
And with other interactions, which can be PHP,
other languages, Java...
For all that it is also
necessary to have API management.
What’s that?
What you should know about the APIs is:
what applications are being used,
which users use my APIs
and also have the metrics about that,
to understand what is being used
and some of the patterns of use.
The elemental part also changed
with the part of Bops resources.
Both with the code repositories,
which started having their own Buit tools,
of continuous integration,
as with a ready code,
we already have all the part
of the assembly and testing process,
and the deployment of applications.
Let’s see interfaces
that also have artificial intelligence,
interpretation of natural language with Chatbots,
and Mobile, with the best
experience for the client,
and closer to users
using it as an interface every day.
We put communication interfaces,
and all of you there
are already directly connected with everyone
and now with applications
through the same interface.
This is also important
for the developer.
In the past, the performance launch
was a discipline
that had the production
and monitoring part.
But for a developer,
with the arrival of bopse,
it was increasingly important to understand
how the application behaves.
Now, the developer is also
more interested in the monitoring.
With all that,
How do we do the deployment?
We could make a package
for a container with the application
and that contains
all the application dependencies.
With the deployment, which is the post
and platform, and which is the support of the container.
So, this is the modern way
we have today with technology
to create an application.
What we are going to do here today
is to show you
how we can put an interface
that works with the perspective of an amateur.
Did you see the last series?
We have the play off
in the NBA, the Golden State Warriors,
known as the Dubs,
which won in this case,
well, they looked for an amateur
in Golden Stage,
who wants to go and have the experience of seeing
his favorite team in a stadium.
So, we can show you what resources we have
to have the best experience.
In this case,
here I explain how we made
the flow of this presentation.
So, I am an API designer.
Okay? What I’m going to do
is see how we can create an API
and do the collaboration part.
Try to see how...
...it’s working
and then I will call Andre.
Andre, my developer, is going to do
the decodification of microservice,
and the connection with the Chatbot.
This way,
we are going to achieve our goal,
that Jane sees
the Golden State Warriors
and that Jane has his experience
as well as possible
to go out from there as an amateur
pretty happy with the experience.
For his whole experience,
for having being in the stadium,
not only for having watched the game.
Talking about API,
it is important to speak also
about the way we handle APIs.
Okay, why is it important?
Developers need,
according to the market,
more and more agility
in the use part of the applications.
So, with a platform
of API management
we can see
how and what we need
to develop the applications.
And with this agility,
the time for market is reduced.
So our lunch
of application of services
is getting faster and faster.
And it fulfills the objective
of serving our customers.
Our platform also
allows to define
which are our security
policies.
With that, we achieve protection,
because the information we have
is super important business information.
So, we need to know
who will be really advising,
you need to have the right people for that
and also the availability
according to the service to be performed.
With all that, I have the possibility to understand
what they are using,
and also identify the
patterns of use of these APIs,
with this feedback
through the correct metrics.
So, it is divided into the life cycle
of an API and its management.
It doesn’t only matter what the design is going to be
or how the implementation of the API will be,
but also addressing the governance of that.
But it is also necessary to think
about how I'm going to protect this API,
what policies I'm going to implement.
Think about who can consume it
and how to provide that to consume the API.
Another concern is also that,
an API is my own service,
I must be sure that I am not providing
other companies, other partners.
How can I monetize
and have my return of this construction,
of this service that I am providing,
how they can be analyzed.
So, for that,
also Oracle, with its platform,
has incorporated the company Apiary,
which provides resources
on how to do the design part
and how to build an API.
And already having proof
so that before I start writing the code,
I already know how it is going to behave,
whether it is the correct API,
whether it has everything
I need, or if something else is needed.
So, with that I finish
with the definitions of the policies
and with the execution of the API.
Apiary already has a very fast
expansion.
It is a about to try
Apiary.io.
It’s free and you can enter
to create your own APIs,
to try and have your test.
And we already have
more than 270.000 developers there,
using some 3 million consumers.
So, we will see how it works
in the practice.
For example,
API designers
are going to contribute to Apiary.
And with that they make their definition
so that the implementers
can collaborate and implement there
in their microservice,
in the language they want,
with the platform, in the definition of API,
with a Python, lower with Ruby,
whatever, to
implement the API.
And with that, they collaborate.
We have gateways
that are deployed there
in any platform.
And the gateways are useful to ensure
that we have access according to the policies.
And you also look for the metrics
that are guided to
the platform.
The platform sends
all the information about
configuration and policies
for the gateways.
And when a requisition
is reached,
this requisition is processed
according to how the part of implemented policies
and metrics is defined.
The gateways can be deployed
anywhere.
It can be in your environment,
in Amazon US,
it can be in Azure,
or it even can be in Oracle Cloud.
With that, the APIs are available in a portal
so that the consumers
can search and define
what they want to develop
or consume.
So, what I’m going to do now
is an Aviary
demonstration
with a designer’s
point of view.
Let’s stop here.
For the demonstration.
You can see
that I’m connected
with git hug,
with my source of git hug.
It’s the same source I will use
to connect with Apiary.
Here it is.
In that case, I have my Apiary
defined.
There is a language called Apiary,
which is maintained by Apiary.
In this case, it is free
and it also supports a swagger.
But Swagger is more...
...it’s going to be Jason’s.
Once we have it, it’s easier
than doing the editing by human or reading.
So, here I have
the code and have to bring
the documentation...
General documentation.
Not only from the code,
but from comments
and so it can be a quite sophisticated
and rich documentation,
with a piece of information
and a good format.
In this case, it started like this
and I will look for
what matters when
I want to experience it again.
Okay.
I will watch a game,
but I want to know where I’m going to seat
and what I’m going to drink.
So, in this case the API
is going to look for what matters.
Where the seats are
and what beer I have to
consume.
Let’s stop here.
I have the “resource”,
what beers,
and I have the “reason”,
the list of beers.
Here.
In Aviary I already have a base
on which it was defined,
I have Mock server.
The test server has already been embedded
so it can do
a test against the platform.
And I also have the part
of code generation for several languages.
How do I do if I want to make a call from here?
So I go to reflow.
They found a code for me,
and also here I can search
and have generated examples.
For example, in Javascript.
So here is the Javascript code,
which is useful to make the call
and know what beers I have.
What I’m going to do...
as editors have done,
is copy and paste.
It’s okay.
And in this case, it will be
a simple way.
What is the monitor looking for?
It’s going to call the Chrome console
and connect with the right service.
Here.
Paste what I have
of the part with the call.
I called Moctes.
Here is the result
of which beers I have.
It’s okay?
But I think water is missing
I’m not in Mexico, but...
There is no Mexican beer here.
So let’s...
I wil go back to the definition.
Okay.
I’m sorry. Regarding preferences,
here we can see what came out.
New York, no.
No... Okay.
So I making the change.
Let’s go to Save.
It is integrated with the gate,
and for now I want to do a git push
with the definition that is there
and then I’ll show the repository.
It’s okay?
Let’s do the git push.
It’s this.
Again.
We have to connect here
with the right service.
As you can see, it is live.
The human interface.
Okay.
So here, Corona,
beer from Mexico.
So we are here.
We see...
the githug. I have a repository here,
that is setbody,
that is connected with the project.
Automatically generated documentation
is now complete.
It seems according to what was defined.
And here...
...I have my API...
...that has...
...changed.
It’s okay? According to what was done.
Okay. So, here I finish my demonstration,
here I will also call to the podium...
Andre to build the microservice,
now that programming begins.
Hello.
Hello.
Do you hear me?
Yes, there it is.
Hello. You know what?
Well, I do not know if you noticed,
but there were about four or five guys
in the PPT film there, right?
And Paul has only interpreted one.
It’s my turn to
perform the four that remain there.
So... Well, I don’t know if you
already felt like developers
or as if someone leaves you in the lurch,
but that's how I feel with my boss.
So I've done a good job here.
But he asked me to do
a microservice in 15 minutes.
Nothing else.
So... Okay.
Have you done a good job, right?
So, once again,
applause for Pablo.
Okay.
So...
Thank you.
Thank you.
But, well...
First of all,
thank you very much for your time there.
Actually,
what happens is I’m going to do...
What I’m going to create...
The men who were there
in the microservice
and the jetbox, but I’m going to show you
the point of a developer.
And thanks to Daniel,
who has given us
very important points
regarding the life of a developer
or regarding the subject of Debox containers.
That has helped me
so that I can bring this message
and you can realize
the scope of the test
that I am going to do here.
So...
Before we get down to business...
I’d like, basically,
to give you an idea about the environment
and scope of our platform
with respect to what a developer
like us can do.
So, when we speak...
... about development tools,
we have to bear in mind
key points,
that are like a continuous integration,
continuous deployment.
That’s part...
... of the things that sometimes
worry us.
How we make ourselves successful.
And also, as Daniel commented,
we often see some cases of companies
that are big,
but when we return to our reality,
we want to cry.
Because the reality is that we are still
with the monolithic applications there.
And it’s our turn to evolve.
In one side, we have all our challenges,
which are related to a good application,
create an interface,
a backing that is good enough
and can provide everything our business area
needs, and
what happens is that in the business area
we have to keep pushing,
because the competition is always strong there.
So how do we resound those issues there?
We have to have a method
and even applications and tools
that allow us to accelerate
the development process itself,
so that we can be successful
in these issues there.
Besides,
when we talk about
the applications,
in terms of
rol type,
we have, well...
We have seen the evolution of platforms
And even the pile that Daniel put here
and the evolution,
but we have seen new tools
that have emerged over the last few years
and which have become
fashionable tools,
such as JavaScript, node.
What happens is that now
we have to have a polyglot environment
that supports all the kinds of applications,
so one can deploy his microservices
above the platform,
that is agile
and strong enough
so one can create this kind of things.
And besides,
the fact that...
... we are seeing new solutions,
like Serverlest,
that allows us to create specific applications
or functions,
and make the most of infrastructure,
and when the infrastructure is not being used,
there is no way to charge,
one hasn’t pay
when using functions.
Of course,
despite the fact
that it is a very important issue,
I see a great demand
for this kind of solution.
And in the end,
all that is running
above the containers,
as Daniel has said there.
Well, we have the container,
but we have to bear in mind
that we have to manage, automate,
and that is no more good practice.
Everything is related, “by default”.
So, if one...
... wants to carry out
a kind of solution like that,
he has to do the adoption.
But the key point that I will show you there
is that you can realize
that there is a couple, a lot of solutions.
The demonstration that I will do to create
the microservice itself,
runs above each of
those components from end to end.
Well,
let’s assume that there is
no component that is not in this line,
but we are going to assume that it uses another solution.
We have to connect
that kind of solution with ours.
We can provide and meet all
development requirements,
the development lifecycle,
the server lifecycle,
as I said there.
Because there is
the fact of infrastructure as code.
So, if one develops
the application,
one can also maintain
the servers as code.
So, in the case of creating
a topic as Daniel has said,
instead of doing a troubleshoot
and try to search where the topic is,
One can eliminate the container
and recreate it from scratch.
That is one of the advantages,
but the films are coming,
and I’m tired as developer.
I like...
... to go down there and that we can dive
into those of the implementation.
So,
let’s see, I’m going to do...
Where is the...?
To change the...
Oh, right, thanks.
Now, let’s see the demonstrations
in the computer, please.
Yes.
So, that’s
the console of the Oracle cloud.
I will enter there, DataCenter.
So, the first step...
... is to create the microservice.
I don’t know if you have already found it
but Pablo has basically created a mock.
He exposed through Apiary,
but now we are going to...
... lower the level there.
Let’s do the implementation,
and in that case,
I will deploy and create an API
above node.
Okay?
So, the first step
is to show you some of the environment
of the life of a developer,
of us, right?
I don’t know...
I don’t know what your pains are
about...
the topics, the worries
that emerge during the day
while we are working,
developing our applications.
There it is.
While I’m connected,
let’s see what happened here.
Let’s see...
Let’s see, it’s so simple.
I don’t know why it doesn’t work
That always happens, it’s Murphy’s law.
That’s because it’s live.
Now yes.
Applause.
Well.
So, now...
The challenge
my boss gave me
was that I had to create everything
very fast there.
So...
I created an integration project.
And... let’s see, here it is.
So, as you can see there,
the project includes
everything related with code,
degradation
and continuous deployment with mailing,
or whatever.
Besides, one can create
the books and issues,
and work with the ajacio methodology...
Agile, I’m sorry.
And then create the spreads, right?
And after that, create the biuts,
and define how to create the biuts and jobs,
and then deploy
the microservices above the platform.
And then, try the service itself.
So,
I will enter here so you
can know the application itself.
The first one is the server.js
It’s basically...
a no-jay code.
I don’t know if you can see it,
but it’s all here.
I will select there.
So, basically,
we have the information to look for
the seats and the beers, right?
And then,
if we go there,
so also...
Let’s assume...
I’d like to see in the details
of the version,
so I can see here that it is the version,
it is a common
server Jay S,
as the basics for those
who are used to using
the Jay S.
Okay. Basically,
it’s a simple application.
But...
The next step it that I’m going to use
that kind of service
for the building of the jet bot.
I will show you some details.
So, there is mailing,
integration with mailing,
the issues...
So, I will enter here.
I just created, for example, an issue.
It’s Fix Cool for microsource and Mexico City.
Okay?
So...
I enter here, the methodology...
...Ajaio.
You will see that I created a springe, right?
Now with Mexico City and let’s assume
that I had to arrange the code.
It took me a whole night
to have this solved.
So...
That is ready.
I will drag there.
And now it’s ready
There it is, this took...
... one day.
Comment,
OK.
So, you can realize there
that the book effect
is ready.
I worked a lot last night
and everything is ready.
After that, I can see,
I can get development reports,
I can see details of the evolution
and if there was any progress,
like the sprints I have.
Regarding the biut, I can create mine.
I have created one for São Paulo, another for Mexico
and I have this one here that was already ready.
I will enter there,
and you will realize that...
the records of the builds are there.
So,
if I enter here, I can see all the details
that the console displays, in notes.
And if I go down here,
you can realize this.
You can see the code that the buit was successful.
So,
it worked.
When...
... we go back there.
Okay.
We can also see the details
of the build configuration.
So, where does
the information come from?
I can get...
Let’s assume that someone
has done a push,
the change...
I’m listening to the details
and I can even trigger
or stop some action
against the environment
and I can define multiple steps.
In that case, basically,
it’s a NPN,
which is basically to maintain
the version updated
to the version of the NPN
which is inside the other...
And I can add other
additional ones, like integration
with maybegrad or nogs.
I’m going to evoke...
... a sql,
and everything I want, right?
At the end,
I will do the deployment, so
I will see that there is
a studio apartment here
where the information is
I will see in the details
of configuration in that case.
Once the built is ready...
Once the built is ready
and working,
I will put it
automatically
inside the server.
That’s the configuration.
That doesn’t always happen,
but in that case,
as it was a sample,
that’s the way I used.
And well,
so,
now that we finally
realized
that the service is ready
and it’s already deployed above
the container of microservices...
And in that case it’s note,
I will enter the application.
One of the topics, I don’t know if you remember,
but when we are handling microservices,
one of the topics is the fact
that one can increase
or reduce the number of servers,
in an agile way, in a simple way,
without having to go down and up all the time.
So, there is one of the differences,
a big advantage.
So I can enter here...
I realized that I have a soft
distance with a gigabyte of memory,
so I will assume that’s not enough,
so I will add
an extra distance,
a little more
memory.
Basically, I have to apply,
and that is ready,
without having to minimize the server.
And, well...
Let’s see if the service is working there.
Basically, it’s already a match.
The service...
The seats...
It was already working.
And the beer service, right?
It’s ready.
So,
At least the part of the microservice is ready,
so I can connect this with my jet bot.
So, now we can go back, please,
to the presentation.
So the next step...
Tell me.
Oh, yes, thanks. My boss.
Thanks, you are very kind.
So,
What does...?
What does the topic of jet bot have to do there?
I travel often, so...
Today I’m here in Mexico,
I’m going to go to São Paulo,
last week I was in Europe,
next week I will be in California.
Every time I have to
access to different applications
of each of the airlines
with which I usually travel.
Sometimes, that turns into a nightmare
because is an issue very difficult to reduce
and what happens is, as you can see there,
in most of the cases, basically,
we have 4 or 5 applications,
that are key applications,
and the others that are there,
basically, one doesn’t use them
and after a while, one eliminates them, right?
So...
The idea of the jetbots,
the first case there
is that, in order to be
a channel,
a single channel for one to access
and solve any kind of issues.
From...
... making an airline reservation,
a check in, everything, and other topics,
like salary query and everything.
What happens is that,
nowadays,
and I think that most of you have already seen there,
there are different types of jet bots.
The first of them,
which is the most transactional jetbot,
which is basically where one enters
and asks a couple of questions like:
What is my salary?
For example, I have to
do a check in,
and basically, it gives you the answer and then
you are there,
but the idea is that we can go beyond that,
that we can interact with our users
and we can
realize what their interests are,
what are some recommendations
that we could do by chance.
Draw their attention,
and even generate an offer
or create an opportunity of sales
and well, so that we can make a...
So that we can provide a better experience
for our users.
In that point there,
the idea is that there is learning, right?
There is where topics come out
artificial intelligence, g-learning...
And that’s the kind of jet bot I have created
for the presentation Pablo requested me.
I’m a fan of...
... the Golden State Warriors.
Let’s assume I’m a fan
and, by the way, I realized that there
is a very good match, Mexico and Germany.
I’m always Mexican,
despite the shame,
7 to 1 but you...
So,
applause, Mexico 7 to 1.
Today it will be the rematch of Brazil...
The rematch of Brazil.
I’m embarrassed, then.
Next time I will do a jet bot
of the Confederations’ cup.
Even better, right?
Where Mexico is the champion.
So...
Well, so the next step.
There are four key components.
The first one is the way
where one can interact.
It’s the channel, one can access
from Facebook messenger,
or Whatsapp,
why not?
Or Wechat
Or even, I do not know if you
have seen Dialexa, right?
One can talk to the
machine and ask,
ask questions and talk to its jet bot
from wherever it is connected.
Another additional point
is the learning engine, machine learning,
and artificial intelligence.
It is the fact of being able to realize
and perceive what are the intentions
of your users and provide,
In that case, you are going to realize
in the jetbot.
I will ask a question, for example,
Which is the next match?
When is the next match?
If I ask this kind of questions,
What does it mean?
It means that, well, I’m interested in buying.
So, why don’t I ask questions
to interact with my user?
My boss is coming so I go faster
but, boss, there is a clock here.
Ten minutes, it’s okay.
Well...
The other there...
The ability to orchestrate and
how they went to a state machine
and the ability to expose
the pencil and jet bot to any platform,
so that anyone
can consume that type of service.
Well, now yes,
the demonstration with the telephone.
I will show you how the jet bot
works, please.
This is not the cable...
Not this one... Yes.
Which one?
There it is.
Here it’s okay.
I will plug it here.
To see if everything works
Now yes, let’s see.
Did it work?
Very good.
So that’s the jet bot
of the basketball court
we have in California.
I don’t know if you visit it,
it’s near the
Oracle office in California
and that's where the
Golden State Warriors house is.
So, I will start with the process,
basically, asking a question.
Hello?
Hello.
Let’s see.
So, in that case,
the jet bot realizes who I am,
in this case I’m Bob Jones
and here is the house of the Golden Gate
How can I help you?
So, I will ask a question.
When is the next match?
Because I’m interested in watching the next game
in the basketball court
of the Golden State Warriors.
Let’s see, let’s see here
Let’s see if it works, yes.
When is the next...?
In this case, it’s in English.
... next game?
When is the next game?
So, well.
It comes out and tells me that it has
some offers, right?
For tickets.
Are you interested?
Yes, of course, why not?
So, let’s see there
I will answer.
Yes.
It worked.
So it realized that
I want to buy
and asks me what the budget is.
In that case, I will say:
Here I have 300 dollars.
Here.
300.
So, according to the budget,
it shows me a list
of options of seats that are closer
to the basketball court
or that are a little further away.
So I will choose
the first one that is the...
I will see, but...
Let’s see.
There is a couple of them, but...
because my budget
is 300, I will choose the first one.
It’s there, in this sector, 114.
The file, the line... U3.
Let’s see.
Yes. I choose.
So...
Well, I can confirm, right?
But I think that
it is too expensive, right?
Because I only have 300,
How can I buy beer and everything?
So, how can I buy a Corona?
Of Fast and Furious.
Pablo watched the movie of
Fast and Furious, right?
Corona.
So, let’s change
We watch there,
I confirm the change.
And it will bring to me again,
I don’t know, a list.
Of everything.
And in that case, I can see.
I will choose another one
that is a little more feasible,
regarding the budget that I have.
I will choose this one.
That sounds good to me, right?
146 dollars.
Confirm? Yes.
So,
The jet bot, I don’t know.
There it is.
The learning machine.
It realized that I didn’t have
That I didn’t have
budget and salary.
So,
Who does not have
a situation like this today?
Everyone.
Yes, but, let’s see.
Yes, it’s okay.
I don’t have money.
Let’s see.
I will ask a salary
increase to my boss who is there.
So,
congratulations,
there it is.
It gave me an offer.
It realized that I had 300.
I chose one of 146.
So,
I still had a little more money
So, why don’t you
add to your package
an offer to get access
a VIP room
with free beer?
Well and Corona.
Yes, why not?
What kind of beer?
Let’s see if…
…it brings Corona in that case
Let’s see.
There, Guinness.
No, I didn’t like it.
I don’t like the beers there.
It doesn’t bring to me,
there isn’t Corona then
Anyway, let’s see.
I will do it there,
I will accept it.
Because it's still worth it, right?
Why I can’t watch a game,
as a fan,
fan of the Golden State Warriors to win?
It brought to me…
…It brought to me
the ticket
I’m going to take a look
to see if everything is okay.
And then, everything is ready.
And basically, I have to
upload the general detail
in the wallet,
in the Apo wallet.
Okay.
That part is ready then.
Thanks for watching,
Now I’d like to
go further into the details
of how I have done,
how I have created the jet bot
below the sheets.
So,
let’s go back
to the presentation, please.
So,
What is the flow?
The first one.
Channel integration.
In that case,
Facebook Messenger, but
it could be also Dialexa.
I could talk to the machine.
The classification of intention.
so when I asked the question,
Thre was a question:
‘What is your budget?’
So, it realized that
I would like to buy a ticket.
So that’s the percentage
of confidence.
And, what are the types
I have to interact with?
beers, seats and everything.
I confirm or change.
At the end, the integration
with the services we have developed
and deployed.
The services and microservices.
And now I will show you a little,
please, in the computer,
so you can realize
how it works.
So,
Here is the platform for creating
a bot. How do you create a bot?
So the first step…
well, you can see there.
In the Oracle Arena.
I will show you some details
so we can dive and
see and realize how it works.
So, when I create a bot
I ask questions, right?
Buy tickets,
Can I buy tickets?
I would like to buy tickets.
And that can be in Spanish,
Portuguese or whatever.
It doesn’t matter
the learning machine
can also work with other languages.
So, in that case,
How does it work?
I will try with an intention of…
When is the next match?
What does it show me?
The percentage of confidence, so
when I ask that kind of question
it evaluates the information
and it brings me that.
it is very likely that
when you ask that kind of question,
he would like to buy something,
right?
So,
It’s good to me,
So,
the next step
after the intention
we can do the test of the bot
What kind of entities
am I interacting with?
Beers, seat,
the customer’s account,
everything.
And everything is developed here
I can add it and
add another additional items.
In that case, I will do
a bot test
How? What is the case?
I don’t know if you remember.
When I put “Hello”, hola.
What comes under the sheets?
This one.
That’s Jason who came out
under the sheets with the details.
Well, I am…
Hello... User...
Here...
What would you like to do in that case?
Well, in that case,
I will propose the next game.
There it is. The next step…
would be to be able to create
a state machine.
In order to define
what the following steps are,
according to
what the users comment.
And, the last one and also
very important
would be define
what the channels are.
In that case, I have 3 channels.
Facebook Channel,
Islak,
and
Dialexa, right?
And then, after
the definition of the channels
one can access in that jet bot.
we have to plug and
access the services.
Where are the services?
Are they in the platform
of the containers?
Here is the address
I don’t know if you remember.
The API that Pablo has exposed
that will access
the services I deployed,
above the platform
and everything is there
all the managers
from end to end.
So,
to sum up, that’s the
part I had to do.
I will call Pablo again,
my boss.
Very kind, the scenario there
for him to finish the presentation
and thank you.
Thanks Andrea, so we are here
following our objective that
has been defining.
Of course.
I wanted to talk a little
about the platform
Oracle Cloud
or Oracle Cloud Platform
that is an open platform
Because I have
as any computer
the processing capacity.
and you can visit whatever you want.
Go through Windows,
several Linux solutions,
or like our Bitnami,
with every display I have
of Bitnami images,
I can bring,
besides Oracle Cloud.
It’s modern.
it offers Access
to all the new technology.
For example, working with…
with HaduSpark,
messaging with Kafka,
It can pick database
from other components.
And it’s easy.
Facility management
because everything is there.
It’s ready to use,
I don’t have to assemble
or add the components on my own.
This platform is already
surrounding several years.
We have a large number of clients
that they are actually users
of a living application.
We have client users from 142 countries
who are using the platform
and 21 datacenters.
And more applications like this one.
So actually, it is a living environment,
Real, that is going to grow.
A special announcement for part
of the Gubernax and Docker components,
Oracle had incorporated
Vercker
with the part of its platform
for continuous integration,
it can already be all part of the process
since output, code repositories,
packaging, assembly
deployment for a repository or
for the containers.
It’s pretty important,
you can try,
register at Vercker.com
For free.
To start testing,
it’s pretty interesting.
We also have a…
…a similar one with Pluralsight
That is for…
…for the part of training
and other part of the container
that is also in Pluralsight,
so you click register,
and choose the promotion of
three days to be in Oracle Code.
OK.
Thank you very much
Pablo, I’m sorry.
Before finishing,
I forgot something,
Time is up!
No, not yet
I have to take a picture of you
doing a wave
I will upload it
to the LinkedIn account, please
pose after 1,2,3.
Everyone, put your hands in the air, please.
Please.
Go there.
1...2...3
Okay.
Thank you very much, oh, but
thank you very much to everyone there,
But I forgot something
Two points there.
I have a session,
I’m going to take advantage of the microphone
A very good session
of the mobile development.
At noon, so if you agree,
I will be in the next room
in the next room there.
And well,
thank you very much again
for your time
If you liked the presentation,
come back.
But if you didn’t like
the presentation,
come back anyway.
Thank you very much, see you soon.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
