are put part of the Java platform team
I'm a group product manager I'm
responsible for that embedded portfolio
of products and also not connect enjoy
embedding before we get started I would
just like to get a quick show of hands
how many of your embedded developers
alright okay and the rest of you just
curious about the embedded space what's
going on which is great
very good and I'm assuming the rest of
you are just enterprise developer is
working in java servlets Java EE all
that kind of good stuff alright very
good so this talk is about a product
called Java embedded suite and embedded
suite is really about bringing metal boy
technologies that are popular on the
server down to embedded devices and
that's what the whole talk is about
we'll go through some introductions in
terms of what is this technology where
does it fit in in the big embedded space
and then no the show a demo of how do
you actually develop applications and
you'll find a lot of commonalities in
terms of how you develop applications
for the server with how do you develop
applications on embedded devices all
right so okay sorry I need to show you
this too disclaimer which basically says
you can't make any commercial decisions
based on information provided over here
agenda so we'll start with Internet of
Things because that's the overarching
theme here and why we even care about
this product in the first place the
embedded ecosystem today on where we are
today in terms of embedded application
development and what benefit do we prank
then IOT with Java and then go into a
deep dive into a are embedded suite the
features what are the different
components and then walk through a demo
of a really Code walkthrough of how do
you actually develop an application
using Jess and when I say Jess I
basically mean Java embedded speak I
these internet of things all right so
Internet of Things is here if you
haven't heard that before from the rest
of the keynotes and other sessions this
is something going to keep hearing
throughout the sessions but basically
there'll be 50 billion plus devices out
there by 2020 that's the minimum number
we've seen so we go with that we
actually heard anywhere from 50 to 200
billion devices that will be out there
generating data and all of these devices
there's immense amount of diversity in
the type of devices that exist out there
that are creating data and the end
result of it is all of them are
generating data and we need a standard
way of acquiring all this data managing
it integrating your back-end systems
analyzing it both on the server as well
as locally and one of the key things
that Java brings to IOT is local
intelligence so being able to take that
data and analyze it at the source so
that you can take more real-time
decisions if there is a boiler which is
about to explode I don't want that data
to go to the server and then get
processed there and then send back a
command saying turn off the pressure
wolf that needs to happen right away
right there so that's the kind of stuff
we're trying to bring in local
intelligence where network may be
disconnected most of the time I may be
working on a satellite network and I may
not have network connectivity all the
time but I still want the sophisticated
functionality how do I do that and
that's something what we are trying to
talk about today today 11% of data is
machine generated in fact most of the
data that exists today in the enterprise
database is corporate databases is
somewhere somehow entered by a human but
whatever a little percent of it is
machine generated data which is
generated directly by a machine and sent
to a database that is definitely
changing as you will have 20 billion 50
billion devices out there a large amount
of data is going to be generated
directly by devices
and sent over to a look to a database
and then it has to be refined along the
way it has to be processed along the way
and that is where Jessa's gonna fit in
so what are the challenges in this first
time acquiring the data from all of
these devices so how do how do you
acquire data in the first place from it
from a sensor which may be connected
over a whole bunch of different networks
so if you've you been listening to other
IOT talks or as you go through other it
does one of the key things that we'll
keep hearing about is the different
types of networks that exists out there
there are short-range networks like
Bluetooth the shorter networks like
ZigBee and z-wave or you have a wide
connection like a USB or serial rs-232
connection how do you connect to this
device in an abstracted way the way we
are used to doing it in Java but all you
do is just say to use Java or Die or
juice niño and just create a connection
and then voila you have a connection a
server socket how do you do that in a
world where every device is talking a
different protocol and that's one of the
bigger challenges that we have to solve
from an application development platform
point of view how do you provide that
common interface how do you manage that
petabytes of data and in a scalable
architecture gathering all this data and
then actually being able to derive some
context around that like I have data
sitting there but how do I map it to a
person that that from which that data
came or maybe it came from medical
device that a patient X was using how do
I map that data when I have petabytes of
data stored in my architecture somewhere
so we need a way where you have identity
of data as it goes through the network
all the way to the data center and then
be able to map it back and forth and how
do you leverage existing enterprise
architectures so some of the solutions
are of course a challenge of acquiring
data from millions of devices decouples
software development from hardware
development today most of embedded
development happens where you write
very embedded device specific
applications you actually go in and say
my device is going to have four
peripherals and I'm gonna write to those
peripherals and yes it works but it's
not scalable
it's very difficult to make a device
that's completely dynamic where you just
plug in any device of your choice and
then expect the application to just work
that's the kind of problem that we need
to solve and one of the ways to do it is
to decouple software development from
hardware development any great databases
data management and data analysis tools
with IOT networks where build that
identity infrastructure that can map
devices to data and that's one of the
key things that I spoke about and then
leveraging existing Enterprise
technologies such as web infrastructure
security infrastructure and so on there
are technologies out there today with
IOT which are trying to build parallel
networks or parallel data centers what
we want to promote as part of the Java
ecosystem is leveraging what we've
already built as part of the enterprise
java technology to fit into IOT space so
that you can leverage all your existing
knowledge you can leverage all your
existing investments and data centers
for IOT so where's the embedded
ecosystem today it this is an
interesting challenge that we are at
this point we're at a crossroads where
we see the opportunity that IOT can
bring IOT is opening up because
communication has become cheaper Moore's
Law has caught up to an extent where you
can now run an app server on a real $35
device actually even smaller devices
this was never possible you need a two
thousand dollar server and it needs to
run a proper app server you can run an
app server on a $35 device if you look
at the arm roadmap they're putting in
64-bit processing on like really really
small chips 32-bit processing is just
completely common now on our
microcontrollers so highly diverse and
changing use cases and technologies
today so many technologies that are
evolving at this point that can leverage
IOT if you look at the Tesla
I mean that's an amazing example of how
you can take something and just put in a
whole bunch of technology and then make
a device that is completely out of the
world in a way that it's really changing
the shifts of shift in paradigm in terms
of how you use a car and that's the
trend that we're going to see moving
forward not just in cars but across all
devices the nest thermostat if you're if
you've seen that one before
I mean thermostats were just this little
things with up and down arrows let's
just completely change that so those are
the kind of use cases that are emerging
and which is not possible which wasn't
possible before mostly because it was
much more expensive to do it people
didn't want to pay thousand dollars for
a thermostat but now you can build the
same thermostat in like two hundred
bucks and that's now approachable
hardware capabilities and connectivity
evolving a value is in software there
was if you were here last year for Juwan
actually the SVP from freescale he had a
pretty good comment he said the
difference between a washing machine of
today and a washing machine three years
from now will be ten thousand lines of
code which is actually very relevant
because there's only so much you can do
now in terms of how you do your wash
cycles and how you rotate your drum it's
really on building in that intelligence
into the washing machine that's where
the evolution is going to come in and we
see that across all kinds of appliances
all kinds of devices and that's where
the value is but embedded software
development today it's extremely
difficult it's C C++ based of course
there is a lot of expertise but the
barrier of entry into that is very high
and it's very proprietary if you using
specific technologies you have to stick
to their SDKs and it's the code that you
write is not always portable it takes
effort if you have devices you have if
you're an OEM with a catalog of 100
devices you probably have 20 different
development teams out there creating
applications for each of these for all
these hundred devices and it's not
uncommon for a big OEM to have that kind
of catalog it's expensive to reinvent
and reintegrate must-have features so
you've shipped devices all of a certain
security has become a big scare or every
other customer saying I need management
of my devices how do you do that it's
very expensive to go back and refresh
our devices bring in those kind of
features then finally value of data is
gaining importance as a business driver
if you're not already gathering enough
data from your device it's very
difficult to go back and change
everything to do that at time to market
of course you need to emphasize on that
point so this is where we are today and
some of the common pain points we hear
when we talk to customers and gel
embedded by the way has been used in
devices for a long time right we have
many examples like one of the more
common consumer example is Amazon Kindle
which is based on the ink which uses
shall I see embedded actually a version
of Java see embedded so we have a bunch
of consumer devices out there many
industrial devices out there that use
Java embedded so we have a good kind of
base to go talk to to understand what
are the common pain points some of the
common things we hear is how do I tell
my boss that we can't find good
developers it's so difficult to ramp up
a team of embedded developers today
which to fit your needs that that's
become a very common pain point that we
hear bomb costs the Bill of Materials
causes one of the key considerations of
course you don't want to spend too much
money you already spend enough on your
hardware software always becomes the key
problem when you're trying to put in
more so that's one of the key areas
where people are where new devices need
to be deployed in 30 days well that
might be a little extreme but it's not
that uncommon that it's so competitive
now that you have to be very very nimble
in terms of getting devices out what is
this vendor locks is then for years to
come in embedded it's still proprietary
technologies so if you're writing to a
particular embedded hardware for a
certain vertical segment you may be
locked in into the window technologies
unless you have a way to abstract out
things so that's one of the key problems
who will support this solutions ten
years from now there is very small there
smaller companies out there that can
build thanks for you but will they be
around will the technology choice that
you making today will that be around 10
years from now and finally how do you
replace things once the device has
shipped how do you add functionality
once the device has shipped so this is
the common pinpoints we keep hearing so
our strategy for this is of course
Internet of Things with Java and one of
the things we keep pointing out is it's
not internet of Java thanks it's
Internet of Things with Java so we
believe that Java can bring in a lot of
benefit not just work with devices that
run Java of course a few running Java on
the device we can definitely do lot more
and most of this talk is going to be
focused around putting Java on the
device and what you can do but our
strategy is to allow you to leverage our
across the stack and even if you're not
using Java on the device but still be
able to leverage benefits from it what
Java can do for you is basically if you
have Java from device all the way to the
backend it can provide the key things
that can provide is first thing it can
provide a common security model one of
the key things that's missing today in
the embedded world is a common security
model between the device and the backend
on the back end we have evolved the
security model especially the enterprise
sure it's fairly valuable now we have
you have of course whole container
models that have evolved you have the
IDM identity security model that is
fairly evolved now integrated into the
Java EE container which is all very good
of course it needs it's not perfect but
it's way more sophisticated then what
exists today on the devices and we need
to bring that common security model onto
the devices development today your
embedded team is of course always
different from your back-end team they
probably never talk to each other except
for deciding some interfaces they're
completely different skills at this
point but it doesn't have to be that way
what we're trying to do with Java of
course is run if you were at the keynote
yesterday
one of the key messages that we tried to
emphasize was there's no longer a job
I'm better John ami developer or a Java
C developer this is a Java developer
moving forward you want to bring love
jaar IME developers to leverage the
skills to build enterprise apps and vice
versa
get the enterprise developers to start
building embedded applications there's
no reason for them to think that all
that is out of reach for us that's our
to scope if there is opportunity there
you need to be in where the opportunity
is and we will allow help Java
developers to move downstream for that
and a common management model Java can
provide you that management framework
where you can easily deploy Java
applications across the board and and
one of the key things wide again Java is
important on devices it's to some extent
the way I look at it is the whole thick
client think lines and stuff that
happened
we're on the web where we first were
very thick with desktop applications and
then we went to the extreme we went 10
and then we realize no that's not good
enough either let's go back to tech and
now we have somewhere hybrid where with
we we seem to have now settled on thick
so it's the same thing in a way today
embedded
they were first embedded devices that
were thick in the sense that they did
everything themselves they didn't really
talk to anything in the backend now the
push is more towards let's just take all
this data and then move them to the
cloud and that'll be it well once you
have the data in the cloud we can do
everything but that's a very thin model
again you're not doing much on the
device that all the device is doing is
just gathering data and sending it over
what we need is something in the middle
where the device is able to do more the
device is able to make decisions itself
but at the same time be able to send
data to the cloud so that you can do
much more deeper analysis that you would
need that you can't do on the device
because you may need other data sources
as well so that's the model we are
trying to go to where Java enables the
device to be intelligent scalable and
supportable or manageable so that's our
vision we're trying to create an open
standards-based secure IOT platform
that can easily integrate devices with
enterprise applications while enabling
simple management application
development deployment and scalability
we'll be focusing on this part today
this is kind of like our conceptual
architecture if you are here by any
chance for our session earlier in the
morning we talked much more in detail
about this I'm not going to spend much
more time today on this one but this is
kind of our vision for how a IOT
architecture might look like you would
you would have devices talking over
cellular networks to data centers but
then there are many devices which would
be able to talk directly to data centers
because they are running on short-range
networks or a battery powered so those
devices would typically talk using a
gateway and then on this side you would
have a communication gateway which is
securing all the communication that's
coming in and also doing protocol
translation because all these guys out
there could be talking many different
protocols like if you're on a satellite
Iridium you're talking SMTP or basically
you're talking email if you are talk
just you know on an Ethernet or a Wi-Fi
you're talking HTTP or tcp/ip if you're
there are other standards emerging such
as 6lowpan and Co RF and there's n QT D
there's a whole bunch of these things
that evolving and we have no idea which
is going to succeed at this point
because this is such an emerging
industry so this component is going to
be key in turn abstracting out that part
where it will be able to work with
different technologies out there and
then we'll leverage our existing
enterprise technologies such as Access
Management identity data routing
technologies such as coherence or you
know caching technologies or event
processing technologies to move data to
the back-end systems so why everything
else so that's the conceptual
architecture today we're going to focus
on that part this box which and
applications of that gateway range in
pretty much every industry in home
automation it's fairly common to have a
gateway device
that sits and connects to all the
appliances in your house your
refrigerator your HVAC security system
etc in medical in the medical field you
would have a patient bedside monitoring
device or in a home in a remote patient
monitoring device which would be
connected to the blood pressure monitor
or to the pulse oximeter or something
else gathering data in industrial
automation you would have it at a big a
CNC machine might have a gateway with a
whole bunch of sensors that it's
connected to so a gateway is a pretty
crucial component in many devices and
it's also a great component there
because it tends to be stationary it
tends to be higher powered than most
other devices many times it's always on
and always powered on which allows us to
do more on this device so it's kind of
like a mini server sitting remote but
then it has its own characteristics in
terms of it needs manageability it needs
a lot more features so moving forward
then tchau embedded suite which is a
product from our jamberry portfolio
provides the is targeted towards
gateways what it does it provides
enterprise middleware capabilities on
embedded devices basically you can use
your enterprise knowledge of writing
servlets of creating web applications
creating rest Web Services to write
applications on a gateway we want to
standardize on rest for all our
communications we feel rest has matured
to an extent where we have enough
infrastructure that understands rest and
knows how to secure rest communication
so you want to bring in those
capabilities on embedded devices and
there's enough you know libraries out
there there enough reusability that you
can do with these technologies but you
know what we've done we know that you
can't just take a tomcat and just run it
on a little Raspberry Pi you could
potentially but you'll have performs
issues definitely not WebLogic so we've
taken down we've taken GlassFish which
truncate down we have reduced the
overall footprint versus competing
platforms or di DIY solutions so you can
take things together kind of put them
all together and you know have a stack
running what we do adjust is we kind of
optimize that all together so that you
remove a lot of extra components that
you may not need just to make sure that
it is compact footprint we enable
configuration options to do deployment
specific tuning and performance and we
have tested binaries for armed platforms
for x86 platforms that you can just
deploy on different developer boots like
Raspberry Pi or beaglebones or anything
else we'll show you one running on
Raspberry Pi today and you can reuse the
existing knowledge in java and java ee
so here's what we have today it's called
the cha embedded suite seven it was a
first attempt at bringing enterprise
middleware on to very small footprint
devices what we basically did was we
took our GlassFish web server or app
server basically and shrunk it down we
removed a whole bunch of things like the
JSP container we removed that we removed
EJB support and really brought the web
profile of GlassFish and put it on job I
see embedded we also took java DB and
combine it all together so now you have
a mini enterprise grade server running
on running on a very small footprint
device and so you could just write a web
application and just deploy it and you
could get running there was a really
great example of two developers from
Brazil who who took this and who had
never done it embedded development
before but they came up with this
interesting idea and came up with a
prototype and just week where they had a
robot running on Arduino and was it the
robot it should answer is a Raspberry Pi
with an Arduino and they put Jess on it
and then they had a guitar and somehow
they connected the guitar over Wireless
to the Raspberry Pi and they would play
notes on the guitar and based on those
nodes the robot would dance and they did
the whole application
like I don't know it two weeks or
something like that and the fact that
they could write an application that
could just do rest all the way through
was what made their development cycle
really really small and they could just
change things on the fly so that's the
power that really simplifying
application development does that it you
don't have that barrier anymore and how
do i I don't even know where to get
started kind of thing but moving forward
we definitely are changing this model
and that's something we want to talk
about today the first Radames was much
more basic we just started off we said
let's first enable web applications but
now we aiming higher we're gonna go get
remote management into it we warned
dynamic lifecycle management of
applications on the Gateway we want to
do far more services we want to do core
services that that are started as part
of the Gateway itself that your
applications can leverage so that's the
model we're moving forward we will have
of course you I see embedded will put a
management framework that will allow you
to do remote management you can remotely
deploy applications install them
uninstall them you can stop applications
as they're running pause then restart
them so all that stuff will be built in
into the framework most all of it will
be done the based on OSGi and OSGi is a
fairly accepted framework for embedded
and no we'll cover a little more about
it we will have Java DBS we'll have SQL
database running on the device so you
can do local storage so which way if you
have cases where there's intermittent
network connectivity so you can keep
caching data locally and then when you
have the network established again you
sync it and we also have another no SQL
database over there option which is
Berkeley DB so you can also put a no
askew later basis if you were focusing
more and key/value pair data then just
use no SQL Berkeley DB oh there jax-rs
is a Java standard for developing web
applications
to arrest applications and very easily
and jax-rs allows you to just host
arrest web services on the servlet
container over here so in a way your
device is a resource at that point your
device is nothing but you can just go in
and say just imagine a model where
you're discovering the device and you
discover services on it and you can say
what can I do with this device you just
call the rest web services and you can
just do whatever based on discovery at
that point you just discover the
services you say what services does your
device expose well I give you
temperature data here let me just call
the method that gives you temperature
temperature data so the dynamic nature
that rest can bring to this and then
again everything can happen securely at
that point used as a cell use your
standard digital encryption technologies
or you can just write a simple web
interface run it on the Soviet container
so that's the model we're going to do
moving forward it's all based on OSGi
bundles so before I hand over to null
for a demo I hope I'm good on time Oh
exceeded a little here's the high-level
features at a glance bringing Enterprise
middleware capabilities on embedded
devices an integrated java application
server for developing and deployment of
applications a good high-performance
java DB java DB is based on Jersey apart
teacher so it's not Jersey derby from
the past project and it's it's used very
widely and we just bring it on to
embedded devices you have restful web
services develop and deployment if
pre-integration a pre integrated
binaries ready for production OSGi which
is not there yet but something we're
working on is we'll bring in that
managed application container which will
also bring in remote management and
finally we're optimizing it all for arm
and other embedded platforms so I'll let
know talk a little more about the
technical details
Thank You Jay so let's I don't know
whether all of you are already familiar
with OSGi but I'm sure that some of you
are at least
so the OSGi Alliance was was set up you
know v you know 14 15 years ago now and
was originally focused on you know home
gateways and so on and it's found its
way into all kinds of places including
Enterprise Java as well of course so
dynamic module system it's you know been
through multiple iterations and some
some changes it's like changes the
direction but essentially it provides a
service oriented
you know componentized environment for
for developers and it provides a
standardized software life cycle
provides security and it provides a way
in which you can dynamically manage the
fact that the functionality of the
device so you can update services I had
new stuff that wasn't there to all that
without having to go through the highly
risk risky process of reflashing the
device and so this is kind of a
important building block for being able
to manage devices that are going to be
you know sitting in places they're often
inaccessible you know maybe it's
someplace inside a machine on your
production line that you're not going to
stop the production line to be able to
go to that device with the USB stick to
to upgrade the software on it so you
need you have to be able to do all this
stuff dynamically for this all to work
so it's been very widely deployed it's
actually specified by some of the
specifications such as the home gateway
initiative
next thank you
so specifically embedded and I'm going
to leave leave aside the you know
enterprise use of Java of OSGi for now
it's being used in a lot of embedded
spaces and it's very well accepted there
and it provides it gives you the the
basis of being able to do remote
management of the software lifecycle
both the platform and services and
applications on the device so you have a
life cycle that allows you to install
start/stop update uninstall and so on
and you know the the model allows you to
share resources and services in the
device and that allows you to actually
start building building applications
that can be aware of the of the
resources that are around on the device
and actually respond to two things as
they change and it it provides a nice
environment for for reusing
functionality and being able to
implement the same functionality in
multiple different ways where you need
to do that and it's also you know it's
100% java technology so it's it's very
hardware independent you know the only
dependent what you need is a java
runtime and then you can run our SGI so
the this is kind of the architecture or
a you know an architecture model of for
SGI you have the operating system and
the hardware obviously and sitting on
top of that what our SGI refers to is
the execution environment so that's
basically your java vm and libraries and
then a module system so a way to
modularize your code have code declare
that it's the the other things that it's
dependent on be able to hide the
implementation of modules so that you
only expose the the pieces that you want
to be public
that your that your contracting not to
change then you have a lifecycle model
so how do you install install stop start
etc and then finally a services model
that allows the dynamic discovery of
services on the device and then you know
application bundles sit on top of all
this and kind of cutting across all of
this is a security model that is based
on the Java SE security model and
extends it slightly to make it you know
give you some dynamic capabilities so
that you can manage the security
environment or at least the permission
environment for Java code running on the
device and it also gives you the ability
to deny permissions as well as allow
permissions which can be can be handy
sometimes so just going to talk very
briefly about Java DB it's it's a very
nice sequel database and it runs
extremely well on embedded hardware in
fact it's very widely used as a you know
by developers of who need a a good
reliable cheap and cheerful sequel
database and we've been very very
pleased with the the footprint and the
performance that we see on on embedded
devices with it some of the benefits of
it of it being a sequel database it has
the full sequel security model so and
it's a very very full dialect of
sequel's it's very familiar to anyone
who already uses sequel so this is part
of you know how do you how do you create
a platform that allows you to to say
yeah you can take your Java and related
skills and you can go here and you can
go here so we don't want to have you
know a really tiny cut-down thing that
isn't familiar to most Java developers
you can encrypt the database for you
know for if if having encrypted data on
the devices is important to make sure
that any undoes access the the raw data
they can't actually read it
or at least not very easily it's it's
very widely used and it's supported by a
number of different ideas Jersey is the
reference implementation of the jax-rs
specification jax-rs is that is the jsr
that deals with both providing and
consuming restful web services and
essentially it works by you annotate
plain old java objects pojos in order to
define the the rest of the
implementation sorry the the interface
of your arm of your restful service so
use annotations like a post at get and
consumes to say what mine types this
particular method can can consume and so
on there's also a client api that is
part of the of the jsr and the whole
thing is built designed and built to be
very modular extensible to be extensible
as far as you'll different security
mechanisms as far as the the entity
support that is that you're carrying
around with you so this is nice because
it means that you can actually cut
things down just something really quite
tiny but as them when you need to add
and use extra stuff then the
extensibility czar there you haven't
just got something that can only be tiny
yeah okay let's so let's move on to a
demo and i think well actually cover
cover this stuff pretty much well while
i'm talking through the demo so can you
just describe what we we have right so
what notes gonna show it so here we have
a raspberry pi and hopefully everyone's
seen a raspberry pi before hopefully
this one if you haven't it's a fairly
cheap device $35 it's it's it's fairly
easy to procure so we like it as a
developer port it's but but you know you
could pretty much use any ARM based
hardware
that can run shall I see any ARM Cortex
hardware skirt so we have JA embedded
sweet running on this on top of Java C
embedded and it's connected we are a
wireless router over here and so no has
NetBeans as an IDE and he's just going
to show how to create an application
using the standard Java model and then
deploy it onto this Raspberry Pi okay
thanks Jay so what I'm using here is
some NetBeans 7.3 and everything that
I'm about to show you also works just as
well with eclipse by the way but I'm I'm
choosing to demonstrate with NetBeans
today so what I've got here I've got you
know in this case I've got a relatively
local Raspberry Pi device running Java
embedded sweet but in reality as long as
I have IP connectivity from NetBeans to
the geography edit suite device then
then the device can be anywhere and what
I'm going to show you is the ability to
start to create applications and to
dynamically deploy and update those
applications to a gateway device running
Java embedded suite without having to do
things like you know deploy something
and then restart the device in order to
be able to invoke that and you'll see
that this is all you know really quite
integrated into NetBeans and there are
there are additional things in along
these lines that we're working on as
well so what I've got an SSH window here
which is you can't quite see all the
screen can unit J maybe you want to move
the table forward slightly and unzoom
the projector where in this mode then
we're not quite seeing the whole oh
thank you sir
yeah okay um so I'm gonna continue
talking well while the a/v gets sorted
out so I've got an SSH window I'm
running Java embedded suite on the
device and over here this is a local
window running on the linux that i've
got here and so I can you know remotely
access the the Raspberry Pi 2 for
example list what bundles we're actually
running on the device and the the
connection that I so that's done using a
restful admin API and it's done using a
connection that is actually using mutual
SSL authentication so the the Raspberry
Pi knows that you know is is looking
only for specific client certificates to
be presented in order to authorize
access to to that admin service so it's
not just you know anyone anyone that
wants to admin my device please go ahead
so over to NetBeans all that I had to do
to to set this up was to go into the the
maven settings in here and I had to add
a couple of a couple of settings here
the first one simply tells tells me even
what's the IP address of the device that
we want to deal with today and the
second one simply tells says whereabouts
on is is job embedded suite installed on
this device and that's simply so that it
can find the admin client in order to be
able to talk to the device so that's
that's all the setup you need we are
using them the the maven capable
integration of NetBeans and Eclipse so
what I'm going to do here is just go go
ahead and create a new project so I can
go in and create a project from an
archetype
and the the Java embedded sweet SDK
provides a number of archetypes for for
for producing different different kinds
of application so I'm just going to type
J's in here too to search for the the
J's archetypes that I've got on here and
I'm going to produce a templated restful
service built using Jersey and I'll just
call it demo one because I'm not very
imaginative today so NetBeans is now you
know using that maven archetype to and
we've produced a little ya demo project
up here so I can go into the source code
and I'll go into the the so an OSGi
bundle has has something called a bundle
activator that is that is called yeah
come talk to me afterwards so I will
modify this code here to simply set the
path where where this restful service is
going to be deployed on the device and
I'm going to ok I'm going to leave that
for now so what I'm going to do now is
build build this project so that'll
happen pretty quickly and it's just
signing the code now so that so this
this this gateway here that I that I've
got here is configured to only accept
trusted signed code so I just you know
as part of the build process then the
code got signed by my developer
certificate and so what I can do now is
just go in and run run that project and
I bring this window you'll see you'll
see this window scroll in a moment okay
so this is basically
okay so that's basically log output from
from the the Java embedded suite running
on the Raspberry Pi and that's simply so
basically log output saying yeah I just
I just got a new bundle deployed to me
so that's now running and if i if i go
to my web browser then i can so this is
running on port 80 443 i've got the
right IP address and its deployed under
the path demo 1 so we should now oops ok
I missed out missed out of character I'm
sorry about that
so I'm now getting basically the class
name of a resource back so just to show
that we can change stuff and yeah and an
update stuff in real time here then I'm
going to change the you know the string
that gets returned by the resource here
so this is obviously a very simple
resource it's tagged to respond to a get
an HTTP GET and it's tagged that to be
able to produce either HTML or plain
text depending on on what the the HTTP
request is is asking for so I'll save
that go and go over here and rebuild and
then in a moment when I when I rerun it
then this will get redeployed because I
already have this bundle installed on
the Gateway then it'll get the the
bundle will get stopped updated and
restarted and then we'll we'll access it
again so we'll run that bundle we'll see
more more log activity happen on Jazz in
a moment there we go
so it's just restarted the bundle so
they go back up here and refresh you'll
see this set now says hello Java 1
the the string that was returned by it
by that very very simple restful service
so you know but basically what I'm
showing you here is just how easy it is
to use standard Java tools and you know
standard development tools and standard
Java I mean this is this is Java SE it's
jax-rs its Web Services servlets web
applications and a lot more to come in
terms of where we're taking Java
embedded suite and I think that's some
enough for the demo Jai okay so just to
wrap up I mean if you look at the method
oh that they get resource which just
returns a string right now I mean you
could do anything in there you could now
open a sensor connection or you could
have a sensor connection which is
already open as part of an OS GI bundle
and call another OSGi service which is
now returning your data from the from
the OSGi service that's gathering data
from all this different devices or you
could just talk to a local database
which is already sitting there with Jess
and you might have a different OSGi
service that has been gathering data
from the sensors and storing it into the
local database and this rest service all
it will do is just go in and query the
database for the latest results and
return the results so now you can
leverage your so imagine scenario where
you have an enterprise application a web
application sitting on a data center it
needs to get the latest data from a
device all it has to do is now make a
rest connection to the Gateway call the
write rest web service and it will have
the data or you could have another OSGi
service which is basically leveraging
the rest connection and synchronizing
data from the Gateway to a back-end
database at a periodic interval so the
possibilities here are endless
but the key thing going that we really
simplify how you do things you leverage
your existing
you can reuse your libraries that you
may have developed for XML parsing for
Jason you could use Jason quite easily
you could use protocol buffers you could
use anything over here that makes your
data transmission easy so we're not
trying to we try to make it simple where
you can build on top of it without
having to learn new things at this point
so I feel that's the biggest benefit
that job edit suite can provide and the
key thing about being able to deploy
things and just speak they just run
automatically without restarting a
device is key I mean that's one of the
key things what we can bring were with
OSGi and osg really simplifies things
over here in terms of making devices far
more dynamic I don't have to restart my
device just to get an update and that
can make things far more easier much
more streamlined so can you go back to
the slides
all right so so just one quick thing on
top jess is basically a platform and
these are the things we already spoke
about a modular extensible middleware
stack that's what jess provides
integrated servlet container integrated
database restful web services management
framework optimization for embedded
hardware security framework so one thing
we didn't cover a lot but no kind of
briefly covered which is the security
part with mutual authentication and that
is an extremely important point being
able to secure things in Java by itself
has a lot of security mechanisms buildin
like you have bytecode verification you
have a sandbox you have you have code
signing mechanisms where you basically
can sign your applications and only the
the applications that are signed with
the appropriate certificate will run and
Jess takes all of that and builds it
into a framework where you can configure
how you want applications to behave so
you can basically go into Jess and say
only run applications that have been
signed by a specific certificate so
that's the kind of security that you can
bring in so you can't just install a
rogue application on to a gateway and
which can just sit around and do just
log data so that's the kind of stuff
that we are trying to bring in with Jess
on top of it with Jess we have Oracle
event processing which requires its own
different full session but basically
Orca live and processing brings and
complex event processing on top of chess
it just suggests it's basically a
platform that allows you to bring in
more services Berkeley DB is another one
that I spoke about earlier
Oracle event processing allows you to do
local data filtering pattern match rank
correlation or an window operation where
you can say if an alarm is on for more
than three minutes then take an action
so so finally here's what we're doing
with John Barrett sweet so hopefully
we'll have something for you guys soon
just seven today with itself is pretty
cool in terms of what you can do
we're really taking that a step forward
bringing in all those features that
people have been talking about of it's
simplified application development just
seven today just uses Web Apps but then
it doesn't have a whole lot of focus on
embedded application development we're
just saying use your enterprise
knowledge put it on a memory device but
what we're doing with just moving
forward is really taking the same
knowledge but customizing it making it
simpler for embedded application
development remote application
deployment management monitoring with
Java C embedded eight job flight
recorder will be one of the features
that you'll see and flight recorder if
you haven't seen it's just amazing it's
like a black box on an airplane where
you look at an event after you know
something bad has happened so instead of
trying to reproduce certain I'm you know
going in and putting debug statements
and trying to do all kinds of tricks to
reproduce an error you can just go back
and look at the logs and it will tell
you exactly what happened it's that's
the black box functionality that Java
flight recorder and that's why it's
called flight recorder because it's the
same analogy to an airplane so that's
what it does and in combination with a
tool called Mission Control we can just
open up flow flight recorder logs and
Mission Control and give you a complete
visual analysis of what went wrong in
the JVM so that's the functionality that
we can bring in with john barry i see
embedded it and that's something you
guys should definitely leverage and so
modular architecture and finally web
services I think rest is the way to go
moving forward we have invested enough
in the java world and we have to bring
rest over to embedded devices think
that's it do we have any time left we
have a few minutes left like a couple of
minutes for questions or we can hang
around if you have any more questions as
well
yeah event processing we definitely can
talk to him more about it we did a lot
of sessions for that earlier but this
year we haven't focused much on because
we haven't changed a lot in the product
since we spoke about it last year so
that's why we haven't focused much on
content this year but something we
definitely can talk about more we have
demos in if you go to the JA embedded
Democrats we have demos in the gateway
booth which were we showing a demo where
we use event processing there's a demo
with freescale again where we used event
processing so it's in almost all of our
embedded demos though that we don't have
any sessions this year oh yeah you're
right I'm sorry
yes there is one yes perfect thank you
right that's Hank when wonk all right
the speaker penguin Wong oh yeah that's
right okay good that's the other one
well they're sessions and we have a
session tomorrow in the morning at 8:30
where we'll briefly cover the topic as
well so yeah it's oracle proprietary
it's similar to Vesper we use a language
we'll cql which is I believe it's far
more powerful than Esper but it's an
ANSI standard CQL stands for continuous
query language it's Esper is not
optimized for embedded and we've really
taken Oh a pea engine and really I rank
it down and it's been optimized for him
about it
Java Enterprise editions like Felix can
yeah well that's what you're unclear
there are a number of companies that
also we've got partners that also sell
OSGi frameworks that have been you know
especially written for different
different news places and so on
yeah because also there was something
like a budget pace to distribute on to
various OS which are in the cloud or
connected while IP so do you see a use
case with connecting such days well I
think the there are a number of
challenges in managing all these devices
you know they come from you know the
different protocols the fact that the
device that you want to manage may or
may not actually be there to talk to at
the time when you when you decide you
want to manage it there are plenty of
mobile devices or battery-powered
devices that stay off the air as much as
possible in order to have and that's
even more important for our devices
because you need battery life of the
year is not not days or weeks so there
are a lot of challenges in that you you
can't just think of this as I you know
oh good we have an IP connection to the
device we can talk to it whenever we
like because you may not have an IP
connection and you make you probably
can't just talk to it whenever you like
yes and you know one of the things in
the conceptual architecture that we
showed it was an IOT gateway that sits
out in the in the DMZ and basically
mediates between your you know the
external part of your IT network and
your corporate infrastructure and that
that's a very very important part of an
of an IOT network or an IOT platform and
what what we're really trying to do here
by bringing this can you know the the
IOT platform and the architecture idea
and there was a lot more detail on that
in a the earlier talk that Jay and I
gave today is to is not to say this is
the Oracle proprietary way of doing
things this is to say if we're going to
make a success out of IOT and create the
ability to build applications and lots
of applications and really be able to
support that many billions of devices in
just a few years then we need to create
a platform that the industry can
converge around and therefore so we're
putting this architecture out there not
not to say you know we have all the
answers already but to say that this is
how you know this is where we're at in
our thinking we'd like to know what you
guys think
which were just seven has you can
download that from Oracle technology
Network and this documentation that
comes with it some of the stuff that
Knowles showed today it's something we
still haven't released yet but we're
hoping that we can release that fairly
soon but you can definitely there are
other OSGi frameworks that that work
Wavell and embedded and they have their
own SDK so the model is fairly similar
in those as well
so if I try those out remote no more
questions then thank you I really
appreciate your time thank you everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
