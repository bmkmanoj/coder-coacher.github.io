work writers yes we are recording it
this time Paula Dietz last time we
didn't do it
someone asked and we couldn't give them
a recording ok so here are the questions
we got this week
I said I was just trying to work through
that open exchange rate one I'm not sure
hey do you want to paste the question in
the chat so that everyone can read them
is that possible or it is no maybe I
should just share my screen gendai oh no
you're so beautiful mark we don't want
to see your screen we want to see you
second let's hear any right now and I
already had a beer it's evening so I
apologize for any wrongdoings I'm about
to do so so we had three questions and
unfortunately one of them I'm simply
gonna say is out of scope for this
session which is what do you do about
Jason in older releases of the database
you know the the scope of this Jason in
the database is the functionality that
we introduced starting with rubies 12
102 we can give people a hint that there
is Jason epochs or apex Jason Jason
Chuck that was what I was about to say
there isn't a text Jason package that
the apex guys introduced teams one of
the later releases of a text that has
some useful functionality but it's not
something we cover in this session and
so I'm afraid you know you're somewhat
on your own we would strongly recommend
that you upgrade to 12 102 or later
where you will get a lot of very useful
functionality significantly more
performant then you would get using
either third-party products that were
around that support the older version of
the database what was the open source
thing to that people lot some people
like beta yell Jason wasn't called PL
Jason yeah Jason that was it right so
that's a package you could look at but
that's not auricle supported and then
there is the apex Jason functionality
that is our core support of it's part of
apex and I'm not sure which database
releases they can be installed in but
certainly it can be restored insert in
some of the version I don't know if it
works you 10 bucks or an 11 yeah well
don't want PL sequel implementation both
apex Jason and PL Jason so they come
with
performance slow performance than our
sea-based buildin the second question
are very the first question here how do
i display I'm not sure I understand this
question at all is the person who asked
it on the line could they clarify it
maybe there is a mute Alok Verma let's
see it the participant list but I don't
see any look there yeah so that one I'm
afraid I'm not really sure I understand
what they're asking so the other one I
was just trying to work through which I
don't know affirm Harun J is on the line
but that was the other question I was
just trying to work at the example now
under some reason yeah just see if this
works so I'm giving 170 keys but then
I'm getting no rows selected why is that
what have I done wrong in my logic I'm
basically the problem with that this one
is it's quite an interesting little
problem and if we look at the format of
the file
the gentleman's asking how can he
process this file using adjacent
capabilities and what we see here is the
file is Luxur dinner
a somewhat unusual manner for a JSON
file I would argue that rates should
have been an array with a set of objects
inside it but what we actually have if
you look carefully is that rates is an
object with a fed of key value pairs
inside it and the keys are affected data
items they're not meaningful names for
the object they are yeah okay dennis is
here
as yeah I'll take that other question
that came back about me yeah Dennis Hess
has added yeah anyway we'll come back to
that one in just a second um you know I
would argue this should have been an
array with um you know an object inside
a that should have had a you know
currency name currency exchange rate but
it isn't it's effectively a name value
pair model where somebody has used the
name as the Tignes which gives us at the
moment a little bit of heartache and
it's something we're aware that we need
to address but there's nothing in our
native sequel functionality that will
let us process that data because we
assume that we're going to know the
names of the keys in advance so we'll
have to drop back to PL sequel that's
okay so the way I would approach this is
I would use a table function if I want
to get it into something that I can then
query in sequel and in order to do that
first I'm gonna have to create a couple
of object types the first object type
I'm creating is defined effectively my
row so what I'm going to generate from
that object with all those exchange
rates in it is a set of rows which will
tell me the epoch which is defined stamp
on the file the base currency which is
the currency I'm coming from and that
information if you look is isn't what is
effectively the header for the file you
can see it here and then it's going to
generate one row from each one of the
rates an order process in order to
generate those rows I need to then
create a table type based on that you
know object type that is my row so
there's my table record and now I can
create a pipeline function
which will process that table and it
returns the table type that we created
and I'm going to use our feel sequel
Jason capabilities to process the file
in particular to deal with that object
where I need to know the names of the
keys in order to get to the values and
so basically what I'm going to set up is
I'm gonna pass in my document and I am
going to construct a JSON object key
from that document which I'm going to
call B Jason I'm then gonna get the
rates object using this guest function
and both the get junk function on the
Jason on the D JSON object and I return
a JSON object T which now gives me that
subset of the record for the JSON
document here and I'm then going to
extract the set of keys
and I'm outputting the number of keys
and then I'm iterating over the set of
keys and should be piping out an
instance of the xr8 record for each row
for each key but for some reason I'm
getting no row so I'm doing something
wrong here so let me just take a quick
look at
the pipe function on what am I doing
wrong
I don't write these very often so Connor
if you're on the line and can spot it
feel free to pipe in that wasn't too bad
of a pun now while I'm looking at this
you know something I've done really
stupid what happens if you ride you just
get null rows or you don't hit the roads
back yeah I think you statement doesn't
need to be there one second and the gate
keys so the the link does the right
number of rows I see me and des loop
iterates over it right week he's count
if you could have put a DBMS output in
the loop that's what I'm gonna do next I
just want to see whether it Sunday's
city is
so you got 170 keys but no rows selected
let's put a DBMS print line under the
loop oh you put line the currency what
happened you can go into the loop by the
look of it what did I do wrong this is
annoying
well I left the keys docked out no I is
not zero well spotted if one isn't
getting it's less than an equal right I
think it's one base just ding oh it's
all the same I think what I actually
meant to do was this sorry I was like
copied in code from something else
luckily everyone is muted so we don't
hear them my fam I in one too
beaky's duck count not else equal and
stop maybe for ya
sorry right in too many different
languages these days for I am that's it
isn't it and move the parentheses that's
about the PLC for loop isn't it
no the the normally there is no trend
here
you don't need the spread to secret you
use x-rays dot get number the keys of I
don't have the right number of closing
parens no I need one more try that
coding line remove the parentheses
around the four header the in-1 tax no
parentheses line 99 line 65 65 at 61 you
want to go back to words editable 65
you can't edit it there this is not your
edit window right 65 this parenthesis
yeah let's give it up
not a try but I think people get the
idea that with PLC quill you have
constructs to in this case extract all
the keys and then iterate over the key
is using a simple for loop and the other
construct here is the table function
which should return you all these things
as separate rows let's give this words
help if I edit the source file not the
log file so it's the person who's asked
the question is it's the person in case
you've got the currencies but we're not
getting there you okay there we go all
right let's get rid of the Yahoo and
that I think is
sir is it not you want to copy and paste
this to the destruct so the person who's
asked the question is that person on
line three point six seven three one six
three point six seven three one eight so
did I read that wrong I only did use do
we have in the file one two three six
six okay so yes I got a rounding error
that's easy to fix
mmm that's just this guy there we go so
basically what we have now is a table
function that returns us the row so what
is it doing here it gets the contents of
the rates object it extracts the key
from the rate it extracts the set of
keys from the rates object and then it
iterates over those keys extracting the
exchange rate for each one of the key
value the key names that it found and
then it generates a row of this x rate
record containing the value of the
timestamp the value of the base and the
name of the key that we get from the
keys array and the number associated
with that key and now I have the table
function I can pass in my JSON document
and I get back 170 rows well precision
is too large okay so I need to fix my
data type again
let's just do that it will make this a
15 10th see if that one works and we get
back a hundred and seventy rows for our
currency exchanges so as I said I don't
know if the gentleman who asked a
question is on the doesn't solve now but
that is your solution at least half my
my time and maybe we could come back to
the chat or my meeting controls down
yeah thanks Judith um
so Dennis I asked about will this be in
the next release of XE and my hands are
somewhat tied in terms of talk about the
next release of XE because it's not yet
a released product however we have never
produced a version of XE where any of
the development features have not been
present and I think you can assume that
that will continue to be the case so
hopefully that indirectly answers your
question without me getting in trouble
with Oracle legal one of the questions
you know when the next XE is supposed to
be released you are all on mute so I'm
gonna
no way I can unmute you'll not commute
you wanna unmute cool can you hear me
mark mark baby here is Johanna
yeah can you hear me hello later yes can
you hear me you're me yes good good good
good
even when I keys coming out when the
when it's released I'm not sure if I
have those dates available beyond that
all of the on premise dates are later in
the year but of course if people want to
play with what stuff now it is available
cloud if you have an Oracle cloud
account we hear a lot of typing maybe
you guys who were who could mute your
line or was this humor hacking the
keyboard now it's not made my hands are
here yeah it sounds like someone
chopping wood or so good old-fashioned
mechanical keyboard by the sound of it
well do we have more questions here
there's one new message what is it
audience good sorry me okay I'll find
any more questions so we got a few
people on the line here
I'm neutral there we go that's where it
is okay so if anyone's got a question
your marks on are live you can also if
you prefer writing the question you can
also uh yeah we haven't little native
type like XML type that's ass that's an
interesting question we the advantage of
having a native type and I'm gonna I'm
gonna mute every want to get my I'm
talking I'll unmute you all at the once
I finished yeah there were several
advantages to having an XML type you
know in particular it may be easier for
tools and things to understand that you
know the content of data was XML however
it also caused a number of problems and
you know for those of you who are around
you know since 92 days it took us a long
introducing a new type into a database
is a very complex process and it takes a
long long time to get all the moving
parts in the database working with a new
data type and it took us several
releases I really you know it's really
11 11 - before we had all of what we
termed the operational completeness that
was you know does XML type work with
feature x of the database and you know
depending on the feature um it took a
long long time for the the answer to be
to be yes these features do work with
xml type so when we started designing
jason one of the decisions we took was
let's not invent another new data type
and give ourselves you know two or three
releases of headaches to get everything
working with Jason because we found with
the fact that stuff didn't work with xml
type um was actually quite a an
impediment to people using the
functionality so when we started doing
jason we said let's just use the
existing jason existing data types I
mean Jason really is just text so let's
use blob club and bar chart two and
we'll deal with the JSON as problem a
different way through the check
constraints so we really have no plans
at the moment to introduce adjacent data
type period we may introduce something
we're kicking around the idea of a
pseudo type um we'll see what comes of
that but it would not be like inventing
an XML type it was a completely new data
type in its own right it might be some
kind of syntactic sugar that at least in
certain circumstances allows it to look
like it's a JSON data type um but even
that has challenges because no one's
ever done that before
and so we need to be very sure that here
there are no untoward side effects of
doing even that amount even that side
says for the moment Katherine your
answer is no we won't be having adjacent
data type and you know there were
reasons that decision was made if there
anything if there a particular reason
why you think one would be useful
I'm gonna mute you only yeah hey I wanna
add a little bit to what you said mark
just a little bit we make love the check
constraint that you add on a varchar law
or blog column and so the database knows
when it sees the varchar result that
this is J before example if you do Jason
generation it was planned to put in
parentheses around no there the double
quotes nonsense and all that information
Mel balls all the way to the clients so
if you for example have Java you can ask
the resultset metadata if we resolve
this jason so there is a is CLOB Jason
or something like this function that you
can invoke so we're gonna work on what
Mark called syntactic sugar
those are ease-of-use features which
make it easier for use for you to deal
with Jason and I think this will get you
to 95% of what a type of giving maybe
even a hundred percent so I think all
this stuff that people are asking for if
they think they need a type this is
gonna stuff that we're gonna give you
without giving you a new date so there's
benefit of having adjacent data type is
having it in a strict structured way
that question I don't understand from
dentists of encode so I mean the
you put in histories and check and
strained on the stuff on the marker you
can't insert something that is not Jason
so sorry and I mean Catherine you're
coming about xquery I mean you know
Jason and another thing that we you know
xquery is a wonderfully wonderfully well
thought-out product it's incredibly
powerful and ninety-five percent of it
no one ever uses so one of the things
about xquery is that we're not looking
at trying to build a Jason query
language that has the complexity of X
query inside it you know we took what we
thought were the good parts of xquery
basically x class and we built inflation
up on which around that and by doing
that we were able to make sure that it
you might keeping it simple it makes it
much easier to optimize and ensure that
you're the Jason processing we do
operates very very efficiently inside
the database so yeah I'm not sure how
it's query applies to having a data type
or not it doesn't you know in Jason we
could you know we can make Jason path as
complex as we as we feel we need to
without having adjacent data type that
or orthogonal to each other but there
are no plans at the moment to produce a
complex language like X query for Jason
processing what we are looking at doing
is adding some update capabilities for
Jason and that's something that you know
we were giving you a path based update
capability at some point in the future
there's also a question about using
sequel XML there are in 12-2 and
enhanced in eighteen ones a set of Jason
operators in sequel that
almost identical in scope to the XML
generation operators that you sound like
you're familiar with and so if you're
wanting to generate Jason from your
relational data you need to look at
things like JSON object JSON array JSON
object AG and JSON array AG those
functions make it very easy to generate
JSON block from its from a sequel
statement in the way that things like
XML element XML attribute XML AG make it
easy to generate an XML document from
your relational data I want to allude to
about comparison about comparing a I
just muted me I just replied to that in
the chat that we've added adjacent equal
operator which does exactly that it
allows you to do a DB equals comparison
especially for JSON objects the ordering
of the key value pairs doesn't really
matter so if you have an object which is
like first name mark last name Drake or
those key values in a different order
that would matter there is a question
from Lloyd what other ways are there to
update a specific key value pair found
within jason string other than reading
the entire jason tweaking the specific
key value pair and then writing the
entire jason back to the column one
thing we've seen so we don't have a JSON
update or jason transform operator yet
what you can do now is to use the PL
sequel object types that marques has
shown where you parse the JSON and then
you and certain fields check if fields
exist were check those values are there
or not and then update to Jason and do
on the database live so you don't have
to ship it all to the client nor fight
there do you want to answer that Marc
sequel yes I mean we know that we're a
bit weak in that and we work on that as
Marc said using path expressions to
specify there is always the case where
the modifications are so complex that
you can't do it in a decorative way and
you need to do it procedural and this is
why we've decided to do that first or
with PLC well you can't program the
changes that you want any complex
business logic is possible and that
greatest way it comes later in future
releases is the question by a guard in
future releases any possibility of
storing property graph data introduced
and our DBMS 12-2 in JSON format I have
to admit I'm not that familiar with what
format the graph data is so is this
actually already Jason date or is this
another representation that you want to
convert it into JSON data
that's a question - so are you familiar
with this mark the I'm not saying the
property yeah I mean this is
representation converted to JSON data so
is the user converting this or is this I
mean I know these all these powerful RDF
graphs but I'm not sure if there's RDF
in Jason I mean the moment you have data
in JSON format you can store it and you
can query it you can also use it for
joins I mean I would assume that if it's
grafted it you would have to do a lot of
joints for self joints in order to
traverse these graphs I don't know I
mean we have a general-purpose jason
storage and query engine so if you jason
represents graph data you should be able
to query it but we have not yet any
graph specific operations also and jason
there is nothing like a like a link or
the ref like an xml you had ID ref ref
something like this something like that
does not exist in jason so those you
would have to extract these values using
Jaycees value or jason table and then
perform joints in sequel in order to
navigate to whatever a value points to I
hope that this answers your question if
not you need to ask more or a bit of
more background returning your pleasure
there is another question from Dennis is
there a special kind of indexing on
Jason columns which have large shows
blogs and index a particular quantity
exactly one I need to find all the
values within value read off the
property color and Postgres sq elders
guide' Nexus thing what connects is cool
so yes we do have an index grab a I want
podcasts yeah always a beer indexes
exact
yes you can extract a value from your
JSON data and store it or index a index
that in a functional nutrient X or
bitmap index or we have the Jason search
index which is an index all approach
which stores your values in an inverted
list so you don't have to specify which
fields you want to index it's its
indexing all the values and then using
an inverted based approach to find this
value to find the relevant values but I
don't know if what corresponds to what
next I would have to do some research
the djinn index is a is a variant of the
text index on would be an index I think
it's related yes it's all it's either
b-tree or its inverted lists and we have
never read this up yes Jeff is well
aware of the bare index I'm gonna be a
program going on okay this is like I
just searched and found we can store
graph representation James yeah you can
also use I mean there the the spatial
team has done some extensions that you
can convert these spatial information
I think graphic facial is somewhat the
same team but I was only involved in the
spatial future you can't convert the GU
Jason that's a standard four point one
teams like geographic information can
Jason format and MapReduce from the
pasty of geometry types so you can write
Jason value-returning sto geometry
and then populate the spatial index with
that for example anybody else yeah we
there's Dennis right something about the
Jason be like a binary Jason format we
also have a binary Jason format if we
have the in-memory option we call it
awesome and the benefit of that I think
it's actually superior to Jason B Jason
B is still a streaming format with
recent we actually can't jump straight
to the values that are of interest so
it's kind of hash table offset approach
right now Olson is only the Jason binary
it's only available in the in-memory
object so if you have a memory and who
store Jason text in a club or varchar on
disk and you enable that table for in
memory we will actually convert it to a
binary Jason format would be much faster
did he do could you please write the
name it's called crystal you won't find
much about it though because we don't
want to Mende because it's plumbing just
tell you that yes yes performance is one
of those areas where we run afoul of
legal if you remember in the old days of
relational databases that are very
carefully orchestrated TPCC ET b c d TB
th numbers but made sure that when
people were comparing performance
everybody was in theory playing on a
level playing field and put the book
unfortunately there is no such standards
for because of no sequel stores so
Oracle legal basically refused to let us
publish any other numbers that we've
done compared with other vendors what I
will say is a bit like the old Rolls
Royce in him years ago the rolls-royce
salesman what the performance of their
rolls-royce was what was the naught to
60 time or what was the brake horsepower
they will simply tell you it's
sufficient to meet your need sir
I think that's very true of our core we
will meet your needs your no sequel
document processing and we are the mix
Facebook or the next Amazon it's very
unlike those cases we probably couldn't
do one of those kind of customers it's
very unlikely that you can come up with
a scenario for using Jason and a sequel
but we will not be able to meet your
performance requirements right and also
has to be clear that you really do an X
and we did some performance measurements
while back with a competing product
where if you actually wrote to the
database the driver told you that the
succeeded once the message hit the
network offer on the client side so this
was before even the data had shipped to
the database it hasn't even reached the
server obviously this gives you a great
latency but it may also mean that you
can lose data so the moment when we put
that product very very successful or
very very popular product among
developers I don't say anything more if
you put that product can have right
acknowledged mode where the where the
database had to basically make sure that
it wrote the data before it told you it
did then that performance drop by a lot
and we were actually yeah better so keep
that in mind if you compare these
products if you can live with losing
data
yeah you may not need the Oracle
database but this is not a market that
we're particularly interested in so I
can't hear anything now it's everyone
muted
no I I muted the one person who seemed
to be generate a lot of background noise
okay good yeah okay are there any other
questions no working on for that I could
do that educated by legal these damn
lawyers let me tell you could beta what
illegal find out you wouldn't be working
on it anymore
oh yeah so sorry no I mean unfortunately
we're not allowed to talk about futures
i'm i've already pushed the envelope of
what we should say in this session
um I think you can guess I think if you
look at the product and we mention a lot
of stuff you can mean yeah I mean the
first time you know if you really want
to find out what we're doing next the
answer has come to open world in October
because that's the first time we're
typically allowed to talk about stuck in
public well mark what if we use an
office session at open world time that
we don't record is that considered are
we then allowed to talk about these
things even I don't even want to think
about doctor asked the powers that be
man yeah this is what they don't let
developers out without product managers
around yeah
oh it's always good I mean let's let's
turn around the question what do you
guys think we should be working on I
mean now you can answer or you can just
type your wish list into the chat here
and we gonna send it to Santa Claus and
see good Jason and the cloud service are
we working on this mark well I mean you
know you can already use Jason in the
cloud because you know we are in
excavator Express we are in GBCs we are
in you know all of the cloud database
cloud services our functionality is
already available you know other other
things we could do with certainly
discussing that a way to update a
specific key value pair without using PL
sequel are we working on that yeah
looking forward for more integration of
Jason with PL sequel good good point
yes not allowed to talk but maybe you
could maybe what what what do you mean
with more integration Sagar what I mean
this is very broad generic general maybe
you could type one two three pieces let
you line by them we're welcome to take
the feedback after of course yeah I mean
our email addresses are fairly easy to
get given our names yeah
be interested in seeing use cases for
the update to to make sure that we've
got everything covered with rain what
were you know whiteboarding at the
moment okay well I am
are there any options to pivot good
query resolves and get in she's not come
in any number of columns can you provide
an example of what you do with XM both
are you talking about that there is an
XML option on the pivot command isn't
that is that what you're referring to
yes it's not actually something we own
but I could certainly check with the
guys and suggest it to them
did the me also think about that and see
if there's anything we can do today but
I don't think there will be because
certainly generate JSON array
I'm asking about getting one JSON
document as a result that would be Jason
gray and maybe right we'd have to look
at what the pivot yeah if you can yeah I
have to look at the pivot in more detail
they did the work for XML so we didn't
get involved in it I have to look and
see if there's anything we can do with
what we have today or whether it will
need more work in which case we'll get
it on their list
so it's a query result which has
different number of columns what if you
do a JSON object of star of that then
you have a JSON object for each row and
then you turn that into an array AG I
don't know because this was well we'll
get back to you on that one
that would be an interesting question to
have in advance then we could have had
the answer mate maybe we'll start the
next session with that question I have
one more question maybe the people
who've already used the product could
just say for how long or people who are
just starting so that we get some
feedback if at what phase you are if
you're just looking into using JSON or
whether you already use that and you
have a very specific question I mean
that may help us for future stuff
whether we should do more overview or
more specific stuff I mean for some
people it seems they already use quite a
bit and others are not even on twelve
one yeah nobody's replying a lot of good
question it seems of 12 - okay just
starting using okay I mean again if
people love information on what they're
doing that that prefer to share private
tribe you privately that's right do you
know how to get hold you know the Fed
our email addresses are basically our
first name dot last name at Oracle comm
really you know got information about
what you're doing that you don't want to
share in a public forum we understand
that we'd still like to get it privately
if possible you okay well
coming up to the top of the hour here I
hope it's been a useful session for you
we'll certainly take that pivot question
offline and see if we can you know if we
can come up with something useful we'll
take that to the opening question for
next Nick the next session yeah thanks a
lot for your time
to good information good feedback and
this time I'll try and get the recording
thing right which will keep Steve happy
and we'll be back in two weeks thanks
