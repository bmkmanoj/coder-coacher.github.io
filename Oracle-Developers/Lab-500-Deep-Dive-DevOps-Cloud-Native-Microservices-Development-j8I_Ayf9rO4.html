laugh and the cloud native DevOps micro
service development workshop in this lab
you're gonna assume the role of Lisa
Jones we're gonna look at our sprint
reports and close out our our sprint in
this case our our job is done so let's
take a look at some of the things that
Lisa would do not only to close out the
active sprint but also to look at the
data historically over time first of all
to close the Sprint also you simply need
to do is click the complete sprint
button it'll prompt her to say hey are
you sure and and there there we go we're
all closed
next we can she can drill into the
administration tab and she can look at
various reports such as the properties
for a given project maybe even delete a
project if need be she can look at a
usage so how much space that were using
on our internal get servers or build
service that sort of thing she can look
at issue tracking so if they're issues
related to releases or products she can
monitor that here over time she can also
look at all the repositories that exist
for any sprint
as well as you know how the code
branched overtime that sort of thing so
all these reports in our case because we
did the entire sprint and probably less
than a day won't be very meaningful but
in reality these particular reports will
give you a lot of information over time
on how your team is executing when they
when they go through a spread</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
