in this presentation we're going to talk
about building chat work services beyond
the joke of the day
why this presentation was giving from
Lundy a little bit of work with him and
Dan ngn from the product it opened him
we made this presentation in open world
and the reason for the presentation is
that the risk understanding that with
the current services you know it
suggests job to great a very advanced
chapel service which is not exactly to
the case the most basic functionalities
you can really get very quickly away
comes do you create something more
advances specifically for more
enterprise customers there're a lot of
configuration you have to take to be
able to do at power so as usual the safe
harbor statement so first a white
conversational I this complete
conversational interface and an
artificial intelligent first and gartner
predicts that actually conversational
communication will supersede the mobile
apps and a way of working with mobile
devices in the next ten years the reason
for this is that well it's a language
engine interface which is way easier to
start you don't really need to learn the
app and how it works you just have to
write or speak snow additional learning
actually and if created in a very
intense way it will be very easy to get
it start it gives you the legged direct
access to value and without the need to
switch between apps which is actually
very powerful so everything you want to
do from a book a book and flight ticket
or the next cinema ticket or paying
bills transfer money everything within
your chat interface and you don't have
to switch
so you just have to talk to it or tap it
so of course the conversational
interface or position ie has also some
challenges one of it for example or some
of them are to be able to integrate
those additional different channel
interfaces just you know we have what
Facebook slack and many more some of
them are Joe's voice integration like
leg so theory or some of the Google
applications and all those channels are
the different interfaces and there are
different requirements and different way
to develop to be able to support those
channels which you have taken
consideration and implementation
complexity also in a security or bracken
integration to be able to design a
dialogue support different languages
another important topic is to get the ie
right because it requires natural
languages process and machine learning
some speech recognition image
recognition sentiment analysis and many
more so if you want to integrate the GUI
advanced chat pod service you need to
take this on consideration so and here
is where the oil come intelligent boat
service can provide some help
it delivers pre-integrated support
across channels and those channels are
actually support is increasing if every
every release its Enterprise ready
Enterprise ready we build back-end
support and integration with work or
products or connectors we have also
embedded ie for the conversational
dialogue allows you to do automatic
recognitions for
intents and entities and many more in
the future has a knowledge service base
and Q&amp;amp;A terms which are dynamically
allows you to model new knowledge into
the boat it has a dialogue and context
the dialogue flow models integrated
inside so that easier for you to create
your application as well as some
analytic information so to be able to
show you how to do how to integrate to
put in a current release from the Oracle
intelligent but I decide to take one of
my use cases from our previous customers
and I don't do this in underling way so
we're going to build a help what is the
help of this chase
chat pod service which basically should
be able to deliver information which is
collected from a different sport
wearable devices like us form our bats
part Watchers mobile devices and so on
so if you have one of those who are
sending tons of information about how
how much steps you do how much if you
run or what kind of activities you had
how much calories you burn during the
day
and when you collect this information
you can also project the information and
generate statistics through the time so
and this is the agenda for today also so
to build that board based on the current
intelligent pod cloud services first we
need to be able to shape the intense so
that understand what the customer is
really asking is in asking about the
calories you burn
how much walk the stairs or how did he
sleep last night and so on another thing
is to be able to recognize different
entities like if it was asking for today
or she would like to have a different
aggregation types like when did I pour
in most calories last week for example
probabilistic parsing like issues last
day yesterday last month and so on
dialog modeling of course back and
integration for the chat bot is very
important
because we need once we know what the
customer is asking we need to be able to
collect them this information from the
back-end service and of course channels
different channels integration for
communication if it's going to be web
hook or Facebook or something else
intent resolution so the internal
resolution is the ability to understand
intent from human ambiguous language and
this is where the machine learning
actually get some bump in the last few
years and basically with today our
algorithms is kind of or Richards
advanced age to understand from a few
sentences to teach a machine to
understand specific intent without ready
to provide a very big size of models for
example if you would like to ask about
how much color is PD born you don't have
to provide all different variations but
it's enough to provide a few sentences
those few appearances which will be
enough to teach the machine to be able
to recognize it in a different
variations of course before you do so
you have to be able to classify your in
tanks you have to know what the custom
or you have to be clear about what the
book is going to support for example how
did I how did i do today or do you know
how I did today or last week or last
Monday and so this is kind of asking
about status probably how far did I walk
this is something probably where you
would like to ask about distance or how
much steps you did or maybe how much
miles of kilometres whoa how active I
was another way or how many calories did
they burn this program would be a
completely different and maybe also the
possibility to us about your daily goals
and just them if you want to also there
could be some more advanced case where
you start to ask about where and when
did they burn must come this last two
weeks or one was kind of a step down
last week
Oh
my highest highest number of floors so
most of them most of those in ten toes
you'd realize even though there for
example in different relations you can
ask about doors calories the main intent
is actually that you have some type of
daily calories so the way how you do
this in Oracle intelligent boat is it
provides you a interface here where this
is already a live demo from from our
current public environment we're here on
the left side you can specify the intent
for example for the retirees you specify
the name of the intent and then you
provide show their answers also at the
same time you have the possibility to
use two different types of intent
training one is more realistic based
model and second one is machine learning
based model for most of the cases to
start experiment with the boat you
probably utilize the trainer the first
one because it's a very quick to start
and to to learn it just takes a few
seconds the machine learning based model
takes little bit longer and probably
would like to use it once you have a
little bit more but a clear picture
about the appearances and here you see I
specify few sentences and even though I
don't have everything here if I asked
about how much hair is did I burn even
though I don't and this in that way it
intensifies here with a very good
certainty that this is actually what I
asked or when did I burn mas color is us
wick so as you can see again indentify
zip up with certainty that actually I'm
asking about my calories all right
entity recognition or also knows and nor
is a very complicated process and
despite all improvements in
in learning the today's algorithms are
still having some weaknesses however
what is it entity recognition is the
capability to automatically recognize
entity meaning from ambiguous language
so this is a very different from a
search if you think about Google search
when you type something there in Google
find it really and you get a very good
result this is because for search the
type of way is that you have a give a
string as such or keywords you want to
do research or the sentence and Google
already indexed or whatever searching in
index or it informations or try by a
different mathematical models to find a
best much as possible
however entity recognition is something
completely passive it doesn't know what
you really want but if it's if you say I
want to get from Hamburg to San
Francisco you should be able to
recognize that actually you have two
entity Hamburg you have an entity San
Francisco and they actually want to pick
it or I want two tickets from Hamburg to
fly tickets from Hamburg to San
Francisco so this is then I have to
recognize that there is a queue and
there is humble from Hamburg to San
Francisco it should be able to recognize
names automatically addresses and so on
so to be able to have those capabilities
you need a very big models teach on a
lot of data to be able to recognize
those entities super good certainty and
this is something which already we
provided in a our solution however
before we continue of course we have to
be able to know okay what are our
requirements which entity actually will
really need and in our case when we want
to create this help what is very helpful
is to know of course what those rest
services which I need to utilize
later in a back-end system what kind of
quorum
really required to be able to get the
information I need so and when I look
about the services then identify okay
the rest of this is the quadric so this
is the daily calories or daily steps or
water intake so those in my case for the
intense then I have a start and end date
so this is the period if I only have a
start date this means that I'm asking
for today but if I have a start and end
date then maybe I'm asking for some pure
like they find it's your last week then
from Monday to Sunday so I have to
specify the taste those days here there
is also a Gregg Asian type where if you
have a phone so this is basically how
much calories you have for a week or the
day or if you ask about max this is
basically if you have Sony for today of
course doesn't make sense because it's
only one value but if you ask about when
was when did I had when did I burn more
calories
last week the decision my personal
aggregation which you want to find the
same which thing you burn more calories
last we can of course user ID to be able
to know for which user you want get you
those queries from the required from
those entities we as I mentioned we just
identify that metric is actually intent
it could be also entity start and end
date this entity aggregation is going to
be Antony and surprisingly is actually
that resolving the start and end date
together with the predation happening
that will be sufficient to producer
people all different type of questions
it just even though it doesn't really
look much it opens you a lot of
possibilities so what do you we have fun
out-of-the-box entities so on the right
side you see the screenshot from all
out-of-the-box entities so we connect to
nice addresses currency date durations
duration and data so you have a
similarities of data if you are today or
yesterday or if you say
happy Christmas epic Valentine's Day and
so on duration is more like last week
last month few last three days from last
week and so on that's odd
and of course you can provide also
custom entities we have a set of custom
entities which are available so this is
for example value each configuration
here let's go back to our environment
here
so on the first step we've seen all
entities we can specify it let me close
on on second tab we have all the
entities we can specify we see here
orders out of the box one yes or no is
also very interesting one because gives
you the opportunity to recognize if
customer wants to confirm something or
denied life yes sure of course and so on
and so on
I additionally create a custom entity
which is an aggregation aggregation is a
value list and here I provide a synonyms
if I see some of those in the sentence
and eventually will know that I owed
like this for some or I have 4 max
average anymore or maybe you know how
much I have left or leftover if you
click on this here you can see that
actually you can change the values so
you can have new synonyms if you remove
some this is the keyword so this is
something which we'll use later if you
remember about the screenshot with the
headers required so this is the
abbreviation type basically also I have
a grouping the grouping is you were
asked about who or people who or how
many people or how many person or how
many individuals so you can specify more
synonyms here
and this is basically going to return me
a key value so I know that actually I'm
asking about grouping and I'm not asking
about me but for more people so how this
is going to work together so you're
interesting here we have a tester and
within this tester we have the first
step is actually where when we start
asking questions we're actually going to
be able to test the full flow so be able
to see the antennas result the entities
back and services call the dialog is
working and so on
the second of all ever gives us the
opportunity to test our intents and
enter this so for example if I ask if
you remember if I speaking how much
calories did I burn then you see the
aggregation is just assumes or nothing
already special and the calories if I
say today then this is the interesting
part here is the part from the
probabilistic identity processor so the
date and today are not just simple
entities potato also probabilistic
parsing probabilistic parsing is as if
you see of the example the first use the
october so you really when you have
something like that you want to know one
exactly the fish and you want to be able
to provide this update so that you can
really start do something with it so
probabilistic person is using dynamic
programming algorithms to compute the
most likely given sense of what is in
the center's so for example addresses
names some of the numbers name dates and
you know onion structure unstructured
text excusable could be used for
information and we have the date
integration support probabilistic
parsing so if you go back here and you
see again how much goes to the one going
today I'm receiving immediately
information I can see that this entity
is parsed
if I say last week then I see that
lovely is for November 12 and 19 also if
I change
here and say for example who burned more
calories
last week this is completely new one so
I see okay it ain't end is properly
recognized we were very good confidence
and then I have aggregation which is you
know most so max then I have a grouping
because asked about who then we have
this duration so for the last week of
course I also have the original decks
which is very useful later when you want
to generate response to a user I can
change this in I can say when the I burn
the most calories last week then we'll
see okay we don't have grouping anymore
creation is already Max and so on or I
can say last month and then I'm getting
all this information here with checking
years later so this is again the
probabilistic parsing with information
and you know you can also do a little
bit more advanced stuff like first
Friday of last month of September or
whatsoever dialogue how to model
dialogue um when you model dialogues
basically it's the behavior of the boats
but at the same time also how you would
like to answer to the user and I have
this rule just has to be friendly short
to the point maybe some type of a joke
which makes the boat look friendly like
in more human life very important rule
here is number one and is that you
should never ever try to pretend that
your body is very smart but it's so
smart like a human because even though
all articles and everything that's each
day about the machine learning and how
good it is there is no machine learning
capability or software or general
machine learning which will allow us to
create the boat that it is so so good
can actually do a conversation for a
long time we don't really be able to
recognize this is a not about you think
that it's a human it takes really in the
best cases two to three minutes with amo
certain spots available today for human
immediately can recognize okay this is
nope this is not really the small one
this is a machine which is there is not
a human on whatsoever so it's important
to be able also to answer a very short
if you cannot answer something or don't
understand something just say hey I'm
just about and I haven't been able to
understand your intent could you please
try to repeat your question in a
different way and for shortly why
shortly because well this is a text
message to you and software you have in
your mobile device and you can answer
something which is having a very long
text and nobody can read up on a reader
it's not pretty
you know pleasant to see it's sometimes
confusing and so on and so on so you
really have to be direct to the point
some dialog examples where you can also
integrate from jokes or something funny
like for example how much did I walk
walk those two months and it is seven
hundred thirty six months by walking the
entire land of Italy you're stepping
away to another cool also achievement
for examples or something like that just
as example how your modeling dialogues
we have a special section inside our or
both here where you get the capability
to model your dialogues this is a llamo
based and currently we have only the
capability to do this here really very
technical one we need to modify the
folder likely and this could get kind of
a big during the time so this is the
example for for the help but right now
which doesn't really have much because
I'm utilizing special components here
which
created more about that a few seconds
later here you have a predefined
component you can utilize where you can
check conditions they intend entities
and so on as you can see this is a very
important component when I type
something like how much curiosity they
burn and basically everything is going
to start here and I configure also some
confidence threshold where if with 70
percent certainty and above it
recognized the intent is going to go
depending on calories or active minutes
or whatever I ask
it's going to go to that action and here
you can model you know a very pretty
very advanced dialogue in the next
coming version this is going to be also
visualize so you don't really have to
type everything but you'll have a more
drag and dropping experience in in the
experience to model those dialogues back
and integration what do you need for
beckon integration so we need to
actually some services in our case this
disorder restful services or I want to
acquire any information which my
customers are asking any type of
back-end information can be integrated
would prefer those restful services
because it's easier to work with
but we also had to integrate saw and
everything else so that's no problem
integration currently he works over
custom components show you a little bit
more about that which are very native
for the dialogue which are just shown
unioning mo so when you create a custom
component you can reduce it there
they're running on OGS which is really
great in my view and you know the
experience in the feedback I'm getting
for because which is very easy very
quick to start and create something back
and could be on any technology of course
the backend you want to integrate no
limitation there as long as you have
access to this back-end
over some type of services you can
integrate it so in our case we have one
service and once we lose them all so we
have only one restful api as I said but
then depending on you know matrix type
and data aggregation itself and user
already I can actually you know answer
all those different types of questions
there is only one second
URL which I'm not showing here this is
the second one is so this one here is
answering all questions about me if I
ask about how much courage I born if I
have hope we're more thorough history
the second overall for that purpose
which I'm not showing here and back and
service response get only what you need
very important so this is a chatbot
solution and when you talk when you
wanted someone to talk to your chat what
you want to be able to instantly reply
to the user if the user waits more than
three four five seconds this is not
really very buton pleasant experience
and maybe you know the customers your
customers not getting satisfied if we're
gonna get a very you know very
impression so I really want to have an
instant responses and not really making
the Kristin I feel like something is
wrong and start repeating questions ask
another question is gonna get math so
it's important and if you can design
your back-end services for your board
that you have a very short responses and
that services can answer in a very short
time
so for example here if I ask something
then this is the information I'm going
to get and some of this information
probably you will not required like
metric for example or tracking data song
because I know what I ask this could be
even more optimized but you have the
amount you have you know if it's you
know calories this is important because
you know for example she was about
distance in Europe maybe want to get
this in kilometers and in u.s. he
probably get this value there
while some poor
distant components so they're the usable
units of course you can define with each
stating your dialogue so you can have it
more than once you can have it
everywhere perform actions that are
specific for your bot and of course
factions you cannot do it out of the box
one usually we use them when some data
has to be returned on tour some business
logic additionally has to be implemented
sometimes those channel specific
response but this is going to get
absolutely curves in the next release
going to provide a specific model for
that can take client specific parameters
and can run of course on ICC MCS and any
node G airspace container did you say
back in integration a piston component a
very simple one so this is everything
actually what you need to start how it
looks you have a few JavaScript files
that message switch back to my editor
here so this is a custom component and
for the custom component to be able to
work you need this component JavaScript
file registry SDK and end shell all
those are provided on polyfoam
platform when you store the or
intelligent both platform you get
additional address on a local host port
80 80 88 and then def resources maybe my
ram is not
open
right now on this one unfortunately I'll
share this next next time but you can
when you install your intelligent
constitutional you can get instance you
have the staff resources where you can
download SDKs and basically what you do
is you create a JavaScript file were you
specify your let me get one which is the
momentum allistic one and more easy to
see for example this one here at the
beginning you have the metadata the
metadata basically the name of the
custom components and form properties if
you want to take some form letters and
support detection here is a how you can
get the values of your parameters which
is specified here then for example in my
case date integration is very important
one I want to know if they're there or
not and I want to be able to parse them
if you remember the original string of
what I said if I said today or yesterday
last week is going to be inside the
original string so that I can use it
later and here now I can do it all my
options where I can specify the world
where I want to call the back end
service then the metric is going to be
the intent start and end date if
available aggregation and the user ID
there is additional feature that I can
actually want recognize depending on
which channel I am what type of user ID
F or not and then here I can use now
those options to be able to execute my
Resco and the data which areas receive
if you remember from the previous slide
here I can use that data for example the
amount of discoveries and the text which
a actually used to ask the question to
generate the text this is a very
simplifying component here just to
understand you know the basics and how
it work
but now that I have the data I can say
okay reply this is from the boat SDK you
born the amount of calories the name if
it's calories as it could be if I ask
for the instance this poem we're gonna
be models and then you know what did I
ask last week or today or last month and
this is going to be sent to the user on
here is the same but in a little bit
more than implementation so I have all
those properties again however here I'm
chatting checking the channel I want to
see if it's a web book channel or if
it's something else to be able to decide
what I want to do I'm getting properties
I can do a little bit more Greg a shin
with them make sure that if aggregation
is not provided this is default one
checking if the dates are there and then
go back again and this is actually ready
work for example so if I go back to my
boat and say how much car is did I burn
today then if everything is working
properly
my name is running
be able to take some responses on see if
the component is super running yes
i panders okay go back see what we have
here I guess we need to change that one
the IP address this this here you go so
now you can try again how much color is
10 i for today
you know has a few points okay so those
values here you get right now are
actually something which I'm randomly
selecting because the services are used
before not working anymore so I'm just
picking some random let us be able to
show you so now that I have this here
this is working let me show you also how
to register this so if you go here to
the components as you seen before if you
click on service here you can provide my
component the information where the
components the components which run on a
mobile cloud service so you can specify
where they are there or on a TCS and any
node GS container so in mine cases it's
so here I'm running in my machine and
this is just an obvious than obvious
application itself which I'm running
here so I'm accessing
I'm accessing them from my local
environment so if you click here you see
this is the location of my crystal
components with some protection username
and password and here if I click on this
one then I see properties are supported
what's the name of the component and
this name of the component here is
something I'm using here inside so this
is how I do this in a dialog again so
show info is just a word is just actions
which I can use to reference so that I
can go to go to here if I want to
directly like the same is with a small
talk and so on so this is the name of
the component here is where I can
provide two variables which we have also
want to have access to and here I have a
transition depending on I could go to a
small talk if I want you in case that
the transition I want you or I can have
a next which is going back to the
previous intent state here and wait for
another question
let's call here I shown you already this
into action and how it works
here how we register the crystal
components again and then channel
support so every channel has a different
bailout and requirements as I can said
and in a in a current release and a
current one zero public release we have
web hooks facebook Messenger and
WebSocket support weather with the next
release which is coming with extending
this we have a common response model so
that you can say I want to respond text
or horizontal card or vertical card or
shut or link or something else you just
say this in in a specific model and you
don't have to take care about the food
channel we integrate it doesn't matter
if Facebook or slack or what's up this
cover motor is going to take care of
this to be able to transform your
response to the JSON model that this
channel is supporting so that when you
see the response in a facebook messenger
for example then you'll see in a way you
want to have it and we provide some
guidelines about how to integrate if
Alex su we have this integration it's
not really complicated in in release one
one becoming next we're going to even
extend and make even more easy to work
with those channels yeah let's go back
here try additionally how much color is
tonight for exhausted
quick as you can see I'm just saying
okay I'm not really sure what you answer
you know can you try again this year as
you realize is also integration with
having some small talk ape abilities
this is currently - a custom component
we provide it's part of my project which
I'm working on where you know you can
just stop the book up and say you know
hi how are you today so this is a
predefined small talk general
capabilities which you can utilize
without the need actually to do this
here inside your box
so they're actually pre-configure than
specified to you not sure what's
happening right now
maybe
there are some issues with the
