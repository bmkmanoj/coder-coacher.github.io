vacuum assistive elver conference about
containers in micro-services java java
ee javascript in that box and mobile we
need cool demos like this robotic arm is
like an IOT workshop hands-on labs good
speakers the roof Douglas Crockford add
in the end about Chris Richards
I'm going to make it really big let's go
global
all around the world North America
Brazil Europe most radius Asia we're
going to call this you can call a
developer world now developers code
we're also coach Oracle code far north
of Fargo good
ohayo gozaimasu
Dozo yo screw welcome to the Oracle code
Tokyo conference this is the tenth
conference in the Oracle code series and
we have a very exciting set of content
that covers a broad range of different
developer topics from containers to
micro services DevOps different
languages like JavaScript Java database
AI machine learning so I think there
should be something everyone here can
learn and find interesting today we have
a big announcement so we are now have a
partnership with docker for the
enterprise store and you can find a
bunch of our Oracle products available
as easily downloadable images any
developers here use docker raise your
hand if you're a docker user ok so that
was a good amount of the audience and
all of you guys can now take advantage
of um you know Oracle database different
Oracle products and services directly in
the docker store just go to the
enterprise docker store and then you can
download commercial images we have all
of our open source images published and
then the source code is available on
github so we the github repo with all of
our open source code and there's more
information at developer to Oracle comm
slash docker for the event today we have
a mobile application which has all the
information for the schedules highly
recommended that you download the mobile
application and use it for the event so
it makes it easier to find the sessions
and the information also the Twitter
handle is at Oracle dev we're going to
be live-streaming interviews in the code
lounge area next door so please follow
the Twitter handle if you're making
we use hashtag Oracle code and you'll be
able to see some of the interviews
posted online via periscope so those
will be live-streamed also speaking of
the code lounge so we have a bunch of
activities happening in the code lounge
we have demonstrations of Oracle cloud
we have CNC cutters we have 3d printers
and other interesting things we have a
bunch of exhibitors who also have cool
technology to show you so I would like
to introduce the next keynote speaker
Phillip Kim who's Director of Product
Management for Oracle cloud is going to
be talking a little bit about Oracle
cloud services for developers so Phillip
would you like to talk a little bit
about what we're going to be doing here
at Oracle code with our technologies
Phil thank you very much
okay hello I am silicon today I'm going
to talk about like know what it is like
building modern application right you
know modern application requires
different requirements and then like no
technologies are shifting you know
nowadays we leverage a cloud like now we
leverage some other kind of technologies
in an API it's becoming more important
than ever and then are there are some
like you know we are building more
smaller modules like no what we call as
a micro service so developers are
looking at different things in terms of
application development right so I'm
going to have a four demos to show the
what it is like you know from a
designing deployment and then developing
and then to the actual like no
leveraging chatbot applications you know
with the help from Akihito song today so
I'll make it more interesting as I can
so this is a very good time to be a
developer you know da 15 years ago 20
years ago we couldn't even imagine you
know what we can do with the
technologies that we have right you know
leveraging cloud right and then chatbots
you know intelligent ever you know it's
like more like a human it has like no
dhadak like artificial intelligence
behind it it can do more kind of like
nadaya use cases so but at the same time
you can leverage these real technologies
for like now you can build it very fast
with the some of the help from the cloud
services providing so what changes we
have you know first we used to develop
like a lot of hard coding like you know
in the code so it was hard to
dynamically change anything now we are
like doing more of like dynamic
configuration of like no application at
the same time without looking at the
application runtime and then we have a
application development lifecycle gotten
shorter it was like no one big waterfall
type of like you know cycle requiring
like tall
months to 18 months of a like long cycle
nowadays we are talking about even zero
time development cycle we're talking
about a few days in even a few hours if
we look at mobile ads like now that's
the case and we used to have a
centralized team one big team like in a
lot of developers many DBAs creating one
huge application as a single deployment
unit now we are changing that to micro
service which is more smaller modules
for legging Adam smaller component means
like you can deploy like in smaller and
then you can change it faster and then
before whenever we have a new
requirement it was pretty much like you
know building another application
nowadays like no we work or not work on
a lot adding new interfaces like a
mobile interface bot interface you know
that's the case we are developing a
functionality first in the past and then
based on the functionality we exposed
api's now that's the other way around
you know now we a P I is very important
to be more efficient we create API first
and then develop based on that API so
these are the lagna some of the modern
application development requirements
like nowadays like we require polyglot
micro services with a different
languages you are able to run like no
different type of a programming
languages and then we need to handle API
like no life cycle designing and then
how to actually enforce it how to secure
your API we need to have a like
continuous integration and development
like net delivery with a DevOps tool
there are tons of DevOps tools like a
fur coat repository and then like Natta
maybe maven built all that and then we
have a like chat pod mobile are becoming
very important interface and channel for
applications we need to monitor them and
then container technology has emerged so
more and more Dockers are you know
leveraged so Oracle as Oracle we are
trying to accommodate
all of these modern application
development requirements with a cloud
platform so to set the context or legmen
we're going to have a demo but letting
those demos are around in a disused case
you know this is I don't know if you
know this team this is a Golden State
Warriors
they're our basketball team in the
United States and then they their home
stadium is Oracle Arena and what in here
like now we are trying to have a more
connections closer engagement with the
fans so that they can buy tickets easier
they can come to the game easier and
then on there we want to enhance their
experience at the game so that they can
come back again to see the game okay so
based on that we're going to develop
this application this application is
chatbot application so fans they're
going to use a facebook messenger and
then ask for like the information about
Golden State Warriors and they can even
buy tickets here to do so we're going to
have a back-end service providing all
the relevant information and then plus
like in a buying ticket logic and we're
going to expose that API to Chapel
application so Chapel application
provide this you know dialogue based
interaction service for the fan so like
I said you know now develop is always
API first so we're going to develop the
API and then get it approved and then
we're going to move on to the next
session with the micro-service I'm going
to bring a key hero sang to the stage he
is at my API developer and then it's all
yours

Kim oh ma APNs vigorous it on Nikita -
moto style - feedback - you gotta make
it exciting
alright so with the Akira song health
alike know we got API design ready and
then let's assume that that also
approved by the like the other teams all
that so we have a you know it's time to
build actual implementation to support
that API we're going to use micro
service to do that you know
micro-service the concept is like the to
briefly cover that before we
traditionally design our application in
one big monolithic application this
monolithic application will have tons of
code just one big application and this
is a single unit of deployment and
nowadays the modern architecture is more
component-based
smaller component so in addy eat each of
the component are focusing on only small
set of features they are independent
from each other they are calling each
other via REST API there they have
typically of their own data store and
they can leverage event programming okay
so by having micro service based
architecture we can release each of the
micro service separately so as a
developer you know you do not have to
understand the whole big chunk of code
and you can focus on your area of a
micro service so in Oracle like you know
what we provide to build a micro service
you know let's start from the developer
tool you're going to need some sort of
like a repository over your code you're
going to need
you know build process based on like new
Hudson or like know some others malignus
so that you can deploy an implement
continuous integration and delivery
you're going to have a leg not have to
deal with the scrum management for your
agile programming and then so we provide
there are many tools out there we pick
the leg node on Vesta tools and then
out-of-the-box cloud environment where
multiple developers can work together
store the code and then manage the
sprint process and then there's a you
know polyglot app dev platform which is
a runtime we support different languages
PHP Java nodejs so it's a darker based
container well you know down when you
deal with the docker
you know if there are multiple instances
of dr you have to manage them and then
scaling out like you know scaling up you
know it's a very complex you're going to
need some sort of like in a scheduler
for that those docker containers you
know we hide all that complexity under
the hood so you just provide application
archive and then we're going to create
docker container behind the scene and
then I will let you use very easily and
manage those docker containers and then
you can make a like DevOps pipeline
starting from like you know build deploy
test and then once approved and then you
can release the software so you can
automate that as much as you can just
easily using our DevOps tool built in
with our developer cloud and we are
providing common services that you can
also leverage for event like you know we
are providing Kafka event hub for event
based programming we're providing
monitoring tool single unified
monitoring tool you can just easily drop
an agent so that we can monitor all the
containers you know about like
application performance users experience
and then all the logs you can also apply
like note you know security for single
sign-on of a leg you know all these can
and so you know it's a very easy to
leverage multiple of services to develop
modern applications so I'm going to go
to demonstration of actual environment
so let's connect with so I'm connecting
to that our cloud service and I have an
account with the application container
which is going to be the runtime and
then our developer cloud service which
is you know what you're looking at here
so this is the developer environment in
Tucson
so developer cloud service provides git
repository for your code and then it
provides all the like note the build
process based on Hudson and then you can
also have you the task management and
then you can define the Sprint and for
your scrum management and Siri in this
page you see streaming of event related
to development activities they could be
commit of code it could be you know
build process done it could be
deployment done or task status changes
they all show up here and let's move on
to the code repository I have a one git
repository of Li you can have a multiple
repository here these code are from like
an atom IDs so you can choose like you
know your favorite IDE could be eclipse
on napkins or JDeveloper we are all
providing plug-ins for this developer
cloud and let's assume like no Sean
Smith developer he just uploaded like
Nodame JavaScript we're like no Dom this
application and then you can look at the
code you can see like the previous
versions of a code and then very soon
we're going to provide a feature of
editing online here let's move on to the
actual build process so here like you
can define a build I have a one build
and you can see the build history here
if I choose the latest one you can see
the although console output about the
logs if you want to debug it if build
process fails this is the log you're
going to get to fix it
and you can know when you configure
these build process right this is the
repository I'm going to look at I'm
going to get the code from this
repository and then this is a very
simple step of our install NPM install
but like you're welcome to add more
steps you can use so like nose-down pure
shell where you can use ant or maven
write or even Gradle so you can mix and
match or like no tools like your
appropriate you know actions for your
build stops build this step to automate
your build after that it's going to be
deployed to the actual runtime I have a
one deployment of configuration go here
it is configured to actually
automatically deploy so deployment
action will kick in whenever there is a
successful build so it's going to grab
the ladies to build artifact and then
invoke back-end service in a back-end
application container to deploy the unit
thank you if I show you the application
container itself which is also very
simple like I said like it's a darker
based but like need you do not have to
worry about liking all the docker images
and orchestration of this docker
containers it's automatically done and
then managed by us so the amount of
things that you need to do for operating
your application here is that we just
control how much memory and how much you
like instance how many instances you're
going to run so you can easily scale out
by adding more instances or then you can
scale up each instance by adding more
memories to it right and then when you
do that we automatically provide a load
balancer in front of it and this is
dynamically configured for based on your
skill scalability action and there's
administration Oh cancel
and then there's a demonstration which
provides all the updates for your
runtime so you do not have to go find
out like no right patches right updates
for your version of a runtime we're
going to do that for you
we're going to make them available here
you just choose to update at your
convenient time okay that was the you
know micro service part let's assume
like no we're we implemented micro
service for our chat bot like no buying
tickets all that now moving on to the
bot bots are becoming very popular and
then why is that
it's because if you look at the study
you know people are generally spending
like you know their time with a twenty
five apps per month twenty five mobile
apps but like you know they're spending
eighty percent of their time for with
the top three apps only
and among those top three apps there is
always messenger app it could be
different messenger app depending on the
region right but like in a cereal I know
lion is popular here but like in a dub
app messenger app is always in one of
those top three so this is a very good
environment where we can have more
interaction with the user so that's why
I like you be a chat bot is becoming
more popular there are two categories of
a chat bot these bots are initial
version was a task oriented so a lot of
thoughts out there are still task
oriented they are very specialized for a
certain task they can only handle those
tasks it's more reactive based on the
users who recast and then so for example
like know transfer fund and show me my
account balance that type of stuff and
then there's a data-driven and
predictive type of bots this one has an
AI built in and it can understand the
context based on the interaction with
the users it can store the state of
interaction
so that it can even recommend and it
Kanaka predict what is the users
intention based on the AI so how do you
build those like intelligent boat so
we're providing Oracle is providing
Oracle intelligent chat bot service to
build intelligent boat there are four
main components here first one is like
no channel configurator channel
configurator is that when you're
building about you don't want to build
alike no different chat pod one for
facebook messenger another one for line
another one Alexa another one for Apple
Siri right there are just different
channels so you define your own chat pod
and then just configure channels to it
next one is a dialogue flow execution so
you need to be able to define the flow
of interaction the dialogue starting
with the greetings and then asking for
users you know what is users interested
and then maybe asking like trying to
upsell a certain product they are all
part of this dialogue flow execution and
this dialogue float execution is
leveraging ai ai will provide the lagna
Dom prediction because the very
important aspect about pod is finding
out users intent based on the natural
language so based on if you know intent
you can come up with out like know the
better recommendation right so that
intent is accuracy of a predicting the
intent gets higher with the AI and then
a lot of data you know actually stored
based on the user's interaction fourth
part is a custom component for actually
connecting back to the backend service
to grab all the data or Legno table to
be able to invoke back-end service to
reserve tickets by ticket things like
that okay so now we you know cover some
like know
components and then as some general
information about looking at this part
so I'm going to show you you know what
it's going to be like actually running a
chatbot application that we built for
this demo and then let me find that app
I'm going to connect to it can we please
change it to the phone
can we change yeah okay great
so I said like you know we are going to
build a chat bot for Golden State
Warriors right so this is like let's
assume that I'm a user I'm a fan I
connected to like no Facebook Messenger
and then like now I'm going to talk to
this chat bot so I'm going to say hello
and then it's waking up the chat pod
right so chat pod response that like no
hello like in a Bob Jones he things like
that I'm Bob Jones and then you know how
can I help you
so I can say like you know Tom when is
the next game I'm interested in the game
when is the next game
okay so and then it tells me like now
the next game is like Nadal March is 8
2017 are you interested in buying ticket
right so it's trying to find my intent
and then I'm going to say ok I'm going
to say yes ok and then it once bought
wants to know more information so that
it can find a leg no Dom better seed
availability for me
so like know what is your budget so I'm
going to say $300 right and then it's
coming up with a leg net a list of a
seat you know pay under $300
I know $300 is expensive but like now I
want to have a good time for myself you
know it's a big gift for me and then
I'll choose like not the expensive seat
$299 one okay and then I'll confirm
right Paulo you know some all of sudden
you know I wanted to change my mind it
gives you like you know $300 alone for
ticket and I need to buy food and drink
all that like it's going to be more
expensive so I'm going to say oh now I'm
going to cut down my budget on the
ticket I'm going to cancel change and
then ask for new seat and then it shows
me the list again and then I'm going to
go to the last one we choose the cheaper
one and then I'm going to choose that
here um it knows like nuts ah okay I
want you I want I need to confirm
so I confirmed it so you know it's um
now I selected $146 heat and then it's
asking like oh are you you selected a
very cheap ticket and then are you
running short on cash I know but body is
very
and you know just direct on that you
know the embarrassing bowlegged knows
I'm gonna say yes I do not have enough
money okay yes I am okay and then bod is
trying to upsell he knows that I had a
$300 budget before and then I only spent
about 146 so I might have a some room so
it's trying to upsell to VIP access VIP
access will provide a free beer so I'm
interested in beer but like you know $50
is a lot so I want to find out like no
dumb
what kind of beer I wanna I don't want
to have a like a very cheap beer
okay what kind of beer do you have
okay so and then it's going to give me
the list of beers right so they have a
you know Guinness they have a Heineken
love and brow they're all premium beers
so I think it's good so you know I'm
going to get those access its give me
that access okay and then it's going to
give me the confirmation okay I can be
view it and then I'm spending hundred
ninety six dollar that's fine okay go
back and I can even generate you know
Apple wallet pass as a ticket right so
that's it I can just carry it to the
game and then get the VIP access as well
so this is the experience that we want
to create for closer engagement with a
user so this is a final outcome now I
want to show can we change back to the
PC I want to show like you know what it
is like actually building that so I'm
gonna you know first there's a channel
integration we had a Facebook right and
then but we can choose to add a
we want it's just another Channel you
know Alexa with Alex I might say Alexa
when is the next game and then the
respond might be same but it's a voice
driven right and then there's an intense
classification so I'm my input is a
natural language and then it understand
my language way from my language if pick
up certain wordings there and then find
out the intent here like nada it was
classifying my intent further with the
budget and there's an entity entity is
the data that Bob is dealing with so
like know things like a beer seat
they're all data right so entity has to
be extracted likeness LC type I chose a
certain seat and then I confirmed it so
that's the kind of like no data that
this bot has to deal with and a lot of
this data is coming from back-end so
there has to be integration component
and as you saw there was dialogue like
starting from the greetings and then
like you know Dom finding out intent my
intent and then as showing the leg net
down seats and then trying to upsell in
the end that's all flow this flow has to
be designed for the bot so that's the
dialogue execution I'm going to show
like no Dom actual our table builder to
build something like that right so I'm
going to make my screen bigger okay
these are the bots I have you know I'm
going to go here for Gerena now you can
clone both application if you want to
change and then use it for some other
use case you go to edit the first page
is about intent so intent is very
important here I have a defined to
intent one is purchase ticket the other
is a show beer list right and then for
purchase ticket
I have a sum like you know natural
language utterances here right so buy
tickets
can I buy tickets you know when is
next game you know if the ball here's
this warnings in natural language it is
I'm giving some hint to the bot that
this one these wordings lead to this
intent right so I want to test out like
in a dub what this AI is coming up with
based on like my input so I can test it
by providing you know my natural
language when it's the next game and
what it's going to do is a based on its
algorithm and then prediction it's going
to come up with out like a ranking of
intent height rankings with a confidence
level it is eighty eight point three
percent confident about purchase tickets
right if I think this is the wrong
answer
then I can choose a different option and
then try to train the bots right so
based on more interaction with the bots
but we'll build up the data back in data
and then come up with a better accuracy
for predicting intent next one is next
page is entity entity is the data that
you know this bot has to deal with you
know so if there if there are any custom
data like a seed or like nah you know
beer they're all defined here and in
this tester section we tested intent but
later let's assume that I want to test
actual dialogue so I can choose but I
can you know my input is same but
instead of just finding intent I want to
know what is the actual response back
from bot right this is actual response
back I can see the actual JSON payload
so as a developer if you want to debug
and test the ball applications this is
where you're going to be doing you're
going to be analyzing the data make sure
that all the data is here in this JSON
payload dialogue execution is managed
here you know using yamo so you're going
to India
you're going to define multiple nodes
and component and so starting with the
greetings and then based on the
customers users response you can go to
different node this node can be nested
as well right so for complex
conversations so it's going to go back
and forth but like it's going to try to
go find the leg net the flow that you
defined in this yellow right and then
the last piece is the integration side
first channel you know like I said we do
not want to build alike no different
BOTS for different channels this is
where you're going to just configure the
new channels you know you're going to
define webhook URL for you know channel
you're going to define three leg or
authorization token here for
authentication you can this is the back
end service that we are using so
designing from apiary the API platform
you know that service that we developed
with micro service will be here and then
this chat bot will leverage that service
to provide this you know fan service
ticket booking service ok going back to
the slide so I just show a few of the
services that we provide for app
development but there are many other
services you know this we are trying to
provide comprehensive cloud platform
services for your application
development you know you saw application
container as one of the back-end service
but we also provide like no full Java EE
compliant the like no cloud service
we're going to provide like in a servlet
function you know mobile application and
plus like node for front-end tooling we
provide SDK for actual like no
developers writing like no JavaScript
all that you can also leverage low code
or no code development tools like our
you know mobile accelerator application
Express app builder all of them or
are kind of you know research-driven or
configuration driven drag-and-drop type
of application development and there are
many common services you saw developer
cloud service this is a good tool for
continuous delivery and we also provide
like meta monitoring solution with the
APM there's a if you want to implement
it with the event based programming you
can leverage CAF kaiser service and then
you saw API management if you want to
develop single sign-on we can leverage
security the identity service we have we
are providing multiple data services you
know heterogeneous data services
enterprise grade like no Oracle database
my sequel no sequel or even big data
there are no integration services for
integrating without SAS applications
other cloud applications or even
on-premise applications we recently
acquired worker worker is you know CI
HDD solution for docker containers the
actual lagina Dom merger transition is
not finalized so we are waiting on that
but this worker will provide like no
better capability around the building
the docker image so starting from the
get it's going to grab all the code and
then you can define the build process
and it's going to produce docker image
container image and that can be deployed
to many different cloud services doctor
container so it's going to build
stronger message around the like no
darker support from our application
development team we are supporting like
no 500-plus
open source so you are welcome to
leverage a lot of open source with our
cloud platform these are the like in the
cloud regions that we have we are adding
in more and more and this is a cloud
platform adoption this is a phenomenal
like you know we have more than 11,000
customers in 142 countries we are
providing 2900 plus application on
marketplace
in 2015 we only had 12 services now in
2017 we have more than 50 services so we
are expanding a lot in very fast pace so
I hope I'll let you know down this
session was a informational to you and
then I hope you can try out our cloud
platform for your own application
development implementation and then
enjoy rest of your day with other
sessions that we provide how we prepared
and thank you very much thank you very
much Bob thanks Steve so just in closing
I want to talk a little bit about
developers and some of the resources
which you guys can get Oh actually I
just I just did something extremely rude
so I I brought coffee on the stage and
none of you have coffee alright see you
soon
fortunately we actually have exactly the
same coffee beans roasted by obscura
coffee roaster in our coffee demo in the
code lounge so even though you probably
don't want this cup maybe you can join
us for a cup of gourmet pour over coffee
in the code lounge yeah okay so after
this but getting back to the
presentation so please join us at the
developer website developer at Oracle
comm resources for modern cloud
development we have videos from the
event we have all the Oracle code event
site is integrated into that on Twitter
we're doing live periscope streaming so
join us at Oracle Dev we also have a
Facebook channel and a YouTube channel
where all the videos from previous
Oracle code events are posted this is
the agenda
for the day yeah I don't know what that
says but hopefully you do I believe
somebody can correct me if I'm wrong we
have a nice lunch coming up and then we
have hands-on labs and sessions after
that three groups of sessions in the
afternoon so a total of six sessions for
the day and then we have a networking
event at the end of the day so please
join us for the networking event as well
here are some of the cities where Oracle
code has been going on we we want
feedback from the conference so if you
do session surveys you can get t-shirts
does anyone like t-shirts okay a little
louder anyone want t-shirts yeah okay so
t-shirt so I I only have a couple
t-shirts here let's go there oh good
catch all right excellent catch poor
throw so everybody can have t-shirts
when you complete the session surveys
and also we have lived for the code
stickers so when you do the cloud trial
signup we have an area in the code
lounge for cloud trial signups you can
get a live for the code sticker for your
laptop as well so please join us in the
code lounge for the interviews for
excellent coffee and other demos like
the CNC cutter the 3d printer all hooked
up to the Oracle cloud we also have a
hacker garden where you can sit down
with speakers and other luminaries and
work together with them on open source
project that is also in the code lounge
Andre amare is the one running that and
thank you very much please enjoy the
conference today
and I get over doing mr. Iijima -
mistake
whatever you scored off your jo koy
