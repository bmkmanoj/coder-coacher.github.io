application development hands-on lab in
this lab we will walk you through the
process of moving an existing
application into a containerized
continuous integration continuous
deployment pipeline and deploy it to a
kubernetes cluster in the Oracle public
cloud during this workshop we will
assume the role of two personas inside a
fetishist company and showcase how they
can work together in the cloud to
complete the project as alpha offices
lead DevOps engineer chip lives in a
world of constant change it seems like
every day new bugs appear application
enhancement requests emerge all at the
same time the CTO pressures him for
faster cloud native service delivery two
years ago when alpha office implemented
a container based micro service
development strategy the simple legacy
paradigm of build and deploy worked
great but as more micro services emerged
so did the complexities and now the team
often struggles to quickly automate
deployments for multi container
applications chip needs options to
enhance alpha offices current continuous
delivery framework he needs an
additional toolset to ensure new
features complex configuration changes
bug fixes and even his crazy experiments
get into the cloud in a timely
repeatable manner a toolset that plugs
into the same source control and
container strategy that alpha office has
invested in and extends the
organization's capabilities to create
detailed pipeline based container
deployments all the while keeping lead
application developers like Derek happy
and productive today chip and Derek
received a high priority project
directly from the vice president of
customer experience you see alpha
Alice's product catalog requires a bug
fix a functional enhancement and an
immediate migration to the cloud the
vice-president needs to handle increased
consumer demand but doesn't have any
remaining budget to procure additional
hardware for the website failure to
perform these tasks in the coming weeks
before the start of the new school year
buying season could severely affect the
consumers online experience and in turn
that come
he's bottom line currently alpha offices
product catalog is running on premises
in three separate docker containers the
polyglot application requires two micro
services the first micro service is
developed in Java and pulls information
from Twitter
the second micro service is written in
JavaScript and accesses the company's
central product database the third
container combines information from both
micro services into a user interface
running on low GS
once the containers are up and running
in the cloud Derek will need to develop
a new set of functions that allow
consumers to write reviews and upload
images showing how they leverage
products since processing and converting
images can be a CPU intensive activity
and there's no real way to predict when
or how many consumers could performing
this task at any given time the team
will be expanding the application into
the world of serverless computing
over the next few hours you will be
assuming the roles of Derrick and chip
as they execute on this project from
start to finish we will begin our
journey by improving the continuous
integration and continuous delivery
process at alpha office by leveraging
worker
worker is a docker based continuous
delivery platform it helps developers
and DevOps engineers like Derrick and
chip containerize applications the
process of building an deploying
applications is automated by chaining
together each individual step in the
process and to easily manageable
workflows
using worker they will create a pipeline
that defines all the required test
builds and deployments for each of the
product catalog source code repositories
the pipelines are comprised of logical
steps defined inside a configuration
file written in the amyl once completed
the pipeline's will then be arranged
inside workflows to perform complex into
end
continuous integration continuous
delivery flows that can take the current
product catalog application from source
to production in the cloud
when the worker configuration is
complete the containers will be stored
inside a docker registry the registry
will store the docker images and
associated documentation to facilitate
rapid reuse across future alpha office
projects
as the workflows execute kubernetes will
extract the images from the docker
registry and deploy them to a kubernetes
cluster the cluster facilitates the
deployment and management of the
containers onto a block of computational
power storage and networking running in
the Oracle cloud infrastructure or OCI
for alpha office OCI combines the raw
computational power to handle any future
consumer demand with a granular control
security and predictability of the
familiar on-premise infrastructure that
they have leveraged for years once the
application is up and running in the
cloud Derek will push out a quick bug
fix to the worker pipeline he will then
leverage a Bluegreen deployment
methodology to test the fix and ensure
it's performing as expected in a
Bluegreen deployment the DevOps team
will run the new version of the Twitter
micro service without bringing down the
old version and once the new version is
fully available Derek will reroute
traffic to the new version by
reconfiguring the kubernetes load
balancer service with the bug fix
operational Derek will then begin
developing the new functionality inside
Oracle's micro service platform here he
can immediately start coding the
function to upload convert and resize
images once complete the FM's server
will expose his code as a rest service
endpoint that can immediately be
consumed by the product catalog user
interface and ensure that the project is
completed before the pending deadline in
lab 100 today you will assume the role
of chip and begin the process by
container izing your existing java
application you will set up worker to
monitor your application source code
repository for commits and automatically
trigger a build test and package
pipeline which will result in a docker
image of your application that is ready
to be deployed in lab 200 you will
assume the role of Derek and create a
kubernetes cluster we will leverage
terraform to configure and provision the
cluster terraform is an open source tool
that greatly simplifies managing
infrastructure for any cloud provider
once created you will deploy your
product catalog micro service and user
interface through a worker
pipeline you will also create both
internal and external facing services
and kubernetes to expose some of your
applications microservices to the
Internet in lab 300 you will assume the
role of Derek and work on fixing a bug
found in the Java micro service that you
deployed to kubernetes you'll make a
code change that fixes the bug commit
the code to github and observe the
execution of a build and deploy workflow
that is managed by your application then
you'll test the application to verify
that the bug fix was successful and lab
400 you will assume the role of chip and
perform a Bluegreen deployment of your
micro service to kubernetes and a
Bluegreen deployment you will run the
new version of the micro service without
bringing down the old version once the
new version is fully available you will
reroute traffic to the new version by
reconfiguring the load balancer service
and lap 500 you will assume the persona
of Derek and extend your application
using a service function you will
install FN on your local machine and
test your function then you will install
an FN server on kubernetes making use of
helm helm is a package manager designed
for kubernetes that makes it easy to
install open source software on your
cluster next you will deploy your
function to the cloud and test it in a
product catalog application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
