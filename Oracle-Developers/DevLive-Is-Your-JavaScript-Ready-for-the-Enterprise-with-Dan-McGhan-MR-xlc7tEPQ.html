belong value from Oracle technology
Network and my guess is them then huh so
then you had a session today about the
JavaScript in the enterprise right so it
yes so so tell us what what was the idea
of the of the top right so a lot of
folks are coming to javascript from
other languages such as Java dotnet
framework and and so on and it's just
kind of a an overview of some of the
things that they can expect and how to
get their code ready for the enterprise
when they move over to JavaScript ok
yeah
and so so how would that happen I mean
is it easy well is it several times
throughout the talk that a lot of these
things there are no simple answers
unfortunately it requires a lot of work
on the folks that are making that
decision to transition to JavaScript
because javascript is a little wild
right now it's kind of a wild rest but
it's a lot of fun - there's a lot of
really neat stuff going on especially if
you're into open source so it can be
exciting mm-hmm
but there's some things to watch out for
as well so like it's changing too fast
and it is have to learn new things all
the time exact well you don't have to
now that's that's actually the very
first point so we went through a
sequence of steps and tips really and so
the very first one was don't follow the
hype and so that for me is perhaps the
most important point of all because I
show a slide with the release dates of
some of the most popular JavaScript
frameworks out there starting back
around 2010 with angular and a few
others too today which is actually
angular 2 the most the most recent and
in fact while we're on angular that this
is exactly the point right so if if an
enterprise chooses to follow the hype
right gets excited and allows the
developers to just choose whatever they
want
of course developers we enjoy learning
we enjoy doing new things and staying
with current trends and so what would
end up happening
you have your first application written
in angular your next one written in
ember the next one written and maybe
view or react and now this new angular 2
is out so now you want to move the tight
script and then you you do all this and
you look back at what you now have
gotten yourself into and it's like well
who's going to maintain these
applications written years ago and the
truth is the developers that are
currently working on angular with
typescript and all these other more
modern frameworks and toolkits they're
not going to want to maintain those are
going to want to rewrite them so I think
this is kind of a developer thing but
the enterprise isn't really so concerned
with that right the enterprise is
looking for productivity stability it's
a different thing that that I think
enterprises are after and so I think the
trick is and again this is tough it's to
find that sweet spot it's not an easy
thing to do and this is why it requires
a bit of effort but going back to
angular and 1 &amp;amp; 2 even if you choose a
major framework created by a major
Enterprise such as Google in this case
there are no guarantees even still right
so angular 1 came out and started really
picking up traction right and and it was
it was hot right everyone was doing
angular and I think Google realized that
that a lot of developers were using
their framework and and even within
their team they said you know we want to
make this the best framework we can make
let's rewrite the entire thing so they
rewrote it was a complete rewrite
they're really saying the other two and
they made a move to typescript which is
not even JavaScript and so it's quite a
transition it is essentially a rewrite
they are trying to do some things to
ease the transition but realistically it
is in fact a rewrite so there are no
guarantees in the space right now it's a
tough place to be honestly so so what's
what's the trick then I mean do you
learn JavaScript and adapt to the new
framework so how that mean is like the
truth is that the folks are learning
JavaScript anyway right when kids are
going to school these days and they
start learning development probably the
first three languages are going to learn
or HTML CSS and JavaScript right so
they're developing this skill set early
on and and then transitioning into
server-side development via nodejs and
perhaps some other framework soon but
they already have this knowledge set and
so over time it's just a unavoidable
trend at least in the near term we're
going to see more and more JavaScript
these days so I think that's what's
happening now enterprises are picking up
on this and they see the trends they see
where the energy is they see where the
developer talent is going and they know
that they need to be there as well so
the trick I'm honestly not entirely sure
there is a trick I mean the best you can
do is choose a JavaScript framework that
shows some maturity some stability has a
dedicated community I think that's
perhaps one of the most important things
when you're choosing a framework for
that matter you know I would I would
have to give props to the ember.js
community they have a fantastic
community they've really done a great
job developing sort of this the API Zoid
a command-line interface that really
makes it easy and somewhat systematic to
to work with that particular framework
on the Oracle side we have Oracle jet
and what they decided to do was you know
take a step back from the hype cycle
choose sort of the best debride of
individual libraries that we're doing
one thing and doing it well right so
when you're talking about data binding
or if you're talking about routing you
know different things that a single-page
application is going to have to do is
just what it does that's what they've
done they've picked and chose you know
what what is the best out there then
then they went and added a bunch of
their own code and libraries for various
components from simple components such
as you know tabs and trees the kinds of
things you normally are going to see in
a lot of enterprise applications and
then they wrote a bunch of very advanced
components and this is when you get into
data visualizations and it's not easy to
do
but they've gone ahead they've written
this library this this layer per
database and it's completely responsive
it's handled very well it works on a lot
of different devices it's of course
accessible it's been
you know they put a lot of effort to it
it's ready to go for enterprises to take
advantage of so I think a lot of a lot
of folks can get a lot of use out of
that and also like a jet will have for
example like I mean a visual interface I
mean so you can also do like part of it
too just by dragging and dropping like
some of their elements oh I think I
think you're referring now to our
application builder cloud service no the
gel jet snow or cold jet okay it could
just be escaping me but I know we have
the application builder cloud service
which is basically a service it provides
you a visual UI okay as you described
yep drag and drop components Rockman and
what it actually does is generates a jet
application for you right excite exactly
right yes that's a very cool tool I saw
a presentation on that at the Oracle
code in New York yeah me too really
blown away they've done a great job
they're moving that product along quite
well right yeah so I mean also if people
don't want to keep up with with the the
programming side of it and at least they
can have right so like an easy way of
develop developers certainly are going
to want to and I think and I think they
should but honestly but maybe not for
the applications are building in the
enterprise so yeah these right visual
kind of builders yeah they can change
the engine essentially what they are is
creating metadata and the great thing
about that rather than code generation
is that you can always swap out the
tools and what you're using behind the
scenes for other things so yeah that
might be the way to go well at least for
the for the short term right I mean is
it makes it easier to just like keep
certain again started as well absolutely
absolutely yes
okay well thank you so much Chuck oh and
how do we find out about more um the
time you mean go to I believe it's
Oracle jet org mm-hm
I can follow the jet team they tweet at
Oracle jet on Twitter yeah I'd be a good
way yep okay cool excellent thank you so
much any any books that you've read that
you really like Oh most recently I was
doing another
imitation on sales is okay so the folks
at sales have released a book if you're
into API development on no js' that was
a good book that that I read recently
just from Manning and I can't remember
the exact title but it's on sales very
very good book cool well thank you then
thank you good appreciate it
Thanks bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
