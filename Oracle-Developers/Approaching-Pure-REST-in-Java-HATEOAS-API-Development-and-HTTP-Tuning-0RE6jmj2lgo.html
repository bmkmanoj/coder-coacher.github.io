i'm here to talk to you about
approaching / arrest in java hey Chavez
inch HP tuning okay first of all I would
like to apologize about my English
because to be honest is my first talk in
english and i'm from brazil with 18
hours flight to be here so it's you can
imagine how I'm anxious and how I am
feeling scared right now you know and
besides that I am a softer craftsman at
the extra the extra is not small company
consulting company in Brazil that work a
lot of hard projects you know that kind
of project that people doesn't want to
do and our destroy and the time of
usually private companies starts to do
the job then destroy the softer and we
assume the legis you know I work with a
lot of stuff specially architettura and
no Seco stuff and my the start of my
career was in our infrastructure
engineer so this kind of new steps love
DevOps is regular stuff for me I work
with the servers or work rita
infrastructure k i'm also a PhD
candidate at UNICAMP uni campus on one
of the biggest universe in brazil i
study basically distributed systems so
this kind of things that we talk here is
there some results of my maths degree
and some of the failures of my maths
degree I you talk with you about later
and then the things that I'm studying in
obtaining in doing at the doctor degree
okay i'm also a Lydia Lydia editor a
teen you oh here is know about in
 you yeah and a board member of
kickin some polos so if you want anyone
want to talk and go to have a nice dip
in Brazil come talk with me after talk
we are always looking for foreigners
speakers ok my twitter is either IGN and
i will put the slides right before the
presentation so you don't have to take
pictures but
okay if you want okay to start and
that's my feeling about the word before
rest you know and III don't know if I
have the fur chin Army's first and she
started to work with big project big
financial projects in Brazil and when I
was a junior software engineer the ark
Tetris tried to explain me how the
things he works you know the first day
in the job fig first day in big projects
they put you in a table and start come
here kid let's talk about how these
octet works and I see something like
that I don't know if this kind of stuff
is is the normal stuff here between
Brazil this is normal you know we call
that the spaghetti architettura I don't
know if it's the right word that people
use their because it's so confusing we
have so many different types of vendors
so many different types of systems
integral in integrating a lot of leg
assistance the especially the tax the
texting and financial things in verse
you is a little bit confusing so you
have to integrate this kind of stuff and
how the system grows you start to have
this kind of stuff you know and in that
point there I was started my career and
I feel scared because I don't know how
to handle I in data in that moment I
don't know what what's the regular
approach to solve these kind of problems
and for me this was the toughest I've on
my life's you know I'm always scary to
put something producing because we have
a lot of patterns you know error my
garba text files to to present you how
this text firewire use it until it's a
shame but in 22 years now the transfer
between two accounts from different
banks in Brazil are made in by text
files you know they chained to a message
driven system two years ago
you can imagine how these things works
and we have a lot of suppliers to solve
these technologies and these suppliers
always try to put some time some kind of
vendor locking you know when you start
to use these these kinds of solutions
for distributed system that solution
works but only works if you buy their
hardware and the software from the same
company you know some guys are doing so
I'm not alone in Brazil with this kind
off of these things and what is time to
see when i start realized there are a
lot of problems with interoperability
and also every vendor every provider he
tries to have in the well and solve the
same problem in the different
implementation you know it's hard then I
I'm at that that time on top of my life
in 2005 i'm looking for a subject for my
master's degree so i decided to study
how these things works and how i can
solve this problem then at that point i
discover soap web service you know if I
pravana back in time I you see me in the
same position talking giving speaks
about that about soap web service in
house hope supposed to to solve this
kind of integration problems you know
but I feel that soap web service I
invested a lot of time to understand of
that make his makeup thesis and after my
master's degree about that and was the
biggest broken promise of my life you
know I think if my wife done with me
when I came back to Brazil is not the
feeling that I feel like when I you
I it's fun but I I talkin in because the
in consulting project in Brazil you
change project every four or five months
you know I work at a lot of perfect in
11 years of my career I work it it
almost went between 12 and 20 different
projects you know so i may have made a
lot of mistakes and suffer about that
and in brazil and events i sometimes I
reached the arc test that i use it to
recommend soap and the poison the
fingers Mia you are doing another
technology again either but at that time
I think and I really think arrest you be
the right way so before I I realized
rest when I feel when I have to make up
with in Brazil proposed architettura
from big companies I only have to do
that you know I have to think myself and
ask and again out that's the work that
I'm trying to do that's what my life
suppose because I know I choose the
technology I use soap and I you suffer
you know but them rest came to save all
the my sins you know every time there I
I made mistakes and we make a kind of
workarounds to integrate this kind of
stuff in Brazil that's what anyone is
that speak Portuguese here no there is a
big word for rock around zebra the name
is gonna be aha you know this can be our
words is a as a pattern that you put
integrate that things but when I
realized rest when I read the thesis
that rest come from I started to think
debts is the solution to this kind of
problems no not the solution to all
problems because there are no silver
bullet in technology I I'm especially I
can give a talk of scenarios that rest
cannot be applied but for these kinds of
integration problems rest Fermi is the
best thing you know but what is rest
this kind of stuff never use
and I will talking next five slides is
the basic introduction thing hold on i
will but i try to put some tombow
everybody the same live okay rest starts
with the rifling dissertation what they
pose our style of art a tree for
distributed systems same as such as
World Wide Web you know he looked like
how the world wide web works double
double double and try to apply this
concept in distributed systems you know
and he calls that representational state
transfer and if you take a look of this
this definition is only I style of
architecture II you know is not a
standard is not a pattern so I see I
think I see the all the talks that were
presented in Java one you can see a lot
of different implementation give
different interpretations of the style
you have to study a lot because if it's
easier when you can follow my standard
you know but I standards I stand there
is not the solution to all the problems
that's the beauty of I style of your
theory you can interpret and interpret
it and put the right solution for your
problem okay but rest have some
principles and constraints you know you
have to follow this principle you manage
to fall on this principles and
constraints should be arresting you must
you have a client-server act a tree that
is easy for us you you must have I
stateless system you know if your system
is stateful you are not rest and you
will have problems of scalability you
know some people promise I put rest and
everything you scale your system will
scale horizontally it's a lie you know
your system only you scale if he had
this prayer prayer prayer requirement
that they have to be
stateless you cannot storage state on
the server okay another thing you have
to be allowed to use caching you have to
use them and reuse the infrastructure
the HTTP infrastructure there as
building like proxy servers like squid
like browser client / axis you know and
you have to have a uniform interface
this uniform interface is based on the
representation of resource I resource is
something that restores on our server
this representation have must have a
unique ID and you only are allowed you
are only allowed to manipulate these
representations to manipulate the
research through the representations you
know you are never touched the resource
you manipulate to their present tales
can be xml json gif PDF for example and
you must use self-described masses of
HTTP you can only interact with the
server through HTTP methods and and the
most important thing in most beauty
thinks is the place both of H was who
knows what Rachel stand for us here h OS
h was Fermi is the worst acronym them
I've never seen you know
when our first take a look wanna talk
about that for years ago a look hate to
us and then what i do in brazil i try to
do here is out talk his speed is
hypermedia is the engine of duplication
stage you know because it's much easier
to understand to then this bad word no
is a bad acronym so but this kind of
stuff is the most important thing to
rest you have this hypermedia as the
engine of your application stage ok the
next thing you you must have a layered
system this is regular for us is normal
or java and optionally you can have
cooled amen you know you can send from
server side you can send some code that
client can execute you know like a
validation and this kind of stuff this
is optionally these six principles are
in the first chapter of rye Feldon and
people complete to completely forget
about that people only read the or seen
the talks the crowd part get booted
pausing the leech to create restore page
resource and stop and that little red
you know so my talk is about what is
about Rachel's is about htp turning is
about caching okay but I have to put
this this default slide in my
presentation of what is our red systems
that's the default slide that people
thinks about rest in the left side you
have the HTTP method get post put bleach
in patch and in the right side you have
the restroom the meaning of this inner
rest assistance if you do a get to a
resource you are retrieving a
representation of this resource if you
post you send a post verb you are
creating a resource in the server you
are if you do a boot by replacing our
resource delete you are deleting a
resource is the new HTTP verbs patch
patch is enough face between approve it
that some browsers implemented and
another browser does implement like
internet explorer accepts the eight so
what the main difference between put and
pet to be there oracle when you do a put
you are replacing all the resource you
know you have you must send the all the
resource data because you are doing a
full replace because in an HTP spec boot
is in the pond independent I didn't
pound and I know I forgot I dependent
you have to have you must have the same
result of to compare two pots and if you
you are if you are trying to do a
partial with dates you need to use the
patch method to be restricted to a
cheapy why we're doing that imagine you
are doing a partial p date with put okay
you are sending only the name of the
resource these these these operations
and you send the name two times you know
and between the first request first put
two requests and the second someone
changed the resource the result will be
will be different isn't it that is the
you know they have the word for some
people like me I don't know if they use
the word in English to testify d you
know from phone jamaica rastafari has
defied that people that try to follow
this kind of principles but there is a
reason besides that we will talk about
this later okay if you worse if your
website of your API are in the front the
first table you are using verbs and
you're using the HTTP method but with
verbs mix it you are not restful you
know if you are using something like
bookmarks 0 / create to create your
resource you are putting verbs you are
not restful that is the main slide you
to understand a lot of stuff in stock
you know in the second table you can
see a representation for example I would
like to create some some resource in the
server if you make up post to the
bookmark you curate something there and
the server returns to you the IG in the
header you know that they create the
rare I that he created okay if you send
if you send a get message to bookmark /
one that one is the IG you retrieve the
representation of the resource can be
XML can be a JSON can miss something if
you do a put you can do a create Arabic
or RP data resource but either you are
saying yeah I can create resource with
post and put yes what's the difference
if I know the real I that will start to
be stored for example if I know that I G
will be the ID will be one I can can use
put to create a resource you know if you
know how the server will you create
these IDs you can use that put two and
if you send a delay delete to the server
each bookmark lash one you delete the
verb ok any questions about that it's
easy part of rest but we ought to have
what you you have to put in my in your
mind in my vision that's the confusion
of architettura style any client can do
any of these operations you know is not
our restriction about what a client can
do you don't have to inform your client
or explain your API to a client to our
client to make restricts about ah you
can delete your resource they can the
server's possibility is to take control
of these dis exes and regulate what the
user can do 10 from the server side this
point of view is a shameful to hate was
works ok if you didn't get that right
now you confused if the next concept and
that kind of things
was my dreams to distributed systems you
know I can't have low coupling because I
using a HTTP protocol that I use it in
order this turf I can scale because I if
I when stateless I can scare easily I
can have fault tolerance for example if
I put a load balancer before my API I
can change the flow of the request and i
can have security there was a nice talk
about red security yesterday jax-rs a
good and if you don't agree with the
secret about rest you are don't you
don't believe in security in web you
know they use open off one or two if you
want to have pain or you can also
implement if you have you already know
but this kind of steps stuff is
extremely misunderstood you know and
what brings me to that point we supposed
that Roy Thomas filled in the guy that
makes stuff putting his blog I read
Fergus what needs to be done to make the
rash architettura style clear on the
notion the hypertext is a constraint in
other words if the engine of the
application stage state and hence the
API is not being driving by hypertext
then it cannot be restful and cannot be
a REST API period is there some manual
somewhere that needs to be broken you
know in that point you feel that this
kind of stuff is a REST API isn't it
everyone everyone do that oh this is a
REST API because he is using the HP
verbs they have wonder why you didn't
ask me about what day / media thing you
know that the main point of the the
first main point of this talk to have a
hat are 22 it should be at your system
be a restful system you have to use
hypermedia
okay but this is a hard concept to
understand in the first approach and
this another teacher Rashard soon makes
a maturity model that make easier to
understand the levels from level zero
level zero the swamp of box to level
three hypermedia control where you can
reach the rolly of rest the promise that
people put on rest okay i will talk
about each level and we r reach the rest
api okay the first level is the swamp of
box you have only one where I won't HTTP
method xml or RPC generally soap plain
old xml running your web server and you
see here post bars /schedule Oh service
you use these where I for everything in
this point you know this is a little
zero of restful api s is how soap are
implemented unfortunately but if you
think about that why where is the HTTP
team i'm also a teacher in brazil and if
you remember this aussie model from
networks the HP are places in
application layer you remember the seven
layer of all aussie on OSI model that
you can put better than all z is you put
the edge HUP in the seven-layer the
application layer layer of protocols why
because HP has a lot of semantics you
have verbs you have status code but
where is this kind of stuff here you are
only use ATP as a transport protocol you
know you are losing all this kind of
stuff that you p can provide to you you
guys stuck it enough for four
layer okay this is a level zero if we
improve your API you came to another
level that with resources in resource
each resource as how his own has his own
where I this level is called where I
tunneling you know but you have one HTTP
verb post or get usually and you are
still using a cheapy and on transport
layer you know you have slot / 1 2 3 4
that's the IG of my slot but you are
still using post for everything you know
you are using this digits this verb you
will only have out specifically write to
each resource ok the next level you have
a lot of rice you have a right use of
HTTP verbs and response codes you are
supposed next state and not behavior you
are doing what people called rest ok see
you can do you are doing a get to / dr.
tatata and asking for our resources and
receive a representation of the resource
if you see the delete for this resource
if you delete the resource you are using
the HTTP verbs who here are at this
level my actual system at this level to
be honest you know but little 0 1 and
two aren't restful I need a rest that's
the problem that's that the actually
problem the problem there they are
recording that that with one of the
mistakes that my consultants do they
sell rest ap ice but for some reason
some projects I stuck it in this level
you know why because you you have a
third level the level of hypermedia
controls the level of a choas hypermedia
as the engine of application
stage the k reason the decay point here
is the self-described of the resource
you know the resource tell the client
how interact with the API that's the
main point of the rest that's the main
point of the low coupling a rest client
only enter a rest application through a
simple where where I that can be for
example index all the main where I offer
our company of our API after that after
entered the index our future actions
that clinch the apt client interact
you'd area with your API i bided through
h was they only follow the links of
rachel's to reach the next resource you
know and to cite another another time
the thesis of high fading this is light
is where he is talking about why he
chose this name rest the name
representation of states transfer was
chosen with the intention to create
image of Halliwell designer web
application behaves a network of a web
page a huge stage machine where they use
navigates through select minx state
transitions resulting the next page next
stage of the application the first time
they will read that distinct seems so
obvious to me you know because we are
using the web like that the whole time
you know when may when you are at amazon
for example selecting the payment of
your user selecting the payment form of
the your your your your books you don't
you don't know who we are incorrect you
know you just show visa or mastercard or
another form of payment you found the
links isn't it and if click in the same
button if the rear I of this bottom
change you
note you realize that your I change if
the boot on which stays the same next
button you click and you can be be sent
to another website to make the payment
without realized that they change the
provider that you wanted the key points
the key points is your API is need to be
a stage machine their user interact you
debase your eye and he follow the links
there is sin the name of the links there
you send to go to the next States okay
that is the beauty of rest understanding
this concept of Rachel's you we've
achieved the loose coupling that was
promised from this technology I make as
an example to you to understand about
how these things works okay these are a
simple representation of a system that
I've developed I change a lot of that
too to fit in this slide but you are
retrieving with a get I slot with IG and
appointments of this lot okay we receive
a kind of xml index xml appointment you
have the information of the slot the
information of the patient and the links
to to get to interact that the main
point to interact with the test of
disappointment what you have to do you
have to only fall on that link you don't
have to know and to couple with the rare
I destiny where I you just follow the
link of this appointment you know if if
you are following the test link and the
server change their I your system will
continue work don't have to change the
client that is the beauty of virtuous
you are navigating through the API to
some links ok but here's come the
question
which verb I can use with this test link
anyone as the client perspective I can
try to make a delete in this test the
server-side have to do to take control
of that and to allow it or no this kind
of stuff if I if I I do like to update
my contact contact info for a client
perspective I send up boot to this link
you know I navigate through my API to
links and this is restful this is a
restful system that Roy proposed in his
thesis ok so the three great inventions
in human history our bure of course
brazilian soccer team and hyperlink ok
so how Jack's RI AP I can provide the
support for me these are the phones
light of a jax-rs API you have them
money I resources map it like card IGN
balance you can choose the ATP method
biding with get you can select what you
produce what work you can accept or near
a p.i n you can use Jack's be to
automatically ization or data but you
also have h was supporting this API you
know you can construct in server-side
links for example response ok order and
I building i'll link you know at the day
of the link in the name of the link in
the kind API are completed the couple i
only look for something that the name of
the link is cheap and if this link are
in the order i mean i am following this
link if the cyber the site should change
the right to change the provider of the
credit card payment for example
our for a class didn't break why because
the link keeps the same we're only
changing the destination okay i will
start my opening shop that's the time
that i'm usually run from the conference
the first misconception is rest is easy
isn't it for the client perspective is
awesome to to consume our REST API but
to build these things in the server side
I really hard okay you have to have this
invention when I first have contact with
rest api i look at it's easy to do that
but it's hard it's hard to to construct
this API this beautiful api's rest
without a choas are not rest stop saying
that I have to stop saying that too
because out the conference I say that
the customers because it is that the
conception of resting is wrong you know
people are stuck eating little chew and
claiming that they have a rest api there
should be no verbs in our where I
there's no reason to put a verb on you
on your where I because if you are doing
that your API you explode for example i
hope i get all accounts get accounts
body gets all caught by idea name that's
testing the start to explode from
detroit explosion and besides that you
are destroying the cash eating when you
do that keep the resource with the names
okay but maybe you talk to me later
other i think i need more than get boost
post put delete and pat semantics my
software is special you know i don't
think so i'm looking for a system that i
cannot modify API
you know why i say that i always ask the
court have someone with this kind of
problem and the who hears work with
financial assistance i'm a lot of
painters like me suffering a lot ah
either how can i transfer from some
occult to another you know i have
account and i need to take the balance
for one account and put in another mmm
that's supposed to be a very reason it
to do that like RPC style no make a
resource called transfer this resource
group the two operations and you can
have the transaction in the server side
you know i will talk about transaction
transactions inch wedges you can always
you always can model your api like a ddd
I love the DD stuff I love this kind of
domain driven development and model
these things of work with this kind of
systems this your domain objects fits
fits perfectly in your waist API because
because you are modeling the same
resource ok if you're asking about
transactions don't do distributed
transactions you know there is some
patterns to start a connection on server
and started another and something gets
wrong we roll back but try hard not to
do that because you will be in trouble
you know allah i believe that your
server can do that kind of stuff if you
are supposed to do a transaction in the
client side put the transactional
resource like the transfer in their
server side you will be safe your life
you p will be easier ok another thing
either I need concurrence how about a
guy sent you updates or take a resource
and update thinking about the last state
you know
ninety-five percent of the system's
doesn't need to take control of that but
if you need wait wait a few seconds I
will talk about that how you can handle
with that kind of stuff okay but more
matrix sting of the day the guy if you
do Rachel's there almost no need for API
documentation you know you are resource
tell the girl clients how to to interact
your API you are using the HTTP
semantics everyone know HP semantics you
know what you are traveling and
navigating through the API only about
the link so it's easy to the customer to
our clients consume your API and also
there are almost no need for API or API
verse on E I don't have to version
especially if my domains change you know
if my domain change I have to to change
my resource but if the guys are doing
Rachel's if I change the way of the
server interact the links are the domain
and the links cannot be changed the name
of the links the path of the links can
change so it's it's you can have this
kind of problem 2 verse on e to either
guys and Facebook or more smarter than
me and he used that kind of stuff but in
our data in your API think about that
you know you can change a lot of stuff a
lot of paths without breaking
compatibility compatibility okay another
amazing of rest
our song is how I can take advantage of
the a cheap east of the AGP server in my
rest service okay usually who is
familiar with infrastructure here first
to Chris guys someone may I have the
best on that so this is kind of stuff
that usually have your service is a big
server the eye of Sodom that's the
nickname of the servers then you have a
reverse proxy what whisper oxy do
imagine if I you are reaching the a lot
of gets the gets verbs to the same
resource the reverse proxy place in the
front of server interpreted that we are
sieving sequential gets and doesn't
query the server you know he his pawns
the the client okay that is amazing for
scalability but you are questioning now
how about stale data stale data if the
things change in the database the
reverse proxy identify that this data
change why because they pass a put
method or a delete to the same resource
they dint you Phi the that you do that
you pass a put before and he stale the
resource and the next time that required
he you think the server imagine what
what that can do you see the power of
the HGP stuff to use the verb and choose
their where I in the middle one you have
the babelfish like a translation proxy
there are some servers proxy that are
using to translate stuff and then a lot
of the proxies that you cannot have
control is the products of the companies
is the products of the cache of their
browser is the all of the products that
we don't have control you can leverage
on that kind of stuff in your assistance
and what is the basics of caching hgp
you have four features basic features
HUP a lowered allow it or not
expiration intermediary caches and star
ball or not okay first thing that you
have to put in mind we will see how to
put these kinds of stuffing or jax-rs
API this is not our abbreviation you
know this is not a rule if you put that
kind of stuff you are asking a favor to
the server to behave in that way you
know you have to have you must have this
kind of stuff in mind you are in
server-side you are asking the server to
store your data he can say no arcane
store without the permission okay iza is
a a hint to the server words works and
when we are HP server decides to cash
first of all is exploration heater you
know you send a reader data time at that
time choose to the resource expires then
the server can reach again you can use
cash control heater you say a max age or
say some some information to control and
the best one is the validation heater
where you have 80 tags etag can be
anything that we want you know you
generate that kind of stuff the ways
that you do but how I can use jax-rs to
do that to set the max age of set
control I instance in sketch control and
set set max age isn't an easy thing to
do yeah that's the beauty of Java and
beauty of jax-rs but the amazing thing
this conditional get who hears know
about conditional get conditional get is
when I asked to the server and a server
say I asked the server like that i have
this version with the e-tag of the
resource I send the server the last
attack there which they received from
the server in the server ask the cash is
valid
if the cache is valid the server answer
at 304 not mod file and I can and I
didn't pay the payload of the transfer a
payload of the the query and if the
crash digit tag is not valid he sent a
200 ok and send a valid resource amazing
it and you can do that in an easily way
you know you reach the fresh tag you
query for a fish that fresh daggara data
you decide how you can produce and and
query this kind of stuff and make a
beauter to evaluate the pretty
conditions of the hcp and then use ask
jax-rs to do this cache control for you
if these things is okay is valid he sent
304 for you if I not valid then you
query the database and query the server
to reach this kind of stuff is sent a
200 in the display information ok this
kind of stuff this kind of principle can
be applied to conditional put and posts
remember when we talk about concurrency
i can send the e-tag to the server to do
it to server check if if the version
that i had in the client side is the
fresh version of the server if not is a
is a error of concurrency you have to
carry again and do the opiate again this
kind of approach solve almost all the
problems of the concurrency know you
send the output with with the e-tag
fresh we tag that receive ok I learned
this stuff i recommend everyone to do
that like in an adoptee a JSR program we
read you know let's talk about Marek I
read all the commits that he do and
it's a lot of learning to you to
understand how these aspects are
evolving on how to take control of the
new stuff you know in in jax-rs there
was a talk current like that I put the
slide in the end you have a new client
API because before jax-rs every client
of jax-rs has his own client API you
know they decided to put a client API a
client api is amazing to interact the
kind of stuff you have a lot of
extension point for login compressing
security beside the jax-rs 2.0 the you
are supposed to do this kind in the
right way hard way with our hands in a
filter implement this kind of stuff and
you have the amazing jax-rs a sync stuff
you know this is a new stuff that are
coming with jax-rs three months ago and
you have a sync API why do you have to
put in mind with this talk you know rest
is amazing thing but you need you to
have the deep knowledge about the
technology that we're working especially
not because I'm blaming you are you
don't know about that because when you
don't know about that you put in in
impossible tough situations for example
very hard to make the rest api you do
the rest api level chew and some
consultant guy a lot of consultants do
in brazil ask for a key a for another
consultant the guy pointed the finger in
USA where's the hypermedia contours
besides that there is a lot of wonderful
stuff stuff that you can do with hey to
us and we th was you can leverage on the
HP turning and cheapest is
infrastructure ok I'll of Java and thank
you for your time
I try to understand the questions okay
if you can't understand that came to me
I will talk yeah yes there is a lot of
approach that you can do to be a
stateless an altercation for example
open off you know is you use twitter
yeah if you do that that kind of
stateless authentication you know
because what's the problem with that
kind of a server-side authentication
imagine you have a load balancer and you
have a lot of servers here and if you
how you these things you work you
authenticating the all servers know okay
you don't have the shared session you
put stick session on a posh a pea patch
server to put the client in the same
server this is a regular approach that a
lot of clients do but if you do that you
can only scaling out because how you're
supposed to turn off machines if you
turn washing machine this guy will be
will be disconnected to be a net 10
dedicated you know so there there is a
lot of I'd recommend to you open off on
open off to I hard don't recommend to
you to implement your wallet education
you know there is a lot of people that I
already do that they're better than I
don't know you hate me I they're better
than me implementation this kind of
stuff because it's hard and the people
are the most of people are stuck it in a
f1a because one of choice between some
problems the owner of the specification
of the outer quits the expert group so
there's some trouble okay you only
stored as a cookie or something
authenticated in your client side okay
no I this is a harder for information I
said if I in my clients I hold on to be
our last version yes yes it is better to
be able to wait to go off to be
establishes established and to move on
to that there's some confusions to about
how this kind of playmate basically they
is not my my main area you know but they
completely changed the way of the
authentication are implemented sorry
oh yeah and you understand there is a
almost there that ok that's basically
thing the main point I can back some
slides I can look here stop it that's
the point the first thing if you only
need to version your API if you are
domains change you know that's why you
break compatibility for example I have a
client a client and address and have
this relation then you see in a choice
for example address link that are you
follow if I change the server that
provide the address don't break doesn't
break compatible compatibility ok but if
I put something in the middle between
for example and you can I guess a
concept a group of address I change the
domain you know if I change the domain I
you break compatibility because they
were changed how the resource are linked
it you know not there how that where I
can reach the resource you understand
that's
no if I change the rule I didn't break
compatibility did you get that if I
change for example I dis contact info I
you access I sternal server that I can
do that I you change the server my
client doesn't break because he's
following the link he is clicking he's
like clicking clicking and contact info
if I keeps the same name doesn't break
onto possibility i can change the server
I can't change you for example something
that I already do that I use it to star
in our client the image in our server I
serve it inside my data center but then
we decided to put in s3 from amazon you
know doesn't break anything because they
click in the link of image i only
redirect him to another site but that's
why i say the out you almost don't have
to do versioning or API because if you
are thinking about that in the upfront
maybe you are modeling the wrong system
you get at it because if you feed a ddd
approach with a resource approach these
things you want to want but if you're
wrong make mistakes or the modern that's
why you had to change and break
compatibility that's you when you need
version 1 and verse with you ok and
another approach to for example let
let's make example you are stuck it in
virtual one for some reason and you rest
anyway we evolved to version two of my
API ok because we may assume deal in a
header offer i request you can send this
data i can exchange the api's for you is
another approach to construct this api
you mean farm for me that I using the
diversion and move from and in the
server the resource send different
representations only point that breaks
and you need version API if your model
evolved in a rare domain model revolve
and you have to map the resource in a
different way
okay did the hell yeah and I see a lot
of the API have as part of the yuan I
itself what's your take I
that's the answer that I can reply that
I can run if you put that for me esta
fatty is a different resource you know
if you put v1 or v2 in your API you are
mapping a different resource that's the
point that make me me a little bit
scared but if you send in the header
data informing that you which version
you are using its regular for me okay
yeah yes it's something that you can use
the my time you mime type you can ask
the server for the mime type to be
specific about mime type mime type is
something that were not well established
stablish it in in resting their people
trained to assist and artists make a
path I standard for this kind of stuff
you know is a some something cloudy yet
but you can use many times to do that or
can only select the version and talk the
clients of your version okay what oh
okay
sorry I standard for um I actually know
that is the main point because it's a
res architetto style this is a world one
that I i think is more educational
purpose you know there is a lot of
people actually I don't use XML that but
people are putting a in JSON a field
colored meta that we can put out this
kind of information about self about
what's the resource the information
about the resource information about the
version of the resource in a self part
of the g'zone but there is no pattern to
do that depends and in any always think
about that when I talk about computer
science computer stuff is hard to say
better if someone's say a techno I ain't
the presentation because I used to say
that about the rest because it's hard to
classify these things because depend
what's your problem you know i can put i
can put advantages of xml disadvantages
of xml advantage of JSON disadvantage of
Jason Jason is pretty goes pretty well
with dynamic language that way why
people are moving one to Jason but
firmly for me if it was I small xml xml
more readable but it's hard choose to
just sees a small xml so i personally
and it's not what is the best i prefer
json representation but if you use an
jux be for example fertilization it's up
for the client the client asked you
about a representation of the resource
that's the point for example if I'm the
client asked me for a json
representation Jack's be sent to him our
JSON if a PDF I can make a printed
version if there was a requirement to
the client you know it's up to the
client to ask me which version of the
resource you remember when I talk about
representations that's the main point i
provide some representation that client
me asking your presentation of the
resource okay more questions sorry
and people are not supposed to do that
but in real life people do that you know
for example a reason to 20 you are doing
that because you are building a big
batch of updates that's why we're asking
me isn't it a reason yes what one of the
approach that I use in my projects is
used a hibernate versioning as the e-tag
you know if you but if you do in SQL it
directs in the database you have
problems too you know I using the LG
java ee team the e-tag as the entity
server version that's the one approach
but maybe you change you change the
version in return hand should work but i
don't tell you about that for example
put some hand on version but that that
will destroy your log you will pay this
price you know
yes the question is what kind of
information I cash I don't forget you
saw Rita ok and in my provider in my
server these reverse proxies cash almost
everything's besides the Monica stuff
for example in we have a the naming be
are you I exchange I work to exchange
bank you know you are by some money I
cash everything besides your own light
data even your balance because that's
the warning if you pass with a loop date
through my reverse proxy the reverse
proxy we stay all the data and cache in
the right way if there's some another
server and other thing that interact
with the web server without passing my
rest api you being problems in some
clients days they don't like this idea
for a database updates for another
systems so we decide should doesn't
start cashing but the main point here if
you put max age for example to a minimum
20 if we form the proxy servers to
doesn't store you're caching doesn't
doesn't force him to doesn't start you
have to to live with that kind of stuff
you understand if I if I am a DevOps guy
and I make a mistake in the
configuration of our squid server this
quit server will behave improperly you
have to to live with that that's why I
so important version in a database and
this kind of team
all
the the question is is everyone
reasonably list and they have to know
how to interact with your domain you
know that's why they look for the index
page and read read the verbs you know if
the reverb they know how to interact and
my AP is are supposed to be carried
queried by every property that the
client receive you know if you do that I
get and receive account number you are
you can take from this point of view you
can quiver me about with this kind of
stuff is the server and part of the the
security should don't don't let you do
that you know the server can do that if
you are my customer of my API you can do
everything that we want you know is mine
is my task to protect my API that's a
it's a different point of view you know
because you are point pointing a lot of
a lot of a lot of stuff in there in the
whole of the Indian the shoulders of the
server you know it's but that's the way
the only way that H was work you know
because you can try to delete your
account because if they're not allow you
to try that you are how you came at
discovery how happy I epi works without
me tell me all this this resource you
can do a catch can do a boost you look
at my point and it said thank you i will
be here if you want to talk with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
