for jetbrains you probably heard about
our ID products IntelliJ and resharper
if you work in dotnet and today I talk
not about an IDE but about a programming
language named Catlin which I work on so
how many of you know anything about
Gatlin
not everybody so I'll give a very short
introduction to give an idea yeah so
Catlin the name itself comes from here
it's an island in the Gulf of Finland in
the Baltic Sea very far away from here
it's where I live I don't live on the
island itself I live in a bigger city
next to the island called st. Petersburg
so thinking behind it was that Java is
an island and a language which has to
serve the Java platform should be also
named after an island so we named it
after the nearest one also the name is
used by NATO to code named a ship Soviet
battleship a destroyer so if you if you
google for Catalan you find the language
and Wikipedia entry for catalan class
destroyer the language is not meant for
class destruction by any means but this
is what it is and interestingly enough
there are other languages having their
own means of transportation like this
one for example is Haskell it's an
attack transport in America man and this
is Scala yeah so somehow it's all about
how you get round and I personally like
the destroyer better than other things
there so a few bullet points about
language
it's a statically typed language so it's
in the same family as Java and Scala and
c-sharp not the same class of languages
as Ruby groovy Python so on so it's a
static one others are dynamic ones it's
compiled to JVM bytecode or
the script so you can run it either on
your JVM or in the browser for example
JVM version is compatible with Java both
ways so you can freely mix calling code
and Java code your project you can have
: Java files next to each other and they
will use other definitions both ways
the main idea behind the language is to
basically provide decent programming
experience to a modern programmer right
so Java is a little bit outdated if in
Java it is so our goal is readability
because it's for industrial people and
we read a lot more code when we write we
rely on simple but powerful abstractions
we evaluate performance and with daily
tooling since we're JetBrains
we are after tooling all the time it's
all open source as well as IntelliJ by
the way so everything we make you can
use today it's not released yet but it's
there in the open at the m6 stage so
enjoy so today's talk isn't about it's
not like an introduction to the language
it's about a particular way of using the
language to make the web development
nicer than it is today so it's always
interesting to use a silly kind of
metaphor in your talk so my todays silly
metaphor is roads so in my opinion when
you're making a project it's kind of a
journey and the road you're taking is
the tools the languages the overall
infrastructure you're using so my
opinion is that today's web programming
is very much like this so you have like
this many bumps ahead of you so one
thing is that web programming didn't
change much since I did it last time ten
years ago so we're basically there today
and yeah there were a few things that
can be fixed now introduce them a little
later so after I
do the introduction why I hate the way
we make web prog web applications today
we'll think about what it should look
like like a decent Road like this and
then we'll proceed to how this distant
road can be built like what you do in
Gatlin to actually make the whole
infrastructure smooth and nice and then
we'll dream a little bit about what we
could get a little later if you have any
questions at any point please raise your
hand and I'll try to answer any
questions at this point the question is
what JVM version do at Target it would
target six so it's usable everywhere as
soon as a seven or eight get enough
adoption well target 70 any more
questions okay so I'll start with
complaining about the way we are doing
web programming today so why I think the
road is bumpy so this is the the set of
basic components we use for web
development today so we have different
tools for different purposes we have
HTML 4 markup
CSS for styling JavaScript for client
scripting Java for business logic and
JSP or some other templating engine for
gluing basically pieces of HTML together
so these are like five technologies now
imagine an alien programmer whom you're
telling about your project okay I'm
going to make this basic application I'm
going to use five languages to make it
it's like why why not 12 so the first
point is that we're probably using too
many different languages to do one
reasonably simple thing so the the main
issue here is not that we have to learn
five languages which may be also a
problem but that those languages don't
really speak very well to each other so
we have to integrate them
they're integrating a very unpleasant
way so my first problem is too many
languages my second problem has
something to do with the difference
between an ape and a human being so
what's what's the difference how we're
different from apes
yeah we're somewhat smarter but that's
somehow qualitative what's that that's
hair yeah the right so one of the good
point yeah one of the widely-used
answers to this question is that human
beings are different in their capacity
to abstract thinking so it's believed
that it cannot abstract and people can
and this is very much how things are
different between HTML and CSS and
programming languages so I'm saying here
that HTML and CSS are not programming
languages because they don't have means
of abstraction HTML and CSS are
basically data formats they are not for
programmers because what programmers do
they abstract and reuse in HTML and CSS
there is no way you make any kind of
abstraction if we take HTML ok I have my
way out how do I reuse parts of my HTML
code
well I copy and paste probably or I
employ an external language the
templating engine to glue pieces
together and still I don't get
components really I get some nasty tag
libs and stuff like that and the same
thing in CSS if I want my favorite shade
shade of purple to be used all over the
page I have maybe five or ten
occurrences of that constant in my CSS
file or copy and paste right and then a
designer comes up to me and says okay
this this shade is not perfect you know
you want to change it a little bit here
and here and then I have to go and
replace some occurrences with something
else
how did normal people come about this
problem they introduced named
constants right so you just give it a
name and he changed it once not in every
occurrence but CSS doesn't give you this
opportunity and this is mitigated by
again bringing another language in like
class or SAS which is well it's a really
cutting-edge technology today right so
in web development something that has
named constants it's cutting edge
technology which is somehow interesting
so my second problem is that the core
language is we use their HTML and CSS
have no means of reuse and abstraction
so we copy and paste all the time and
it's normal like we copy and paste and
we're proud of it so another fun joke is
that there are libraries of CSS styles
like Twitter bootstrap for example so
wonderful library how it works
gives you many styles for like common
components like buttons and stuff but if
you want your own color scheme you go to
the website you enter a bunch of
parameters there and they generate you
your personalized version of bootstrap
right that's well in my time it was
called a function with parameters right
so it should be a library that has a
function that takes the color as a
parameter but here you have to like
manually go to the website and or
something get the files back and deploy
them makes no sense to me so my second
problem is black of means or
abstractions any questions at this point
ok so to the third problem third problem
is about discipline so when we do web
development many of the things we're
using are not checked other than
manually for example if my templates
generate links to pages in my
application I'm never sure that my links
are not broken
I'm just generating some text this text
has never checked it can only be
manually tested and even manual testing
may not reveal that somewhere I forgot
some parameter so maybe the link the
link base is okay but some parameters
are missing
so this the nature of this is that we
don't have any kind of static checking
for anything if I reference a CSS style
I'm never sure it's there maybe the page
looks ok but some styles are missing
when I generate HTML I'm never sure it
will be always correctly structured
maybe I put somewhere a mess some
somewhere up in the template so and so
forth it's never checked sound tools do
some checking no tool does really good
check
so web development today is associated
with substantial courage you have to
believe you know in that you didn't mess
things up or you have to invest a lot in
the testing so this is my third problem
lack of static check
so to summarize I have three problems to
many languages now a fraction no static
checks in my solution obviously as a
language developer my solution is use
one language which is good enough to
serve all five purposes we have there to
provide your abstraction and to provide
the necessary static checks any
questions here and you probably can
guess what the language is JavaScript
all right
so disclaimer here and I will be giving
you examples of using a particular web
framework written in Catalan it's not
finished yet
you can use it it's released under
version zero point something it's being
changed so my examples may be stale in a
month from now but anyway the main point
here is to convey the idea the design
principle not the particular framework
so I don't care too much about the
particular ways that framework is done
it's more about how you use the language
to mitigate all the problems I named
okay so first let's get some idea on how
one language can unify so many purposes
so how do do you do say mark up in
cotton this is what it looks like so
here is my HTML
those wonderful angle brackets I'm so
fun of them everybody is I guess yeah so
if you want this structure in your
program in Catalan it looks like this
it's a little fewer brackets and
although otherwise it's the same
structure also now that here is the link
and the link is not a string but
something more reasonable I'll tell you
about it a little later any questions
here I would like to point out that this
is not like a special language construct
we don't have HTML built into Kotlin
it's just a bunch of function calls so
it's a library that basically allows you
to make a DSL and column that looks more
or less like HTML and basically at
runtime is just run and translated into
this text which is later delivered to
the decline questions yeah okay so I'll
tell you more about it later but the
idea here is that this plus turns a
constant into something live that is
attached somewhere because otherwise
it's just stale constant in the veneer
yeah so it's it's a function that
attaches the constant to the tag
otherwise yeah you can think of it as a
content of avataq more questions all
right yeah by the way I'm sorry them
using my pointer only one screen I have
only one pair wise so I can monitor two
screens but feel free to move to to this
part of the audience okay so this is
what CSS looks like CSS is pretty much
the same way right even the syntax is
close so we have all the units and
everything and this is tight so you
cannot assign an arbitrary string to
width and can't assign an unknown
constant to text-align so if you have a
custom attribute or if you're smarter
than the library of course you can you
have a way to do whatever you like but
normally your typed and it works this
way okay so I'll be showing you an
application written with this framework
it's a silly example done
for functionality but for demonstration
it will display less files in a
directory local directory in my laptop
and the sub directories are links so you
can go and see what's in them so the
basic principle for this web framework
like for any other web framework is that
you type something in the browser
address bar it gets processed by the
framework itself and when it gets to
your code it's already structured in a
well typed way so if here you had some
kind of an address it gets translated to
an object which has a type and you can
use it structurally not just matching
strings but doing something better and
the same thing happens when you generate
references and I'll get to it with the
examples in a second so let's do it
right now and yeah so we'll be looking
at carbon code and if you have any
questions about the syntax just put up
your hands and I'll tell you things but
basically what we have here this is an
example of how you set up your routing
for a web application so this file tells
the framework what addresses you can
answer on we have a route slash list and
slash tree so if I in my browser just
say localhost this is what I get the
home page right and then I can navigate
to a list or two to three now I have
three classes here and every class
defines the behavior for a particular
request we can answer so what do I do
here in the annotations these are
annotations annotations specify the
address the classes specify the
parameters my addresses may have so
let's start with the easiest one my
index is the route and what my request
does it returns something called index
view which tells you how to render the
index page so this is what it looks like
the index page itself plain HTML you
probably can read it any questions about
what it's doing
silence okay so we have a header here
then it's a list with two items right so
and this is a program it's not
it looks declarative it works an in
reasonable way but you can use
programming language operators here like
if I want to repeat this ten times I can
do it with a for loop and magically I
can have ten times list other than one
time list right so this particular thing
does make much of a difference so I'll
put my index here so if I rerun this
I'll get my list of eleven items first
ten of them are lists and the last one
is tree so this is this is how a
language helps you do templating right
so we started with basically with plain
HTML now we have a template without
changing languages right so we were in
the same language we have some logic
there it works any questions yeah
exactly
yeah so the statement is that normally
our UI is our layouts are done by some
special people who work with HTML and
CSS and the rest is done by programmers
but actually your templates your jsps
are not that different from this right
so it's still the same people working on
the some people working on the code part
of the template and some people working
on the HTML part of the template so
there is one thing that helps if your
designers were HTML people are really
against any other syntax if they're in
love with their angled brackets we have
a plug-in that just converts HTML to
this so you can have your HTML and just
copy and paste it here and we'll be
converted on the fly otherwise yeah you
have to change the format and and use it
in the same way you used to because it's
still a template you still have some
logic there in some markup there now way
around it any questions any more
questions statements objections all
right so so this is how we cover two
things markup and templating now what
about styles so my Styles look pretty
much like this same CSS and of course I
can take this expression and introduce a
constant and use it everywhere obviously
so it's a programming language I can
even extract a part of a style as a
function and reapply it in many many
places so and so forth and of course I
can see where this style is used and
navigate the call sites and everything
so three things are covered templates
HTML CSS well of course
business logic is trivially
godwyn because otherwise you write it in
some programming language anyway now
let's see how type safety works so for
type safety the good example will be
links so how do I make sure that no
links are broken in my program this is
how I create links here's my anchor tag
with href which has it it's not a string
it has a type link which is basically
one of the requests I defined here so if
I did not define something here I cannot
reference it well of course I can have
external references and there are means
to mitigate that but if I if I'm
speaking about internal links this is
how I do it
so if I have a page that's not here it
can be answered at all so I can create a
link
another thing is parameters so if I want
my file list for example to have an
extra parameter say greeting right I
have to declare it here and then pass it
somehow to the rendering but the idea is
that as soon as I have it here my code
does not compile unless I actually pass
the value for that parameter so if I get
back to the index page I have a compile
error here and it won't run until I pass
something here so I can say that I'm
coming from home
and now when I recompile if all the
links are okay it will let me run it
otherwise it will break and tell me that
okay I forgot that somewhere else
I had another link to that same page so
I have to provide some data here doesn't
matter what what exactly but it will
statically check without any testers
involved any money paid but for the
electricity it will check automatically
that all the links are working correctly
which is I think important because these
bugs are really unpleasant yeah so
second thing we get is type safety and
then let's have a look at
abstraction and reuse how we do that so
this is my list page with oh I don't
have it run sorry I updated the
application and didn't restart it
so my table page that displays a list of
the directory content it starts of
course with some error checking and then
we have a table so table table has a
header then we have a reference to the
parent directory so on so forth the
interesting parts probably the most
interesting part comes in here when you
have to generate this this green white
rows alternating colors here so of
course you have a for loop and you have
a flag that tells you whether it's
another even row and you can select a
class for your TR here it is it's a CSS
class here that's selected based on some
logic then you render the references and
then you rendered the permissions like
these things here and how I do it I have
a function for rendering permissions
because maybe I want to render
permissions in different places in my
program and I don't have to do anything
really fancy because it's just a
function that I can be used in many
places and here it is it just creates a
table and puts things in there and even
inside it has a local function to redo
not to write the same thing three times
here make sense feel free to ask
questions I'll tell you more about how
these things work I mean how the
functions are defined a little later but
the general idea that I can't use
functions here more or less freely
should be clear any questions another
thing is that my HTML structure is
checked for me so that I cannot use for
example a list item outside a list here
it's red because it's not defined
outside the list so it's harder for
me to generate somehow broken HTML then
when I have no checking okay so now
let's proceed to the part where we
create our own our own DSL so this kind
of dsl is called typesafe builder we
call it builder after groovy people
growing people have their dynamic
builders and ours are as good but static
statically checked and performant okay
so a short tutorial on how you make such
dsl work in Gatlin so let's start with
the components we need to put together
to get this working first component is
higher-order functions if you heard
anything about functional programming
you know that higher-order functions are
the foundation for functional
programming the idea there is that your
function one function can take another
function as an argument so you can call
a and pass a function B as an argument
to it so this is how it's done in
Catalan I have my function let this is a
generic parameter T just for led to work
on any type let has two parameters at T
and something called body which has type
function from T to unit unit is no
interesting value so basically like
Javas void but better so to call that I
have to pass two things some value and a
function that can be applied to that
value and all it does is just apply the
function nothing interesting so I can
use let this way here I pass as sum of
two and three and a function that takes
an X and prints x squared right so this
is the way you use higher order
functions anywhere like you can filter a
list this way and many other things too
there is better syntax and column for
this so I can't pass my function as a
lambda expression like this so those
curly braces in an arrow mean that this
is a function literal and I must
function and coughlin allows you to pass
the last lambda expression last
anonymous function outside the
parentheses so that you get this kind of
syntax where it's more like a control
structure the DSL looks like looks nicer
this way so my let's it's absolutely the
same code just differently formatted it
looks now more like an if for awhile or
other control structures we don't have
currying as such in the language there
is so you can have a function that
returns another function and no you
cannot pass many lambdas in a row so
only one last lambda on a call can be
passed outside the parent parenthesis
but actually nobody is crazy enough to
want to pass main Yolanda's there
because it's it's unreadable anyway
that's all we does not do not allow this
so first component is higher-order
functions then we can proceed to the
next component which is extension
functions and this is a very nice
feature that not so many languages
actually have but the newer languages
tend to have it so the idea is if I have
a library class for example string
I usually well usually people are
smarter than library writers in the
sense that they know that this method
was really needed in that class but for
some reason it's not there the reason is
obvious library writers can't cover all
the methods of course but we want new
methods on string so what we do normally
is create a string get a class and if
you don't have one I don't believe you
so we create a string you do class and
make ugly calls like string G Alou of
string and so extension functions give
us another way of writing the same thing
down so here I can define a function
last character on string which actually
it is a static function it's no magic we
are not going to the string class not
altering byte codes we're
not introducing a new method into a
class it's actually just a static method
outside the class you cannot access
private members no no magic there but do
you have this nice syntax of defining a
function on a string having this inside
so this is the string we pass here and
the best part is that you can call it
with a dot like a normal method and of
course you have it in code completion
here and you know it's more or less as
good as any member so yeah yeah the
question is what's the scope of an
extension function declaration so if it
is not defined in place you have to
explicitly import it from some other
place so it depends on where you define
it but normally they're defined in
packages so you can import either all
packages all functions in a package or
just individual functions by name yeah
so yeah and if you have a class like you
have many functions main extension
functions class you have to somehow
mitigate on the import level if you have
a clash between an extension function
and a member member always wins so there
is no magic there yeah so extension
functions are very simple and very nice
means of making libraries better like
you can take a really shitty old Java
library that has no API whatever I mean
no useable API and turn it into a very
nice usable library by just introducing
five ten extension methods like really
parts of the Java libraries there are a
little bit behind like Java IO file for
example having no get extension method
for it and things like that are very
easily monkey patch this way and you get
really nice library with no effort so my
second component is extension functions
then when you multiply higher-order
functions by extension functions you get
higher-order extension so let's see how
it works here is my old lip it's the
same I showed you before lead function
takes
tea and a function from Tita unit here
is a function that is almost the same
but it takes a tea and an extension to
tea so my body here is not a function of
T to unit it's an extension to tea to
unit and I still apply it in the body so
I don't do anything different I just
pass the argument in a different place
and what I'm after is syntax actually
because the way I can use this with
function it's like this I can say with
string builder and then in my curly
braces in a lambda I can say say append
and that will be a pen on this string
builder because it's of course this dot
append and as an extension function can
have this implicitly in the body which
can be omitted
I get place append without the projects
this this function basically lets you
write things like some of us did in
Pascal there was this with operator a
building construct in the language that
allowed you to save on qualifications a
little bit so this is how this is
expressed in Catalan as a function so we
have with string builder is just as
different syntax for the same thing
again with string builder append here
and then append a little bit more in the
loop very simple but it's already a
little bit like our builders before
right so now we can put things together
any questions at this point
ok so now we'll shape it more like a
builder gradually so first thing we do
we define classes for lists and list
items and then if I create a list this
is a constructor invocation we don't
have a new operator because it's not the
so if I create a list then with this
list I can't call its methods l eyes as
many as I like right so this is already
very much like a builder of course you
don't have to use with you can write
your specialized function with the
speaking name here is my UL function
which is doing absolutely the same thing
it
an extension to a list and just calls it
and that's it crates listen calls it so
I can say ul and then many allies inside
the next step will be to have it to have
Li as a method in ul right I have a list
it has items inside the item function
takes an extension and creates new item
added to the items collection and this
is how you use it
so it's list and list items inside
that's it and if I try to use the item
outside the list it doesn't work because
it's not a member of global in space
it's only a member of the list class
questions okay so it's actually two
features very important on their own put
together give you a very nice DSL
facility in the language so this is
basically how all the DSL czar done for
HTML for CSS for many other things yeah
and it gives you both this ability to
use things as functions because this
this is plain code you can introduce
functions you can use constants stuff
like that it gives you type safety again
this thing doesn't let you do nasty
things and it's a unified language for
everything this way questions okay
no questions do I want to show you
anything no all right
so to summarize so we have a framework
that uses a coven as a DSL definition
language basically to embed things like
HTML and CSS and using the carbons being
programming language to have abstraction
and to have basically templating
capabilities there and also column being
a static language to give you
checking so we have our four basic needs
covered its markup styling templating
and business logic so here we are more
or less good any objections yeah exactly
yes so my main point there so to repeat
the question
the it was an objection that you still
need to know the semantics of CSS of
HTML and of all the other things you're
using yes so my initial point was that
many languages is bad not because we
have to learn five languages but because
they don't integrate very well yeah so
in this framework they integrate very
easily so all the references are checked
everything can be reused in the same way
so on so forth so its unification on the
tooling level not on the concept level
because having five different needs
addressed means five different libraries
or five different languages anyway five
different ways of thinking that's
inevitable what's what we can do and
what we do is unify the like how you do
things not what you do make sense yeah
I think there is substantial inspiration
in groovy builders because this is the
way of embedding declarative languages
into an imperative ones this is one big
inspiration then there is a well we are
addressing the same problems many other
projects are addressing one by one like
class addresses CSS problems
particularly and templating languages
address problems of reusing HTML
particularly so on so forth so we
basically put many things together it's
not like we invented the whole thing
from scratch no I don't think there is
no so Scala's best is Play Framework
which is wonderful but in different ways
so it's they don't have this type safety
thing for example and many other things
too so no I'm not aware of anything
really close to this so in functionality
you have of course many things working
pretty much the same way for example
Microsoft razor + very good ID works
reasonably well because ID checks many
things for you it's not checked on the
build server for example so if somebody
checks in something bad you don't know
until you actually check it with the ID
but otherwise the functionality is more
or less there but it's there are
different syntax for everything and it's
still very heterogeneous to ecology so
you don't have the freedom of reusing
everything the same way and stuff like
that there we're probably unique my
questions ok so that was my demo and now
we can go for a dream because I only
show you four things and there were five
languages I talked about so the missing
part is JavaScript and it is something
we don't have working yet but we're
working on it so it's in the realm of
dreams but the dreams are coming - so
what we will
like to have there as here is my HTML
something here and somewhere in the
middle I have an event handler my
unmount over does something in the
JavaScript terms of course so of course
I wanted to be written this way
I'm writing my UI and here is an event
handler make sense to put it there
but now there are a few technical
questions technical question number one
okay my template is running on the
server so this is compiled to JavaScript
I'll the JavaScript how do I do that
there are two options and we will
probably implement both so this is this
the first option I'm giving you takes
more work so it will be later really
later but yeah let's start with it so
the idea is that we run this on the
server right and we translate most of
the code to the executable byte codes
but from the type of this onmouseover
the compiler knows that it's argument
shouldn't be actually executed it should
be compiled not to the executable byte
code but to an ast so that at runtime
it's not run it's represented as a
syntax tree so that the framework can
take the tree take transform it if it
needs so and give it to the Colin to
JavaScript compiler to get a text of the
JavaScript to embed into the HTML and
give it to the client this is something
very much like expression trees in
c-sharp and macro facilities and many
other languages but we are keeping in
type safe so it's not not like C macros
no way yeah so this is a way of
generating bits of JavaScript from
program generally compiled to Java and
questions here ok so the second option
would be to do something radical move
all the templating and styling from the
server to the client
and it's relatively easy because we can
compile cattle into JavaScript right so
we can take those templates and just
transfer them to the client so this is
almost working already there are a few
things to fix in the column to
JavaScript translator and all the code
that does not use Java specific
libraries can be run in the browser with
no problem and then you have only send
data back back and forth like JSON or
something
to have your templating just work there
and then you don't have a problem of
compiling the same file to two different
languages yeah so this is very much like
what angularjs does and makes a lot of
sense to me but again compared to
angularjs this is strictly typed
everything is that type checked and it
can be integrated with a server-side
which is also statically typed check and
you know they're all data matches and
stuff like that questions here okay
so summary I have my four bits cover
already I have the fifth bit coming and
this all amounts to really type safe web
unified for unified as a framework in
one language thanks for your attention
more questions are welcome good
licensing Apache - very open source more
questions alright so we are 15 minutes
early but I think it's ok for this late
in the day thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
