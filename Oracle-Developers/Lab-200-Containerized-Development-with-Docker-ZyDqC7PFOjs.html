with docker hands-on lab this is lab 200
and we're gonna take a look at ways to
containerize applications in this
particular lab we're gonna assume the
persona of evan and we're gonna help
evan set up his development environment
where it can run four separate
containers now to get started we're
gonna open up a new terminal window and
go fullscreen just so you can see
everything nice and clear
we're gonna do a change directory just
to make sure we're in the right place
and we'll do a darker version command
just to make sure everything is in order
on your machine or in your virtual image
you can see here we're running version
17 dot it was six and now we're going to
go out and paste in our first command
this is a git command that'll download
some code and images that we'll use
throughout this particular lab we're
gonna change our privileges on this code
we just download it so that it's fully
read and writable and you should see an
alpha office setup folder at the end of
the day next we're gonna log into our
docker hub from our terminal window so
we can push an image at the end of this
workshop back up to Tiger hub now one of
the things you're gonna want to jot down
as you do this hands-on lab is your your
forward working directory so issue a PWD
command and write down the path that
appears on your system as you will use
this path throughout our workshop today
one of the places you are going to use
it is when you start copying down your
database image like you see here this
particular image will reach out and grab
a database 12.2 image from docker hub
and the V birder account now this will
take some time and so for the sake of
this video I did speed it up but what
you want to look for at the end of the
day is this status code here that your
image has completed download and next
you'll want to go out and look at the
log files so do a docker logs that just
follow and just watch this over the
course of a couple minutes what you
should see is that your Oracle instance
will be started and then at the bottom
of the log file you'll see a note that
you are done in your database is ready
to use when you do see this commandment
you can proceed on to the next steps all
right next we're gonna actually Asch
into this container
we're gonna change directories to our
database files directory and do a simple
touch command to make sure we can access
the files since no error return we'll do
an LS and what I want you to look at is
this particular file that you'd see here
setup alpha Oracle that's sequel you
might want to jot down that name after
that will connect and be a sequel plus
and we'll execute that setup alpha
office script and this once again will
stop your database start your database
it'll take a minute or two to run as you
go through
but at the end of the day you should see
the following syntax account of 57 an
account of 20 noting that everything you
need is installed correctly to move
forward next we're just going to do a
docker PS command so you can see that
you have two images currently running
one is our database image 12:2 and the
other is our rest client from the lab
100 we're in a pulse full screen here go
into Firefox and we're going to pull up
Oracle Enterprise Manager the web
console this will be running on port
5600 slash a.m. and if you ever need to
administer your database as you go
through a containerized development this
is one way that you can do it
so we'll login us
and just let you see the administration
console that's here running in our
particular container alright now we're
gonna come back to our terminal window
and we're gonna download our Twitter
feed rest service from docker hub and
spawn it up on port 90 80 here we can
see our image was downloaded correctly
and we can do a PS command docker PS to
see that it is now up and running
we go back to our browser we can open a
new tab
I go localhost 90-80 slash static tweets
and you should see your Twitter data
returned
now one of the things we did in lab 100
with this
client was just used static information
from within the image itself what we're
gonna do now is issue a new can't
command that will actually link this out
to the Oracle 12-2 database that we have
running on this local instance so that
it'll pull live information from the
back-end database inside of the
container and there we go now we're spun
back up and running see that everything
is up in order and if we go back and
open a new tab again and go to our
arrest client we can look at our product
catalog that's being pulled directly
from our database itself
another way you can check it is to
actually
by the path for your rest service so
it's a slash product slash 1025 or any
other product number in there and you
can see the specific information relate
to a product itself all right last but
not least we're going to pull down our
user interface that will connect to both
those rest services our alpha office
catalog UI this will take a minute or
two but you should see the status code
once it's down
we'll check to make sure it's up and
running
and next we can go back out to our web
browser once again look at port and look
at port 80 85 to see our product catalog
hopefully your product catalog will
appear and look just like this we'll see
the product information combined with
the tweet the tweet information related
to that particular product all right
we're gonna note our forward working
directory one more time and now we're
gonna go in and modify our user
interface image so one of the cool
things that we have the ability to do
here is in docker is copy an image from
our host system directly into the
container so what we're doing with this
Dockers copy command here is copying our
home HUL user alfalfa's setup dark blue
jpg image into our alpha office UI
container slash images folder so we can
use it inside the container itself once
the command completes we're actually
gonna bash into this docker container is
route we're gonna run an apt-get update
command which will update the packages
to the latest versions inside of the
container itself and then we're actually
gonna install a package called vim now
then we'll it will let us actually
modify code very easily on inside the
container itself
alright next we're gonna go out and just
check to make sure our dark blue image
copied into the container correctly
which it did we can see it right here
and we're gonna begin modifying our our
code here a little bit we're gonna first
modify our HTML file on our home page
we're gonna fix a misspelling in the
title so it does it says alpha and then
we're going to personalize it you know
it's not going to be alpha office-supply
it's gonna be chips off the supply for
the sake of this particular change
we'll hit escape Z to save our work and
now we'll go out and edit another file
we're going to edit our cascading style
sheet and change our core background
image from BG jpg to dark underscore
blue dot jpg
we'll exit out of our shell script
and then we're going to commit our
changes
this may take a second to run but you
should see the code here at the end then
we're going to execute a docker images
command which will just show you that
our image was committed six seconds ago
and you can see the total size of the
image there and then we're going to
restart an image on port 808 6 and 808 5
we'll make sure that image is up and
running that command completed
successfully
and then we'll go back to firefox
refresh our page here and we can see
that our changes have taken place and
now says chips office supply with the
dark blue image in the background now
what we want to do next is actually save
our image backup to docker hub for
future use so we're gonna issue a docker
push command to the sea baver and docker
account docker hub account and then push
the dock at a alpha office UI image
backup let's take a few minutes to run I
sped it up for you in the video but once
it's completed then you can go out to
docker hub and actually log in to your
account
and he should see that this new image is
present there it is and that completes
