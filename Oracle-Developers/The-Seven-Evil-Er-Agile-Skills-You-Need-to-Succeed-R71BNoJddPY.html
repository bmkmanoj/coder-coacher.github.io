evil or agile skills you need to succeed
so Who am I my name is Beethoven vote
but you can call me Peter I'm from
Belgium from Middletown cult show
another witch if you translate it
literally it's beautiful earth so it's a
nice place to live I'm an application
lifecycle management as a Belgian
company called real Dolman we used to be
a Java developer but then i started
doing something else i have a block at
wwlp.com you can find me on twitter and
you can email me all you want i don't
mind spam if you have any feedback
please provide it through Twitter
through email on my blog or in person
here I love feedback especially
constructive feedback always ready to
hear it so what is this talk all about
actually it's about evil super villains
and how they these guys are actually
pretty agile and what we can learn from
them it's also a bit about you bit about
me bit well everybody so I hope you
enjoy the talk if you don't you're
always free to stand up and if I one
bite so the first skill I want to talk
about you is investing it's a bit like
Lex Luthor you've got lots of money and
you want to do something evil with it so
reinvested investing companies
University in global supremacy just do
whatever you want with it you can for
example invested in your team and give
them all nice uniforms give them
training and then that's GI Joe kick
dress you can invest it in yourself so
like Doctor Octopus we can have a set of
extra arms really handy for pair
programming
or like Biff Tannen you can invest in
the future it's just steal a time
machine travel back create a new future
where your dredge guy well what I really
mean is actually investing your team to
invest in your team is to invest in
people and investment in your team is
not always something that's directly
work-related it can be just creating a
culture like spam Peter told the
audience yesterday in the same room in
stock coding culture it can be giving
trainings it can be Brownback sessions
for example so I don't know who knows
what the Brownback session is okay
already quite a lot of people I'll
explain it quickly a brown bag session
is actually a session during lunch so
somebody from your company is giving a
presentation while everybody else is
just eating their lunch it's called
brown bag because seemingly in the US
people take all of food in brown bags in
Belgium we just stuff it in something
else so investing your team like the CFO
and CEO are discussing here is really
important for you and for your team to
become more agile of course you have to
invest in yourself lots of people i know
they always say well i don't have time
or well why should I follow this
training or why should I do this well
actually an investment in yourself is
the best investment you can make it's
the only kind of investment that will
last a lifetime actually an entire
lifetime and it shouldn't even be a
technical investment well if you're
really a big fan of the latest
frameworks of course learn them but it
can be starting to play an instrument
because you always wanted to play in a
band you always wanted to be the next
Aerosmith for example start doing it you
will have more fun in life you will be a
better co-worker and maybe even a better
husband or wife or a father or mother
maybe blue suede actually I went to
Weight Watchers I lost 15 kilos
I felt better I had more fun at home I
was more fun person to be around at work
win-win just invest in yourself you're
worth it very important invest in the
future don't just think about what are
we going to do this quarterly or what
are we going to do next fiscal year no
think about what are we going to do in
five years in 10 years what do we want
our children to be doing when they're
growing up invest in environment because
well it's the place where we going to
live investing in in other people do
some charity help people work out help
people become better at themselves
invest in the future of yourself your
children and your team so that's the
first evil skill so anybody if you want
to tweet I put it on top because Trisha
g told me that you can't reach the
bottom line of the slides so second
skill listening so you guys are doing
great I'm not sorry it's a bit like a
certain government agency who might be
listening right now Shh no it might also
be like this guy is from a movie about
the German the East German Stasi and his
entire life it was spent listening to
one family and in the end there was
happening something to the family and he
saved their lives because he loved them
because he heard them the entire time
any Williams truly understood them so is
he a bad guy I don't know or like dr.
evil he likes to listen to himself so
much that he created a clone so he could
listen to himself twice
or like King Joffrey from the options he
likes to listen to his peasant so much
that it just kills them truly really
easy but do I really meanest know what I
really mean again it's be open to what
people tell you lots of times when we're
listening to people we already have
prejudice so we're thinking all I know
this guy or this it is this kind of type
or well that's some artistic fellow and
is always up into the clouds or stuff
like that no be open sit there with an
open mind listen to what they have to
say take your time to listen and you
might actually be surprised at what you
learn because each and every person has
it has a different view on the same
world so you have your own view but by
listening to somebody else you can
actually view the world through their
eyes you might learn a lot you have two
ears and one mouth use them in that
proportion so now I will have to follow
two talks before i can speak again this
is really important because listening
takes time but listening also teaches
you a lot well when you're speaking
you're not really learning you're just
trying to help other people around
trying to learn something to other
people but yourself you're not learning
unless people give constant feedback
which is also sometimes possible but
always thing this you have two years one
mount use them in the proportion okay
who knows the five-second rule it's the
one when you drop food on the ground and
you get there five seconds before it's
bad Oh 32 seconds well this is another
rule it's actually when you have to have
a conversation with somebody wait a
couple of seconds for example 5 or two
before answering and use that time to
think about your answer why we're all we
are all doing is normally when you have
a conversation we're already thinking
about what we're going to say when the
other person is still speaking so then
you're like fifty percent having
attention for this person and already
fifty percent of your brain is trying to
think of announcer which is not really
optimal optimal we all want performance
we're all from want to optimize
replications so let's also optimize our
conversations so just take a few seconds
after somebody tell something before
your answer and use those seconds to
formulate your apply it will make a
world of difference trust me and I do
have to admit I try to implement this
but it's not really easy it did get to
keep on trying keep on improving
yourself and of course you can listen
with your ears but you can also listen
with your eyes body language is
something that's really important in a
conversation if somebody is sitting like
this yeah whatever that's not really
well iki can talk enthusiastically is
telling you that he's not really
enthusiastic but it can also be that
somebody is really introverted so there
are we talking taizo silently but
they're actually the entire body is full
of energy and they want to help you so
when listening don't only listen with
your eyes with your ears also listen
with your eyes
so next up amputee who knows for this
guy is a few this is ransom Bolton from
Game of Thrones and he's one of the
least favorite characters because well
he just kills everybody really painfully
so he has a lot of empathy for his
victims but in a really wrong way or for
example nicolas cage and john travolta
they actually wanted to know how it
feels to be the other person or the orcs
and elves talking about cultural
differences which is a major part of
empathy you look they're going to give a
hug I think not sure or like this you
always have to know when you're talking
about empathy that every person is
different just like all these villains
from Doctor Who is there anybody in the
room who can tell me the names of all
different villains no me neither sorry
but I do like them but of course yet
again what do I really mean welcome out
in someone else's shoe shoes terribly
but can walk about YouTube well when
you're talking with somebody when you're
coaching with someone someone when
you're working with somebody think about
their history think about their culture
think what have they already what
happened what has already happened in
their lives and use that knowledge to
understand their point of view to create
empathy for that cause or for what
they're saying don't just say well I'm
thinking this and whatever you're
thinking is bad no try to get to know
them try to learn from them try to say
well I want to walk a mile in your shoes
beware of cultural differences I'm still
waiting on this movie star trek first
star
should be cool there are a lot of
cultural differences in this world I'm
from a country which has only 11 million
inhabitants and actually we have lots of
cultural differences and some of those
we really have to take into account when
we work together we have a Dutch part in
the north we have a French part in the
south we have to work together so we
speak English because we don't want to
speak French and they don't want to
speak Dutch but for example we have
people in the East who speak a little
bit slow and we have people in the West
we speak very very fast so when they
meet in the middle they have to speak a
bit like this so cultural differences
those are minor examples but if your
international company you will know that
there are big differences between
cultures and those differences and the
skeleton can be a disadvantage but they
can also be an advantage to enrich your
culture in the company to enrich your
own experience because each culture
again is different few points on the
world we live in on the problem you have
so try to understand those cultures try
to learn from them enjoy learning from
those cultures enjoy learning new things
but also be aware that there are
cultural differences and it is sometimes
have to take them into account when
making decisions when talking to people
i know there are certain cultures where
it is actually really bad style to say
no to superior but some cultures expect
you to say no when there's a problem so
if you have people of those two cultures
together you have to be aware about the
fact that some people will not say no
even if they know the answer is no
everybody is different like all these
LEGO minifigs everybody is different
everybody is unique or like I once heard
somebody tell tell its I'm normal
everybody else is not normal in my world
it was a bit of a crazy person but again
keep in mind everybody is different some
people will be more open more extrovert
some people will be more introverted
some people will be really loud some
people will be a little bit more silence
some people will be a really good with
numbers other people will be really good
with soft skills in a team you need a
bit of everything and you need to
combine those things sometimes also when
you have a manager and you need to
convince them about your new ID some
managers just want you to be enticed
enthusiastic and then it's fine but as
we all know them some of the managers
are really number of freaks so then if
you have an ID you have to know okay my
manager he wants to have a business plan
wants to see what are the numbers
prepared for it because you know is a
different kind of person than I am but I
know how I can talk to him again think
about it everybody is different which is
good because if you were all the same
this would be pretty boring conference
because you would already know what I
was going to say and probably you
wouldn't have survived the first ice age
because nobody invented fire so also
know your own strengths and weaknesses
for example I know for myself I'm bad
with numbers I'm pretty Celtic I just do
whatever I want sometimes and then well
my boss knows that I nodes so we know
how to work together he says the numbers
guy I'm the more chaotic enthusiastic
guy it works perfectly so know your own
strength know your own weaknesses again
this will allow you to become more agile
to become to become better in life
better life and better at working
together so next skill adaptability
that's an easy one mystique from the
x-men she's she can adapt to any
circumstance
or for example the Grinch from the
grinch stole christmas he actually
wanted to become Santa Claus or
terminator first in centen to kill John
Connor and to save him but what I really
mean always be ready to that our world
is always changing and agile is really
something that supports change that
loves change and being agile is loving
change is being ready to adopt to
changing environments just like a
chameleon and changing environments well
how we do it how you how can you adapt
to changing things how can you learn to
adapt to change things well get out of
your comfort zone we all have a comfort
zone it's it's a bubble around their
work or around home or we feel
comfortable where we know exactly what's
happening what you will do next it's
nice to be there but it's also well it's
small if you compare with the entire
world it's really small and sometimes
you need to get out of your comfort zone
because if you get out you will meet new
people you will meet new and interesting
problems you will meet you maybe learn
something new maybe not yes but Indians
you will be able to adapt to change
because you will be changed and your
comfort zone will change for example for
me two years ago I had a bets with my
division managers that night that's my
boss's boss and I was selling well we
should send somebody to Java one I
wasn't java developer I wanted to go to
Java one so I was like can you please
send me and he said well I know you want
to you're enthusiastic so if you can get
accepted as a speaker at javaone you can
go and I'll pay for everything so but
yes you're mine I didn't have any
speaker experience
I have not I had never written an
abstract and I got accepted so I came to
Java one it was completely out of my
comfort zone standing on stage talking
to I know 100 people but I loved it so
now I'm here back again I've done on
some other conferences to and now this
is becoming it's not but it's becoming
my comfort zone I'm still nervous no not
what I was nervous before you Ste but
it's new at something new I've made new
friends I've learned new things I've
been to San Francisco which is a
beautiful city I've been to Krakow which
is also beautiful city and those were
things I would never have done if I
hadn't been ready to adapt to change if
it's broken fix it so don't take don't
start with windows 9 jump to windows 10
know if you see something that's broken
in a process or its work or at home or
whatever don't just ignore it because
then it will start festering it will
become small bigger and a bigger problem
simply fix it maybe you have to change
stuff maybe you have to adopt a new
environment or the new circumstances but
if you will not fix it it will just
fester and in the end it will cause lots
of lots of more problems that causes now
it's really easy just fix it don't be
afraid of change and braces there are
lots of stories about mega companies
with 100,000 employees that were afraid
of change ten years later you don't hear
about them anymore like the adaptive
ists like yahoo yahoo is still there but
ten years of 15 years ago yahoo was
everything online and now it's like oh
yeah that's something else next to
google embrace change don't be afraid of
change change is part of who we are
changes part of our life it's also big
part of being agile
so next up coaching this is something is
it a skill as it's something you learn I
don't know I think it's something you
learn I think some people are born with
it but most of the people can learn it
because well coaching is something you
do everywhere all the time it can be yes
just to with a coke with the coworker
talking and you might be coaching each
other it can be you talking with your
child and you might be coaching him but
you might actually be coached by your
child it's a bit like despicable me you
have millions of minions and you have to
coach them out or like Nero in Star Trek
sometimes coaching takes time he took 30
years before he blew up Scott Spock's
planet sometimes yet you need to have
taken you need time sorry sometimes you
have to lead your minions or just send
them out towards an Italian plumber who
will kill them all and then in the end
you have to hopefully protect the
princess but well those aren't really
great examples of coaching well
sometimes also you need to coach the
coach so again dr. evil very smart guy
thought about it and you just created
his own mini coach so we can cause him
self but what I really mean of course is
know the people who coach know the
people who coach you again coaching
people is always having them trying to
get them to learn something new to
appreciate something to adapt to
changing circumstances help them and
know how to help them again some people
are really open and it's easy to know
okay this is how they're feeling this is
what they want other people are more
closed you might eat more time with them
to know what are their wishes what are
the feelings what did they want to reach
in this life
take time to do it right or don't do it
at all because you won't have time to do
it over this is actually a lesson I've
learned myself I was coaching a team of
about thirteen developers and it was
going great after a couple of months
they were actually big improvements I
were thinking okay it's time I can start
doing this part-time well that was not a
good idea only one month later it was a
complete disaster it was because well in
the end it seemed I didn't have enough
time I didn't take enough time to do it
right coaching takes time coaching
actually takes a lifetime because well
you're not only coaching people at work
you're coaching your children your
coaching maybe sometimes you're coaching
your parents when they get older you're
coaching your friends your friends are
coaching you it's always about personal
interactions about helping each other to
move on in the world be a leader don't
be a boss this is really for when you're
coaching any company environments who
knows the difference between leader and
a boss some hands thank you well it's
really simple a leader that the guy who
says look at what I'm doing and if you
want you can follow me the bosses I want
you to do this because I am the boss
there's a really nice example about this
on the internet it's actually about how
if you're a leader the most important
person in your life is your first
follower it's a movie with small small
movie on YouTube about somebody
somewhere on a dance festival and he's
dancing all by himself they're like a
hundred people sitting down around and
just enjoying the music and he's really
dancing dancing jumping around going
crazy but nobody is joining him and
after a minute of two certainly one guy
joins this person so that's his first
follower and within one or two minutes
at least 100 people are dancing so that
that's that gives you indication that
you can be a leader but it cannot be a
leader without at least one follower and
you should always be aware that you
should be a leader not a bus because the
boss is somebody who you will not
probably will not respect anymore a
leader is somebody who you can respect
can also be identity there are several
leaders could be that when you're
working on an enterprise application
that you have people who are leading the
front end people were leaving the back
end it's all possible let them work
together and it will create a very
effective team also about coaching who
knows the book drive by daniel pink
great fantastic thank you very much
drive is about these treating autonomy
mastery and purpose it tells about
motivation Drita 30 so used to be in the
stone age we had motivation one that oh
we want to survive we wanted to have sex
and we wanted to well that's it about it
then the Industrial Revolution happens
and we got motivation 20 we got managers
and we got work workforce and they
simply had to do as much work as
possible it was really competitive to
simply putting this fight there or
putting this there or whatever always
the same so they invented the stick and
the carrot if you do your work really
fast we get a carrot if you're slow we
get the stick but well now we we don't
do simple work we don't have a simple
job we need to think we need to be
constantly aware of changes we need to
be individual sometimes we need to work
in groups and teams to create new
programs new applications new things in
life so this
sticking carrots I don't think it to
really work in software development so
what did we do we invented motivation
trudeau about autonomy mastery and
purpose it's about giving your team the
autonomy to work wherever they want
whenever they want with whom they want
how they want just let them do it
because they are responsible grown ups
they know what how to do it and when to
do it let them strive for mastery give
them the training give them the coaching
give them the investment they need to
strive for mastery because people they
want to be concreted something they want
to excel at things and last but not
least give them purpose tell them why
they are doing this tell them why your
company is doing this let them have the
feeling that they're part of something
greater under some of them of the
different parts I would really recommend
this book it's drive by Daniel H pink
owl it will feature on the slides later
on and of course you have a coach but
the court should always have a coach how
does this work well for example at one
of my clients I had a scene where we had
a team of several scrim coaches scrum
masters and each Friday we actually had
a meeting just discussed what we were
doing and which problems we encountered
a bit like the retrospective Instagram
but focused on our teams are the people
who are coaching I mean good ideas we
got coached by our colleagues and in the
end it made us better coaches and very
important if you're looking for somebody
to work with boats in personal life or
in private life do the atlassian
trademarked beer test actually it's fun
called it the pavement test yesterday
but I'm from Belgium I like beer so
keeping calling it the beer test what is
the beer test it's actually really
simple so you're meeting somebody and
you
may be interested in working together
with them do the simple test would you
go out on a Friday night with this
person to a bar and have a beer if yes
then it's okay if no I think you should
to seek somebody else to work with so
next skill assertiveness anybody wants
to guess which evil super villain is
coming up them is really assertive a bit
too much I think or for example who
knows who this is this is Anna from the
series v the visitors and is actually
her speaking on big screens all over the
world in the air she's really assert if
you would say maybe also a bit too much
and then of course mr. burns he always
loves to have a plan he always loves to
be really really friendly of course for
the people in Springfield and he's
always very assertive but what I really
mean is be assertive okay but don't be
aggressive don't start shouting don't
start yelling let people finish their
sentences but stay true to your own to
your words stay too true too we are
stand up and say well this is where I am
this is what I believe in but do it in a
respectful open way don't be afraid one
of my favorite Steve job words
and he has a lot of good ones but this
is one of my favorites don't be afraid
to speak up you might be surprised at
how many people actually have the same
problems with the same wishes and you
have but it don't speak up that they're
not assertive about it they're just
quite speak up I know what know your
options for example we are all working
IT we know there are lots there's a need
for many more people than there are now
so we have always four options door
number one don't speak about it don't if
yours the proper don't speak about it
just keep quiet that's a lose-lose
situation you will feel helpless you
will feel sad your work will suck and
your company will be better than mad
about it so mad door number two go to
the same job at a different company I
can almost guarantee you that you'll
have the same problem within two years
okay door number three go to a
completely different job so for example
go start working as a gardener or become
a professional music player or a ballet
dancer whatever you might have found you
true calling in life or maybe not but
you will still be wandering out what if
so in the end you should choose door
number four which is talk about it be
open about it don't be afraid to talk
about it look for a solution together
with the people with period other people
look for a solution together with your
team you know what if it fails you still
have treat all the doors to choose from
but at least you will know that you've
done everything you could and always
have a plan he loves it when a plan come
to get it comes together okay so you
have an idea and you want to speak up
about its planets think about what are
people going to say what are people
going to ask and already prepare some
answers
if people know that you're prepared if
people know that you've thought about it
there will be more open to conversation
little more be more open to think
together with you about it don't just
kill two manager and say well I have a
problem no go to your managers and say
well I have a problem and I have these
possible solutions let's talk about it
so last skill creativity this guy is
really creative seven movies I haven't
watched them all but yeah these guys
also really creative every night they
have a different plan to conquer the
world it always fails but no problem
they're creative this guy that's my he's
the most creative guy ever is also the
most pathetic I ever but whatever he
tries he tries neutralized but he can
never catch the roadrunner but of course
what do I really mean well say yes and
instead of yes but so you want to become
more creative it's as easy as this for
example you're planning an event for
your team and you've got you had a great
fiscal year your company is booming and
you want to have a team event a whole
weekend so the idea is let's take our
team to Las Vegas you can say yes but
then the wives and girlfriends will be
sad because we're gone and the children
will be sad because our fathers or
mothers are gone and it will cost a lot
of money stuff like it or you can say
yes and we can take the wives and
girlfriends with us and then okay well
what are we going to do because nobody
not everybody likes to gamble again you
can say yes but or you can say yes and
ok yes ok maybe we should have some
other activities planned for people who
don't on the gamble maybe we should have
childcare childcare in the evening so
the grown-ups can go out to a show or
can go gamble if they want so if you say
yes and it will give you a lots of
possibilities and in the end you will
have an entire tree of possibilities you
will have some really creative solutions
and then you can still start picking the
realistic ones but if you say yes but
it's done the creativity stops so it's
as simple as this do some
improvisational theater you've got the
guys from improv everywhere who know
them the other guys will do all kinds of
weird stuff you can find them on youtube
improvisational theater will learn you
how to be open for every opportunity for
example well those guys they're just
standing there one guy's saying
something you're right reacts when it's
first guy reacts back they don't know
what they're going to do but they're
open to every possibility try this and
you will become more open you'll become
again more creative play this is my son
layer is playing a board game with us it
doesn't understand the rules but he
loves to play with it and this like this
children can learn is how to be creative
if you give a child some plastic blocks
it will become a castle or a mountain
give them some cars and it will become
the greatest stories ever written
children have a lot of creativity and we
can learn from them they can coach us
and being more creative if you have
children play with them learn from them

a few board games in the lunch area play
a board game it can help you get to know
your colleagues and maybe it will give
