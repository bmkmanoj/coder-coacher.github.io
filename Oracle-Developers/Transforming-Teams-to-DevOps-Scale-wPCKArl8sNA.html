what's that take it away this is now
nearly gone linked in at eligor link on
Twitter and everywhere else pretty much
everywhere else apparently on a
professional sabbatical but run
engineering teams for companies like
Oracle used to work here till L run
operations team at Thalia when we were
one of the largest members in the world
in a sauce space few of my teller
colleagues at the back of the room say
hi hello people and this is barceló
Gorski and I'm the developer advocate
with Jeff frog we do awesome t-shirts we
also do awesome software should I should
do the other way round about a t-shirt
we don't all some software but also
awesome t-shirts and if you want this
awesome t-shirt our booth is downstairs
on the reservation hall so I am Jeff
Rock we do software for software
development and especially for
accelerating software development with
DevOps and this is my kind of take on
this talk so we have a vendor the
practitioner yes and the manager of the
practitioner with that yes so let's
start with the definition of DevOps and
by now it should be pretty obvious what
the ropes is in a matter of fact is not
but this is something that you saw a
couple of times before
right so DevOps as the name implies is
integration between dev and ops
obviously someone forgot about the QA
and early stages and edit them later I
think the name just didn't work well def
cubes okay dev dev dev ops QA Mottram
okay so the name stays DevOps but QA is
of course a very big part of it probably
there are a couple of more about
security adding there to this Venn
diagram and so this sweet spot in the
middle is DevOps by the formal
definition right so Patrick dy is going
to be here I think today and talk about
that obviously I hope the man who coined
the term and
you will learn about the official
definition that's from there today we
are going to take an alternative
approach and that will be this Venn
diagram we just love the on diagram and
the somewhere in the middle between
change in all three of those change in
people change in process and change in
tools this is where devops emerges and
today we are going to talk about
different aspects of DevOps and how
change in all three of those actually
make it happen
to set the stage we're going to use a
study that I participated in when I was
an executive or CA technologies running
our APM product we spent some time
trying to figure out what are the key
stages that their organizations go
through on this maturity curve from
starting it at it was nothing
effectively to getting to a very very
mature stage and running the operation
process well we did the study when we
figured out that roughly folks fall into
three broad categories reactive we will
also call them the fire brigade I'm sure
a lot of you worked in their
organizations that felt like that right
and this is where you typically start
regardless of how much you know about
what good looks like you always start
with reactive because you always start
with fundamentals and basics right and
you know sometimes less process is good
right if you start off with three people
you don't need a lot exactly now
traditionally if you want to survive and
continue to grow you move to what we
call reactive improvement or we call
that stage the smoke alarm installing
right something goes bump at night you
figure out what happened you make sure
it doesn't happen again because if you
don't you likely not be able to survive
either I bet the majority of the crowd
here is in this stage according to a
study the last stage and I'll talk a bit
about the the distribution is the
proactive improvement is the stage where
we call it Smokey the Bear
yeah but fire prevention this is the
stage that in our studies and we started
top 2000 organizations in the world
mm IT organizations about 10-15 percent
of the organization's are able to reach
and we'll talk about some of the
fundamentals that go into reaching that
scale right so if you feel that you and
reactive improvement don't despair the
vast majority of companies that survive
and exit the reactive stage typically
find themselves in reactive improvement
the other thing we wanted to make sure
you understand as we as you listen to us
talk about the scale and what we believe
good looks like is from our other talk
we have the slide called scale is a
scale what does it mean well it means
you can't really skip any stages here
you have to move along this continuum
because every single stage reactive
improvement or proactive improvement
build on the things you have to go
through in previous stages so what we're
going to do today is kind of a technical
tips for you on how to implement this
progression on the scale how to go from
reactive a to reactive improvement and
hopefully how to go from reactive
improvement to proactive improvement and
of course there is a lot of work to be
done on people on process on tools in
each of those categories now for today's
talk we picked up nine including
dealer's choice
or the audience generations we'll get to
that as the last one we probably won't
have time to cover them all because more
often I like to talk and this is like
four hours we have talks on every single
one of them like the on call one the
Silicon Valley Chainsaw Massacre talk or
how we spend our Friday on call if
anybody wants to see it look for us at
other conferences shameless plug so what
we gonna do is we we're gonna pick maybe
one or two that Bart and I are very
passionate about and believe that are
very fundamental but we want to hear
what you guys want to hear about so by
there's a handle by yelling by yelling
violence by everybody
we're always loudest will win what do
you guys want to hear like that's a good
big who did you have to pay yeah all
right let's go compliance and security
for 200 you
sorry front all right it always worked
so compliance compliance and security
fable is the introduction to the topic
and what topic should we pick in
compliance and security in software
today mmm security any ideas something
happened in the news recently angry Fox
all right do you have to pay anybody all
right right so every Fox every Fox is a
lot of fun I think that's the wrong
slide yes so a couple things change when
you start thinking about security in
this day and age when you work for a
company I think as demonstrated by
target Home Depot Nordstrom and others
Anaheim reputational risk $150,000,000
reputational risk is the biggest risk
out there right when we were working at
talero I remember early the age of
software-as-a-service people were
laughing and it's like nobody will give
you the celery datas for all their
employees to hold in your cloud right
and one of the interesting things you
realize that the scrutineers on you
every company is a software company so
you have to change the people and what
what you tend to do is number one you
have to change the mindset of the people
in the company what does it mean I mean
you know there are people who are
responsible for security right I have
this head of security guy and and it's
their problems not mine but you also
need to bring additional people to the
table right and start listening to them
so for example bringing folks that are
independent of the organization to make
sure that you stay compliant I'm sure
some of you here are under some kind of
audit where the sock to pci-dss
HIPAA yep etc etc right but this is
process before we go to bra
let's get back to people and I'll ask
you who are the stakeholders in this
security and compliance conversation
inside the organization so I think
historically if you looked at our
Ganesh's a lot of people said the
security is somebody else's problem like
it will ride this off for every well you
know we'll give it to the production
guys they'll do their thing go for the
fire fall around it right that all that
works that's good enough but but but in
reality in this day and age with
software that moves so quickly with
things like continuous delivery or like
J likes the call of liquid software
right it's continuously evolving
everybody has to be security conscious
so whether it's training whether it's
general awareness and understanding and
whether it's the right tools and we'll
get to that
so let's talk about let's talk about the
responsibilities of each each of those
and the software developers how what is
their stake in the security perimeter of
their organization understanding right
it's it's training and fundamental
understanding how many organizations
here make it mandatory for security for
software engineer to take some kind of
fundamental security software course Wow
it's like what 25 percent 25 percent
okay so the rest of you you are the next
sacrifice it is like it starts with the
foundations I get if I suppose breach by
a fundamental yeah the other things that
have to be that have to well somebody
has to worry about it like things like
monitoring components for continuous
vulnerabilities so that we're going to
get to that in in the process and the
tools and let's talk let's talk about
the process of this thing and so how do
you build how to build the processor you
mentioned you mentioned training right
20 disease but training doesn't help we
all will know that you know brushing
your teeth in the morning kind of helps
you right you want to ask how many
actually do not have to know no that's
not subject to us talk but unfortunately
this type of hygiene when it comes to
security is not always available mostly
because of lack of awareness which is
being solved by publicity nowadays I
think every CEO and every product
manager is aware of what security can do
to to you but ideally your process has
to be seen
right ideally your process have to move
what's called shift left you don't want
to wait till the software development
cycle is complete until the software is
in production before you do in your
testing all right
so ideally want something that looks at
the software and does not Alice's either
during the nightly build ideally during
the commit anybody here does things like
static code analysis or security
scanning during commit that's exactly
the same people to do the training
interesting
Wow that's pretty good actually that the
percentages are growing right yes yes
yes this is where you want to catch your
security vulnerabilities and there are a
lot of their tools out there that are
getting better that that are getting
better at time to feedback for the
developer to get that information
gathered in the tools and I will shrivel
asleep lag one of the examples but
before that I have another question for
process so let's say I'm a software
developer let's pretend for a second and
I can I know how to protect my code
against mener abilities that I know so I
heard about cross-site scripting I know
how to do that I know about sq objection
I know how to escape my my queries but
but I guess the idea is that I should be
protecting my code against many
abilities that I don't know about so how
the company itself can protect itself
against itself so as you know the
security threats evolve every day right
vulnerabilities that exist even though
the OVAs top 10 exists and how many of
you guys routinely scan and test and
enforce that the fundamental or wasp top
10 when your abilities don't exist in
your code okay that's less than we had
so start with those that's a good start
but we're going to give an example of
couple of tools that do that today
yeah but the new vectors show up every
day and staying up to date becomes
important and that becomes important by
having the right folks in the
organization or if you're too small as
you continue to scale you the centralize
that function on a smaller scale you
tend to bring a third-party vendor I
think that's very important because
third-party vendor can guarantee that
they will search for something that you
want because this is what they
in addition to that the side benefit of
having the third-party vendor that will
be an expectation from your customers
you scale right they will not trust you
implicitly and that's why those
compliance or compliance protocols such
as SAS 70 PCI DSS etc etc exists so find
a reputable third-party find a reputable
third-party specifically that can move
with the speed of your business and this
is exactly we as as a vendor we know
that exactly so where companies when our
customers like CA like Oracle and like
any other customer of ours come to us
and say how can we make sure that the
software that we buy from you is secured
oh that's fine we checked it rasca
translates one card we need to come with
conclusions with reports from those
third party in companies that and found
something coming was clearly poured we
never found anything probably won't
build a lot of trust as well it never
happens and that's another thing that
companies have seen as they continue to
scale and get very reluctant they get
very reluctant to disclose the security
stance or the security stats right and
I'm not suggesting you you give your
customers a report with a vulnerability
list and the steps to reproduce those
vulnerabilities that we've done yep
having said that though the expectation
at scale from from a larger side of the
vendors is that you know security is a
continuous process there will always be
something what the customers really
expect is to know that you have a
process you identify those and and most
importantly you remediate them in the
timeline you yourself set for yourself
and commit them and this brings us back
to tools and as they're only mentioned
em the sooner you discover your
vulnerabilities the better but there is
a trade of there
if you try to whitelist every component
that you allow your developers to use
two things will happen
people will start leaving because
approving every component that they want
to use for a couple of weeks is just
devastating does anybody work at the
organization
we're getting a new open source
component takes more than an hour here
you go how do you like it it's not so
much not so much right right that's what
the second if they won't leave
they will sneak them in I want to ask
how many of you do that
but I know you do write some drives
emails to yourself and this kind of
stuff get it in the code and do this
right and then because you want to be
productive you don't want to see for two
days and wait for a component to be
approved I have a realistic typically so
this is the trade-off but there are
tools that actually help there but
number of them and being here as part of
Jeff rock I will shamelessly plug around
so we have this tool called Jeff Rock
x-ray which actually allows you to use
to start using any component that you
feel like help you being productive and
we alert you when you first bring this
component to your IDE as a local
dependency or in the in the first build
of your continuous integration about
problems in this component we scan the
build we find components recursively at
any level depth if you just build a
docker image we will go to every layer
find every archive there of whatever
type it is Devon package rpm package zip
file go deeper a long list of things
find a war file endurance yeah I need to
so the key item the key point here it's
automated and it's transparent to the
day-to-day development organ so yeah
there are tools and we're not the only
ones obviously we are but yeah if you if
you want to look at this this is
category that is emerging called
software composition analysis those are
the tools that look at the software now
analyze the components will proactively
alert you on things beyond security you
know legal guys have conferences to they
talk about GPL staff and other licenses
so things like compliance was your
requirements on licensing and
third-party components and when these
legal comes to you and say you know what
the release
two days please give me a list of all
the open-source licenses that you use
and you're like what we have those so
that happens and those tools that
already scan your components and know
what's inside cannot only report on
security vulnerabilities but also on the
licenses as well I think oh this is all
the time we have yeah talk about that
right what are the things you guys want
to talk about metrics oh that's our
favorite anything let's see we have
slides for those so we will see if the
slides downloaded we had a lovely lovely
oh yeah yeah we checked we checked about
the how do you call the capabilities of
Microsoft PowerPoint for collaborate
collaborative editing and our failed
miserably
yeah don't have the matrix yeah so one
of the key things to think about the
matrix is the key characteristics that
you see in the companies that have all
along the maturity curve is continuous
reliance and increased reliance of
gathering the right data and getting
decisions made on that data the further
up you go to the proactive improvement
there's no proactive improvement without
the right data all without having the
right interpretation for the data and
now I have one of the loveliest stories
I have about numbers is the one it
actually can came from Leonie so this
happens to be a product that I was
managing I was asked to come and help
their development organization kind of
with some of the scaling issues several
hundred engineers several hundred
million dollars a year product and one
of the challenges or maybe not was
quality and here what Larry did just
grouped that the tickets the customer
defects by severity and this is the
patch the picture that we have as you
can see here sixty-five sick
overwhelming sixty-five percent of all
the defects are either severity one or
severity two and now I will ask you a
question that Leonie doesn't love me
when I ask but I have to what do you
think about this
since equality like looking at this data
how does the quality look does it is it
if anybody thinks this is great good
okay pretty crappy someone for that
product means something really really
broken folk for customer okay so having
that those are nice metrics right this
is this is a good set of data that we
can come to orangey and have it very
very clearly what pseudo conversation
with them yeah I think we should be
fixing more bugs right that's what you
look at this data it's like well let's
invest in fixing mobile something come
to the head of development and we say
you know what guys you should step up
your game
this is not a good quality well here's
the interesting thing because if you
want to scale successfully and you want
to fix the right things you have to look
at the data we started looking at the
data and we started gathering additional
layer of data and in this particular
case we started looking at resolution by
severity right like for each of those
seven ones what happened how did they
get resolved and here's the data that
emerged now this is also very
interesting chart those are the same
defects but now organized by the
resolution how the ticket was resolved
and the numbers here are our management
only nineteen point nine percent of the
someone's ancef twos actually of all the
defects resulted in some kind of code
fix and about 52 percent of the defects
that ended up in the hand of the
engineering organization were resolved
by providing information back to the
support team so amazingly enough our
conversation should be now not with the
head of R&amp;amp;D but with the head of the
support right guys you don't know how to
answer those queries you raise them to
crazy severity when all you need to do
is read the documentation well and the
conversation and again those are actual
slides from one of the products I
managed the conversation went slightly
well well beyond that
the conversation was hey guys we clearly
have a problem right let's figure out
how do we solve it together we we don't
play the blame game but clearly they
have a documentation issue a support
ability issue or some kind of training
issue and it was way cheaper for me to
have couple of my device
purrs fly through all the support
centers and trade the folks in how to
support the product then deal with the
myriad of defects and the number of
defects we don't have the slides have
done down dramatically right something
you can measure something you can
measure was the right accuracy is the
key to evolving to scale and that cuts
across all the dimensions we just have
one example that is very innocent right
but it helps to when it comes to people
right metrics at everybody's job just
like security right just like security
and you have to get into this
data-driven mindset and you have to
learn how to extract the right data and
how to interpret the right data because
without this data-driven mindset you
will not be able to solve the root
underlying root cause for the issues you
will be creating the symptoms right and
and getting back to example that we
spoke about all it takes to be in this
data-driven mindset for get the numbers
you probably you previously saw is just
make sure that the further support and
then there in the field the right fields
in JIRA or whatever not and that's the
frustrating things for me as the leader
for an organization that comes in you
see it takes time to gather the right
data so if you are starting to gather
data think about the kind of data you
need to make decisions because that's
the stuff that you need trends you need
data over time to make the right
decisions now the thing you need is
everybody has to agree on how we
interpret the data not just how we look
at the specific data but the methodology
by which you go to interpret the data so
you cannot have fake facts and true
facts they're facts alternative facts
could be a reality sometimes but in
reality for the organization to become
data-driven you have to agree that the
data is right right and everybody in the
room like I had to sit down the set of
support saying hey listen let's agree
that the data we're looking for is right
and a lot of people tend to skip that
stage right then you go to the stage of
interpreting the data and typically more
often than not different people will
come out with different interpretations
like again if you looked at our early
slides we could say hey quality is bad
yeah right that's why sometimes you need
to go and refine your data based on what
you see and only then right you can
I want to do a lot of organizations that
I've seen that trying to become
data-driven till to skip the step of the
conversation and agree in on the same
data and they go the support guys go to
their system they have one set of data
the development team for example in the
quality example goes to their system and
looks at their data and it doesn't even
agree right so you can't make any
decisions so fundamentally right you
need to do that
once you do that also from a process
perspective you got to get into the
periodic review of those metrics how
many of you who in leadership here look
on some kind of metrics flash report on
a weekly or monthly basis okay pretty
good number right yep for the management
side it was yeah well the right side of
the wreck was right it's extremely
important to look at the right metrics
at the right frequency sometimes people
tend to be overwhelmed and some of those
metrics to the extent that you can get
them with tools is easy to get right and
produce a flash report sometimes you
need to look at those metrics in less
frequency or just ignore them and one
thing I've seen organizations do is now
set up a flash report 3 is later
everybody gets the flash report nobody
knows why it's there nobody knows what
kind of data is there what does it mean
so the key is also periodically evolve
the data that and evolve the data out
and in right and there's things that
that I used to look at weekly like
quality trends as a ways for a SAS
product and there's things you look at
quarterly maybe like MTTR mean time to
resolve where the data over time has to
evolve now in order to get this data you
also need tools but tools here are
pretty high pretty basic right you need
about tracking that or for a ticket
management tool for the quality metrics
to come in and then to be resolved
correctly right and then you need some
kind of performance analysis and
statistics gathering a lot of people
tend to go to log management tools like
Splunk log lee sooman logic etc etc in
games if you for performance you have
application performance monitoring and
sometimes for a business it's
appropriate to go build some custom tool
chain right and and
there is also another very sophisticated
expensive and hardly approachable tool
made by a fortune 3 company I think and
yes this is one of the places where it's
okay to say yes to excel as much I
personally hate any data that requires
any type of manual massaging or manual
extraction I absolutely have a violent
reaction to when a product manager tells
me hey I have this giant excel to tell
you about our quality and what a tool to
tell me about a quality right sometimes
this is where you go to excel and the
previous slides those numbers that you
saw that they were actually done in
itself by the way know itself exactly so
it's okay to use Excel alright we still
have time what else you guys want to
talk about sorry planning what else
architecture hurt any other asks
software lifecycle okay let's go to the
software no no no let's not go to
software life no yeah I already did my
plot for today okay let's go to
architecture
I'll do that charm all good all right
let's do architecture well I'm sure that
those of you that worked in the industry
long enough know that software
architectures like entropy every
increasing and never get ever complex
yes so the thing is doing something
complicated is much easier than doing
something simple right and that requires
people and you know the complexity of
software architecture is more fun than
other people problem will have our
desired methodologies our desired
technology we all want to play with
certain things and yet they're not
always appropriate I have seen a product
in my portfolio where we had three
different software components using very
similar architecture all style reactive
right event-driven architecture done
using three different technologies for
no reason whatsoever because why not
right so what kind of people do we need
to make sure your architecture evolves
and continues to evolve as you scale so
number one you need architects right
well well you small you can get away
with that and those architect architects
for software teams can be a very scary
order who the chief architects
I mean right he's going to enforce his
will upon us obviously you want
architects that are rational ideally you
want architects that spend their time of
the code but as the teams scale you want
different level of architecture to be
considered so you need somebody who
looks at the system as a chief architect
and looks at the coherency of the entire
system right largest system I'm sure you
guys have folks that have more than one
or ten or fifteen or twenty components
seventy years to make sure that all of
this has some kind of way of coming
together who here works in organizations
where the development team is
distributed across multiple sites and
good chunk of you so one of the key
tricks that I use is you always have
somebody on site representing an
architecture team right
ideally either on site or if you have
multiple sites on the same time zone at
least in time zone right traditional big
company set up maybe North America plan
plus India or North America plus Europe
or multiple sites across different
geographies ideally you want to have a
site architect so the number of
relationship and the number of
conversations that that site has to have
with the chief architect is minimized
and you have somebody local all staff
who can make decisions especially in the
different time zone without the holding
the team up right the job of the site
architect is to represent the chief
architect for particular geography
nothing more nothing less what I also
tend to do in my organizations is we
also bring what's called scrum team
architects those guys are members of the
scrum team the code maybe some of their
time is allocated to proactive work
things like architectural spikes
architectural runway definition right
the job of the architecture team is to
define the how right they need to think
about the what that may be coming down
the road and a product development
background so I tend to put scrum team
architects maybe one / - scrum teams
that their job is to live in the
day-to-day of the Sprint and of the
backlog where the chief architect and
the site architects tend to be more
forward-looking was that the process has
to evolve as well right and you know
process when it comes to architecture is
as
yeah it's a big negative reaction for
the boy oh no generally it's the
negative reaction to architects and what
they do that's why maybe so what we tend
to do is we tend to put a very
lightweight architectural review board
almost sounds scary boards right
Commission's consortium state they they
get together to talk what we ask our
teams to do and the job of the chief
architect is to look at the product
development backlog during play and say
you know what those are the features
that I'm concerned about and for those I
would like to do what's called an
inception review where the team comes in
and says hey you know what we don't know
exactly how we're going to build it but
this is our first order of approximation
or what's going to happen with this
technology and for that we need to
support this particular feature set and
this is where the chief architect and
say you know what I see the entire
system and those guys over here or
they're doing something that you're
planning to do over there maybe you
should go that way like let's let's use
akka here and akka here other than akka
here and no GS over here for the same
thing right
inception review for certain types of
features you probably want to do a
follow-up with review because no
architecture survives the first
engagement was the code like things tend
to evolve ideally you want the chief
architect to stay closer to this and
that's where your broader team helps the
other important things as architectural
spikes right this is the job of the
architecture team to identify what is
that we're gonna need what type research
we need to do in order to support our
product development not for the current
program increment maybe the next quarter
but two or three quarters out and what
do we need in order to estimate things
can most from a computational complexity
from a development complexity from cost
to operate correctly what an type of
things we want to do what are the spikes
right and those spikes somebody asked
about planning right those spikes have
to go on the backlog they need to be
allocated capacity because they don't
happen out of the blue maybe some of
your architecture spikes can be done by
the architecture team themself but they
tend to be small my architecture team
for the product was 250 engineers was
three not a lot of capacity in that
right so they have to borrow and that's
a good learning opportunity for more
junior developers to come in and work
with their architecture team on some of
the architecture spikes they get exposed
to the thing
they get exposed to the technology right
tools
well the architecture process does not
require sophisticated tools a decent
week emulsify suffice a good diagramming
tool and quite frankly I'm a huge fan of
Trello we used Trello for everything
else
yeah so that's that's what you tend to
see it doesn't need to be overly complex
when it comes to scaling architecture as
you continue to scale your DevOps one
other item that would didn't mention on
the file it just came to me is you also
need to think about things like
non-functional requirements for those of
you that have operations background or
work on their operations teams the best
relationship for you guys to build as
was the chief architect of the system
because he's the person who can
represent and typically represents or
act as a product owner or product
manager depending on the size of the
product for what's called a
non-functional backlog things like
scalability ability to monitor things
ability to extract metrics the
architecture team is the team that
typically defines what we call
non-functional definition of done and
those are the folks that you really want
to be friends with and none of the folks
that you want the help because they live
in the software development organization
to get some of things you need from a
development team so that's architecture
anyone want to do the wild card well
what do you guys want to talk about for
the wild card yep so what I want to talk
about a topic that is not on the slides
meant to be the wild card so any other
topics let's go back all right that
didn't work well that you will only do
peak from the list
let's talk about our CAS I call it let's
ask now they have selection doesn't need
to come up with topic planning people
one planning well
planning so we talked about runway we
talked about architecture and some of
that there is that we haven't seen we
talk about things that have to go on the
backlog how do how do you manage your
backlog and what are the key roles that
come to managing your backlog I'm a big
believer that in a software organization
there are three fundamental pillars
right there are people that do the what
the product management team
traditionally the people that define how
the architecture team we talked about
them and then people that talk about the
one right the development organization
and those are the three pillars that
have to come together and figure out
across three of those competing domains
whether it's the scope the complexity of
the architecture for the short term
versus the long term that's you're
playing all the time right so what are
the key balls that you have to have in
your organization in order for the
planning process to work so number one
you need product owners does a COO here
has a clear definition in their
organization and separates product
managers from product owners okay
minority so we talked a bit about it the
traditional definition and what I tend
to work with is product owner is a
product manager but it's about the focus
product managers are typically market or
externally customer focus it doesn't
mean that you don't have your product
owners talk to customers we don't put
them in the cage and lock them down but
the job of the product owner
predominantly is to satisfy the needs of
the development team that they work with
there's some good ratios typically
product managers you'll figure out based
on your markets or key key directions in
your product line that you need product
owners very simple mass ideally you want
to have one product owner support no
more than two traditional scrum teams
there's not enough time right people do
and people try to do less but it doesn't
work because the quality and the ability
for the product order to respond to the
product development team during the
Sprint just diminishes greatly right
you also need architects we talked about
that a lot of people tend to forget to
bring representatives from external
teams upon which they can inflict pain
was the software m2 the product planning
process yeah so folks like support
folks like operations and quite frankly
based on my experience it takes a while
for those guys because they typically
not invite it to the planning table
right to participate proactively so you
may be disappointed for the first few
times when you bring the support team or
you bring an Operations team into your
planning process because they're not
quite frankly not always used to it
they don't always send the right person
so looking for the person who can
represent the support team adequately
but understands the rest of the
complexity of the product development
organization is important but those
types of folks are incredibly externally
important because you're going to be
making a lot of trade-offs during your
planning process and bringing those
teams along for the ride is much easier
when somebody represented him sat at the
table and rationally agreed that that's
the right trade-off and can go back to
your team say hey listen you know what
yes we didn't get that extra log that we
wanted to but we're getting something
else that we needed more because
effectively planning is prioritization
from 1 to n right I'm not gonna dive
into the role of a scrum master but a
lot of organizations today still trying
to do agile without them or without
properly trained one or like somebody
gets volunteered to be a scrum master
how hard can it be it's easy like whoa
you just need to run a stand up every
morning you your job is done by 9 by 9
a.m. in reality the next to roll the
scrum master and the program manager all
about facilitation and you know quite
frankly facilitation is a professional
right variety of facilitation tools you
can get it's it's it's a different
mindset and it's something that you need
to look at it we typically see in small
organization just scrum master you can a
good scrum master can cover an entire
site depending on how many I wouldn't
put a scrum master over more than 4
scrum teams you can do scrum of scrums
if you have many or if you have
distributed sites because you do need to
get the statuses together and deal with
interdependencies and we separate the
role of a scrum master from a role of a
program manager which can be considered
an uber scrum master very simply much
like we separate the role of product
owner and product manager the job of the
product manager to be externally facing
to other organizations that the
development team
inter depends on
and the job of the scrum masters to
focus on satisfying the needs and
velocity of an internal force well
Rosa's is planning planning process an
agile organization is a Kanban scrum and
of course what you see here the steps
are exactly the scale but smaller teams
can go just fine with Kanban just you
know if they're sitting in the same room
okay so we'll repeat the question I
think your mic is that the question was
how do you go and where do you move so
my guideline was obviously when when you
when you below seven people Campbell is
perfectly fine I think you start going
to scram when their external
organization that's starting to depend
on predictability and understanding
what's happening with the backlog right
and interestingly enough safe has three
layers in it the modern definition of
safe framework starting from a very
simple definition over scrum that
includes things like how do you do your
contextual runway like what's the
process for that and the fun thing about
processes is you know we all love
inventing them one of the beauty of
relying on something like safe and if
you haven't guys seen it go to save
scaled agile website they have this
awesome clickable diagram where you can
look at a particular area of the process
and say hey I want to know what
architectural runways click and there's
a well-defined definition so you don't
have to spend hours writing you own for
their own organization obviously you
don't always use the processes
yeah now doors that's the most one of
the most scary sights I ever visited
it's so much process it's just makes you
wanna die well that's because you don't
do what I do
but realistically in safe the next layer
becomes when you start managing products
that have to aggregate program of
programs right and they have some very
lightweight frameworks that help you
manage those and understand what are the
kind of roles the kind of the
conversations the kind of backlogs again
you still need to manage so I would
consider safe probably at around five
scrum teams or above or multiple sites
so the moment you go distributed across
sites safe does help with certain
collaboration across sites so those are
my criteria is probably the largest I've
seen is 22 scrum teams on the product
across four sites I probably wouldn't
have survived without which is
fundamental scrum with that though you
also need some tools so yeah and for
tools obviously the planning tools are
are straightforward JIRA is great with
that Raleigh is great with that other
version one the variety of their variety
of tools for planning there are some
less formal some more formal you can do
the Kanban and JIRA without almost any
process the one thing about the tools
and we talked about metrics and we
talked about metrics being the key to
ability to move them this maturity curve
you have to adopt some kind of tools and
you have to adopt it correctly you know
time and time again I I get frustrated
it was my own teams where I see a team
that has a tool but the status is never
up to date and it goes both to people
are the fundamental discipline of
keeping the system's up to date you know
you want to be a professional software
engineer you want to get your paycheck
well that comes with the job I may not
enjoy brushing my teeth every morning
but again comes with the job I don't
like seeing their interests even more
and you need this data because it allows
you to make predictions so I'll give you
one example every once in a while an
organization said you know what we have
to have a quality goal let's say we want
our MTTR mean time to resolve force f2s
to be two days and then you so you want
to say that we want
commit to our customers that no defect
will sit on the backlog for longer than
365 days maybe it doesn't matter
whatever your goals are so the next
logical question for the head of
engineering is well they're kind of
engineering when we do our planning
process how much development capacity do
we need to allocate to a defect backlog
in order to met those quality goals
well guess no surprises there right and
and and guess what if you didn't have a
tool that gathered this data for you for
the last 12 months that you can now hey
listen on average I have three sevens
filed a week five sev two's on average
it takes that many hours to resolve of
that many days there's no prediction as
a head of engineering I can make without
this data and therefore there's no
predictability in other development
processes I can have because I'm
probably sacrificing features so this
goes back to being proactive and
gathering those metrics and that's one
of the fundamentals things when you
start talking to the teams about why is
it important to keep your tool
up-to-date it's this kind of data that
I'm able to extract a show to my
development teams that hey listen if I
know how long it takes to fix the bug or
what are the accurate story points in
the sprint I can make sure you don't
have to work the weekends no not gonna
happen it does it tends to resonate
worried about alright but this is the
stuff you need for the data so going
back yeah and I think that's that's time
for for a short summary of ours and so
as you saw we spoke about just three or
four concepts out of much broader list
today they are much more and I think
that the the key take takes away you you
actually picked very good basics like
the metrics like the architecture
security those are the important
concepts of implementing processes like
the opposite scale the two other things
we've learned over the years that we're
big believers right the two principles
of DevOps
one is you build it you own it right you
have to bring ownership to the people
and typically which is my favorite
principle of DevOps pain is
instructional right too many
organizations tend to hide the pain from
the source to many organizations like I
never had a maintenance team on on my
on my development org structure because
the people that created the bug should
experience the pain of fixing the bug
the people that created the bug
should-should should experience the pain
of getting woken up at 2:00 a.m. in the
morning when they go on call the people
that created the bug should experience
the uncomfortable pain of doing a root
cause analysis and writing an hour see a
report right so metrics and bringing the
pain to the source of the two things
that we have seen over the years that
help organizations move along this
maturity curve because at some point
this pain tends to be a motivator to
improve things yep so I think with that
we are standing between you and your
lunch so thank you very much and Gephart
accomplished shownotes
will be the page when you will have the
slides the video by tomorrow and the
links to bunch of resources that mostly
learn invention and myself so that's the
only slide you need to take picture of
and of course our twitter handles are
extremely important so there is this
duke machine outside the only button
works is green so you don't buy anything
else and thank you very much we need to
well the gentleman who asked me that my
favorite question safe has left so I
can't give it to him so yeah so we will
do it we will do that all right we
follow one of the shameless plug if you
want to see another deeper conversation
on the subject there is a recording
available also jay frog show notes
there's a talk mark and i do it called
devops at scale the Greek tragedy in
three acts where we go into much more
depth on the under maturity model on the
maturity model and some of the other
fundamentals we didn't cover here again
