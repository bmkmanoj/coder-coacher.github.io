Washington DC I'm Bob Rubert with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
another interview with one of the people
who's presenting content here at this
event and in this case that person is
hands Henry Sen Beck he's the CEO of Jay
Pro technologies tell me a little bit
about what Jay Pro does Jay Pro to put
it on in one sentence the put it
directly to the point is bringing Java
to the browser so Jay Pro is a tool
which you can run Java programs in the
browser without the plugin what was the
topic of your session today
today was the % j Pro because scrapers
is hasn't been launched yet it's just
about to be launched for the market so
people don't know it yet and many people
are suffering from from the current
technology stacks which they are dealing
with daily because there's a complex
people are writing web applications
using several different frameworks
several different languages cross
compilers and everything is very complex
so we are trying to make people happy to
say that now you can use one language
one framework one technology for all
platforms absolutely all platforms so
the so-called war paradigm write once
run anywhere which has been something
people have been dreaming about for many
years and some have claimed they can do
it but it has never happened now it is
there you made the journey to Java one
in 2016 and that turned out to be a very
good trip for you talk about what
happened at JavaOne yeah it's over one
we were very very happy with me we came
home from the other one because we go to
the Technology Award because of j-pop so
so it seems that the people have
understood what it is about the
community was a part of that decision I
think so I think people of the insiders
in the Java community are aware of
Jaipur
and we have a very good feedback from
them but the market doesn't know about
it yet so that's going to be incited how
does Jay Pro relate to Oracle cloud
services we have now been working
together with the cloud service group of
Oracle for for some couple of months and
we are pretty far now in in the process
of utilizing ACC in a very good way to
get a bit April so we will see that
happening relatively soon I think that
Jay probe will be harmony in a very good
harmony with with with the Oracle cloud
services and by ACC you mean application
container clouds yes yes we are very
good very good marriage because what JP
is doing is actually to bring
applications to the cloud with Jay Pro
you can read you can let Java
applications run in the cloud totally so
all the business logic will be put into
the cloud so you get rid of several
security topics that people are dealing
with daily those are gone
when you use that architecture that Jay
Pro is pushing and you get rid of all
the hassle of course of of having to
deal with their own servers to admit
administer your your application and
we're versions and so on so we think
that when we get that finished that that
would be interesting for the market if
attendees at your session remember only
one thing what do you want that one
thing to be that would be that the Jay
Pro they can reduce their development
teams so drastical that it's almost
sounds like cynics saturation when I'm
saying it because today you have you
have a team for your iOS developer to
have a team for Android development
you have Java on the back end you have
desktop development you have your
browser development and you have to deal
with four browsers for fie browser
perfect platform of different versions
so you have to maintain a very big team
today if you do Syria software
development cross for many platforms and
that's what the market is asking for so
we are saying now you can have one team
with the same technology the same
knowledge with the same skills and you
can save enormous lis of development
cost what's next for you are you part of
any other Oracle code events coming up
in the future we are coming to some of
the events in Europe this is the last
event in the u.s. that we are
participating in that we are going to
Prague to a couple of them in Germany
about which one a couple of others
alright well if you'd like to hear
first-hand about Jai Pro you can attend
any of those events coming up in there's
a couple left here in the United States
and several in Europe and APEC you'll
find more information about the
remaining 16 events in the Oracle code
tour at developer oracle.com slash code
you'll also find information on how you
can submit a session proposal to present
at one of these upcoming Oracle code
events for the Oracle technology Network
I'm Babu Bart thanks for watching and
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
