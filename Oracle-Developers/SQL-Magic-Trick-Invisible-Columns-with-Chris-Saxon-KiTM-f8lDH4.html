good sound check alright you sound great
oh that's great thanks Laura hey it's
Laura Ramsey and we are live from Oracle
OpenWorld 2017 we're here at the
developer community lounge how do you
like it it's great okay Laura it's great
to see all the good work they've done
here you know it's it's only Monday
mm-hmm
and we've already had a full day of
sessions yesterday the developer the
community day was amazing very busy I
saw an incredibly long line for the
session about jigsaw whatever jigsaw is
I have promised myself I will find out
what jigsaw is by the end of the week
okay and I will hold an interview about
it but today what we're going to do is
we are going to get one of your famous
card tricks right exactly
Chris Saxon the sequel magician tell us
what what you've got going on okay so
you know I think sequel should be a bit
fun and it's have to do some something a
little bit different so what I want to
do is like a little sequel card trick
okay and how we're gonna do this we've
got a like a deck of cards here and it's
just a database table so what I'm gonna
ask you to do in a second is to choose a
card and I'm not gonna see what it is
and I'm gonna try and read your mind and
figure out which card you chose so okay
we'll start again we'll start again
so what I'm gonna do in a second I'll
ask you to choose a card and you choose
a card so if you didn't want the ace of
clubs you take ACE and put it in the
value and then Club some and put it in
this suit and when you've done that
you'll run the statement and run the
statement by clicking on the green arrow
click on the green arrow that's it make
sure once you've done that delete what
you've chosen so I can't see it so I
don't know what you've done and then
you're gonna undo it by hitting rollback
so you're happy you know what okay you
got it
you've got it all right then if you come
on you're good at this okay all right
then so what I'm gonna do is kind of
there's a way to like I can't see what
she's chosen so I'm just gonna give her
a minute and let her figure out what
she's which card she's picking and then
once she's chosen it and undone it so I
can't see what's going on okay I've got
a problem you've got a mouse there we go
come on Laura okay we got it so I'm
gonna try and read her mind and figure
out which card she's chosen so a big fan
of there's a psychological illusionist
called Darren brown in the UK they kinda
like read people's mind I can't really
read people's minds but and I try and
see if I can figure out which card she
chose without actually seeing which one
it is you push a green arrow did it say
one row updated at the bottom it did it
did fantastic so delete whatever you
chose so I can't see it okay okay so I
can't see it and then you're gonna hit
roll back so it's undone so I can't I
don't know okay
all done and it said roll back complete
fantage okay alright then so what I'm
gonna do you what I need you to kind of
look deep into my eyes okay and then you
did to really concentrate and think very
detailed about what this card was you
need to get a really good picture on it
so you've got to think about the value
first think about the value you forgot
already
I think this might not work have you
forgotten your card already wait okay
you got it you got it all right then so
can I keep repeating it to yourself over
and over you look right look right into
my eyes look very close I can see
exactly what's gonna stop repeating it
to yourself over and over so I want it
it's like on the tip of your tongue you
want to keep repeating it you got it
getting really good visualization so
yeah I'm sorry I think I'm starting to
get an image of exactly what it is you
need to it's coming it's a bit fuzzy at
the moment Laurie I need to like really
concentrate really think about exactly
what value it is so I can kind of get it
and I'm gonna see I'm just gonna put my
hand up here to see if it can pass down
through my hand all the way down through
into the computer so I can figure out
exactly which card you chose okay all
right then so let's give it a couple of
tries I need you to just really
concentrate really hard think very
carefully don't got anything over
/ keep it repeating it over and over and
over and over to yourself okay you ready
3 2 1 and was that your card get out how
did you do that well it's the sequel
magic now so I'm not a real magician
obviously you know and I want people to
kind of learn exactly what's going on
here so if we kind of let's bring this
back up here so we can see what's going
on now if I scroll down a bit of a
little bit here we got this sequel
statement we're gonna find one row from
the table great and which is it well
it's the seven of Hearts that's your
card that you're joking right so how on
earth would I know that how would I know
that
I forgot it and then it came back
exactly I know it's just weird so you
know I've done some some kind of funky
stuff with it you know a bit interesting
let's scroll down a little bit so you
can see we got three things here we got
a value seat and a name column but I've
got this little extra column here called
pk and I'm gonna run this you can see
whoa we've got an extra little column
there so I was a little bit naughty so
when you ran that update I can trigger
in the background which would set that
value so this takes advantage of a 12c
feature called invisible columns exactly
I remember that one well there you go
you see you know some stuff and you know
you can select it explicitly here so we
can see what that value is but if I just
do like a select star like a generic
access we can't see what it is so here
you know I've set that invisible column
in the background so I can pick up with
that value we've set things
appropriately why is that valuable to
have them visible calling us so
invisible columns are a useful feature
when it comes to making changes to your
database so it's you know when you're
adding or removing columns from a table
that's kind of like a risky business
something could go wrong right so
particularly if you've got like select
star queries like this this three
columns in you add one so it's going to
have four columns stuff could break by
adding it as an invisible column you
kind of de-risking that process it's
less likely that something will
accidentally fall over
and this is perhaps more important if
you're trying to get rid of a column
because if you drop a column that's like
that's it it's gone the only way to get
it back is to go back to backup and
restore the table you don't really want
to do that yeah exactly
yeah you don't you don't want to find
out that you know you just broken your
application because you dropped a column
when some it was really being used you
didn't update your code correctly so
this can help kind of de-risk that
process you can mark it invisible so
developers don't see it when they're
doing things like select stars hopefully
they're not coding new things so you can
kind of gracefully kind of get rid of it
saying with deprecating this column you
shouldn't use it anymore because it's
invisible okay and then when you'll got
some more confidence that you've updated
all your code you can finally get rid of
it for real all right then well
fantastic yep
very cool well thank you so much for the
for the card trick oh thank you Laura
you did a great because it's great there
thank you and maybe you'll come back and
do some more tricks later in the week
huh oh yeah I've got a couple of tricks

o'clock I can't remember they're right
back to back so the first ones at 11:30
