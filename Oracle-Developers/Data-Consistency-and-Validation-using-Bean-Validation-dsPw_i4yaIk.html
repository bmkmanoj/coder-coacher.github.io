I'm a cloud evangelist at Oracle and
today I'm going to talk to you about
data consistency using being validation
B validation OPI makes it easier to
validate and consists your data before
you do anything with that okay so I'm
just show you a new example on how the
version 2.0 just updated some new stuff
and you can do it very easily in a very
cool way so let's see the demo so we
have here our customer I just created a
plain plain old Java object so we have
here some fields where I use some
annotations for from being validation
and first of all we have here an ID and
I use it the positive annotation oh the
positive we'll make sure that you're
your interior will be positive okay so
if you inform an ID less than zero it
won't work is a negative so the second
one is a not blank on the previous
version of B validation we have just an
not no and but you could be you would be
able to inform and not know string but
you could do that using spaces for
example so it's a blank string so now we
have the not blank so you should not be
new and not either
blank okay and we have also the size the
size and notation that will inform the
minimum and maximum size of your name
for example when you have you also the
email a notation now-ish you don't have
to write your own code to to validate
your email format and using the add
character and so on so you have a
notation for that and we have also done
our empty notation that especially for
lists you you are sure that your list is
not empty okay so it will validate once
you are using it and what I've done here
is writing a unit test to try our
our roles so we have here a validator
from the the big validation and we said
once the the the test is is going up and
here we have methods for trying all
those those roles for the first one just
to make sure that the value summer is
real valid so we have here a positive ID
not blank name real valid email in a
list this is not empty okay so this one
shouldn't have any violation
concentrates at all and then we try the
other ones the negative so we are trying
here a negative ID we have a blank name
with blank name here and long name with
a real long name
greater than 45 characters an invalid
email without the add character and we
have here the entry address with an
entry empty list so it's just right and
check if our roles well design it and
it's working so it will build the
project
so it's try those six rows and no
failures no rehearse at all thanks for
watching see you next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
