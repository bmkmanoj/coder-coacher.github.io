life I'm your host Javed Mohammed here
at Oracle called Sydney so I have as my
guest
general Wenzel who is a developer
advocate Gerald welcome enjoy it thank
you so it's been a busy morning here at
article called Sydney you with MC for
the for the keynotes and he highlights
you want to kind of share from that well
my kind of little mistake or screwed up
if you like was when I threw out the
hoodie and it went all the way into the
roof animator the screen shake but we
have some fantastic speakers are really
good we had Peter Lorre and Chris
Richardson on two keynotes
we can have Peter Lorre later on Alda
perfect yeah and could be interviewed in
there I interviewed in Beijing okay / -
jet test executives know exactly what
they're talking about great and then
afterwards we had Steven Tyndall and
Otto Franco coming on to did an Oracle
keynote on on API sand the orator cloud
and chat box that was really really
informative as well and I think people
have taken a lot of things away quite
positively the room was full was packed
no people have left throughout the
keynote so that I could see sir I was
really exciting great
so Oracle code is targeted at developers
so obviously and that is our primary
audience both through here and I meant a
clear through to the event and just any
thoughts in terms of what else I guess
we can be doing I guess in terms of that
the outreach of the in terms of getting
the message getting the message out yeah
I think I think the important thing is
that Oracle started again to reach out
to developers so this is really a goal
for us now and it's not at all it'll
never do that but it's a while ago and
this is like what then we're at the 18th
I think this is the 18th event the 18th
event yeah we have two more two girls
with
Bangalore coming up on the 4th of August
I think and then Seoul South Korea on
the 30th of August yes if anyone out
there happens to be in any of those
regions please
sign up is a free event yeah it's
gradient great speakers always great
content people always regard fantastic
reviews people enjoyed it a lot so far
great okay and you're a developer
advocate is there some particular
technologies that you focus on yes so I
have a heavier Oracle database
background kind of a half a database guy
I have a developer which actually is
some of the rediscover the area shall we
say with all the data science around
data managing it the different no sequel
databases etc so actually I feel quite
happy in its basement of developers
again talk about how do we leverage
databases how do we actually manage data
and so forth but that's not only the
only thing so I'm a talker fanboy as
well
some people may know my name or have
used to some of the doctor bills
elsewhere fund gets up for the Oracle
database so I keep involving that and
answer questions around that so on the
way to the venue this morning we were
actually talking about how Oracle has a
large present at only in terms of their
enterprise and the database but also in
open source you want to talk a little
bit about that yeah certainly so that's
also something that people don't
necessarily associate author with open
source right but Oracle always had a
presence and the open source space I
mean just the usual candidates that
people tend to forget right it's Java my
sequel Oracle Linux there's all open
source
and there's many other projects out that
every drive in an open source effort but
it has also the last couple of months or
a year also changed that we have
actively driven even more open source
product and it's just I believe two
weeks ago that we launched three new
products in the container space fully
open source on our github want us to
deploy container based architecture so
micro containers actually want us to
troubleshoot them and I believe the
third on is to monitor mccottry was a
really cool tools they're very popular
picked up right away and fully driven
and open source man and that's just one
of the examples there's many many more
out there okay
and if folks out there I want to
actually try out some of the
the the cloud services I guess we have a
special deal going on you want to talk a
little bit about that one yes and if you
would like to sign up for order to cloud
trial you can sign up you get right now

dollar promo going on so you get five
