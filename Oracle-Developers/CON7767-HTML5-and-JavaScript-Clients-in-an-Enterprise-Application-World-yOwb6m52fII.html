thank you very much for coming clearly
this topic is of great interest to many
people html5 and JavaScript clients in
an enterprise application world my name
is Aoki on villain ha I'm product
manager on Oracle and I want to share
some thoughts on the new world of
JavaScript and how new it is and how
useful it is and what we can do with it
and what the problems might be hopefully
there'll be some time at the end for
discussion but we'll see how we go and
someday told me recently that when
you're born and the world that you find
around you is what you consider to be
the default state of things and that the
world that you see around you between
the age of 15 and 35 is new and exciting
and something to be embraced and the
world that you find when you're around
the age of 45 is a world that you should
resist at all costs and fight so I'm
looking around and I'm seeing a
significant number of people falling
into the into the last category and I
want to you know honestly approach this
topic and see what we can learn from it
and what we can do with it and if it is
really a world only relevant for small
apps and toys and the like because the
world is quite scary of course for many
people there is this massive chasm of a
scary stuff that is kind of undefined
and volatile and in constant flux that
we find ourselves confronting as soon as
we take a step out of our comfortable
Java world with its very clearly
specified everything and it's libraries
and its ecosystem and its discussions
and it's 20 years of existence suddenly
all of those things that you might have
thought as being a signs of
things grinding along suddenly appeared
to be something that is really excellent
and something that we're now missing in
this in this world that we found
ourselves in in the in the JavaScript
ecosystem so what is this world and you
know what does it consist of and why is
it even there and what can we do with it
as serious developers so first of all I
would suggest that where we are right
now is based on three developments that
are very closely related to each other
and the first of these anomalies are
surprising but just to mention them and
the first of these the fact that there
are now multiple different devices and
multiple different screen sizes the how
topic are responsive design would be
completely irrelevant and has been
completely irrelevant after up to this
point because we've always had the same
resolution to deal with but now we have
all these different kinds of devices
mobile devices iPads tablets and whatnot
and so now we need to deal with the
reality that our app could be deployed
to unused in a whole range of different
with a whole range of different screen
sizes and we need to program our
applications appropriately and find
ready-made solutions if possible for
dealing with this reality with the same
image but a different header here kind
of you know closely related to this the
browser is everywhere and it's maybe an
obvious thing to say but with stating
the browser is everywhere and as a Java
developer I'd always thought that the
JVM would be everywhere and that's true
too to a large degree but on the front
end if you're doing front-end
development this is why javascript is is
so interesting to so many people because
the browser is everywhere on all of
those different multiple devices that
are out there so is there an easier way
to approach all of those devices then to
use JavaScript probably not and this
explains where we found ourselves
related to that also is as a third point
I'd like to put into this category of
factors is the single page application
and this is very closely tied to the
other two
because if you're aware that the user of
your application is going to have
problems with bandwidth and battery life
and the like then the less navigation
you have in your application and simpler
it is and the more focused it is on
doing one particular thing the better
for your end user so all the frameworks
that we had in the past in the Java
world a lot of them were really focused
on navigation between pages and about
different components and how to get from
one to the other and those kinds of
things and and these the whole question
of navigation you know eats up your
battery life and the best navigation is
maybe no navigation and keeping
everything simple and so the whole topic
of sparse is you know very current and
so this also means that the applications
that are being created tend to be a lot
simpler and then before and much more
focused on one particular function
selling a product reserving a room and
those kinds of things so I would say
that that these three factors underpin
the increasing popularity over the past
years of JavaScript and also the
innovation that you have seen happening
in that space in the past and you would
wake up every other week and find that
there's a new server side java framework
and that isn't happening anymore instead
every other day there's a new JavaScript
framework that solves some problem and
offers to be the completely best and new
and greatest solution until the next day
when there's another JavaScript
framework promising the same thing so
that that innovation that we used to see
on the Java server side is not happening
a lot on the on the JavaScript side so
I'd like to approach a response to this
reality from the point of view of 10
tips so I'd like to leave you with 10
tips and that's really the main part of
this story focused around four different
teams so I'd first like to suggest that
you should see HTML very differently and
CSS very differently to what you might
think before we even look at Java
good and then once we've done that we
could actually look at javascript in in
a different way and to what you might
traditionally think javascript to be so
to start off with the very first tip tip
number one do you resist the hive I
really think you really need to consider
the use cases you know where the
application of you correcting is being
used think about things like the fact
that if you're creative an air traffic
control system behind the firewall
there's no one out there waiting to do
their air traffic control management on
a mobile device there are so many use
cases where you simply do need a large
screen size and when you discover that
all the users of the application are
sitting in exactly the same room with
each other and they are doing some very
heavy data processing and visualization
do ask yourself whether simply keeping
with the old tools and techniques that
you've had in the past is not the way to
go and what you'll find actually and
I've seen as quite a lot is that it's
normally the management of your user
group you're you're you're tired user
that is pushing for a web-based solution
but not the users themselves and this is
of course a very sad sad situation that
you were in so it's it's on your site as
a developer that your managers are
pushing you to write web-based and
mobile oriented applications and on the
side of the users it's their management
saying we really need to have a
web-based solution here because that's
the cool thing and we really need to
move off the desktop but in reality
neither you know the actual user of the
application has that interest at heart
so I would suggest a tip one a consider
as a compromise supplementing the
existing system worth one of these
modern technologies so the air traffic
control system continues to be exactly
where it is however you add a mobile app
to it so that urgent notifications can
be sent to the HH control users of that
system a web app so that the management
can see how there was
sticks so there are ways of integrating
existing systems into this new
technology world without necessarily
rewriting everything and throwing
everything away you can add and
integrate using mobile apps and web apps
while remaining squarely in the place
where the application should really be
so that would be my very first step do
you resist where it doesn't make sense
and of course where it does make sense
it's a good thing to go down this route
and the second point I'd like to make is
an html5 is completely different to what
you might think it is so originally HTML
was obviously all about documents and
you might think okay so what I'm saying
is completely well-known it is
completely well known that that html5
are for this video and audio and
multimedia type functionality but did
you know that it also offers application
type functionality so including a
validation and error handling and and
full-blown components that I want to
show you something over in a very short
demo in a moment so there's a host of
new elements that are not that are
really not focused only at video and
multimedia and those kinds of things but
that are also focused on on true
application development and this comes
from the basic principles of what html5
is all about so these are the principles
of the latest HTML specification but the
new features in HTML should be based on
HTML CSS and JavaScript that as far as
possible there should be no flesh or
other plugins involved but error
handling should be simpler than it was
before that there should be more focus
on markup and understandably that html5
should be device independent and related
to that is the concept of shadow Dom so
a shadow Dom provides a separation
between the content and the presentation
of an HTML element whereas in the past
you this might have been expressed by i
plug in or via some scripting or
something like that and this is now a
new way of composing HTML elements
including the HTML elements at rmv html5
specification so I want to show you
something very quickly and if you're not
aware of this this will be pretty
interesting to see so i'll create a
awesome app and here it is and in this
awesome app i'm going to add a new html5
component so here is a something called
a datalist my data list provides a
full-blown credit completion drop down
type functionality in auto completion so
first of all we have here a HL a native
HTML element code label which is also
noon html5 we have the standard input
element that was always there on HTML
but what's included is a new attribute
called list so this is new in html5 so
list attribute is used to identify an
element that lists predefined options
suggested to the user and because in
this data list element here which is
also noon html5 the IDS country this
data list is connected to this input
element and therefore in my I'm going to
have when I when I see this in the
browser a drop-down and when i type in
it they will automatically be completion
provided for me by the data list element
so let's do that so run this and here it
is and here's my country field and
here's the the input and when i start
typing so you can see these are the
items that are in that list so when i
start typing immediately you can see
that that the filtering is built into
this so if you have in your websites web
apps whatever created this kind of
functionality via various kinds of
libraries that are available jquery or
whatever this is not natively part of
HTML there's nothing you need to do for
that except use the native HTML elements
so in this step really look at html5 as
providing an application framework with
pre-built components that provide this
really cool functionality
and so and another example is the
required so this is for some validation
so let's look in the browser what is
your favorite movie we click Submit and
then you can see here please fill out
this field and that please fill out this
field is there simply because we have
this attribute required added now this
is it could say okay there's a small
stuff but this is completely new you in
HTML and gives you the foundation for
creating much more powerful applications
without including a whole bunch of
libraries and there are more like that
but so that this this trip would be take
a look at what hTML is now offering you
and make use of what it natively
provides the third set what everyone
knows about CSS in the css3
specifications on the later
specification is that it is all about a
multimedia and about providing media
queries so you can say if the screen
width is like this then show this and if
not then show that but what is
interesting is that what the media
queries in CSS do is they hide Dom
elements from the view the hide them
that don't load and unload them
dynamically on the fly which is what
various JavaScript libraries do so i
want to show you in a very quick demo
that instead of benefiting from the
responsive design that CSS offers and
the cool thing that people find about
CSS being the media queries you can just
as well use javascript for it and
javascript doesn't actually better so
I'm going to make use of a small app
that is online it's a template that is
on github it's called solid knock out
and it's basically a template that
provides a basic structure for working
with enterprise Java Script
here
and here it is so here is this template
and I want to open it in the browser and
you will not like what it looks like
because it's really ugly but the point
is to show you something here and once
it starts up okay so this is a
supposedly a coca-cola site but the
point of this is okay so we have now
this application at full screen size
full screen resolution but if you make
it smartphone portrait you see that the
coca-cola bottle of the logo go away and
that this text you are using a large
resolution will change so as you can see
now using a small resolution however
let's inspect what is actually going on
alive in the Dom so I'm going to make it
large again so I click on this in the
browser and I can see in this live Dom
inspector what is available in the Dom
at this point in time so here is the
bottle here is the logo in the bottom
left and here is the be tagged so now we
switch this to the smaller resolution
and you can see that the battle is still
there and the leather is gone so look at
the bottle what's going on here and what
you can see here is that media queries
are used so this is CSS it just hides
the element from the view it's still in
the Dom you can see it's still on the
dumb the other one when I make it larger
again you can see it again because it's
back now is this logo and go to the
source and what you can see here is a
little bit of knockout so here's a
knockout data binding and here we have
an if not which comes from knockout and
here is a condition if not we are small
we look in here and there is some logic
here so expressed in JavaScript via a
framework called response GIS there are
break points so here the breakpoints
defined and here we're saying if if this
particular breakpoint is hit then set
that condition to true and otherwise
sedative false and based on that we
either
or hide our our logo so here's a tip
take a look at response GIS response
james Kalm javascript responsive design
but there's a second example and that is
that text that changes and it changes
again not because of CSS but because of
this bit of HTML which comes from a
frame record foundation interchange so
via foundation interchange which you can
see here on line 32 to 34 we can specify
which fragrance so these are these are
pointers to an HTML file in our project
should be shown under the conditions of
the breakpoint so here's this small
medium and large and this is made
possible at this data interchange which
comes from foundation and so the tip
there would be to take a look at
foundations urb.com and part of their
great solutions is this interchange
functionality so let's step number three
don't don't buy the whole CSS media
queries story immediately without
looking at what javascript can do
especially since javascript can on the
fly add and remove Dom elements which a
CSS doesn't do okay so then once you get
to the point where you looking at actual
frameworks there's of course a plethora
of possibilities and the one that one
normally gets to very quickly within the
first three minutes is angular and
angular has a very large ecosystem and
it's very well established and there's a
whole community around it there are many
libraries around it it's been there for
a while which is well supported and so
on and this is really the framework
approach so if you like taking framework
and we're working with that framework
then angular is definitely a good choice
the other approach always as in any
ecosystem or or library or language is
to assemble your own infrastructure
instead of taking the angular the entire
angular stack assembling your own and
there are many options in this space if
you're going to
you that you might consider angular
being too heavy and you would rather
pick and choose the libraries that are
relevant for your specific needs so you
would start by looking at these
libraries first of all because these are
the the most basic JavaScript libraries
on top of the JavaScript language so
prototype underscore dojo jquery and
mootools actively being developed to
various extents so that's always the
question to ask of course but these
would be the initial ones that you would
need to look at in assembling your own
your own framework basically and and
also at some point you need to evaluate
which of the build systems are going to
use so if you're in the Java Sea if
you're new to the JavaScript ecosystem
instead of mtor maven you would
investigate grunt and just when your
happily using grunt everyone will tell
you now that's old that's it so last
week you need to use gulp bus gulp is
the new grunt and it turns out that
brunch is the new gulp so in case you
didn't know that and in case you're very
excited about gulp take a look at brunch
because it does everything so much
better than gob and then you need to
look at the front end and you know
angular provides a complete front end
solution but on the alternative route
you will take a look at most typically
backbone and ember and knock out
initially and meteor these also are
front-end frameworks that provide
solutions as well look a bit more at
that in a second because then you're
going to go to indeed com or someplace
like that and you type in all of these
names to see which is the most popular
but be careful because the fact that
something is most popular on indeed com
or something like that only tells you
how interested people are in a
particular framework which doesn't
necessarily mean that they're using it
there's no way that any site can tell
you what people are actually using in
real life unless someone is actually
going on interviewed thousands of people
or something like that but these sites
are very misleading I would say and they
they indicate what kinds of searches
have been done online and what people
are looking for and certainly angular is
is up there in terms of popularity and
people are researching it so it's
definitely an attractive option backbone
would be a strong focus on MVC it would
be its main advantage knockout focuses
very specifically on to a data binding
whereas the angular approach is the Olin
one angle if we were to look at what not
kind of specifically focuses on there's
a bunch of handy tutorials on a knockout
site so it's very narrowly focused on
data binding so what that means is to a
data binding we have here three input
elements and we have this attribute data
binding to sort a little bit already and
we are binding a property in our view
model so here's a property called first
name and last name and full name which
is computed from the first name and last
name and they are bound to input
elements and the span element in our
view and that's it and that's really
what what knockout focuses on on binding
a view to a model and using the standard
elements in HTML and to express the view
and using javascript to express the
business logic and nowadays as well then
the new thing to look at in this context
is react react is very popular Facebook
is behind it and come out with react
some time ago already and I've been at a
number of conferences for people were
saying no we're not doing angular at all
anymore we really like react now and so
there seems to be some kind of some kind
of switch to react which means that you
need to go down or how different rabbit
hole because there's a whole range of
frameworks and libraries and solutions
that fit into the reactor ecosystem it
has its own community with its own
solutions yet yet to go so that's
something that that you'll hear about a
lot when you're investigating these
things that in addition to angular as a
solution there's this also react to look
at then on top of all of that and some
of these base libraries you will have
component libraries and what's
interesting is a component library
provided by Prime phase and also by
kendo which are traditionally known as
providing JSF compound
so definitely an indication of a change
in technology space that the providers
of component libraries in Java or for
for jsf are now providing those same
same kind of components for JavaScript
so there's jQuery UI very popular and
this ignites and Yui and kendo UI and
primefaces to explore then as in Java
this a whole range of unit testing and
integration testing frameworks to
examine if you're in the angular space
then protract sure would be an obvious
one which is really nice about angular
that it's got an ecosystem with
libraries and solutions that that fit
into that ecosystem and the tractor
comes out of the same organization then
since you're in the JavaScript space
you're probably there because you want
to do something with mobile devices so
there are also mobile solutions and
there is the option to use Cordova or as
it was known phonegap to convert your
JavaScript application to a native
application so then a native rapper is
created by Cordova around your
JavaScript to make it a native Android
app or a native iOS app and there is a
jquery mobile and a bunch of other
mobile solutions so jQuery Mobile on top
of jQuery and what's also really nice to
examine if you're doing anything with
JavaScript and mobile is the ionic
framework ionic framework provides a
whole bunch of components and easy ways
of working with with mobile applications
written in JavaScript and kind of
miscellaneous topic but very important
you hear about this all the time yeoman
Bower and node so node giving you the
possibility to go full JavaScript and
Bauer something like maven in the sense
of getting your dependencies and yeoman
for scaffolding and generating of your
basic infrastructure at the start of
your application very useful is as a tip
is to definitely incorporate modularity
so this is something that we've been
wanting forever as an official part of
Java and once you enter the JavaScript
space you will see that there are
modularity solutions for you to try out
they're requirejs being the more popular
one at the moment and also take a look
at abstractions and by that I mean you
don't need to type bearer HTML CSS
JavaScript there are things around it so
you can use something called Emmet
instead of typing HTML there's a sort of
sub language in emmett that generates
HTML snippets for you and says unless
you would use with CSS and there's
coffee script and typescript as
alternatives for for JavaScript now you
can see there are many different options
when different libraries possibility of
going down the wrong track and finding
yourself stuck with allowing that's no
longer being supported and so tip number
seven is really don't worry about this
ecosystems volatility except if you do
if if you do worry about it this is
maybe not the place for your your system
this is a system that this ecosystem is
constantly changing I'm constantly new
features are being added new libraries
are being written but the I think the
point is a large majority of the
applications written in the JavaScript
ecosystem are kind of small to
medium-sized I'm not yet seeing or
hoping to the to discover and air
traffic control system written in
JavaScript for example so these these
really large scientific monitoring type
systems typically one would not find in
this space it's more the kind of
application that's written quickly and
brought to market and used and it's in
production and then when there are new
features a year or so later rather than
adding those features to the existing
application what often happens is that a
completely new application is written
from scratch and knowing that in the
back of your mind that when there is a
new feature requests in the future a new
application will be written would kind
of lead you to write code that doesn't
necessarily need to be maintained
because maintainability isn't a major
concern in this space so as sometimes
this results in JavaScript code not
being so well-written and well
structured but on the other
sometimes that doesn't really matter
because things are changing and you
frameworks and libraries are coming in
all the time so I'm curious does anyone
here know what wanta stands for okay
you're about to find out from write once
run anywhere to write once and never
touch again and and again this is not
necessarily a critique or a negative
thing and it's it's not sarcastic or
whatever it's just really a lot of these
applications need to be written once use
for is for real purposes or demo
purposes and then you move on to the
next step then what's also really a
useful thing to want to do is to
evaluate what large corporations are
doing in this JavaScript space with
these different libraries that are
available so I'm google has a solution
ing as a solution it was very
interesting so a couple of sessions at
conferences in Europe where ing
presented component libraries are
decorated on top of angular and this
this framework it's open source it's on
github called spectacular is used
internally at ING to correct their
banking software and if you want to have
the same kind of look and feel when the
same kind of component says as you'll
find in ing sites you would use this and
Salesforce has a solution in IBM as a
solution and there is now also and here
it is a solution by Oracle and it's
actually announced this week and it's
it's almost not been mentioned anywhere
yet but there is a JavaScript framework
that's been worked on for the last two
years internally with an Oracle and has
been used for a number of the Oracle
sites so the mel belle isle service site
and and the iot cloud service site and
the various sites that have been built
up various applications to present
services to to users have been built in
a framework called jet so this is how it
is referred to oracle jet and the
javascript extension toolkit and it is
it takes the approach of using open
source libraries as a basis and then
adding Oracle specific components to it
so this is basically the story and jet
empowers developers by providing a
modular toolkit so it's it's modular out
of the box it has accessibility built in
which large organizations need it is
internationalization built-in is built
on top of knock out on top of require on
top of jQuery jQuery UI and then there
are a bunch of data like components or
graphs and maps and charts which are
really hard to do and you normally need
to get some off-the-shelf product and
pay for it but this is all part of this
this is the same the same infrastructure
and it's really focused on on developers
your operating intermediate to to learn
our applications and there's a URL is a
site where you can go and you can see
this Oracle jet org and there is a
there's a youtube channel there is a
twitter handle there are demos there's a
cookbook with examples to get started
with and it's it's proven in the sense
that it's been used internally for a
whole bunch of sites that have been
developed at Oracle so there are samples
there's a cookbook with with starting
points for for working with this so how
this looks when you so there's a getting
started template and what this gives you
out of the box without doing anything
else is see here it is out of the box
you get
once I run it snuck the lunch
it's been worth
yes I wanted to share another one first
okay so let's run this one first this is
a slightly more advanced so it's got a
starting point so it's the simplest
template gives you a starting point with
with these links and tires and so on and
it also this chart is just part of of
jet so charts and maps and graphs and
this is really simple to create and the
more advanced application it's also
available as a sample is called the
better app and looks like this since
loaded so there's a complete example and
built into it is modularity so I would
use it require and its its uses
responsive design so the same principles
from from foundation interchange or
built into this so you can see that as
soon as we switch from from run
resolution to the other automatically
everything resizes itself to fit the
screen size so accessibility
internationalisation modularity based on
knock out based on jquery and such so
there's also a bunch of sessions about
this there's one this afternoon this one
tomorrow about this new framework this
is a hands-on lab there are two sessions
to hands-on labs one tomorrow and the
other the next day and you can get
introduced to this to this solution
there is a final tip and to briefly
explore and that is the fact that you
could look at javascript as being a
simply language and rather than a
language that you want to code in
yourself the jet solution and the
solutions by the other organizations
assume that you still going to be
writing in JavaScript however the fact
that the browser needs JavaScript that
that that javascript is the language of
the browser does not necessarily mean
that it is a language that you need to
code in you could simply see it as
assembly language because javascript is
tied directly to a
particular architecture and there's a
lowly of a programming language in the
way that the assembly language is in
other cases too so when you look at the
70 language you might not think our
javascript fits into this picture but
when you look at javascript again it
does look a lot like assembly language
and it might not be something that you
would want to code by hand and yourself
so if you prefer taking the other out
and where you're not using a javascript
in your in your coding practice you
could look at transpires and even the
people the strongest supporters
including the inventor of java script
itself have talked about javascript
being a simple language it's not a
derogatory comment it's just the way
that the javascript is it's tied to the
browser it so it's the language in the
browser so there are a range of
different transpiler source-to-source
compiler is that you might want to use
and until explorer and coffee script and
transcripts are kind of in that space
and a kind of well-known and darks the
where that is at the moment is kind of
questionable and grit and violin are the
most popular a way to approach the
javascript problem without being
integrated in javascript and I want to
talk especially about Duke script
because this offers something and
comparable to value but is probably new
to you so jig script is a solution that
you can find when you go to Duke
scribd.com which I have somewhere here
it is cube script calm and it's
supported there's a company behind it in
Germany Zhukov and what it is about is
enabling you to write the business logic
of your application directly in in Java
so the idea here is that you can that on
all the different devices there is some
kind of vm available so there is dalvik
on android there's robo vm on iOS and
there's joob scripts own transpired from
Java to JavaScript available for the web
and on the desktop there's a hot spots
and for the view and the view we have
javafx i'm not on the desktop and
android has a web
you and iOS has a web view and and the
web has chrome or any other browser to
view the content in and what this script
does is it bundles all these different
solutions into one system and lets you
work with it directly at the difference
between what do trip does and what what
grid does is that with grit and verdun
you are writing a business logic in java
whereas with jig script you can write
your business logic in HTML so you're
right your business logic in HTML but
you're right sorry you're right your
view layer in HTML and your business
logic in Java whereas with with rather
than with everything is in in Java the
nice thing then with Duke script is that
you can split off the HTML to go to a
designer to work on on the HTML side
while you work on the business logic and
and also the other difference between
Virdon and Duke script is that with with
Duke script you end up with a native
application so the native Android app a
native iOS app or native app for the
desktop whereas with rather than what
you end up with an actual web
application and so so those are some
significant differences so to see how
this works there are maven archetypes
for this and built in here is a
step-by-step wizard which takes you
through the process and sets everything
up for you so you would step through
this and so next and you would say I
want this to run on Android I want this
to run in the browser I want this to be
used to use knockout bindings so you can
use bindings for different frameworks
you can include the sample code in it
and if you go through the process you
end up exactly with this and here is
where the client code is found and so in
this example we have a a web page here
and so I'm just going to remove all the
example code and build in our own code
and the code i will use for this is the
knockout tutorial so if i go to the
knockout site here is the HTML so we're
going to copy and paste this and express
our view in HTML
and here is the data model and you can
see there's a computed property and
there is a standard property these use
annotations and they generate aperture
on the fly so there's really nothing we
need to do here other than define our
properties so we have a first name
property here we have a first name
property and a last name property and a
full name property so here is first name
and here is last name and here we have a
type system because we're using Java so
this we would not have if we were using
javascript and we can then say okay this
is going to return here a string which
is the full name so here you can see
it's the same language as knockout using
the computer property we had here as
well and a normal property and the full
name is based on the first name and the
last name and we fit them together and
return them here and that is our
business logic so now we are actually
writing what would normally be a
knockout application not in JavaScript
but in Java with its type system so now
once we generate the application so
these use maven archetype so here you
can see and also the nice thing is
because of the type system can also use
quite completion much better than we
would with JavaScript so set first name
and here is the set last name so this is
to initialize the values and now when we
compile this application what we end up
with is an Android app so an apk file a
desktop app and a browser app it's going
to remove this test and then we can
generate the application from here and
all those different outputs that we
specified will be created for us and
we'll be able to deploy our application
on all our different devices
so let's see how long it will take us
okay so let's take a look here so what
you have here for Android so we could
deploy this you can see here APK file
has been created and on the here's a
client code so this is our web view in
javafx and this is our application in
the browser almost there
here we are so run the application when
it's room d the web
so the web browser starts up and here we
have exactly the code the exactly the
application we had before except that we
now write everything in German and we
use HTML for the be ok and so
to wrap up the tips I wanted to share
with you are to first of all and resist
the hype and to to where it makes sense
and continue to using the solutions that
you have before and to combine them with
with mobile and web solutions to think
of actually no it's an application
framework to compare a CSS as responsive
design but with JavaScript evaluate the
various libraries this is a changing
ecosystem and you can evaluate the
corporate frameworks and if you want to
stay with Java you can look at the
JavaScript as an assembly language that
you yourself don't need to code in thank
you thank you very much are there any
questions from anybody yes JB sitting
right here yeah so the licensing for jet
today we announced it this week and it's
available for anybody to download and
play with and do anything you want with
it it's actually been released in a
three phase structure the first phase
was an internal release we did a year
ago and that's all the mobile cloud or
the public cloud software you're seeing
today is written with that this week
we're announcing that it's open for
production or commercial use with
customers that have purchased or
subscribe to Oracle cloud services so
mobile cloud service developer cloud
service those types of things we're
already in the process of fully opening
so open sourcing it it will be available
on github next year at some point and
open for everybody to use for free
Apache 20 license unlimited yeah legally
I can only say a year and jet JB is the
product manager for jet so it's I think
it's a really wonderful solution in the
image JavaScript space any other
questions yes
it's mature yeah there are there are
applications that have been written in
it there's a book being written in it
about it there are developers working on
it there's a company supporting it so if
you want to stick in the Java in the
Java world it's definitely something to
look at you should definitely evaluate
it along with raden if you want to you
know not go the JavaScript road yeah
yeah yeah it's definitely worth
comparing it with vanden plas badan is
pure java yeah and so with with gypsy up
you can just really give you a HTML
pages to to someone else to to to to
design and get them back and then
connect them to your to your business
logic in Java it's really awesome I have
no pony in this race I don't work for
them I just think it's a cool thing yes
yes definitely
yes they'll be available I'm not sure
where but somewhere on the on this on
the Java one side after the conference
if you further questions please come up
and chat thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
