lives and the last one here at Oracle
code Sydney I'm the host Javed Mohammed
and I have with me Craig bar and Arun
Merrick with the rubicon read gentleman
welcome thank you so you guys had a
session earlier and the title is very
interesting it's a how to make your
micro-services sing were you able to
make them say sorry okay all right and
you want to share with us just a little
bit about all right so tell us a little
bit about your presentation it's funny I
mentioned maybe able to make our
micro-services sing I think Craig opened
his presentation with a very intriguing
talk but how can actually make your
microservices sing so he was about he
kind of you know talk to the audience
about how you can have an application
where you can speak to Alex and throw
random words and hands and stuff and can
probably like you know repeat that
through a singing so if you wanted your
microservices to sing and then they can
but our so our our presentation was
nothing about that but it was more about
how do you kind of bailed microservices
both from bottoms up and from and from a
top-down approach and how do you kind of
you know uh have DevOps how you apply
the practices of DevOps and cárdenas to
build those micro services so can you
just elaborate perhaps a little bit on
that Craig I mean so room talked about
developing Microsoft top-down bottom-up
how do you go about doing that yeah so
what we were talking about in this
session we introduced the open API
specification
formally known as the swagger spec so
with that we can actually define our
api's we can model them and we can we
can generate our API documentation and
share it with our stakeholders we can
also generate our our code using things
like the swagger coach n so we showed
that kind of top-down approach where you
you know model in your API services that
we're going to provide to your consumers
we talked a little
about the bottom-up approach as well
where you know this open API
specification we can also use that if
we've taken a more code centric starting
point we can also generate our swagger
definition and you know for me like the
value of swagger is is the visibility
that gives you how consumers can
interact with your api's and yeah all
right so you mentioned about DevOps so
once you've defined your API how does
that kind of how does that factor into
in terms of from a developer standpoint
yeah so what about key things in our
presentation or the 12 factor
application check so once you so what
our presentation covered was once you
have built what lets you have a monolith
and you want to break it down and break
it down into micro services you want to
apply the principles of live up so that
you have a repeatable process of
checking in your code where and then
probably putting that code through a
life cycle through a pipeline of testing
and acceptance test unit testing
integration testing all the way through
deployment promotion and and finally a
release and we talked about the 12
factor application check across these
life cycles to see how you can apply the
principles of DevOps
in that process okay what are some of
those you know to go through this all's
well but what are some of those factors
that the dimension yeah so we looked at
if I talk about maybe the first couple
so sure them was about having one code
base so you should have one code base
which used to deploy to many
environments so you know in our story
that we told about the medical records
we also have these scripts that are used
to deploy to our environments we might
have our operations guys running SQL
scripts and you know if you if you want
to look at a micro service a more
appropriate model for micro services the
application should be in control of its
own data so we showed that you know we
can actually move and we can actually
version control our database
changes along with our code base for our
application code and we can essentially
get get our applications to be more
cloud native so that means we can
actually deploy them and we can link
them up to any back in service it should
be very so you're talking about like
having like one called repository like
github or some something like that
something like that yeah another one of
the principles is around dependencies so
it's about saying we should have
explicit dependencies defined so for our
cloud native applications we shouldn't
be assuming that we have specific
versions of our application server or
packages on our target environments
because then you know we're not going to
end up with a particularly portable
application so that was where in the
talk I introduced docker and also
packaging systems like maven and Gradle
as a way to make sure that we explicitly
defining our application in a way that
it's containerized and that we could we
could deploy anywhere so all we need is
the docker engine we don't have to rely
on anything else existing there we push
out container to the docker hub and then
we can pull that down onto the docker
registry so there's 12 of these
principles and I won't look at all the
variables ok so these are these are
quite mature principles and Lincoln and
Craig also dick talked about in his
presentation that they originate from
the hero ku team and they are about 5
years old now but still is very relevant
in terms of building building
containerize applications using using
micro services underneath yeah yeah so
basically we've gone from the 10
commandments to the 12 accuracy captain
right yeah so no Sam I just know most
exciting right yeah very much all right
so one last question so I'll kind of go
back to your earlier question so making
Mike is the title is is just captivating
so are you guys going to be auditioning
for Australian Idol or whatever is
called over here probably not but we do
what we also what we also did it for the
presentation was we did a live demo of
how we
able to kind of use the micro services
that is a great craic in its
presentation in our presentation we
showed how you can build microservice
some grounds up using API definitions
and then we also went along and showed a
very cool remote patient monitoring
application where we took reading of a
person through a wrist wrist you know a
blood-pressure risk monitoring device
and we were able to leverage the API is
that we built during the presentation to
sing that data into a cloud and then
trigger an exception if trigger a whole
process based on the reading give us a
second so we kind of ena showed micro
services and everything is good but
what's a real value out of it so the
real value is to move away from ops and
move into apps and to start the
innovation if you have the ops ops
sorted out you really can you know focus
on building your building your apps and
innovator on it so we don't do we don't
plan to go to a shrill ID but we do plan
to go to any hackathons or or to code
even set come in the future to talk
about our slide slides and also about
our demo what sounds like a very
interesting things but not only building
great apps with you building healthy
lives yes yeah of all our session
collateral are part of the presentation
so we've heard a git git repository page
where you can share that with me I'm
opposed to when we post on Muslim yep
look at that well gentlemen thank you so
much for coming by and all the blank you
very much thank you have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
