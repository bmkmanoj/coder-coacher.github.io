the group is so small feel free to speak
up and during the appointment we can
have this session more like a Boff and
more informal big giant room for people
I'm Steve northover client architects
and development manager for JavaFX I
have a long history with UI toolkits I
was involved first in small talk doing
UI toolkits and then in Java I have a
history with Eclipse responsible for
Eclipse SWT and I left IBM quite a while
ago and I've been working on an article
from last maybe three or four years on
effects and other things so on so that's
me with me today is my good friend
Philippe Heinrich okay so well that's a
lot okay I also work on eclipse with
Steve so I have been building in UI two
kids and graphics for over ten years
like my first time I work for
accessibility was um for Linux or 80k
support for the SWT and this over with
start problem December with
accessibility for job FX and we are
happy that were able to complete that
entire ATU 40 and we are about to
present you the new api and all the
features you're going to get good this
is the useless lawyer slide I hope there
aren't any useless lawyers in the
audience and there's the peanut gallery
over there
back get back
we'll make you wait outside so our table
of contents
I guess quickly there's a very minimal
accessible to accessibility API that
will get you off the ground quickly and
a more advanced version it's not really
to api's but we like to think of it like
that
so let's just move on what does it mean
to be accessible and here's the
definition from yeah so I'm going to
read it out accessibility is the degree
to which a product service device
service or environment is available to
as many people as possible
accessibility can be viewed as the
ability to access and benefit from some
system or entity accessible software
aims to address these things visual
impairments etc but the thing that we
were addressing most with the Eclipse
with the JavaFX
accessibility API it's never happened to
me before
ever not during a talk is mostly around
visual impairments and you can see those
that the way to address that is with
screen readers and high contrast themes
the zoom capability etc is normally
built into the operating system and you
don't really have to do much about that
and JavaFX is already a vector-based
graph and so as long as you can use them
building a magnifier jhana factors are
going to look crisp and graphs are gonna
look great so it didn't have to do any
work towards that
just give it a nature of a technology
we're okay on that sense so a screen
reader for somebody that don't know
speak the contents of the control and
they have their own concept of focus and
traversal that is independent from the
JavaFX concept to focus on traversal and
also each different platform will have
different keys to activate that
traversal and those are the three
examples those happen to be the screen
readers that the
accessibility API supports primarily
ones that you are officially testing but
any any on the Mac anything talking as
accessible should work with us but on
the Mac I think is everybody on
voiceover on Windows anyone using there
is no radar not narrator they got emails
jaws anyone who is you I a exactly yeah
so we've implemented the native
accessibility so anybody who speaks that
protocol will work with us or should
work with us now it's untested software
and accessibility is very complicated so
but these are the ones that we test on
it and make sure that work I guess I'm
not gonna say too much here other than
JavaFX has had several attempts at
accessibility and they haven't come up
well in the past there's been various
reasons for that including turnovers on
the team and plus it's a big hard
problem and it tends to get addressed at
the end of a widget toolkit usually the
engineers are more concerned I'm afraid
to say with getting the pixels and
getting the controls built on the screen
and then they try and add accessibility
as an afterthought which is obviously
not good but anyway there was another
aspect that kind of caused some trouble
was that Windows itself had a pretty
sort of terrible
msaa was a kind of half an API and a
bunch of the screen vendors like jaws
had to implement their own workarounds
for help
bad msaa was and so at the time you know
figuring out what accessibility api to
use for Jeff effects was a bit of a
problem because if you use MSA a
there was not enough capability in there
to to make all of JavaFX widgets be
accessible if you went for a proprietary
api of light well ia - I'm calling a
proprietary it was as open standard but
it was not supported by Microsoft so
there was a bunch of there was API
questions and it was only up
till Windows seven where Microsoft
finally got their act in gear and
decided to get serious about
accessibility and provide an API that
was complete enough so that the
accessibility vendors like Freedom
Scientific didn't have to screen scrape
the pixels to understand what strings
were drawn there it gives me the thumb
up so what really made accessibility so
hard well it's it needs a common
portable API and it has a different
implementation way down underneath so
it's got has to have an implementation
for Mac and implementation for Windows
there's all these different controls and
they have their own different behavior
and it makes a lot of API to implement
to make it control be accessible so the
other thing is that the platform
accessibility documentation and the
examples they provide we're not the best
and you know Windows normally it does a
very very good job of having a lot of
examples about how to use their API and
this is an area where they left a lot of
stuff out in particularly I believe
there was not much on the table control
yeah that's correct way is a very large
API so they had some examples and the do
meditation was actually good but it
didn't have the same coverage as other
areas like graphics or cilantro's and
Mac was particularly cryptic in that the
hierarchy of objects had to be a certain
way or the screen reader wouldn't read
it and if the JavaFX hierarchy wasn't
exactly the same way in particularly for
complicated controls like tables if the
screen reader was just not reading it
and none of us documented so it was
difficult to figure out what's going on
why why it wasn't being read and I guess
the last point there is accessibility
cross cuts all the way up so it goes
down to the lowest level of the tool
tech toolkit which is called glass
that's the sea based implementation that
that talks to the operating system so it
goes all the way there all the way up
through controls up to the skins and so
it kind of cross cuts the whole toolkit
and if you give someone yeah
a task of implementing this they get
focused on the lowest level bit and you
know so this is all kind of a giant
excuse why it took us so long to get
this API however at this point we have
the API and we're looking good okay so
there's two other accessibility
implementations are around for java.awt
swing accessibility is known to be not
that great that's all I'm going to say
about it and requires that you have a
extra jar and an extra live shared
library in this and it's clunky in that
way Eclipse accessibility is good for
the native control so as long as you
stick to trees and tables that are
native and eclipse it's pretty good but
when you get farther away from the
native controls an attempt to build your
own controls that are emulated then the
API has bugs and is less is not as good
so I guess the takeaway is that the Java
affects access to the API and
implementation is the best or or you
know of the of the three so far at this
point the most complete so we had some
design goals we wanted to be complete
and minimal so a lot of the time
accessibility isn't turned on for and so
we didn't want to take up the when when
the screen readers etc is not turned on
we didn't want to take up more memory or
make anything slower in that case so we
want we wanted a complete we wanted to
be minimal and complete we had to
implement accessibility for all the
built-in controls so there's I mean the
obvious reason for doing that is so that
the controls are accessible number one
but obviously the second but the second
reason is to test out our API because
we're not only implementing the API way
down deep in the glass layer and down in
the guts of JavaFX we're using that API
to make our control successful and that
is a proof of concept that you can use
the API to make your controls accessible
yeah another thing we'd like to add is
that with java facts if you get to eight
you for the early
doctors build and you run a little hello
world with a few buttons whatever you
throw in there and you start around
narrator or voiceover it's just going to
work you don't need to install any
additional software or do any additional
configuration just run your application
the turn on your screen reader it works
there's no other separate download or
anything else that you need to install
by enemies so this is just a little
diagram that explains kind of very
simply that the implementation is a
lightweight implementation with a
one-to-one mapping between accessible
objects that have no stage two nodes in
the scene graph other possible
implementations would be to have another
higher key and etc and not but of course
take up more memory would be another
hierarchy to maintain I'm talking about
a runtime hierarchy not an inheritance
RG hierarchy my screen just do something
okay so the key takeaway here is that
there's there's no state in that the
accessible objects they are one-to-one
mapping between the nodes and JavaFX and
it's probably about as minimal as you
can get so I guess the talking over but
we've realized our design goals you know
we're using the runtime hierarchy for to
talk to the screen readers we're also
using the inheritance hierarchy to for
our implementation so notice the root
class of a bunch of Java FX nodes and
every node must have certain attributes
associated with it so we're able to
share naturally in the inheritance
hierarchy of the of the classes in Java
effects right right so if the screen
reader is not running then no
accessibility code is getting executed
now is the one of the goals that we had
right and when it is running there is no
data duplication right because if the
the screen reader needs to read the
attacks that it goes straight I don't
know that the very source where that
text is starting rigid for you so we
don't we don't make copies of did don't
duplicate the state duplicated state is
a nightmare anyway in software
engineering
want to do that rights just keeping
things up to date so just piranhas
switch around 4x8 repet accomplice
okay thanks Steve okay okay so we talk
about what we want to do and how we want
to do it and I'm going to start by
saying that a lot of the heavy lift we
have done and put in place for you so as
long as they using the common control
common controls of thing about windows
about our control libraries in Java fax
your accessibility is implemented for
those so we are going to start to free
that that said you're going to get a lot
of things for free but you don't get
everything for free
so there's a lot of simple little cases
that we wanted to make it very simple
for people using our API I think the
most important this is light sprawl the
third one the text property when you
have an image view or a button that does
not have text itself is just arrow
pointing left and that's not enough
information so I will go in details for
each one of these properties but our
hope is that by using this four to five
properties you're gonna solve the
majority of the problems okay so you're
gonna start with the row so for our
controls like buttons and table views
and links that's the red set is already
there
if you want to view your own custom
control you're gonna have to set the row
for that custom control so if you
implement your own button or your own
import link then you're gonna have to
start selling these properties so the
first one is really I would say it here
what what is that control what's the
role that control and based on that row
are we the screen reader is going to
expect some information to be provided
in some actions to be implemented like a
class a role is not going to change so
it's not going to be a button part of
the time and at a table the rest
the time it's right we don't stop you
from doing that but we don't expect you
to do it so you might actually survive
doing that but it's not really yes ya
expect okay so so this is a little code
snippet is actually the real
implementation you would see in Java
facts control buttons so after the
constructor there's a initialize method
that gets called and in our control that
I went through there is one line that we
said the default style class right after
that I said the row so if we start
browser you're gonna see aw did that
have that same pattern happening out
through the toolkit or our controls so
there are two rows that are particularly
a little bit different which is node
with the basic rule every element in the
wire that your screen reader is going to
be interacting with it is a node or a
descendant of a node the first one down
that's important just a parent that's
nothing but a collection of nodes those
knows itself they make the connections
between parent and children but they are
mostly ignore they don't really carry
carry content information to the screen
reader unless you said their role to be
something like a button for example so
if you think about a higher key of Java
effects like a Java effects program at a
large hierarchy of nodes generally and
most of them are containing other nodes
and there's nothing to be spoke for them
so I think Jonathan's theory we could
probably tell you that our button is
aggregation maybe of three or four
different nodes of which just one
program really matters to the screen
reader right there are nodes around that
are there to put gradients and colors
and decorations but the one that really
matters is the one that has the size of
it and the one that has the text robro
description ok 99.9% of the time you're
not gonna worry about this one when you
say is a button the screen reader knows
to say button
if you're doing something that you snide
it or we're going to have example at the
end to say that they paw away arrow or a
chevron or a diagram and you want a
screen read announce that a visual
element to be such then that's when
you're going to use the row description
when you set that then you're on your
own and you need to translate your
software to different languages then
you're gonna have to do the right thing
with that string as well but if most of
the time ladies finger reader goes
Wayne's gonna just get it right for you
so the problem was this that the role is
an enum which means there isn't a user
defined role and the reason it's that
way is that that is the way it's
implemented way down deep on the
Macintosh or the way down deep and the
on Windows Windows has a trade based API
where you can put together stuff into
trace there is a roll as well but it
allows you to combine stuff so you know
when it was time to offer the API if
we'd offered a trade based API that was
similar to what the lowest-level
microsoft api is we would end up trying
to implement that on a macintosh where
it's strictly role based so we get into
trouble so that's you know how we got
around that problem okay I think I
mentioned that quickly in the beginning
so the tax property that's you commonly
use with an image view or another
control that does not have text by
itself but it can be used it can be set
in any control and in an RDP I this guy
when is set we're going to read that so
it's going to override the tax that you
see in the table cell or in or in a
button for that matter or a label so it
has the highest priority if you play HML
it has the alt text the thing has a
lower priority or when you have a
labeled by it has a lock which tax is
going to get first this guy gets it in
first and they help that's usually when
you ask the screen reader to give that
depends or more complete information
about a node that's
where we gonna go to look for that
description that actually help usually
if you set it to tip and do nothing else
we are gonna go and get the tax and to
tip and use that as the help like a long
advance description of the denote that
we have that on the examples rounded em
at the end of the talk lay before that
was quite important usually nice lighter
when you have a slider in a UI it is
preceded by a label or by someone else
that has the tags that is telling you
what is that slider controlling and
that's a very common solution and in
that's something that the application
has to get it right we will not gonna
guess it for you in job effects I think
we did that in SWT and as abilities that
there's a slider and there's no text we
look around for someone if a text and
the preceding guy if it happens to be a
label we make a free connection error
and we give that label enjoy effects
there is no such a thing we don't get it
for free so if you have a or your your
slider you gotta set the label by yeah
so the screen reader has a way to
describe what that slider is up to
it's also common when you have normal
form if the label followed by a text
input right so we have name in text
input last name text input so you want
to make those connections in your code
when you are using to have effects his
is also good for another reason the
label pie has been Java fax from the
very beginning I believe and I was used
on Windows to activate mnemonic so it's
something that you should already been
doing to make to increase usability of
your product and now it's also important
for your screen reader so so here I have
a little piece of code that will work as
a as an explained so it when here is
live so when the second text input take
for take focus is going to read the
label it's got this editable text that
is the row description that we are going
for free because we said the this tax is
a tax roll and nose is edible because
not because there's a property for that
and then the value that is inside of the
text basically the same here just
instead of using a tax I'm using a
slider and the screen reader knows how
to make those connections so as long as
they are saying you're gonna get a very
good response from your screen reader
okay so that those are the easy P is
just five properties that you should get
most most of your problems what I'm
gonna go in here is really if you are
really building a custom control out of
not based on anything else and so this
time the we're gonna allow for the
screen reader okay yeah let's you go to
the next one so you can look at these
three methods as interface but it's not
really what it is in the code but as I
said everything comes down from node and
those methods are implemented node so
what you have to do you need to override
the appropriate one or maybe all three
and I'm sorry except the last one yeah
you're gonna wanna rewrite override the
first in this second the pen watch what
you are doing in a have examples for
that
sorry case but one way to think about it
is this is too low one way to think
about it is you know the screen reader
is calling in to you asking for a value
or you're calling out to the screen
reader to tell it that something has
happened and the ones that you override
are the ones where the screen reader is
calling in to you and the one that you
don't override is the API where you're
calling out right so moving forward
that's what we're gonna see here oh and
we have announced we have three gnomes
that are where the API maybe get large
like if you think that you solve all the
horse s ability with three methods is
because you have an arms behind and they
have a lot of entries in it and
no but maybe I mean your 30 may more so
yeah you have your choice of a million
not a million a ton of methods that are
custom named and everything or you have
your choice of a generic API with the
numbs to tell you what's going on so we
chose the generic sort of a pack not
generic in the term of Java effects
generics but okay so that's the first
one that Steve was mentioning the when
the screen reader needs some information
can be the bombs can be the number of
items in the list the tags on a button
it was gonna call using the query
accessible attribute and the attribute
is going to be accessible attribute is
there now and that analysis up has all
the possible questions that the screen
reader can ask your note in this little
piece of code is the row count so
probably doing a list view here or maybe
a table and want to know how many rows
are in there and it's very important
that at the end you call super that's
because a note is this release is
actually not complete that's you get a
lot of things for free that's already
implemented for you like the start of
the state of being folks are disabled to
look the bounds the parent in I actually
had to make it short to fit in the slide
but a lot of the work you don't need to
worry about it and just really about the
details of that control that they're
doing and is usually about three or four
attributes and in it wet so you remember
I mentioned that we use the inheritance
hierarchy of node as part of our
implementation rather than having some
other hierarchy of accessible button
accessible that's accessible that so
this is this example of inheriting from
the route the behavior that you want so
now we have the author interaction is
when you need to win the know needs to
initiate the communication of the screen
reader to touch screen reader that
something is changed in the UI so the
examples I have in here is what you can
verted it and read it you inverted the
actions when the screen reader calls in
to you and says the thing fired there's
something asked I'm sorry yes this is
this is when the screen reader
is as sterling let's say a 3-cell to
expand or another or to activate the
button for example so this is the case
this is diplomat this actually real code
that you can see in button base that
gets all our buttons and hyperlinks in
java facts so there's the action called
fire and just need to tell that that
button to execute its action that's what
fire is the public method button I just
have to call it and now is what I was
talking about before is when you need to
notify the screenreader that the state
of your UI is changed the most common
part is focus node so the focus your
hitting tab or you are clicking around
it needs nowhere to go to read that said
is that these these parts all right
taking care for you you most likely
don't need to do anything about that but
value as you are in a nice pin or nice
slider you might have to tell the user
that the guys moving the slider or the
treatment cell has been expanded in so
you're gonna call it notifier accessible
attribute if the appropriate accessible
attribute so remember we were talking
about the advanced api and these are the
this is the the api that the controls
are using to implement accessibility on
your behalf so you'll be interested in
these this these calls if you yourself
are implementing a custom control if you
do nothing you get for free you know
yeah if you're just using you have
effects that expect you to to get
everything or vast majority of your
problems solved with those four or five
properties yeah that i talked at
beginning this is for people that
implementing custom controls yeah and
here's the next example of i took this
code that's real code again and i took
from this brand-new spinner that just
went in each of it you forty and that's
when the value of the spinner is
changing so we use properties for
everything and so we'll just use an
invalidate of the property to tell the
screen reader that there's a new value
for there
sometimes the screen reader might not
actually use that but the video part and
you notify the screen reader in this
case it gets gets picked up and there's
some decisions that you might want to do
based if the screen reader is running or
not for example like if you have a chart
maybe a chart is not your best option if
the screen reader is is running that
said it doesn't work when you gonna have
a chart in your app if our charts are
access when you're effects you can
actually read the entire chart by
tabbing around all the labels and you're
going to read all pretty much all
information that you would have in your
all the way but you might want to not
use the chart maybe maybe a table makes
it more natural to read that type of
data using a screen reader or you just
want to make the the more knows with
reversible when the screen reader is
running and we are going to show that in
the demo okay so I think we are gonna
start the Emma now right pretty soon so
wait that's so that's just how to use
this property is up in a platform so it
has you can bind to it we design it as a
page yellow property okay so things he
wants to make sure doesn't matter for
whatever okay so this is a short
checklist to make your code accessible
use the standard controls and you'll be
there the standard controls are highly
configurable so you can generally get
them to do what you want I'm talking
about specifically the screen reader use
I can't have a high contrast version for
your custom CSS so if you add custom CSS
have a high contrast version of that
available you need text equivalents for
non-text elements so Philippe was
mentioning if you have an image view
it's just a picture of something add use
the accessible text property to give a
short meaningful description of it
another thing that people tend to miss
is
you'll use an animation like you have
something shake like this to indicate an
error watch for those because somebody
using a screen reader is not going to
see that happen or may not notice it
happen
label for which you should be using
anyway make sure to connect up combos
and text fields and I guess sliders and
and the normal things that get connected
in a business application and make sure
that important nodes are traversable so
that's all search first traversable with
the keyboard so we're gonna make a
bouncing ball be accessible so in our
world there's a bouncing ball demo it's
been in JavaFX forever it's a circle
that draws a radial Creighton radial
gradient and by default it's just a node
so if it's just a node it means the
screen reader ignores it and so we need
to tell the screen reader that the ball
is something interesting and we want to
speak at state and so that the example
code for the bouncing ball that's the
link for where it is and the app looks
something like this when we go to write
this part the front assemble yeah if you
ever run ensemble which is our showcase
of some of the features in G of FX the
bouncy ball is somewhere in there isn't
it okay at least that once upon a time
I'm sure it was a still there yeah okay
Kevin shaking his head so sorry let's
see let's make sure nothing works
oh thank you what is that that's Steve
will I run a close button oh that voice
yeah okay so here's our fancy clubs menu
13 items closing menu table row 37 of 67
Java
window reset button okay so now I'm
going to tab around and so there's our
bouncing balls we're currently on a
button to click on this button press
control option in space yeah so there's
our
working bouncing ball voiceover off so
that's a great demo of nothing working
so these are the simple properties that
Philippe described to begin with and
we'll set all of them so we're gonna you
know when you're looking for to make a
node accessible our circle accessible
look for a role that closely matches
what the intent of that contro right so
in that case we saw that ball like a
thing that you can click Oh like a know
that you can activate for that matter it
has some tax I want something to be
announced when it's focused and I wanted
to respond to an action so a button was
a perfect match in this case so we set
those four properties and let's try
again so we don't want this one we
probably want embedding patch one is the
one one patch one so I guess I should
turn on voiceover on Java window reset
button has keyboard focus you still
cannot tap but you can use the commands
of the screen reader in the on the pot
to move over click this button press
control option in space are gonna try I
have not used we faced more keyboard
first rounds involved so I'm not using
the regular traversal mechanism in Java
fax you need to click this button press
control option space the help that is
this is bouncing ball use primary action
to start animation you know I work for
six months of that going I had dreams
then narrator below anyway so I'm using
a shortcut that's provided by voice over
to inspect the the UI I could have used
and other facilities like make voiceover
follow the mouse instead of the keyboard
and that would have got me the same
second bouncing but I forgot that
shortcuts third bouncing ball so so
basically you actually got quite a bit
you know where you are you know that the
element workaround
chuckles button press control option
space the help tab is this it that's a
good example of getting the free
Traverse if you ever work there is one
key that made it stop talking
remember that one thing control in that
same on Windows that's why I'm showing
here on the Mac oh you you had the test
right okay as the first shortcut you
learn the part of this demo is gonna
work exactly the same on Windows the
only thing that's gonna change are the
shortcuts that you're accusing but the
functionality is gonna be exactly the
same so yeah now I can go everywhere
here yeah fullscreen game zoom button
I'm gonna close button yeah so the next
batch is just which closes the current
window voiceover all how do you got it
sorry you have to hit option whatever I
got it function as a matter of fact you
could actually stop here you know just
said the properties in your attic gave
your love of coverage here that got you
there but there's something missing that
I would like to have I would like to be
able to activate the ball make the ball
bounce if you like I can use the mouse
so I can actually click in the ball
using notepad and they will do something
not very interesting in this case but I
want to be able to do that code the
slides so go back to the magic right
yeah so there we go the free native
traversal we've seen this there we go
we've seen this already talked about
next one right so we want our ball to be
traversal by that traversed by the tab
key not the free native traversal right
I don't want to have to use control
option arrow to go around so I'm gonna
add one single line to the constructor
updated the ball three so three to the
right or free to the left the other way
okay so all the patches if you are to
actually make the special available to
you they are very small the first one
was four lines of code
this one is one line of code
so it is in my list is it true so this
is about not nice the Netherlands window
window I'm just hitting that reset
button right and everything else is
pretty much the same first bouncing ball
voiceover off now I'm gonna go to the
last step that's gonna provide all the
features of this very small app
available to the screenreader okay s you
don't know how to do it so I want to
allow the screen reader to tell that
ball to start bouncing and at this time
I'm gonna have to subclass that note
which most like I'm already subclass in
anyway so all I had to do was that is
one method and when the screen reader
says fire I call the function that it
starts that animation that make against
the ball to bounce up and down so this
is an example of the screen reader I
have to be important to do this special
the screen reader on I go the wrong way
this the screen reader the screen reader
the screen reader calling in to you
right and what are we what are we on
three or last one is it three yes okay
voiceover on Java window reset button
has keyboard focus first bouncing ball
yeah it's option something right so
instead of you are currently example
does not have press control actually the
helped ad is this is bouncing no
actually we did forget to say that we
did provide the help description if you
look at the bar of this balloon there's
a help tag so in this one we said the
road to be a button we said the road
description same balloon balloon ball I
would say button right but here seconds
bouncing ball so that string ball is
your row description
you haven't haven't you said that you
would get you are currently on the
bouncing ball to click you would get
because that's the road description that
Mac OS provides for the row the help
there was also set and is this a
bouncing ball use the primary action to
activate it if I can remember the
shortcut enter search text no I can't
enter search text previous search fine
menu 81 items well there is a one
shortcut that's gonna get you the help
the bouncing ball to click this button
press control object space control
option space is gonna be the primary
action so are gonna get a notification
from at the glass slab or the better
lower level say that screen reader
called the action activate primary
action and that goes all the way up to
the button press second bouncing ball
and then that last code is gonna run and
gonna start animation for us press
second bouncing ball fourth bouncing
ball and did we miss anything so we so
we go to all the properties there you
are current llama dancing all to click
this button which got the majority of
the work done you go to another line to
make it easy traverse around and you got
to implement one method to connect the
action you start to do nothing right so
the first one actually got there in the
rest just polishing around the corners
make you nice the Anwar fusion Windows 7
window suspend button walk space with
VMware fusion containing window windows
7 full screen space Java window fourth
bouncing ball space with applications
Java Eclipse oh come on come on function
you are currently on voiceover off thank
you it's actually not about using I sky
and there is so that's the final code
and that's stress that it all runs and
works on Windows just the sequence is
different summary okay well which a
accessibility guy is appropriate and I
mean I'm saying you know it's
fundamental and advanced it's our
distinction in the API there's no real
separation but it's it's a good way to
actually the first one is implementing
on top of the other right the properties
are using the advanced if you want to
call it that way right
yeah so 99.9% of time stick to the three
four properties and and you're good you
know did more advanced API use for
custom controls you may need to use the
action and if you build your application
out of standard FX controls they will
all be accessible and label 4 will
connect it all together for you
right goes to say that if you are trying
to do it like a tree view it will not be
that simple right we kept simple to kept
between a time that we had that said you
can always come to the mailing list or
look at implementation because all open
source the code is there but if that's
not enough just you know we are here to
help you I mean as I mentioned some
platforms I think Mac expected your
notes to be in a certain place and
things to answer a certain way right and
if you didn't follow that's not the
documented on there we learn a lot along
the way so I mean we can help yeah so
summary accessibility is here we're
using the native mechanisms no extra
libraries are required filter controls
are all implemented and the API is
minimal and complete and so built-in and
also charts I'm sure we mention that are
accessible as well and that's all are
there any questions
so that would be something that Apple
would do there wouldn't be like it we
would just be on the receiving end of it
and we would be voice activated by Siri
or whatever and that would translate
into going moving that accessibility
focused around next tab next next
control or something right in the case
of the bouncy ball I use a shortcut but
could have been an application that you
would take that is a voice command and
call through the same acronyms
with the same final result but that does
still put it with yeah we are declined
would it be the server on the other side
that would implement such functionality
no we made the rose to match our own
names so that in the name of the row is
the name of the control in our API it
maps to something over there yeah yeah
yeah yeah but the name you seen our API
met out on at night it gets mapped to
whatever maker wins decided to call it
put a breakpoint inside of get roll and
watch the stack and you're gonna take
some time and see from windows and from
Mac the call in that what it's asking
there's a big switch statement somewhere
that does this translation yeah they are
oh yeah right now so what's part of the
work and actually the part that took the
most time no no no no controls FX is the
external project yeah you have the right
guy in the room
because we don't want to base model
maybe 40 so once a t14 ones that
baseline defensive for reasonable thing
from otherwise we're going to require
everyone that runs control techniques
will be running at you forty which is a
little bit ridiculous to convey
hey I need a branch for that that before
could be interesting having a brain
should make sense in a place where
you're allowed to create branches yeah
not the moment but the ATK API is also
rule-based remember I mentioned the you
didn't want to have any an API that
couldn't be implemented we didn't want
to offer traits ATK's also rule-based
and that's the underlying Linux thing so
it's a there's a match there for a Linux
implementation anybody else all right
well thanks a lot folks god did you came
by it was a nice little group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
