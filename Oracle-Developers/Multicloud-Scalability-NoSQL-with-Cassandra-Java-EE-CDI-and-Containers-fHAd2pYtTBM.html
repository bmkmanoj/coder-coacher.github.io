you know if we started off of the event
already oh come on who wants more one
more week of Java wine yeah cool all
right at least at least I don't have to
work or I just have fun okay so i gotta
ask this who wasn't a keynote this
morning you know who love at the keynote
this morning and not much okay all right
that's fine ok we blew it ok daddy was
to have fun there who had fun at least
ok good all right let's this better okay
all right so we're gonna be here talking
about a little bit about no sequel with
Cassandra and java ee CDI and containers
etc and you know I think that's we the
whole like the whole idea here is show a
little little things that some of the
big companies are doing and and how you
can also do in your project and to talk
about this I have the pleasure having
here for me the guy you know otago
Santana you know Tahoe is a java
champion he is the guy that you know
he's a commuter at the Cassandra project
so you know he's been working if we have
no sequel for a long time and he's an
openjdk commuter and he he won last year
I think was the outstanding member of
the year for the JCP award so if you
guys what Travis on time put your hands
together for him you need talking about
I have a pleasure to to save the
Brazilian Java me the guy who used
flight Bruno Souza is JCP achieve a
member so he has the community make
standard to java to move forwards we did
a trip in Europe and South America and
Brazil a lot a lot of different counters
took more body Authority CPQ he drives a
community for a long time that is so
Java a lot of community are
the words now is a java me but now it's
becoming a cloud man so if you guys
Bruno so Zack thank you thank you very
much so I was just trying to connect
this thing to the power so it doesn't
turn off hopefully it doesn't turn off
okay all right okay so um you know
that's how treaters over there she wants
to and and then you know let's let's
start thinking I'm talking about this
those big guys here right now Salesforce
facebook netflix who hears working on on
a system that the scale of those guys
here okay no one alright that's fine
that's normal because the scale of those
guys is amazingly huge right you know we
usually that's that's not what the
things that we do the things that
they're this big and but you know one of
the things you know those those guys are
using a lot of job a lot of a lot of
open source and one of the things that
those guys are doing in common is that
you know they are using no sequel and
actually then so there is no sequel and
they're using some of the things we're
going to talk here about today and the
interesting thing is that the same tools
that those guys are using to create this
huge scale that they have you know to
create all this huge infrastructure very
very scalable very reliable you know
those of those tools are open source
tools all right and they work very well
in small project also so doesn't matter
the size of the project there you have
you know you can actually use the same
to that those guys are you so we're
going to talk up a little bit about this
year yeah right so a little bit really
quick little bit about no sequel okay
are teeny I can help you run go ahead
basically both companies are using OC
Clara base I just want commercialwho no
words no sequel is a few people's yeah
so I the summer to you guys basically no
Seco as SQL database is a database so
you can put formation there you can
retry information they're just the
strategy different
because SQL database you're looking for
more strategy to save a memory to save
space in the disk basically the SQL
database was bored at 74 years ago so
the the size and the disk is one thing
really important this space is one thing
that matter that's why the SQL database
looking for normalization stuff so
basically try to don't repeat the get
the information to duplicate information
so but right now they probably won't try
to do a lot of relationships york where
it becomes loi so right now the problem
is no more the memory because they have
a lot of memory the memory is so free so
cheaper basically lik looking for more
scalability and more performances so
right now you are usable seeker because
you're looking for more quickly answered
so you are doing using a relationship
you are looking more for bass basically
it's a ventral percent one and you have
five types to media stories for but
normally when you read some recent books
these yearbooks you talk more about this
last one so the first one is key value
basically is a structure look like a map
java map one basically give them kill
you have a value so it's looked like the
dictionary structure if you have a lot
of vendors that i use this guy here so
each value the one problem is if it will
actually try information for different
field you can normally you cannot the
night sample is the dns so you put
google.com and they will drive the IP
okay do a relationship between SQL
database and keep very database we have
a table to bucket you have a room 22
value part so basically is dad's so so
simple and that is it the next one yeah
so some q le pars you don't have like
anything like columns relationships yeah
the next one is a document there are
large type of document words basically
is a look like XM of XML 5 file or JSON
file basically I can't drive are
learning formation from these fields for
example here I have huge life first name
last name I have document inside
documents that you Colleen sub documents
I believe the most famous one is a
MongoDB the Lord tutorial Lord includes
a Java driver to run mommy to be Oh
Bruno thanks it's like okay I can go
ahead basically the different into the
do a compartir between seco and no sicko
document basically have a table to
collection one you have edge connects
here's a document to room and basically
we create our own a run time just so
basically its type you create your home
document is we can naturally so you can
eat your necks right ok so I have a
table to collection room air column
basically the column is a k value per
basic is a topo basically you have a
navy in his effective value so in
document structure there isn't
relationship just a link let's try to
emulate something like that okay the
third third type of no sequel database
yeah actually it's my favorite one you
know Cassandra is a column family I will
it the most and also oh I hope so is
Cassandra for Bochy so basically there
is one murata
fields that's the key we also have the
top o basically we have a name he's
respective value so for example here we
have some through some keys you have a
polo Aphrodite's RS and Kratos everyone
has different information it is not
dueling like SQL because it creates
follows or real time so can go go next
please do the analogy between SQL NoSQL
column we have table 2 column family who
have a row to call each each column a
column you have key value pair so that
the top o if there is no relationship
basically the dhamaka quay to try
formation is from the room key there is
some database that support you can enact
some field but it becomes slowly okay
it's not recommended one alright so the
fourth type of logical database yeah i
will leave the last one basic is a graph
the most stable ones is an elf oj
basically you store the relationship
between the nodes basically here you
have two brothers air is Apollo errors
and that's to relationship between these
guys and you have the guy who killed him
so that's great oohs yeah but it's my
favorite game that is it so yes so
basically whole idea is that your you're
saving this relationship between each
one of those objects yeah right it's a
relief column if some structural i click
eg when they suggest some person that
you have some something in common so
normally they are using graph database
the seven ology between these guys you
have a table you have h ro vertex column
we have the prophets and the rest of
ships is
the edge okay right on the last one yeah
I don't believe that is a kind of
database because basically the database
who supports more than two types it's a
mooch model for example or ntb hand
support you column and graph so it's a
much bolder water cassandra is really
famous with Colin database now they have
strategy of sports graph word so much
model basically the mood model is
everyone who has part two more than two
kind of database okay that's why I don't
believe the five type just for right so
basically you know so we get back just
to the to those three guys here and what
are the things that those guys are using
right from from all those you know we
are getting our specific stuff no sequel
database of no secret technology here so
those two guys are using a last search
and Cassandra I mean this is 33 because
it is less certain Cassandra to do a lot
of things things they're doing so
basically of you know from all of those
those start from databases they're using
those two and both last search and
Cassandra are open source and so they
can be used it for doesn't matter how
big your project is or how much law your
project is you can actually use both of
those both of those databases to
implement you are whatever you are
you're trying to do in your system so
that allows you to get scalability and
performance in and create our relations
their needs and if you ever reach the
scale of those guys you're covered right
because they those technologies reach
that no problem yeah ok now for for the
thing that we going to show here and in
the demo that's going to show you know
Travis computer a minute we are also
adding CDI right the reason why are
adding CGI is just should be like the
glue that's going to just going to
connect your everything here right so
base what we're going to do here is that
we're going to get I know you have we
have a CDI and so we going to you
no from CD are going to access the last
search database to do indexing right and
are we going to use the casino database
you store the information right so we
are actually using you know chu
difference no secret databases right to
do what they do best right and so we're
going to do this two things here yeah
yeah basically I hope you all remember
the column database weary fast away you
try from the key value Q value so
basically the best idea is its charge
everything Cassandra to become right
faster read faster and we try all
information for a large search you can
do your last search as a search engine
to everything that you want basically
some freak like resume something like
the leakage indeed search for me to keep
learners letters and freak like that so
basically you can pool our information
Cassandra use the alleged search with
Travis information yes so basically
we're doing here that's why our target
doesn't like to date that you have like
the fifth type of of no secret database
right because actually what we're doing
here is that we're having kind of a
multimode database because you're using
two different no secret database to do
what they do best right and using
combination because you know Cassandra
it's really fast to read but it's not
very good to search right so we are
putting out the data and Cassandra that
so we can can receive it very very fast
but instead of using customer that's not
good for search for in search we're not
going to do search there we're just
going to use the last search to do all
the indexing in the into the storage in
last search and retrieve information
from Kazan yeah that's that's the
basically the idea I would try some
formation for live search a large search
returns Mike you Mike you and Mikey and
then I can retire information in
Cassandra right okay now of course to
make the demo completely we are going to
do this a rest interface right to make
it easier to access and of course once
you put the rest interface then it can
easily access all these from from your
mobile application from
web application whatever you want you
can use the front ends to access this
right so we're going to have a little
rest interface then we can do this and
we're going to use Jersey running here
right and so we know judge is going to
access this we're going to have George
exs things CDI now oh you know this
truth just two guys here Jersey and CDI
deer running tomcat right actually John
Tommy Tommy an e right so again are we
gonna have those two guys running there
you know this jerseys Java Tomcats Java
CD is Java last searches Java Cassandra
job right so it's out it's a fool java
sweet that you can use you know to
everything that you know to actually
track to scale are two very very large
loads yeah that's okay yeah talk a
little about the code yeah sure so I
think shows to you in this slide yeah
just just do a quick overview yeah let's
go has okay so basic yeah so basically
what we're gonna do is I'm just kind of
a quick overview here we're going to
start on the first troop things in the
top this is basically on CDI and then
you know we're going to do indexing on a
last search and storing on Cassandra to
get the information right yeah so let's
see the steps basically everything
starts in the rest api so basically we
have the recipe interface to put
information there and they retry
information so basically we are using
standards to make it either so basically
here i have the developer dto that's a
data transfer object it's a Saudi name
I'll oh just but trust me just to a
simple basically our time formation get
an information for the API for the rest
api and then pornstars ok ok of course
i'm using the CDI to grow everything
because i'm using two different database
i'm using rest api you need one thing to
put everything work well together that's
why I'm inject
guy here and then automatically they
figure out out and yet to me which is a
kind of Jedi merged power right all
right yeah okay so now we're now in the
Cassandra side yeah it's a looking
basically we say we fire to events and
even there are two listeners basically
want to the customer side and another
one to Alex earth south side basically
we have the context of Cassandra here
basically I have I get long session from
Cassandra to prove to see I produce
these three context and I have the guide
to close this session of everything is
done so basically I have the contest
something like transaction does but
using CDI alright so i have this guy
produce EDI producing and i just put
injector notation then cgi helps you put
this guy magically out in automatically
so so basically i get this object here
I'm sober these events so i get the
object and then as a cute they start the
information there ok so now on the
Gillette search side yeah there's some
idea we have the context the creation of
the decline to like search and then i
have this guide to dispose it is quiet
basically it's going to close this
session of where everything is done
basically here ok you see it's an
application scope it so it start of what
application started it's tiring
applications died so that's the context
so basically it's going to inject the
client site just use the ejector
notation so yeah it's an ugly oval code
because there's no Stern that you know
secret yet but i need to get all the
object information and convert you a
barcode a bites and then storage
informational our search
now so now you're back you know we've
already stored information and and yeah
and exit everything is done right now
there too with Travis information there
basically we have this guy here to get
my report acoust avella / so think like
that I'd like to know the ever average
the De Quincey this guy are receive its
money so I can do something like that
it's is a notation here is basically the
rest jax-rs a notation basically I have
a path and I get when this guy get a cat
manner merit in this path you where the
jax-rs call this metal automatically so
yes that's that's that's our little API
here for the demo right yeah so
basically um I'm doing some match in the
last search and it is a cutie screw
query okay and that is it so basically
when everything started in the Jackson
here's in the rest api when a put
information I fire what event and this
event has two observers what is castle
database in other words a large search
database so these guys has a context by
CDI when I put a single rotation by CDI
this guy managing other search to me so
when a potential started he creates the
session both Cassandra a large search
and then when applications die and CDI
disposed these dis clients so that is it
ok so now the other part of this is that
of course we have the whole ideas that
we want to do is that we want to scale
this to as many machines we need of
course you know the whole one of the
biggest advantage of reusing nosek
databases is is that we can easily add
nodes such a process
information right so the idea is that we
want to see be able to scale this as
much as we can or as much as we need
actually right and so for that of course
all of these things here they are
running on separates let's say separate
machines right so you know you have a
Tommy running the glue here but you know
the last search runs and so on its own
part because sir no runs runs in some
part and so one of the things that we
that we got to do here to make this easy
to scale is that we're going to turn
this into docker containers right so so
we're going to run well actually we're
going to run containers for each one of
those those guys here all right so
basically the idea about containers is
that we can encapsulate inside a
container everything your application
means right so we can put inside our
container that's out that's our web
server here we can put our application
everything their application needs you
know our war or ER code for example
those who stands on the container so we
can easily replicate their content to
access to receive more requests one
thing that we're not showing here but in
front of Jersey here we're probably
going to have like a load balancer to
receive just to distribute requests
among our multiple jerseys are
containers right so we're going to run
all of these in a container but also are
we going to run the last search and
Cassandra in their own separate
containers that way if we need to
increase you know if getting more
requests we haven't either to retrieve
more information or to index more
information we can start more containers
so we can scale easily by just starting
more containers and then since
everything then we were doing here it's
just about a basic you know based on the
annotation so we can easily access this
multiple containers every time we start
a new continue right so so basically
with that oh you know just interesting
thing the doctor allows us to do is that
both the last search and Cassandra
already have a premade container
on docker hub right so if you want to
start by doing this you don't need to
choose to package or install or prepare
anything you just need to do a one
command dr. run and pass the name of the
of the Cassandra or the last search
container and you get it you get a
complete docker container for everything
running right and you connect those two
jersey oh no Tommy container and then
you know immediately you have a full
environment like with everything you
need with all your architecture prepared
to just run right he's not having to do
a lot of code around a lot of
infrastructure work right and then the
important thing about doing content so
so basically when you talk to talk about
containers the important thing about
containers dad's once you package your
application status after container in
the ins application is very portable
right so so you can easily move that's
that container with everything
application needs from one place to the
next so we can run for example our
containers inside or Chavez laptop for
example and if we need to and also for
development we can run the same
containers for our test and QA
environment so you know your Jenkins
server CI server for example you can't
start those containers just to run all
the tests and then the same containers
can run your production environment
right so you can separate in different
machines or you can run in a single
machine if your environments and small
environments and if you if you want to
really scale this you might decide to do
to run this on the cloud right so you
know we have here just as an example
since we're we are on Java one right you
could run on oracle clubs for example
but of course any cloud providers to
park supports doctor today so you can
actually just run the same containers
that you have that you're running here
chavez laptop you can run on an Oracle
cloud or Amazon or Google or there or
jelastic that's another container on
cloud provider and so you can easily get
all of these infrastructure and put your
run on on multiple environments okay
there's a
sorry well yeah it depends on how you
want to do well or not in our demo we're
not storing sessions anywhere right
what's you know just using this Tomcat
session but yes you could store the
session data on on on your note not no
sequel database for careful so if you
want to track the user's fashion
everything you can hear you can use no
sequel database to store the session
that's actually a very good thing to do
I i personally prefer to use a key value
to start the session for a show you put
the key is a nickname for the user
tofique like PR kavvum an otaku java and
the value is all the user information
are normally do do something like that
and my favorite one is a has a class
because so quickly it's so nice to
understand because everything there try
to use the Java API documentation think
that the java developer already know so
it's more easier sure if you like to
know more about how the cost just
download the code take the product in
the loading run it's so nice if you do
something for more if Q value then I'll
column database yeah so sub so this
basically for a key value database so
that that you see you can add another
database you're not even doing here is
the key validator base and your
infrastructure you know has even one
more like so that is really a multi-mode
demo here right there's no question the
back
ok so the his question is the actual
data where is the actual data stored
inside or outside the container right so
basically that's a that's a that's a
very good point because containers we
usually like to say the containers are
stateless there are state full container
right so one of the things that we we
here we use a a container technology
from jelastic Jaleski has a state full
container so you actually could store
the data inside containers if you wanted
to write but usually what you do is that
you consider the container as a
stateless environment that means you can
kill destroy container in your starter
containers and as you know any time you
don't worry about what's inside right
and in this case it's always better to
restore the data outside of the content
right so basically what you do is that
you know you mount an external volume it
could be a volume in your operation
system or it could be a volume on the
network for example we do a lot of
things with NFS right so you want any
excess volume if you want to share among
among different our servers or you know
you can set you can you can do things
like that but one of the interesting
thing about about the no secret database
that they do work with distributed data
right so they came they can save their
in multiple machines and and how you
know so basically you can actually have
the data the data itself is going to be
outside the container but it's going to
be accessed through the Trudy no
cigarette ways yeah another thing
composite is imagine right now I'd like
you Oprah great the Cassandra version
right basic cognitive strategies image
and then put a new US version of
Cassandra and the data still there so
basically when you put alpha males
outside he has some benefits like this
yes oh gnome normal the best practice is
to put information outside of outside of
the container so you can you know can
easily like like a Java sign up for
greater container or destroy the
container thing like that okay all right
okay to me I've developed a zone problem
when you are using docker because I
cannot say it's worth just running my
machine anymore just walking I'm a
senior
yeah all right yeah as you know this so
the whole problem that we have the
developer saying oh yes it's running my
machine doesn't run yours yes so so
basically the main idea of containers
right is that there they are very
portable right so when when you're
talking about you know we all know the
real containers right now the big the
big metal boxes right and the good thing
about about having in the containers on
the reward is how easy it is for you to
move you know from from a truck into the
ship from the ship into storage you know
or for customers and then and now in
dinner a train so the whole idea of
containers is the easy of use I mean if
ease of move things around because the
container contains everything
application needs so you don't have to
reinstall you don't have to you know it
was running in this environment we
change the environment things not
running anymore so you know and then we
are taking advantage of containers to
the exactly that to allow us to develop
for on your laptop on on your server
whatever provider you want you want to
use to to to hold your application right
and one interesting things that a lot of
times you're going to be running for
example something cider company and then
you need to move to your provider for
example maybe you know of course you're
talking about scale right so maybe some
time you're going to have to you know
near Christmas for example you need more
scale so you might run some of the stuff
outside the public cloud for a while or
the other way around right so you know
some of those when those companies get
really really really large not sure if
you guys follow for example now drop box
when they you know they become so large
that it was actually more expensive to
run a public cloud than didn't you
create their own data center so they
moved everything internally again right
so you know containers allow you to do
this kind of things you know you can you
can decide where are you going to run
your infrastructure because everything
you need your packet inside containers
yeah all right now at a view you know
Oracle's Java chip right i mean i'm part
of that isn't
somehow I hope so ok so now before we go
to go to 20 * damelin now one
interesting thing is that you know
everything is Java here that's a nice
part now 11 interesting things are
discussing here is that not only
everything is Java but also you're not
tidying so you're not tied in 20 to 22
any any specific infrastructure because
everything is Java that's good now not
only that but you know Tommy Tommy
implements java ee that's a standard
specification we're not tied to to tow
me out either Oh Jersey it's you know
implements another specification
sophistication that for that's our
guitarist but you know what's the number
you good new numbers what are we 49 and
if you must version believe it three
wait one but also by the numbers you
know it's another specification right so
you're not tied to Jersey either to
implement this you can you can run in or
never provide any one CD is also i spec
right so you're not tied to any any
specific vendors today either three six
and nine 369 yeah yes that's that's what
a view is is is it's like a JCP
outstanding member of the year right
because he knows everything of the JCP
now when you get you chica syringe in
the last search atop what happened yeah
actually i know i might charge of those
guys yeah actually have a huge problem
here who know what's who try to use java
ee + no secret at a base just you guys
maybe you know that the huge problem
here there's a nice solution but not one
CD i right there's our nice solution but
we call me spring data so yeah it's sad
to say but basically there is a nice
solution but you cannot run in the java
ee words so basically right now you are
story to create specification to know
sequel database so basically you try to
involve a lot of no psycho vendors
looking for concepts about it
of course need to try to standardize
everything but he to look for a
specialization because for example even
we are using column to column database
there is a special behavioral in
different kind of database for example
in cassandra has consistent level
constant level it bitch has a lot of a
lot of stuff so there's something
happened we are using has a case one to
keep value well you have to try to use
code base so even be the same type of
column of the non-secure base it has
different behavior that will rely to use
basically touched on the rider think but
don't forget the diversity and no see
Clara base right so basically how the
good idea there's discussing right now
with lots of different vendors and lots
of lots of players in to JCP and you
know we are working on this and should
be ready to be officially submitted to
GC pee in a cup of months we we are you
know we're going to propose a JSR to
standardize access to no Cinco database
right so then you know so then then this
whole discussion about no sequel is also
becomes also specification that you
don't need to be tied to specific vendor
specific implementation of no sick right
so that's that's you know it's coming
soon there's a lot of a lot of those
players are involved right now on the
discussion ok there's a question over
there oh that's a good question what's
happening our banana jam is they are
trying to use jpa and my question is a
jpa support no Sinclair base what
happens if you like to use time to live
and the arbonne atgm it's not happened
because the SQL database don't support
the time to leave what happens we'd like
to use process level it's not happening
either
the best answer to you is you cannot
drive a plane with the car API so if you
try to use device version try to use a
wrong wrong API to these two so that's
why we are not looking for JP I rotation
the API merits but of course try to use
the same literature naming the same name
no makin sure so basically try to you
the seminary like update Percy prestige
our safe but of course there is more
stuff on the no sequel database and
freak like time to leave asynchronous
saves that doesn't have an JP so the
basic idea you looking for I
specifically a specifically
specification because the JP don't
support no circular base visit because
it's not it was not made to no secret a
base yeah so so right now yes that's
that's a great point there are
specifications that could be adjusted
but we we do think that the reason there
is a space for for a specific
specification for no sequel there is
also you know I think we also think that
there is enough experimentation is
enough no sequel database out there
there's enough experimentation with
different API for all those databases
for that we can actually get a
specification that covers you know the
most common use cases there are a few
projects and already trying to chew not
standardized but trying to create a
common API to multiple for those those
movie database so we already have some
measure to see if that's a success that
can be and we're not alone on doing this
there in a lot of several of the vendors
from those sequel databases in the open
source project or per Patera planetary
projects some of those vendors already
agree that it is a good time for doing
the specification so we are working with
with several of those companies and
projects together a proper good proposal
put together and we are hoping that once
we do this we can we can get the
approval for the JCPS you move this
forward yeah basically the idea is to
have four different API you know
basically one API for different kind of
database one out 5 because emerging code
base that has brought you to different
different type of not secure base this
guy gonna implement to api's want to
kill Q value in other words document so
basically the IDS you to have the
diversity inside the specification
that's not yes I know but that's why I'm
trying to involve the community with
feedbacks try to vote no SQ vendors like
Cassandra MongoDB codebase orienta be
basically that it will arrive the
proposal right now there is a site that
had this information basically you try
to split in two layers the first one is
a communication error that's something
like the daily bc does basically a
communication between your application
with the no sequel database and a loud
way so you're going to use more velocity
stuffs another one going to be a high
API that's going to be something more
like the jpa is so basically right now
you are looking for communication API
because more difficult because it we
both are lured out no see Clara base to
try to do it the the hardy is on the day
no psycho dark so you can assess the
decide you can get our formation all the
story code in the github there with the
organization Jane oseco so basically you
can stood give feedbacks open pull
requests everything is open source in a
partial license so we can is fee-free
prostu these codes yeah that's another
interesting thing is that that you know
we're trying to do this in a very very
open way and it's not
like okay let's think about this once
there is a specification already know
the codes are right out there you know
you can go to d to help right now you
can go to the website right now and get
involved because there is a lot a lot of
things going on and of course once he
gets into JCP then there's how the
process of actually you know having
created specification itself but at
least we have already started a you know
a project with source code that you can
download it can test it right now you
can spare experiment and then we can
discuss together how are you going to
specify this yeah yeah basically that is
do a lot of hang out earth about it and
in January the next JCP face-to-face
meeting are going to show the results so
basically that's time to you submit your
question and give more feedbacks about
it because it is really important to us
make a better API because it's going to
be the future right so the idea is to
raise our best best api to everyone can
use so i may be honest question right
there mistaking is taking a selfie okay
sorry there's no fee but there's a
question right here right taking a
selfie but none of us right off him okay
all right thank pizza funny no yes he's
actually doing something else over there
the question was what happened if I'd
like to use specifically behavior in the
load secure database right and what's
happened is we are looking for the
standard but you're looking to the way
to use the specific implementation
because in OC cada base and one person
freak on the loop for a specific dose
syllabus AG's it specific behavior so
the idea is if I'd you lie to you
something SEC from one would it be in
this case you can use it because there
are a lot of methods to specifically to
MongoDB so basically have the concept is
the same we have the collection the
document and this the matter is going to
be different so the way to save the way
to fight something the query by the
concept is exactly the same so basically
we have this the common matters if you
have so if you'd like to do specific
things you cannot use the API but you
can use the implementation one by this
guy tracks you the servant of making
sure so yeah yeah basically some air
just that's happy with jdbc right this
is imagine right now you are using both
we ask al and there is something like
the newest version that's Portuguese 9
there is a Bernard Jason if you can use
everything and possibly of the API but
if large spaces stuff you can use this
specific implementation that exactly
what happen if SQL database yeah so
basically you know when you're talking
about any any of the job I standards you
do have specific implementations from
vendors that you can use if you want to
but basically the ideas that it'sit's
you know you're clearly you clearly know
when you're using something that is a
stand they're going to work every where
and when you're using something that is
specific to a vendor because that's then
that's you can take that decision and
you know you can you can code your
application
clearly to the standard because you want
to have the freedom to move or two other
things and yeah if you um you know
because basically usually have three
three three sarah different situations
one is you want your code oops sorry one
is you want your code to be independent
of the other specific implementation so
you're going to call completely to the
standard API right so you can do this
with any of the base you know jdbc or or
JMS whatever whatever api you're using
you can code completely chew they stand
the API and then you can move from
different different vendors without much
trouble right so that's that's one
situation the other situations that
directly opposite that you you already
know exactly what vendor you want and
you want to go you know use all the
features of that that that vendor
provides and you know you you're okay
with that she's your decision and so you
can you know you can basically use
everything from that vendor you know
because that's that's that's that's fine
too that's not that's not a problem and
then there's a middle ground that's a
lot of people are in that's you know you
you do want you have the freedom to move
but you do understand some things you're
not going to well maybe you're paying
for a first received database you want
to use that performance features are
going to help you out but you're going
to code mostly to the API and you're
going to do some few calls to use that
specificity you want but at least you
know exactly what it is so if you if you
ever decide to move or to migrate then
you know exactly what you need to change
exactly what he needs you choo-choo
access right so you know this is very
very normal or any of the Java API is
that that's not going to be any
difference here okay question
right yeah wow that's a good question
turns out no transaction yes yes that's
that's why we basically desire so the
question is oh yeah I know weird we're
here talking about you know two
different no secret databases and what
happens with Windows database goes on
right and one of the things about about
no sequence is no transactions right so
what happens basically that's why we
have more than one cluster on Cassandra
last search so normally is recommended
to when you are using Cassandra use more
than three notes but what happened for
these three notes going down you that is
gone sorry to you there's no treasure
transaction delivered of a that's why
you're looking for LACC latissimus oh
sorry city elasticity and also have more
dorm day 1 nodes yes you know that's
this this is part you know this is part
of the trade off of the architecture
right so the use cases for the nose
secret databases are different than the
use case for the sequel database that's
why you know they have they have
different constraints okay all right so
actually his question laughs with them
to chief so cone here we do you have to
mess a little bit and his question was
about exactly about the coat right so
maybe you should go right okay okay i'll
leave here our contact information so
let's let's let's dive into the code a
little bit okay you need to learn how to
walk around for flag yeah it takes some
time to learn all right just moved here
three we know that nuts on number one
that you yeah that's you right you put
me Meyer yes putting me over is there
anyone for crashing y 0 tau is preparing
his laptop here no no more questions
right so you guys are tough you know we
have we have this the Cylons moments
you're gonna let us hang right here
right come on
okay there's a question really okay good
cool well there's to crash the same time
come on
oh the question is you know what does
any reason why you're using Cassandra
store information why you're not storing
everything in last search I'll let him
answer but you know photographers
comedian Cassandra of course you gotta
reuse Cassandra in the demo right and
maybe because your user with resume for
me oh yes basically this sample is a
resume information so basically just are
looking for a large search through trav
information in the exit so you can use a
large strategy to index our information
there to get more relevance imagine
right now to let you find java
developers by specific distance so
basically the GES pitch their
responsibility so i use the last search
to index or information have strategy to
index have a strategy to put score and
our information and and customer this
with trav information if you put a lot
of stuff in a large search the right
Kirby is lower so but that's the problem
euge problem if you use this guide to
start casa de to store information and
use the last 32 index information is
going to be quickly that's why a large
huge vendor like linkage e do something
like that yes basically what you're
trying to do here is that you're trying
to get the best of each one of those
databases to use cheese or their best
for and and that's that's what that's a
thing you guys you know actually that's
why there's four different types of no
sequel database they are they're good
for different things right and so I
think that once you understand that they
are good for different things you can
you can plan your architecture for
specifically you know your use case and
what's best in this case you know we are
trying to store information quickly on
in Cassandra consider is really really
fast to get this information you know
and Alaska search is really good you did
a search so we can combine both things I
should it you get the best of the best
performance or
attack that we need and if you just have
a few we pass of course you can just use
your one elastic search database it's
the DEP enjoyed number of requests fer
more about your architecture yeah this
architecture here is used by those big
guys no netflix lincoln in facebook
they're using this because they you know
they need the performance everything ok
so there's a question where they also
ok so his question is I did you know
they've seen Cassandra together with
solar and you know if the last search is
the best right now or so why not solar
ok is my opinion right now I choose last
search because they're just serves to
relax old lectures that's a large cloud
so that i don't like to manager
everything that i always normally choose
their life surf by the difference
between these guys is salt molecules
that i use the sum and gene that's a
leucine one from patch basically the
idea is I just choose because easier to
me because I have one guy and I have a
sex just ready to I use that's how i
prefer the Elector shua the other thing
is that you know we're trying to show
here you know their comparison what some
of you guys are doing and one thing that
you guys could do that that that we know
it can reach these scales everything so
you know since these those guys are also
using last search for us it's a little
you know it's a little bit more
impactful to mention that ok good reason
so here we have this the jato Seco or I
see all right also need you over here
for us home to working so I smashed so
basically here I have same formation
side like the mayor year the day
behavior right now we have some features
basic you have to api's and want to ck
for each different kind of database
basically if you are callin database you
need to check the API implement our
information and they run his CC TC key
so basically if everything is fine yeah
your implementation like driver support
this product basically is something that
already happened JCP right basically I
can run I think it is is gone you have
approve this stuff another thing that
all
looking for just keep it I know so they
were up you r LJ no SQL or just pointed
yeah yes very small but I sure you guys
can hear ya okay you have a lot of guys
that allowed to do it happened that
Monty be code base or NT be a MDB knell
for J so that's why I looking for this
for kind of api's but currently the
graph API already has a kind of
specification that's the Apache finger
pop this guy tried to do a kind of
standards Oh graph API so that is
looking for API new verse Sophie cloud
using Java 8 lambda 3 API optional one
everything year so that's a good point
to give your opinion about it you have
the outer documentation here in a dot
okay come on chop you gotta show the gym
a little bit because we done now now
you're running out okay so basically
they advantages of using a try to use
Turner's is some freak like that so
imagine all right now you can once you
have the simple storage you can use
something like that okay I can Wow so
basically I can use a notation you try
to use the 70 tation like the JP I does
so Suffolk like entity column but of
course different package let's show to
you guys hear that Artemis Wyatt aim is
a it's a goodness quick believe it's a
goodness of moon hunter finger like this
so basically use a notation and then
easily it's gone basically they ID media
here if using standard ik mapping
everything here and there
to use a CDI guy I can include this guy
here so right now I have this central
repository that's our column called
crude operation here because cast on the
column family guy so I can do a lot of
stuff like safe asynchronously some
freak like JP I cannot too I think where
this stuff I came find information right
here I can retrieve information by the
same so ID so the basic idea is ok I can
use no secret abase easily because i
have an attention I have the outer CDI
context like events everything around
this java awards so you just have a
seconds before understanding anyone has
any more questions ok before we run
totally running out of time this this
whole thing we have finalized averages
from talk is being turning to new
article right so we're going to have you
know not only our discord is available
on Janos SQL org but also now we are
turning out and do this whole talking to
an article so it should be available in
the next few days so so you can also see
an OT n laters thanks oh I can actually
hold my microphone right now okay all
right and is it you want to eat you
return tues ok ok just yes right just
right just here yeah so just leave our
contacts there ok guys thanks very much
this thing's anyone like a last question
that you can answer I think we have like
one minute
so his question is do you recommend you
to mix no secret database with sequel
database in the same application that's
that's how that depends on your use case
right so yes there is a lot of cases
where the secret database makes sense
right you know yeah I forgot especially
if you got to keep the relationships for
example so there is a lot of situations
where the secret database makes a lot of
sense and yes it's you know no sequel is
not about okay we're not never going to
use a secret database any more nights it
it's it's about having the right tool
for the right case and if you're in your
particular I mean there's a whole lot of
cases where the secret database makes a
lot of sense and if that does you have
no reason to okay let's I'm going to
have to to to figure out ways of to
pretend you know for example de gallo
cells ask about transaction right if you
need transaction your project for any
reason a lot of people say sure you know
that but it made visible so sometimes
you do need if you need transactions
maybe it's going to be better for you to
put on a secret database right so yes
it's the best thing is use the best tool
for the job and and just kind of figure
out your actually best way for you some
feet likely I'd like to use managing
your storage in a grocery store the the
transaction transaction stuff is so
important because random guy buy some
stuff you need to decrease information
so it's just need to decrease when our
role is stone so he transactions right
now in this case it should use sequel
database in normalcy colonies okay guys
before everyone has to leave right thank
you very much thanks a lot for being a
Java one and you know hope i can see you
guys online thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
