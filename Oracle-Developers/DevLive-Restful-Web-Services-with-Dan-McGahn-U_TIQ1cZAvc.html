article dead life of your host Javed
Muhammad and I have as my guest today
Dan McGann with an article developer
advocate so that wasn't budget so you
just came in from New York
how long was the trip oh is a nice trip
but it's great to be in London uh-huh
I'm Vincent we've been to London before
once before but I didn't get a chance to
check out any of the highlights room
sort of in and out but this time I hope
to maybe tomorrow you have you had your
fish and chips yeah a bigger signal okay
guys okay don't forget to try that out
so then you're going to be presenting
today here at the Oracle code can you
give it a little preview or I guess we
can just talk about a little bit about
your presentation shortly so what you're
going to be talking about absolutely so
the talk is restful web service is the
easy way basically I want I'm gonna do
but is it easy way yeah good great
question
basically we I want to walk through how
to do this using node yes which is a
very popular platform for JavaScript
development these days I'm going to look
at different ways that it can be done
starting with sort of the most basic
build your own infrastructure kind of
approach this is actually the approach
that I prefer I like to use Express
which is a web server it's fairly
low-level and then put the rest of the
pieces in place as I see fit
some things all rest web servers are
going to have in common are you going to
have that web server and they're going
to have some kind of routing logic we're
going to have some controller logic and
then some kind of database logic I know
how these pieces get done is completely
up to you so I'll start with Express and
use their built-in routing logic for the
controller logic you can just use any
kind of vanilla JavaScript all you're
doing is taking data out and
doing whatever you need to do with that
upon your business project and then for
that database logic I like to use our
node database driver or Oracle data
excuse me for Oracle database mm-hm
and so that's that's one approach but
for some folks this may be too low level
especially if they're not very
comfortable working with Oracle database
maybe they come from
Postgres background or my sequel or even
a non relational database such as Mongo
for folks like that they may be more
comfortable working with an ORM rather
than a driver directly into our aims
object relational mapper z-- is sort of
keep a lot of that business logic in the
middle tier and then they sort of create
tables and do all the persistence for
the user and abstract away a lot of the
complexity there and of course there's
some trade-offs when you're using Oren's
and I'll talk about a few of those and
then on the complete other side we have
full fledged frameworks that promise to
sort of do everything for you you know
in school everything in the kitchen sink
these are frameworks like sales loop
back and Ord Oracle rest data services
again folks that are not too familiar
with specific databases may prefer these
but really folks that want to focus on
productivity and not have to make a lot
of decisions on their own they're going
to prefer these frameworks and so we'll
talk about sales specifically and I'll
give a demo on orange as well great so
basically depending on the comfort level
of the developer they can work at the
the most basic level all the way up to a
higher level and then I think also what
comes into play
is the particular project so for example
if I'm if you're looking at a very
specific goal you know the exact API you
need to create you have those
requirements you may prefer what you
might look at some of those higher-level
tools and you may find that they fit
your requirements exactly so that's a
good fit and you're going to choose
those higher-level frameworks of course
but you may find that your goals aren't
necessarily in line with the way that
those frameworks work and so what you
would find in that particular case is
that you're actually sort of working
against the grain over and over so so
when you choose these higher-level
framework setting your requirements have
to be somewhat flexible and and really
just built around the framework
themselves so that you're not working
against the grain so it really just
depends on the project in your goals and
of course I mean rest API is
applications of Kabir all over the
places microservices kind of like the
one definitely an area that can be
applying yeah I think a lot of people
implement micro services behind the
restful api so absolutely it's very
relevant all right then well then is
what time is your presentation in case
it leaves the folks will to come and
take a look at it
it's the last hawk before the before
that was a happy hour before happy hour
so don't forget that folks it's the
important also for happy hour now on the
one you should you and move okay so
anyways we'll check it out then thank
you so much for stopping by appreciate
right and flexible for tuning in I'm
