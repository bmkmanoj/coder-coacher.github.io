Atlanta I'm Bob brew Bart with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
another dev live interview with one of
the speakers from this event and in this
case that speaker happens to be product
Patel product thanks for stopping by
more than welcome happy to be here so
tell me about your role at trip lingo
sure I am the CTO at a small company
like trip lingo
it basically means I'm the jack of all
tech stuff so we have a very small tech
team and we do pretty much everything
between the two or three of us in terms
of the tech stack that's Ruby on Rails
Java groovy native iOS native Android
and recently some machine running with
Python so it's a quite quite a very
expansive kind of technology platforms
we have if the CTO do you do anything
that makes you nervous see meeting
customers they'll actually I'm ok with
that
but there's there's something that being
kind of the person who makes all the
decisions for the tech stack and kind of
what we present to our customers in
terms of specific features and things
it's always it's always a little bit of
interesting game because you're kind of
on the front lines in terms of trying to
figure out what the customer wants and a
lot of times telling the customers what
they need and doing the implementation
on the back as well so just kind of
finding a balance between what a small
team can do and what a customer wants
and needs is kind of like the most
difficult part of being in a small
company and decision maker and
implementer at the same time so yeah
yeah
now speaking of presentations your
presentation at Oracle code was the
modern Java JavaScript server stack so
give me the the 2 minute version of that
prism
so the the genesis of this presentation
is actually the fact that in in the
JavaScript world there's a little bit of
a negligence negligence isn't exactly
the right word but the kind of
architectural considerations around
building server-side JavaScript aren't
really addressed at conferences and you
know there's a lot of blog articles and
stuff like that but just doesn't get a
lot of mindshare in my opinion among
developers or there's a lot of stuff
talking about performance and
architecting a front-end or browser
based web application but when it comes
to kind of the server side there is some
stuff out there but typically not at
like standard kind of conferences right
obviously if you go to node con or
something there's a very big focus on
architecting and building solutions
around JavaScript on the server
obviously using node it so that the one
of the reasons I like to do this is to
show people that especially for a
company like ours or a lot of companies
where we have multiple platforms that we
run things on where does Java Script fit
into the overall kind of platform
constellation of different things right
like I mentioned earlier we run Java we
run Ruby on Rails we run JavaScript
there's all these different things that
we run but where does it actually fit in
and what are the sweet spots and what
are the reasons why you would want to
use javascript and then and how do you
architect a solution around that you
know not from kind of a 50,000 feet
point of view and not at the ground
level but somewhere in between right so
that's kind of was the idea and the
thought process behind putting together
something like this to relate some
experience in terms of how one goes
about understanding first why JavaScript
on the server is important and second
how do you actually put that into an
overall architecture that has multiple
platforms running multiple you know
operating systems and programming
languages and things like that so about
a year ago I put together a panel
discussion for a podcast that was on a
software architecture in the modern
enterprise and one of the participants
in that that panel discussion was Oracle
ace director Luisa Weir who I don't
think you know but hi Luis how you
luis made the point that javascript has
become a first-class citizen among
programming languages how would you
explain that
ascension yeah that's actually a it's
actually a really good question I
believe that is there's a about two or
three different factors that come into
play with JavaScript rise in terms of
popularity it the obvious one is that
JavaScript runs in the browser so
nowadays especially since there's not a
lot of good alternatives for running or
building front-end applications right
aside obviously from native iOS and
native Android type of apps which very
specialized or very specific platforms
but it's the web browser right everybody
has the web browser on every device that
they have and you can build front-end
applications with JavaScript for all
these different things right whether
it's desktop mobile etc etc and I think
the other thing is in some ways
javascript was on the leading edge in
the way that it's inherently architected
at a very low level right so javascript
is intrinsically in an event-driven
environment and so if we go back to the
genesis of JavaScript on the server to
2009 when node.js first came out well
it's not the very first time oh if the
listeners out there who are who have
been programming for a long time we know
that JavaScript on the server was
actually around in the late 90s manifest
as a base way to write kind of plugins
and small applications in Netscape
communication server so if you go way
way back in time right almost 20 years
down
javascript was it was available on the
server but not all people used it back
then there were other things that people
did but anyways getting back to my story
if we go to 2009 and
the the creation of note and then its
subsequent quick rise in terms of
developer mind share because javascript
is inherently in a vet based model with
the node event loop and the way that it
uses async threads to offload work it in
some ways not by design but more by
circumstance or whatever you want to
call it it was leading the way in terms
of the way that we think today about
building large-scale applications by
using event-driven type of programming
and so if n trivet programming is also
available on other platforms so for
example in the Java world you might use
something like vertex to do venture oven
programming on the java virtual machine
there examples of other things as well
you can also look at things like elixir
and whatnot but I think that's one of
the other reasons that a fact from the
ubiquity in the front end but on the
server side people notice that you could
get a huge amount of performance because
of this non-blocking event-driven
low-level programming model that's baked
right into the JavaScript languages
platform so all of a sudden you have
this thing that you know in JavaScript
you have to write async code that's just
programming language in the platform but
the benefit that you get from having
that extra mental and your kind of
complexity overhead is that you have you
have the ability to write super scale
applications on the server without
having to like go in and change stuff
it's all just built into the
architecture and the programming model
is probably the best way to put it so I
think those two things along with the
fact that and and this this third point
is a little bit debatable depending on
who you ask I think but because
javascript has a very low barrier to
getting started right you basically you
can just open up any web browser that
you already have you can open up the
console and just start typing code yeah
right and it doesn't have a huge amount
of programming constructs
it's a dynamically typed dynamic
language right so there's no compile
phase along nowadays with projects you
know there's
various different things that people do
for optimisations which could kind of be
seen as a preparation or compilation
phase but it has a very low barrier to
entry for developers so I think what
happened is a lot of people who are
getting into programming or maybe coming
out of college or going to code schools
or maybe just had an interest in it
javascript is something that's very easy
to jump on to jump onto the train and
just get started with it it takes a long
time to master just like any other
programming languages and it has its own
nuances as any good JavaScript developer
will tell you but I think with those
three things that's kind of the reason
why it's gotten so popular so quickly
right it's easy the easy to get started
with it has a superscalar type of
architecture that you have to follow
when you build JavaScript applications
obviously you can do things in a bad way
but if you do it in the prescribed way
you get the scale out of the box and
then the ubiquity on the front end also
meant that a lot of people who were
writing code for web browsers were able
to very easily now take that same
programming language that they wrote
stuff for the web with and can write
server-side applications so it opened up
this whole new kind of this whole new
environment or this whole new basically
area of developing applications to
existing programmers so what's on the
horizon for JavaScript what do you see
in this not-too-distant future so
there's some interesting things going on
in the JavaScript world es 2017 with the
tc39 spec group that that's the echo
script specification group that is I
believe nearing its final stages so
they're adding more things to the the
base javascript programming language
most of which I agree with some of which
I don't really agree with but I think
that's one thing that is really pushing
things forward and I think especially
over the last couple of years what's
happened is Java the JavaScript language
specification had been stagnant for
debatably over a decade and then all of
a sudden there was a lot of movement in
the community say we need to add new
features so that we work around some of
the nuances and the pain points in
JavaScript
so they did that with finally when they
released es6 or
it's supposed to be es2015 Ori is 2016
right so they added all this extra stuff
and then developer started to get their
heads around it and I think that really
kind of pushed the language forward and
the way people were able to build
applications using these new features
that helped from everything from an
organizational point of view as well as
dealing better with async constructs and
other things like that made a big
difference so that's kind of like from
the language front that's what's kind of
happening there and in the kind of
larger constellation in the JavaScript
world it can be exasperated so much
speed in new things coming out right new
web and web frameworks for the browser
new things happening on the server and
and tools to help you improve code
quality and lots of other things so it's
very rapidly moving space compared to
other programming platforms right
whether you think of Java or Python or
Ruby all right those have kind of
reached a very mature state you know
there's occasionally they'll be a big
jump like for example JDK 9 is coming
out this year so Java Dyne will or in
the Java world they'll be a little bit
of a leap whereas in the JavaScript
world it's like a continuous upward line
in my opinion in terms of the progress
being made whereas in other programming
platforms it kind of goes leaps in terms
of you know Java 9 is out Python 3.6
just came out you know rails 5 came out
about a year ago so you know they have
more leaps in the JavaScript world it
feels like it's just a bullet train you
know moving through the detect the tech
universe at a very rapid pace so I'm
going to throw you a curve here how does
a how does a master's degree in
biomedical engineering translate into a
career in software to go okay so that's
an excellent question what I actually
did for my master's thesis was build a
system using object-oriented databases
for modeling immunization records
interesting right so and there was also
work on the kind of hardware engineering
side around medical devices and things
like that
so so yes environmental engineering you
can do kind of everything from tissue
generation to building software to
building medical devices and you know
things like that so it's very broad
field which is kind of nice in a way but
also very challenging as you so imagine
software development was something you
were doing before you get into that what
defrosted the the choice of biomedical
engineering I always had that interest
early on to kind of see what could be
done in the medical space because I was
felt that there's quite a bit in terms
of technology that could be done to help
the health and the kind of care of
people you know with with their health
obviously so that was my initial
interest in it and as I started working
in different things you know I saw that
there was quite a bit that needed to be
done unfortunately for somebody who
probably has ADHD like me having to be
constrained by all the the regulations
and I'm not saying the regulations are
bad obviously you know you need to make
sure that you know if you build a
medical device that doesn't harm the
patient right but you know so obviously
there's regulations around all this
stuff sure so it just it wasn't
something that after I really got into
it that I wanted to do long term because
it's not you know not moving fast enough
for for me to for it to keep me
interested all the time well really
you'd be hard-pressed to find any any
area any endeavor that for which
technology hasn't become a significant
part yeah Wow yeah well product thanks
