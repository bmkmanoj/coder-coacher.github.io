stragglers this is a presentation about
using the cloud to compute massive
amounts of data it just so happens by
coincidence it's also about data that
has to do with a star dynamics and
trajectory design for spacecraft to go
to really far away places I'll get to
that in a minute and I'm gonna show some
of that so as a primer kind of a
background not too much and then we're
gonna get to some of the underlying
tools and frame explain use and then
we'll start showing you actual examples
using cloud services if the Wi-Fi
behaves as it's been kind of flaky in
the last conference and so in between
those things will show you code if the
cloud gives us a hard time will show you
more code and you know vice versa so I'm
Sean Philips and this is Johann Voss and
together we are the wild cloud stallions
so first and foremost I work for AI
solutions we're a NASA contractor I have
to state this I I do not represent NASA
I do not work for NASA I do not speak
for NASA this is the stuff that I do as
part of my cont my company that does
NASA work this is where we are and if
you're interested in this type of work
and you're a hotshot or not
and you want to come see me and maybe
get hired come see me after this so with
me is Johan and he runs a company named
gluon and i dr.
pass the buck a little bit are you HOT
yeah I'm on my own I'm um you showed
that you showed the trophy on that
previous slide is that the Oracle
Innovation Award
No okay so last night we got some cloud
innovation awards from Oracle's so thank
you Oracle thank you for recognizing us
we've done some cool stuff
but on the gluon because I'd like to say
that uh if it wasn't for there's a lot
of technologies and a lot of people
involved that would enable us to do what
we did which I keep alluding to doing
something good yeah I'll get to that I
promise this isn't a timeshares pitch
but if it wasn't for johan's work and
his company's products both open-source
and for sale glue on the glue on like
cloud link i couldn't have done it
because i'm not a cloud guy my head's in
the clouds and my works above the clouds
but I I'm not cloud engineer and so they
took me from zero to award in just a
couple months it's pretty amazing and I
think you guys can do that too and so I
love their products and I want you don't
want to talk a little bit about that but
then we'll get to the good stuff thank
you so the reason I asked we want an
Oracle Innovation Award finalists fing
with the trophy yesterday as well enough
how seriously wondering where that I
left the trophy anyway we will fix it
after the session it's in somebody's
supercar ok still inside back so I work
for a gluon we were a small company we
started recently and we try to bring
Java to mobile so we try to allow to
enable all the Java developers the teams
that we have 12 million Java developers
now and they are now capable of writing
Java code and deploy it to mobile
devices just by writing Java code no I
always know androids required
you don't need Java Script and you do so
interface is cross-platform as well
because we're using Java FX so that's
the only thing that you need to to
deploy the java application on mobile
phone it starts with an ID plug-in and
then it's all Java so Java Mobile is
fine it's great but well this is a cloud
conference it's it's everywhere so
wherever the revenue is it sits in the
cloud so it's somehow the data from the
mobile needs to go to the cloud and
that's actually what we will show in
this session as well so they need to be
an interaction between mobile and cloud
and that is our flagship product is
growing crowding and that allows you to
connect a mobile application in a secure
way with any cloud or enterprise based
system secure is extremely important
here
our website if you want a more details
as you can not see there it's blue and
hq.com and there you get more
information about about how exactly blue
and cloud link works so I think I'll
keep it here because I always have to
pay $100 extra for the promotional time
yeah right right yes yeah I was gonna
say I was gonna say website want me to
show them real quick yeah blue hq.com is
our is the company website where you can
find all the information about both blue
and mobile as well as a gluon cloud link
so if you want to repeat this yeah you
can use the same tools as that shown is
using and it's really it's really not
hard and the great thing is you can
concentrate them you're on the things
that you're good in you're in your own
business logic and we help you with
bringing that to mobile and bridging the
gap between mobile and enterprise so I
think and that's why we try to make
everything open source for developers as
much as possible developers should never
be limited by things that are outside of
his competence the main you should only
be limited by your brains and if you
should work if you have to worry about
how can I get this to mobile and get it
to the cloud then you're losing time
yeah well said man all right so uh let's
see powerpoints being mean to me okay
here we go
so he kind of summarized this right here
this slide that we'd put in but there's
some specifics here why would you want
to use these tools these these tools
that put your traditional Java
applications desktop web services etc
why would you want to put it on tablet
why would you want to make it put it up
in the cloud and make it more more
prolific prolifically available well
here's why at least in my world when
somebody wants to do data analysis they
tend to do it on a desktop there's a lot
of work there's that deep dive into it
and that takes a lot of memory a lot of
computation that sort of things so
clearly having access to cloud level
resources makes it even easier but you
need
in order for that to really work whether
it's on a tablet or with on the desktop
you really need these connection type
capabilities cloud link okay and if
you're going to draw here we go this guy
I love this guy
front row come on this guy comes in as
like show me something new show me
something new every time I'll give you
something big I'll give you my big deal
just like Larry Ellison says okay so uh
sorry can I say that so if you're going
to collaborate how how how are you going
to collaborate it's not on your desktop
collaboration occurs when when you're
around other people and that's generally
done in an ad hoc manner and so a great
way to share things is through some sort
of mobile capability tablets phones that
sort of thing right or if you can at
least do something on one device and
easily to send it or make it available
on something else that's like when I say
it like that's like well no duh Shan but
like okay how do you do that easily and
make it look nice and how do you how do
you do in a way that doesn't break the
bank trying to develop these tools you
use these frameworks okay I like to say
with uh with gluons capability it's a
right once walk anywhere okay now uh
that supposed to be funny guys you're
laughing right so they didn't think my
comments are funny I'm dying up here I'm
dying so okay so before we get into the
cloudy stuff we got started talking
about above the cloud right so I'm gonna
show you a soft piece of software that
my company built and with the help of a
certain scientist who's visiting right
now dr. Diane Davis stand up Diane this
is her PhD research manifested into
software life okay
very very I've won the lottery to have
worked with her alright so NASA puts out
these programs new frontiers programs
and I put this slide together and I
pulled this quote off of their their
website so this is my my conveyance of
this information to you but they have
missions where nobody in their right
mind would spend money to go do but it's
so it's so intriguing that they set
aside small pots of money to put these
missions out
so examples are New Horizons do you know
with osiris-rex and I'm going to talk
about this in a little bit and so
recently they started talking about
something called I see the title slides
are all cut off this is not interesting
huh so I have I have titles but they're
being cut off but we'll work through it
so the newest de kado survey for the new
frontiers program is the ocean world's
program and that's where they're
focusing on worlds that could Harbor
life okay it's not going to be life that
as we know it there's not gonna be
little critters walking around there's
it's probably going to be microbe real
at best but there are lots of places in
this solar system that could potentially
Harbor it for example Titan the geysers
coming off of and cell it is and
actually Europa and so they have
missions that are being planned and
funded right now that are going to go to
these places the problem is it's very
hard to do and it's really hard because
you've got these big huge bodies Jupiter
Saturn you get these little tiny ice
moons Enceladus Europa exedra some some
sometimes even smaller in the dynamics
are just out all over the place and so
I'm going to show you a video of a tool
that helps sort through that and you're
gonna see the data you're gonna
understand the data and say oh my god
this this is hard and then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna start showing
how we can make the hard part easier
through just brute force calculating as
much as possible on the cloud and then
sorting through that and cherry-picking
the results and then maybe show a few a
few lines of code how easy it is I'm
gonna try to get through as quick as I
can
now please if you have a question just
walk right to that microphone and get my
attention okay please you have to talk
about oh yeah right
where did you leave it let me get to the
next couple slides okay if somebody has
a I'm gonna start asking questions and
if people can answer them and they're
gonna be like opinion questions that
sort of thing or somebody asks a really
good question we've got some yeah we got
some three
printed asteroids films 3d printed
asteroids with some choice labels on
them and so I got a few of those I'm
gonna give those out to some of the best
questions so humor me that the the
JavaOne gods are like hey you need to
get the audience's involved I'm like
well I don't like them they're not that
I don't you know but then they're like
no and I'm like ah alright so we're
gonna do this so the tool we're gonna
show you is the deep-space trajectory
Explorer which just won the dukes Choice
Award last night so that's pretty cool
it's pretty badass so it's a mix of 2d
and 3d type views that allow you to sort
through like well millions of data
points visually dynamically and I'm
gonna get to that I'm not that's a
JavaFX type conversation I gave that
session yesterday none y'all showed up
except for my friend here so my friends
right here so I'm ashamed of you and but
if you do have questions about the
JavaFX stuff come see me right after the
reason nobody showed up was at the same
moment
do you even myself had a session on
quantum computing so that's a good point
actually yeah I recognize all of you we
are all in this session so except for
you yeah so so talking about making this
a more interactive for the audience what
I typically do is I make fun of my
co-presenter Jim told me yesterday that
it's the last time that he wants to do a
presentation with me so I'm not gonna
risk it I will end up without
co-presenters any ya know desperate
thing I can get ok so you're gonna see
some data views that generally look like
this okay so I'm gonna just quickly go
through this and you're gonna be like oh
I get it and then the slide will go
through and you're like I don't get it
but just trust me we we can look at data
in and around trajectories around a
planet or a moon in this case this is
Europa and instead of actually looking
at all the data in a trajectory we can
look at what's called the periapsis
point or the closest point to the
central body
okay now the periapsis points all these
dots that are colorized all derived from
these white dots in these patterns so
why is that useful because different
types of orbits form different patterns
and there's hidden sub structures within
the hyper dimensional space oh I just
used the big word hyper dimensional
space yeah what I use it twice yeah
right I know
and it's gonna be this is gonna be a
tough session you're not gonna get it
right an asteroid now maybe I'm maybe I
like them so um we take advantage of
this okay and Diane literally pioneered
this okay
and so what we're doing is we're taking
an immense amount of data and we're
reducing the dimensionality of it and
then projecting it onto 2d and 3d planes
the screen so that the user can see the
dynamics as it changes so we've got a
video which will take us through that
hold on I might have to disembark from
PowerPoint real quick because it tries
to take over everything yeah all right
seven minutes oh yeah yeah yeah okay
now's the time we're gonna hit those
lights okay so it's gonna wash out a
little bit if you want to come up feel
free if you want to come right up and
see the screen I don't mind
you want to get the presentation please
you'll do a better job than me
okay so this is what you're about to see
is the deep-space trajectory Explorer
okay so right here is a lunar analysis a
lunar transfer problem what we want to
do is we want to get into a southern
polar close flyby type scenario so we've
generated all these possible
trajectories and we've collected these
periapsis points but if you notice I
better pause it already I'm already
behind looking up at the top of the
screen you see total Peary apps a
periapsis plural there's three hundred
and eighteen thousand data points there
right so what we've done is we've taken
what would be billions of data points
the positions and the velocities of the
of the potential trajectory points and
we've reduced it by orders of magnitude
down to the periapsis space and it's
still overwhelming okay so you need to
develop tools which can filter it and
transform it so what we do is we use
we've built and this is all Java effects
we've built tools on the side which you
can automatically filter min and Max
type range thresholds and filter out the
data and look what we start to see these
hidden structures and all I've done is
I've changed the semi-major axis and
eccentricity which mine a sick friend
understand
but maybe you don't him but it's
basically like you know how's it
inclined how long it is how fat that
what orbit is these these basic things
that come with orbits I mean everybody's
orbits got these things right and before
you know it you've basically gone after
just a few variable changes a few
specific structures so the structures
I'm talking about are these little
spokes that come out of the edge and the
central ring so now that we've got it
reduced we need to zoom in and take a
closer look so unfortunately the
resolution is a little weird so you're
not seeing all right thank you you can't
see exactly the menu options I'm
selecting but you know what what I'm
doing is I'm zooming in right so we've
got two types of trajectory families in
here that are common they both meet the
needs of the mission one that looks like
that generally speaking in the other
that looks like this okay so they all
both those types meet that our mission
needs but they look radically different
now what so now you need to take a look
at the the higher dimensional space so
now here's that same data set plotted in
3d that's three hundred and eighteen
thousand points plotted in Java vex 3d
okay anybody tells you you can't use
Java X 3d is weak and we use F XYZ to do
that by the way that's a free
open-source thing go to F X Y Z 3d org I
paid for the domain please okay so what
we did is we took those we took those
filtering settings that we did in 2d
because that's a more intuitive view and
we just reused them we dropped him into
this view and lo and behold because
we've got an extra dimension in our view
we see let's back up a little bit
because I was blabbing we see that
there's an actual altitude dimension and
that's good we need that so now we need
to look at higher dimensional
information to determine which things
that we want that are what's the most
important thing because they're all kind
of the same so we change it so instead
of just plotting the position we also
plot the direction of the of the
information in this case we're using by
default the velocity so at each one of
those points you see the direction of
the velocity now what we can also do is
change the parameter used for both the
position and and you can't see it cuz
i'm i'm offscreen unfortunately the
resolution but you can change both the
position
variables and the direction variables on
all six axes so you know you're now
working in a hyper dimensional space of
six dimensions and if you factor in the
the length of the tetrahedra and the
color and the width you're now at nine
nine hyper dimensions so when you talk
about then some people say oh well you
know you can't do anything more than
three than 3d it's like no you can you
just got to unlock your mind on how you
perceive that data okay so we see that
the that there's differences between
those two orbits right so now let's
let's take a look at what what does that
really mean so this first one looks
really good we wanted to get really
close to the southern pole the moon
right that gets really close to the
southern pole the moon but then it goes
back to earth so that's less than ideal
right you know you don't want a
trajectory that is doomed to fail from
the start so we bring this other one in
and we look at it again this is Java
it's 3d and it isn't as close to the
surface that's the first one but it
never leaves the vicinity now that might
be that's our winner really we want that
because now using less fuel it's more
predictable it's more stable you can
your operational cadence is simpler so
now how do we transfer to and from that
that that trajectory from the Deep Space
gateway oh the deep-space gateway that
is the new human habitat that will be
around the moon well these trajectories
that you're looking at right here are
candidate trajectories that the
deep-space gateway would be at they're
called it's called a manifold or
manifold sorry Diana I'm so sorry it's
called a halo family and these are
mostly long-term stable Lagrangian type
orbits which require only a Mazda mount
of fuel to stay in orbit around so we
want to pick one of those and we want to
generate a transfer with a low cost
Delta V to get from there to the science
orbit or back so we've developed tools
using JavaFX which allow you to take all
the points on one base trajectory and
apply a Delta V and it bumps it and then
it shows you where it goes and I see
just from looking at that and by the way
that was real-time okay
wasn't sped up there are some
trajectories that intersect with my
science orbit so how do I find out which
one is the right one so we create this
tool which is a stacking tool where we
take our original data set we filter it
down to the constraints that we
determined in the 2d view this is 2d as
well but this layered view you'll see we
then drag the same equivalent data
that's that color for a little uh
swoosh thing from the from those
manifolds and then we look to see
literally which points intersect in
positional space and then look to see
which ones have a very similar velocity
direction those that exact point is the
point that we want in the trajectory
that we want because that means it's the
least amount of fuel to get where we
want and then of course the tool
facilitates when you click it shows you
what the actual transfer is and lo and
behold we have a beautiful transfer from
our deep-space gateway orbit into our
science orbit okay you're all our
aerospace engineers oh here let's get
some credits here now are there any
questions
stand up use the use of mic sorry I know
you that's the worst case scenario for
you you have to walk all the way back
and state and state your name the
intersection of one that's a great point
so his mics a little low so I'm gonna
repeat the important key part no that's
excellent question what he's what he
needs is a differential corrector
correct ayan yeah okay so now that she's
here I have to take it and make sure I
say this right so what he's saying is
okay so you've got pixels and you're
stacking them on top of each other and
that's a match in the in the
astronomical sense because you know
meters matter kilometers matter or you
know the power are you getting accurate
we're not it's getting it very very
close okay and then they have algorithms
called differential correction or you
can also use an optimizer which will
figure out how much how many little
bits of fuel change you need to get that
exactly right and then we run that into
a higher fidelity simulation tool like
like the one we create free flyer which
is meant to do ground systems in a
reusable fashion okay and we have a
thing going there was a another question
from someone who asked is this is Java
and Java tends to be slow so how comes
that this is going fast maybe I can
answer that question yeah sure hey that
wasn't that was a scientific question
answer so what are your fising our
explain
Java is a java effect uses hardware
accelerated rendering and that's one of
the cool things about java x compared to
swing for example this is this is
rendered entirely on top of the GPU so
because Java is relatively new it takes
advantage of the modern capabilities of
system so directly the hardware
accelerated rendering allows for much
much much faster rendering than purely
software now are there any questions out
more with the on the Java sub go ahead
that's we're literally getting right
into that okay so some of the stuff all
that all the video that you saw recorded
actually use the desktop okay because
the things that we're doing there were
well they're more constrained it's when
you start getting outside of that box
where you're like I I want to do I don't
want to do 100 trajectories I want to do
1 million trajectories or 100 million or
blah and I only want like the best out
of all that you can't do that on a
screen that's not a visualization
problem per se that's it that's a
computational problem and you need to
have an interface that allows user to
facilitate that execution so I'm gonna
we're get into that right now but I'm
assuming there's no more questions if
you have any more questions about the
software absolutely come see me
afterwards ok
ok great so this is a slide that was
created and I'm gonna leave it like this
because for some reason powerpoints
being cut off so that at least now you
can see the whole thing
this is our basically our architecture
for facilitating high performance
on-demand computing in the cloud happens
to be the Oracle bare metal which is
kind of why they're so interested in
this but using cloud okay so it starts
at the client and a lot of people don't
that doesn't that they think cloud they
don't think client the clients drive the
necessity for the cloud in this
situation okay so in our case we've got
a desktop client you just saw it and
we've also got a mobile client I'm about
to show that okay and and the mobile
client admittedly needs some more you
know we're still developing it's just a
prototype but it it we put it together
extremely quickly because of these tools
so basically the client requests a it's
a high-performance computing type
request to do umpteen million trajectory
calculations this is all numerix a lot
of floating-point a lot of equations of
motion and it's all embarrassingly
parallel ok perfect for a cloud type
solution right ok so it travels it using
glue on the glue on cloud link client
api's which you know it's all part of
one big package we then make a remote
function connection and this is this is
through the glue on cloud link cloud
service which in this key in this
particular case it was running on
Oracle's a CCS but it's it's it's
portable to other frameworks yes by
default it's a solution that runs on
Amazon but if you want to run it on Prem
that's possible and if you want to run
it inside your own Oracle cloud
infrastructure you can use our crisis
yes and then it runs inside your own you
have your own copy of blown yeah right
and I'm gonna pull up in a ok I'm gonna
pull up in a the view and I want to do
it in this I'm doing in Firefox because
I have my password saved in Firefox and
I can't remember my password off the top
my head so I'm good okay so in this what
I'm bringing up is it's so easy it's
just been it's just it's covered with
this simple web dashboard and I've
defined my functions that my clients
connect to through a simple interface
like this in an you know under the hood
it's its rest
it's a rest service so you can't you
don't you can do it your own way but
this just makes it super easy so what
we're about to see here
the the transfers of function here this
one a lot of parameters and essentially
I'm gonna formulate a problem where it's
going to bang out you know a hundred
thousand treasure I forget the exact
number as a big amounts gonna integrate
these things each one takes about a
millisecond but there's lots of them and
then it stores the whole thing in memory
and does a close approach check your
nautical sports am it does a close
approach check to a target and then it
it ranks them and then returns only the
top 150 to the the client so let me log
into the cloud and then make sure the
service is running this is this would be
where the internet would would kill us
would break us okay let's do two two
yeah and let me well okay it's running
let me let me kill it and then uh
because I want to I want to see the UM
the console output I want you guys to
see what's going on okay twenty six four
four five okay great and then we'll just
restart it we won't know how bit will
just do that
okay and because I'm gonna run the big
one after this what I'm gonna do is add
a zero to that heat memory doing so look
at that look if you can't see this and I
can't really fix that that's 320
gigabytes of heat memory okay so I want
to specify that I don't normally code
like this okay I'm not Mike this thing I
try not to write pigs for software but
in this case we want to store everything
in memory that's the whole point of
throwing it at the cloud okay okay great
so we starting up our service and it's
it's running off a payara microbe okay
and it's gonna do its little thing and
now it's ready right and there's there's
actually multiple rest services that are
going to be enabled through this
particular application so that's a Java
EE application priorities an
implementation of the Java EE
applications already that's right very
thin and I can show you some of that
code as time permits okay so now we're
talking about what's on the server so
this got this this tower here on the
right is essentially what's there and as
you can see that's just not that
munch and we put this Oracle cloud thing
in there because you know they wanted to
see that and all that but it's really
just a Ubuntu bare-bones Ubuntu instance
it's we installed Java chubby
we install piyo micro we put our the the
numerical engine from our our d'Este
application which is the that's custom
code obviously we put that on there as
part of a as a part of a set of rest
services okay and then at that point we
just threw it on to a really big cloud
instance so this is oh it's it's it's
not actually 72 that's its act it's 36
and 72 virtual it's sending two virtual
cores and it's 36 physical course ok I
want to be specific right now Oracle
bare metal has 30 s their biggest high
density IO instances are 36 physical
core instances okay and a whole lot of
RAM okay so we send the request it
grinds kicks back the answer shows up on
the desktop or the tablet okay so don't
believe me okay
right so this is a pixel this is a pixel
see it's not it's a real nice tablet
there's your console I'm going to start
this application okay
and then it's going to start pumping out
oh no I didn't put this on the Wi-Fi of
course it's not gonna put it on the
Wi-Fi while you're okay yeah so so I I
forgot to actually put it on the Wi-Fi
here testing it over in the hotels like
yeah of course it works there so while
he's doing that what I'm gonna do is
show you some of the code so we
developed this all in NetBeans this
happens to be a Gradle project because
NetBeans has some really good support
for Gradle and Gradle it does a nice job
of allowing me to have a lot of sub
projects so in this situation we have I
want to show you the first I want to
show you the client side okay
did it down let's see here okay so this
is not the exact one but I mean I just
want but this is actually the exact one
this is how we basically define using
gluons framework a remote function that
would if you know if when the Wi-Fi
plays nice will you'd be able to see
running okay so essentially they have
several objects that facilitate this in
a very easy manner yeah your Chen what's
the hotkey and that means to crank up
your font the to me make the font get up
what's a hockey control yeah that's true
yeah it's like yeah yep how's that whoa
okay is that better everyone including
the guy in the sleep in the back there
I'm just gonna man okay you're number
one too so uh so so they provide these
objects like data client okay
and basically this this if you work
through a data client okay that's your
client and it doesn't matter if it's
mobile or a desktop just doesn't
okay and then they you facilitate
connections via a remote function okay
so now that's a little bit more specific
but if you look closely you're
essentially oh my god look always
commented code and I didn't bother
removing it um
what you're looking at is a rest
function you're defining a rest function
okay which you can use any mechanism to
facilitate the client-side rest
connection and then you define in this
remote function object gives you
everything you need to then
asynchronously retrieve it back using a
specific date of provider pattern so
looking at this code this is the bit of
code that gets the data back
asynchronously when it's done computing
okay and this is how you define what
those how to get the data to the
function and and this this little bit is
really good this guy here this is gold
they all they've gone to all the trouble
to create observe a sort of alternate
observable list which wraps the standard
observable risk in a way so that when
the data comes back from your server
it automatically asynchronously just
goes into the observable list which then
behaves like any normal observable list
would do in Java
okay that's powerful so basically what
we in Java fix you have this notion of
observable object that makes it easy to
bind a model data from a model with a UI
component and we extended that to glue
an observable object which is a remote
which does the remote binding so this
binds your local UI component with some
remote data and if the remote data
changes you your I component will change
as well okay so we have to go fast
that's okay cuz this broke anyway so so
I'm not going to show you the the Java X
mobile client stuff okay because this is
supposed to be about the cloud so let's
go right to showing the the the 3d
probabilistic surface demo okay great so
let's say we want to calculate and this
will go fast okay
we want to calculate a whole bunch of we
want do a Monte Carlo of trajectories
right okay so here's a space sombrero
it's just a sine wave it's just some
data a placeholder what we're doing is
we're going through all the combinations
of yaw and pitch and delta v to do a
huge number of combinations of maneuvers
and then what we're doing is we're
calculate we're integrating all those
maneuvers using the equations of motion
built into our product and then we're
going through and doing a close approach
on
one of those to see how close it got to
it to a target okay now this probably
resonates with a couple people in this
audience this is how you might target
landing on a loan how you might target
another spacecraft how you might be
anticipating another spacecraft
targeting you okay and we won't get into
how we were going to weaponize Java
effects so we'll just we'll step back
for a bit but you can see I'm cranking
out on all four cores I've got a really
powerful i7 I threw eight gigs of memory
into the heap and it's still going and
we've only desk and we've barely gotten
to the fidelity that we really need
we're des critizing at two degrees along
the angles so it's like every two
degrees but in space
two degrees is is a lifetime of angle
right you want to do point two you want
to do point zero two okay look it's
starting to choke now it's running out
of memory it can't do it now I I did
that on purpose because I want to
emphasize that it's it quickly becomes
infeasible and yeah I could throw maybe
another four gigs at it so this is where
the cloud kind of comes in so here's the
same thing using glue on stuff all right
I think I've lost the internet
connection damn it this is the problem
with the cloud well yeah not really with
the cloud yeah that's a bummer if I'll
try to I'll try to maybe reconnect or
something like that but I seem to be
able to get out two websites so that's
that's up that's such a bummer show coat
okay yeah
code right so I'm not sure what happened
there so for you so something else is
wrong I'm gonna I'm gonna show code
folks and then I'm gonna kill this and
then maybe restart at thanks Jim I
appreciate it but something else went
wonky
we'll restart it okay so in the meantime
we can then run all of those up on the
cloud and you know it does the same
thing as what you saw except now
everything's running on the cloud so how
would we do that from a desktop
application well this is how did we
create our remotes or a service okay
you're right better best okay we create
a remote service Jesus and a surprise
surprise it looks just like what it did
for a mobile client right okay so you
create your data client you define your
parameters you kick off your job and
when it's done it returns this
absorbable list now where does that used
when use the power of NetBeans did it
this is how you might use that in your
application so anybody who's ever used
observable lists or done something that
where things change typically in a GUI
this is a this is a pattern that kind of
looks familiar and at that point I just
add a listener and whenever something
happens whenever something changes I
just react to it now if we're using JSON
to send things back and forth so there's
a little boilerplate here to unwrap that
that JSON string and then you know you
know binded it or get it into an actual
Java object that's useful but
essentially that's it I have to after
that we are by default web jason
converters as well so we will work on it
but so data that comes in Jesse can
directly be unmarshal
to Java objects yeah okay I'm gonna try
to run it one more time if it's poking
you you I typically disconnect from
Wi-Fi and reconnect but yeah turn but
the good thing is here at least we're at
the conference where the network really
breaks everywhere with that so if we
blame it on the network is sometimes you
have conferences where the network is
flawless
actively in the network then yeah I'm
sorry guys um it's giving me a hard time
and we're at it we're kind of out of
time anyway it's kind of a bummer
because we're saying okay we're gonna
compute cloud data and then we can't get
to the cloud so that's awesome but um oh
we can't say there's a maintenance we
know you can trust us so so why is that
let's finish this off though why is this
important well this I was supposed to
show this slide before we got to the to
the the actual demonstration that kind
of only demo didn't demonstrate this to
define the problem you essentially at
every single state in your trajectory
okay so you're here and you're traveling
this way and you need to get to this
target some arbitrary 3d target at any
given little step there is a nearly
infinite number of combinations of yaw
pitch and Delta V now traditionally how
they solve this is they kind of pick
something that they think is right and
then they use an optimizer to get it a
little bit closer and then it kind of
works right and there's better ways to
do it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie to
you there there are traditional ways
that get the job done but this approach
says I'm just going to calculate damn it
all of the there I want you to see the
numbers I'm just gonna calculate all all
those things okay and here are the
numbers at the bottom what we are what
we were able to calculate with the cloud
which you have to trust me on is given
this is the formula given 1 million six
hundred and twenty thousand trajectories
and given those statistics about six
thousand states in each trajectory
that's a total of nine billion almost 10
billion independent and states that we
then have to do a close approach check
on a conjunction assessment if you it's
not quite a conjunction assessment but
that's like a geometric a distance check
that's very expensive and we were able
to do all those in like you know like
was it 29 seconds remember
during the one Sam I showed you I was
taking sorry yes so you remember I was
running it locally and it couldn't even
finish we were able to do that in 29
seconds using that bare metal footprint
now this is not an advertisement for
Oracle bare-metal but it is good when
you can get to it and yeah oh I don't
think we have time we can drive it so it
looks like we have to restart the
instance in the cloud and so okay these
are the little things that you have to
deal with when you deal with cloud now I
don't just gonna scare you away from
doing that it if you're going to use the
cloud you you have people who whose job
it is is to make sure these things spin
up and spin down appropriately okay okay
so I'm just gonna end that note to say
that we're also using this to approach a
similar problem with asteroid
conjunction assessment meaning if you're
flying around an asteroid you want to
avoid boulders that are also flying
around it what do you have to do to
avoid those things and that amps up the
problem to four hundred eighty six
trillion assessments that's with a tee
and using using the cloud we estimate
that we can do with four instances
instead of just one we can get it done
in 37 minutes so just order magnitude on
that so that's kind of like a worst case
scenario type thing so keep that in mind
you can use client tools like Java Java
vex you can use cloud link to facilitate
connections and you can use cloud
services like bare metal but also Amazon
Web Services would you support
absolutely what uh really quick cuz he's
hustling us what um cloud services
do you support so you can you can
connect your mobile application to a
large amount of enterprise and cloud
services you can connect with any rest
service but you can also add an AWS
lambda for example so if you want to to
do something service you want to compute
something but you don't want to set up
some infrastructure you can use AWS
lambda we were support for the new
Oracle event project as well and you can
talk to any service that has disregards
authentication because you store the
credentials on gluon cloud link and you
then talk to your back-end in a secure
way and so on and so on
all right so we have to get moving so if
there's any questions I have to pretend
like I'm unpacking up come over here and
just ask the questions and I will pack
and talk okay the 3d coat the 3d
rendering code is on github well on FX
yeah it is
however the the custom stuff is not
gluons a gluon has a lot of open a lot
of their products are open source and
available to just go to gluon HQ comm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
