appreciate it you guys are the ones we
want to get the value out of that badge
so I don't know thank you very much for
coming so this is called practical
advice using a cloud-based DevOps
environment so we're gonna just sort of
talk through some of the challenges that
that folks have with building software
building anything automating things
really we're going to talk about an
offering that Oracle has it fills
several of these gaps we're gonna use it
sort of a it's called developer cloud
service and we're gonna look at it as a
you know it's similar to a lot of other
offerings but we're gonna take a look at
it as a whole and see some of the gaps
it can fit it can fill in for your
environments hope that sounds like what
you expected so just a little bit about
me I won't make I won't make this too
long but I'm an Oracle ace director I'm
actually an ace director in bi and data
integration analytics but we we build a
lot of products accelerators real
products etc also I don't know if you
guys have been paying attention to the
analytics space lately but code is
really cool again so we've been working
really hard and automating things that
are going on in analytics and data right
so people are writing code again to move
their data
people are writing code again to process
their data so my company were really
interested in finding ways to automate
those pipelines I work for a company
called red pill analytics and instead of
telling you what we do I'll tell you
these are all of our partners so these
are the products and the services that
we work with we do an awful lot of kafka
today so we're a confluent partner just
a quick shout out to event hub cloud
service which is new for Oracle it's
kafka in the cloud and it's it's pretty
good and they were first to the cloud in
that
we're pretty happy about that we also
work in the Google platform mostly
around bigquery and cloud dataflow and a
couple of others there and of course
Oracle is about 60% of our business so
good old good old red is still still
still drive the numbers and just I just
want to give you an idea of how we
deliver analytics and it might tell you
why I wanted to do this talk so about
60% not necessarily the same 60% about
60% of our customers engage with us this
way we sell service this is like
development as a service and we sell
story points nine hours so we make the
whole thing agile and we sell it a month
at a time and get bill a month at a time
so we're not interested in well not that
we're not interested but we're more
interested in the customers that want to
engage with us continually because we'll
bring them value instead of a six-month
of 12 months statement of work so that's
sort of the world Maya that's the world
I come from my company so even though
it's behind analytics we think about
this sort of DevOps world and this agile
world every day when we're delivering
analytics and any time I talk about this
subject matter I like to show this slide
from Spotify and it's about a mindset
it's also about having a set of
technologies that can enable it okay and
so notice the frowny faces until you get
to the end right because there's because
there's nothing usable until you get to
the end and that's not a way to build
anything much less functionality instead
Spotify likes to approach it like this
and add incremental value as you can and
just to reiterate that is a mindset
you've got to be willing to release
often you've got to get used to
releasing often but you need tools that
enable it and there's a lot of companies
that haven't been riding the wave of
modern DevOps techniques and modern
delivery techniques that may not have
anything
helps them and so this is where a cloud
sort of all-in-one environment can be
very very helpful helpful to you to you
to get started if that makes sense
and you have to be willing to embrace
change there's no reason to have a suite
of tools that allow you to release
automatically if you're not willing to
release often okay so you have to be in
the mindset of not being afraid of code
changes being migrated to production or
to dev or to QA and a regular at a
regular rate and what this means is you
need to use source control now if you're
a Java shop and you're in here
interested in this that sounds like why
do you need to point that out store of
course but if you're a DBA shop
supporting a Java shop your scripts need
to be in code as we need to be checked
into source control as well and released
and have some sort of pipeline that that
makes sure that you're not editing
scripts and a bunch of different servers
that don't necessarily agree so I want
you to as we go through this I'm mostly
going to show you building some Java
here but when I get into the tool and
show you a demo you'll see that you can
run almost anything from here and that
includes enablement that concludes
command-line utilities of spinning up
and provisioning in the Oracle cloud etc
okay so think about that as we go I am
gonna mostly show you building job and
what that looks like but keep in mind
that you can do a lot of things in this
service and you have to be thinking
about some sort of git flow or hub flow
style of development framework again for
those of you who do this you can't
understand why I'm saying this but I
can't tell you how many development
shops and enterprise small companies
whatever that are that are not branching
and that's just nonsense
so get flow is really the sort of the
the approach and
mostly what this slide is showing of
doing merges locally hub flow comes from
github but as you'll see in developer
cloud service they may have the rights
to the term pull request but we have
merge requests what's actually which
actually is I think a better explanation
anyway so hub flow just means using
using a development service or a
cloud-based environment where your code
resides to do the merges and on that
side instead of on your side that's a
hell of a lot easier to track and keep
up with so let's sort of take a look at
the developer cloud service and what it
is and I'll also do a demo and walk
through some of this it is a sprint or
agile board okay so start from the
basics if you're not using a ticketing
system you need to be using a ticketing
system and that's to anyone in out here
that has any sort of changes that are
occurring of course if you're doing real
hardcore development that makes sense
but again look at automating back-end
processes and orchestration of delivery
pipelines that aren't necessarily about
delivering code but but might be about
back-end scripts or automated scripts
that those need to be run through an
agile work board as well so and also as
we go through the developer cloud
service the PM for it is in here so I
have to watch some of what I say don't
think whether it's best-of-breed and
everything because it's pretty darn good
in all of them but think of it as a
whole right and then we'll talk about
the price tag at the end but think about
it as a whole how many different
services from JIRA to github door
whatever do you have to pay for when
this maybe is maybe it's not as great at
get as good
maybe it's not as great an agile boards
as JIRA is but think about it as a whole
especially if you don't if you're
missing several of these pieces okay if
several of these pieces are not
currently in your in your quiver so to
speak so we have an agile board so you
can create stories it's drag and drop
between them so you can move things
between between different spirits
there's also a view of the of tickets so
if you're not into a j'l or what or
whatever still you can just create
tickets and view a ticket and respond to
a ticket and accept a ticket etc okay so
you don't have to put the tickets on
boards and use it that way but you
should we also have git repositories now
you are able to use git repositories
right here in the service so you don't
have to go use github repository or a
bitbucket repository if you do want to
use those you can also link out to
external github repositories so when you
go into the admin screen you can create
a repository wholly hosted in the Oracle
cloud or you can say you know I'd rather
just point out I've got a lot of stuff
going on in github let me just point out
to those repositories where they sit and
github merge requests so we there's no
pull requests in this tool but large
requests are pretty much the same thing
okay so we're able to open merge
requests and again this is where the
merging of branches is occurring on the
back end or in the cloud service so
you're able to collaborate on these
things you have to assign a reviewer
when you open a pull request there's
places for you to put text in for
comment on certain things so this allows
merge requests to be collaborative and
that's sort of the point so if you're
familiar with github this has similar
functionality so that you can
collaborate and assign a pull request
to someone we also have a build tool and
I'm gonna demonstrate this we have a
build tool that allows you to define
workflows that respond to repositories
to repository commits okay so some new
codes committed you're able to kick off
a process and we'll show you what that
kind of looks like and on the practical
of advice of things I'm gonna talk about
a functionality that this tool has to
use an Enterprise build tool called
Gradle I'm wearing the shirt so this
developed a cloud service supports
Gradle and I'm going to talk a little
bit about all the power that Gradle
provides for building workflows and
those sorts of things you can build
workflows in the tool how it is or you
can use something like Gradle which
allows you to build your jobs as
configuration is code like I say in that
right so your logic can sit in the
repository okay instead of in built to
Bui jobs you still have a job that you
that runs your build that responds and
the cloud service this all works
together when there's a commit there's a
job that runs but your logic can live
inside of a Gradle file checked right
into your repository we also have maven
repositories so maven is the standard
way that most soft and other types of
built code will most the things that run
on the JVM are published as jars or some
sort of zipped up library that we then
publish so I don't you know I don't know
what the make up in the audience is here
but code belongs and get but artifacts
the things that we build that we
actually deploy to places belong in
maven and most Java servers know
to do dependency resolution and pull out
and know where to pull libraries to run
code okay so this is where we publish
our built artifacts
so again if you're any DBAs in the room
no okay they're they're all going any
back-end people or we all developers
developers any back-end or operations
style people okay good so this can be
zipped up UNIX scripts there's no reason
we can't have our UNIX scripts or our
back-end processing scripts committed to
source control and we can write
processes that zip these things up and
deploy them to different environments
okay so be thinking about not just your
standard development but how if you go
back as advocates for a cloud-based
hopefully this one a cloud-based service
that makes a lot of this easier advocate
for sort of spreading the love with this
service so that it can be used for more
than just your development team your
cloud orchestration team your cloud
operations team etc so this is just an
example of where we have the palme file
which is the dependency file that's the
XML file of hierarchically describes
this library depends on this library and
this library depends on this library etc
and then the jar file is the actual code
I built this is some I just reused a
custom Kafka consumer and producer code
that I wrote for another presentation so
when it came time to set up this demo I
said yeah I've got some code I've
already written I'll just use I'll just
bring that in so that's why it's this
Kafka we're not doing to talk on Kafka
but notice and I really should have
highlighted the Gradle because I'm a big
Gradle fan but this shows you the text
that you need to go and plug in to your
build tool to tell it what dependencies
this library requires
and then we also have releases so when
you go into the developer cloud service
we can do releases several different
ways if you're familiar with the release
functionality and something like JIRA
usually JIRA says hey it's these it's
these bunch of it's these bunch of it
these bunch of issues and here is some
sort of artifact related to it okay if
you're using some sort of build tool
that plugs into to JIRA we have a lot of
options here so when we go to tagar
release or signify a release we can go
in here and point to either the maven
repository can point to the maven
artifact and say that's a release we can
point to the repository and say this
tags a release or we can point to a
build job and say the results of this
build job is a release
so whatever mindset you're in if you are
running a lot of different builds for
the same release not using snapshot
versioning if you're just running the
same build release over and over again
you might go and choose the most recent
build or anything associated with the
most recent build declare that as a
release or you may go into two maven and
say whatever version this is this is the
release and we also have the ability
let's face it the reason oh this is my
opinion the reason this cloud service
exists is they want you to deploy things
to the Oracle cloud they want to make it
really easy for you to code there's a
lot of other sort of developer friendly
tools there that are that are running in
the cloud now that make it easy to
develop code and deploy
that code to the Oracle cloud and so we
see that we have our Java cloud service
Java cloud service SAS extensions an
application container cloud as options
my understanding shades we're going to
be seeing that list a lot longer is that
right
yeah I see things like docker images etc
that yep so expect as you know as as
this service grows you're gonna see a
lot more deployment options okay and
then we also have so here's where I'm
defining my build step in the build tool
and this is me showing the Gradle
wrapper and I'm going to talk a little
bit more about the Gradle wrapper in a
minute but this allows you to use the
Enterprise build tool called Gradle and
cradles the number one build tool in the
world the main reason for that is
because it's the build tool for Android
studio so anybody who writes Android
code and uses Gradle to build their and
deploy their code their code to the
place for the Google Play Store so it's
got a big big user base it's highly
scalable it's very powerful it's very
very simple
in this developer cloud service to use
Gradle as your build tool of choice so
with all of that with all filling all
these gaps how much money would you
expect to pay a lot it's actually free
it's free if you have the Java developer
cloud service is it free with any cloud
service or just Jonathan anyone that's
what I thought I wanted to make sure I
asked before I said it
safe harbor by the way I don't work for
Oracle but please keep that in mind so
is for it's a free cloud service okay so
when you start thinking about what
you're paying for all these other
services are they better in some ways
than this cloud service perhaps but it
has some pretty good functionality so as
a whole all you got to do is dip your
toe in the Oracle cloud
and you get this service so whether
you're building yep I don't think you
can get it by itself right you can
something that's che the PM for the for
the tool so it enables you to do rapid
development whether you're just
developing stuff against the database
whether you're developing stuff because
cloud service the application container
cloud service etc so it is free it shows
up in your instance when you buy one of
those cloud services so turning the page
a little bit I want to talk about Gradle
and why I think cradle is a big part of
this does he might have familiar with
Gradle has anybody used Gradle yeah are
you a build master or just a developer
okay do you get how it runs okay were
you in my Gradle talk earlier today or
was anybody my Gradle talk earlier today
good I reused some of the slides perfect
so let's talk about what it is and why I
on the practical advice side of this
talk think that you should be looking at
this because there's a big move toward
having your pipeline jobs whatever jobs
you have run all the different steps be
something that you can commit to your
repository think that think about that
that makes perfect sense right so if you
make some change to the way you deploy
your software the way you test it do you
want to go in and change it in a GUI in
the cloud where multiple branches might
run on that
you haven't perhaps you haven't updated
your code to support it no commit it
right along with your code okay so it's
an open-source build automation tool I
love the way that's described and what I
want to talk about is all the different
pieces what makes it so flexible so
obviously it's designed to run in source
control so you know it rides along with
your source control whatever you're
building it's got easy to call exec
processes so when you build and you have
what's called a build.gradle file I'll
show you an example of one you have like
a build.gradle file that defines all
your jobs most often you just apply a
plugin such as a Java plug-in you know
native such as C++ plug-in or a
JavaScript plug-in or whatever and
suddenly just get all of these tasks
that show up that allow you to build
those things and usually you make a
single call to to call your entire build
pipeline because of its ordering and its
dependencies that it understands okay so
it does built it has built-in regression
testing for Spock J unit tests in G etc
so it just automatically scans your test
directories to look for for test classes
so you don't have to configure any of
that as long as you're building the
software if the tests are riding along
with the software it goes ahead and runs
those regression tests and then
dependencies and ordering which I
believe I talked about are art is what I
really want you to be thinking about
when you're using really any cloud
service because Gradle can be can run
and build anywhere okay and we'll talk
about why that's the case
so it's DSL if you guys ever heard
domain-specific language that term right
so this is the idea that as in the Maven
world you would configure your builds
with xml and no human can read this okay
so the idea behind DSL is to
is to have your configuration of your
pipelines or your processing be human
readable and Gradle does a good job
ripping out boilerplate over the years
for one release to the next you know a
boilerplate is that code you pasted
around from one place to another no one
really knows what it does but it has to
be in the file or the build won't run
they've been trying to remove that crap
for years we have basically Gradle is a
series of tasks ok so there's all these
specific task types and these task types
do do all of the built-in functionality
that you're used to but it also is
extensible so you can you can their
class file so you can extend those class
files and create your own custom task
types ok and the Gradle wrapper which
we're going to talk about in just a
minute we're also going to talk about
the directed at a cyclic graph and what
that means
so publishing built-in support for
publishing to standard maven
repositories but also built-in
publishing to either s3 or Google Cloud
storage built right into the tool so
anybody from artifactory in here
hopefully not so you don't really need
these big that you know maven servers
anymore when you can just publish
straight to an object store it makes
perfect sense
ok plugins I'm not going to really get
into here an incremental build support
we'll talk about why that's really
powerful and it also has a daemon
process so it runs a daemon you can
choose not to run with a demon but it
runs a daemon to speed up here so
there's no process that je viens don't
have to kick up and run to run your
processes there's a demon that's already
running so you saw that Gradle wrapper
that was in the developer cloud service
let's talk about what that is exactly so
our build tools need to execute ever be
able to execute everywhere ok so if
we're going to use a build tool to build
our software
it needs to run on the developer
workstations it needs to run on the
build servers the containers that may
build our code today the bare metal or
VMs that run our builds and our tests
and Gradle unlike other middle tools
updates very frequently ok you get a
release of about a release a month so we
need some way to make sure that it's
easy to ensure that developers are
running the same version of Gradle that
all of our build tools are and so that's
sort of a headache and without the
Gradle wrapper so what the Gradle
wrapper is extends that idea of
configuration as code or code as
configuration what I don't never get
that right but that idea that you should
define in a declarative manner your
process commit that to source control
Gradle also believes that you should
check in the utility that executes sit
ok and that's called the Gradle wrapper
so the Gradle wrapper if you're in side
of your source control repository
you just run Gradle wrapper and you get
these four things ok you get two
command-line utilities Gradle W whether
you're on Windows or UNIX it'll run you
get a lightweight jar file that is not
the Gradle distribution it is just the
jar file to facilitate the command-line
utility so those two command line
utilities don't have a lot of logic in
just the ability to call that jar ok and
you have a properties file for for for
certain things so what happens is the
first time you run when you run the
Gradle wrapper it puts those things in
your repository now anywhere you check
out that repository you have the Gradle
W command and it will pull down the
distribution of Gradle either from
Gradle that's the default place it looks
or you can host distribution of Gradle
inside your firewall and it will
automatically pull that down
anywhere you run so if you want to
update Radel on every single one of your
environments you just go what you got to
have it installed somewhere right any
developer can do this have the most
recent version of Gradle run Gradle
wrapper in the repository commit the
changes to those files and now anywhere
that you check out your git repository
and run Gradle will run with the newest
version of Gradle ok so there's 0
infrastructure required or zero
infrastructure support or operations
support required to seamlessly upgrade
Gradle across all your environments it's
very nice now I want to talk about the
directed acyclic graph or dag I don't
know if you guys have ever heard that
expression but dag is all the rage and
big data from air airflow to spark uses
a dag so all of these Big Data
technologies use a dag and all it really
means is we have the ability to do
dependencies in ordering ok so in my
very robust hello world example I've
defined three tasks and the first task
simply prints hello
the second task prints world but it must
run after hello ok so I want to make
sure that if I call Gradle and I pass it
hello and world that it will run them in
the proper order
ok it doesn't run them in the order you
pass it runs it in the order and the dag
tells it to run so every time you run a
Gradle build it dynamically generates
all the jobs that you're in and orders
them dynamically at runtime ok so you
won't have a bespoke process necessarily
that declares all the different things
that are going to run you just declare a
task the dependencies kick in the
ordering kicks in etc now I don't want
to have to run Gradle space hello space
world I want to run a single job hello
world so that's why I've deployed
hello world and said it depends on hello
and world
so the must run after does not cause the
does not cause anything to run just says
hey if the dependencies flushed all this
stuff into the bucket to run that's when
the ordering kicks in
so the must run after does not cause
something to right you also have the
equivalent should run after which is
almost like must run after but it has to
do with concurrency because the dag
understands which things can run in
parallel and which one can't you define
that and your plugins that you use to
find that so all your regression testing
if you're running a Java code with the
Gradle will all run in parallel because
it understands it can do that okay so
this is why my practical and by side of
this whatever cloud service you use use
Gradle or something like there's nothing
like it
use Gradle to define your pipeline check
that in in your build.gradle file and
now wherever you run it'll just work
okay now I want to talk about
incremental builds this is something
else that Gradle does ok so I don't know
if there's nobody really from the
database world in here so I don't know
if Carrie Millsaps know him but he's
also a developer and he is a
world-renowned expert on performance
both from my own from a database
perspective but also just a coding
perspective ways to think about
performance and he has this expression
that I love and he puts it in almost
every paper
anytime he talks he probably says it at
least once or twice but the fastest way
to do something is not and do it at all
and that's really common sense okay so
if you think about what that means in
the Gradle world that means that we can
enable incremental builds let me give
you an example from a JavaScript
application ok so notice this is me
using the web pack utility inside of
Gradle to build a JavaScript application
and I'm calling an exact task so Gradle
has a built in exact task
makes it very very easy for me to call
command-line utilities okay there's a
bunch of different ways but in general
you pass an executable in a series of
arguments but notice I've declared my
inputs and outputs okay now it don't it
doesn't just have to be a file you'll
see in the next next example
these can be parameters boolean
variables but if you declare them as
inputs and outputs Gradle automatically
starts hashing the values of all of that
and if you run a task and none of the
inputs and outputs have changed since
the last time you ran it it doesn't run
okay so just run publish first time you
run publish it knows it's dependent on
build and it'll build a software run
publish again it knows that nothing and
the inputs and outputs have in build
have changed so it doesn't run build it
just runs publish okay that makes sense
so as you get these sort of long pipe
lines of tasks and you want to be able
to call combinations of tasks in your in
your process Gradle makes that really
really easy here is me writing a custom
task in Gradle okay so I'm extending the
default task but I can also extend any
of the other tasks such as exec
whatever if I want to build on exec and
add some new parameters and exec I can
write my own and this is me declaring
just with annotations which parameters
are inputs and outputs and down here I
even get to I even wrote a getter and
declared the results of that getter or
method whatever you want to call it the
results of that getter as a output okay
so whatever that returns whatever logic
long deep whatever whatever that returns
it considers to be an output so it won't
run something
doesn't need to and that's the fastest
way to speed up your builds is not to
burn cycles on things that produce but
don't change the output at all your
source codes changed or the inputs have
changed so it'll run the build again if
the output has been deleted and then
it's not there it knows that so it runs
the build again if none of those things
have changed why do it right and finally
I think finally what I want to talk
about is the idea of composite builds so
all the things I've talked to you are
about two years old and Gradle this is
about six months old and Gradle eight
months old maybe a year but they
actually it's about a year old this is
super powerful so if you look at trying
to manage build pipelines for my micro
services it's a headache why is that
Stewart well because we might shy away
from micro services because it's the
it's the difficulty of plugging all the
things together that have to run in a
micro services world in the old world
everything was checked into the same git
repository right all your code for the
entire application so all you needed was
a build tool that checked out that one
repository and built everything if there
were some libraries you required you
might pull them down but in the world of
micro services everybody is innovating
in their own repository and writing code
and when you go to do a build you don't
necessarily want to build the jar file
that's been published last week you want
to build the code that's in the
repository right and if that repository
is not there then you want to go on the
jar file okay that's what a composite
build does oh sorry I thought I already
done that one so if I told you that you
can have your cake and eat it too and
this is how it's done
so when you do a build you can do what's
called the include build and say here is
this other directory that I want you to
look at and build and if you can find a
jar file that you would pull down if
that repository builds that jar file
don't pull it down and use the results
of the build and cause that build in
that other repository to happen so if
then maybe this example will make it a
little easier this is me putting into
the Gradle configuration file look go
look for this other directory if it's
there please build it if it's not done
so think about this so almost all CI
servers give you the ability to check
out multiple repositories ok all you're
really interested is building your app
but do you want to build your app and
pull down some jar files that main that
may not represent what's in source o
check out all the repositories build
your app but also build all of those
apps an incremental build kicks in if
none of those apps need to be built it
won't build them okay so this composite
build has been really powerful for us
when you have some sort of a
microservices 4 or 5 repositories where
you split your app up and you want to
run a build process anytime any one of
them commit something and build all of
the projects together and understand how
those builds go together that the jar
files that get produced from those
builds are the same jar files you're
referencing and your dependency
management Gradle manages all of that so
let's do a quick demo I'm just fooling
I'm just fooling with you there
like I got oh I'm doing get seven
minutes man so this is the developer
cloud service maybe I'll blow this up a
little all right so I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna go and create a merge request
so I've already created a branch it's
got some code differences so we're gonna
we're gonna do a build we're gonna we're
gonna force a build here but so I'm
gonna do that first and while we're
waiting for the build I'm gonna go and
show you some of the other stuff so I'll
simply do new merge request yeah log
back in all right new merge request and
it's my Kafka samples I want to merge
into master my feature branch and it
sees my change so there's my there's a
lot change in all honesty I added two
comments so not a lot of and change the
version number I can link to any of the
issues in the developer cloud service so
know that we also have issue numbers and
if this commit relates to issue numbers
then I could then I can link them right
here and opening the pull request
additionally I can reference build jobs
if a build job has failed I can open it
I can say that sohow references that
build I can give a summary and then I
have to select a reviewer
okay so somebody's got to review this
and I can change this description if I
want but let's just do that for now so
now I've got my merge request again we
could collaborate on this merge request
over time me and the other developer etc
but at some time we're going to merge it
and hopefully my developer cloud service
build will start running so we'll go
check on it in a minute and see if it is
and while we're waiting for that though
I want I just want to walk around you've
got this sort of main dashboard that
gives you sort of a high-level view of
everything that's going on this is where
you can go browse your source code
repository so we're able to go in here
if you don't want to go check out the
latest you can go here and just choose a
branch and see what the code is so what
exactly what you expect from a
development from a cloud service that
runs in the cloud from a developer cloud
service in the cloud this is our maven
repository so you can see the previous
versions of the code that I have that I
have built and what's great about here
is if you want to require this in a
Gradle build somewhere else it
immediately gives you the code you need
to go paste into your build.gradle file
ok so that's really really nice we have
snippets so if you're familiar with
guest's gist's and github this is a
similar concept so stop emailing little
code samples around and say is this look
right go put MIT create a git I mean if
it's code that you're checking in a
source controlled and obviously just
just point them to that but little
sample code samples hey is this look
right you said you were looking for a
way to do something is this what you're
looking for let me create a new snippet
and you can share and collaborate on on
little code snippets here it's a good
name for it this is the issue screen so
if you're not interested in really
dealing with agile boards you can just
use this issue screen okay if you're not
agile but you still want to track work
on the other hand if you are agile sorry
I forgot to create a board if you are
agile you can create boards here and
easily add sprints okay so you can
create sprints you can drag issues back
and forth between sprints and then
here's that deploy screen I don't have
enough o CPUs in my cloud account to
spin up Java cloud service but
if if you did you can deploy this code
straight to Java cloud service and we
have the docker registry so you can link
an external docker registry and this is
actually how you also deal with Oracle's
docker registry and then we also have an
administration screen so this is where
you can go in and configure things in
the cloud service add new repositories
etc so this is the screen that that not
every developer necessarily needs right
so there are certain things that
probably don't apply
well upholding didn't work so let's just
build it and actually it's no different
than this one that ran earlier today so
as you can see I can go take a look at
the console and this is running the
Gradle wrapper so it's building jar
files and I'm publishing both to an s3
bucket
so that's Gradle is capability of
publishing to an s3 bucket
I'm also publishing directly to the
Oracle maven repository that exists as
part of the cloud service so the cloud
service you know if what you wanted the
jar files to be run on the on the cloud
service then the maven repository in the
cloud service is a great option if you
need to make these libraries available
to other clouds for instance cradles a
great option because it can deploy jars
to both Google and to Amazon
so with that about done one night left
be willing to take any questions and the
time I have left on one minute
no pressure good all right thanks for
coming at 5:30 on Wednesday I really
appreciate it thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
