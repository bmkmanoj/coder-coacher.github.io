we're going to show you two things a the
technical details of intercept 0 and
java ee 7 but the other side is how JCP
people from different companies actually
managed to walk into him to make
something happen so it's it's a
background story to the the technical
details so I do work for red hat in the
past year and a half have been heavily
working on java ee 7 and specifically
bean validation which i have the respect
lid off otherwise i do initially walk in
the in the hibernate team and working on
everything data @ @ j both these days
and there is a marina from oracle hi i
was the maintenance lead for this update
of the interceptors bug i'm also a spark
late for EG beasley door 201 in gb 32
talk at 3pm here so if you're welcome to
that talk as well otherwise i'm a
developer glassfish oracle oracle open
source application server okay let's get
started
is it me hearing this noise or everybody
else also hearing will adjust just keep
going do you want to start or not going
so this is our agenda for today it will
be kind of back and forth between what
changed in the interceptors and how it
change in Y changed and technologies
that were affected by this change and we
will again we will go back and forth so
bear with us so it is our interceptors
one or two maintenance update of the
previous version so it stayed at the
previous GSR 318 the old egb three dot
one though it is now completely separate
spark it is part of the e7 platform and
it's a major update to the document
itself besides the features that we
added and I will go into more details
why we did it but now it is the single
spark that should be used for
interceptors for both developers and the
container providers so the major change
to the document to the specification
itself is merging all things
interceptors we moved chapter 9 most of
it from CD is back into the interceptors
back so that now the document has much
better flow it once was one chapter and
related documents that you know not very
developer friendly now it has five
chapters and six related documents and
we added three features around construct
and priority something that I mean I
will be talking how he needed it and why
he needed it in how he used it in
invalidation and were also simplified
rules for intercept method signature sir
so this is the first part of the changes
the document change
if before this release you you were
wondering what interceptors are and how
they work and where do they belong you
will be scratching your heads because
there is a interceptors back that
describes a gb style interceptors for
historical reason because interceptors
came to exist with eg bees then they
were moved out of eg bees but they
stayed egb style interceptors and they
are eight interceptors interceptors but
if you look at this back 11 it would say
oh by the way at interceptors
interceptors support is optional and
there are also intercepted binding
interceptors which support is also
optional and you're like huh do I need
to know this bag do I don't maybe it's
all duplicated why it is so so we
removed all these strange things we
again we took the original interceptors
back we took chapter 9 from CD is back
and we merged it together so and
rearrange it so that common rules are
common rules and specific rules are
specific rules and if something doesn't
belong to commons park it says
explicitly so it says you know CDI spark
also adds this or eat EG beasts back
adds that or extension spec is allowed
to add more in this area and some areas
cannot be modified that's the role so as
part of it we moved EG BGR xml
deployment descriptor elements that
historically were moved to that
interceptors back back to where it
belongs to the gb spec and and we added
a lot of examples I mean we added as
many examples as time permitted so uh it
is an open java.net project with JIRA
touch so if you find any missing example
as still any confusion people are filing
GFI lagera it's it's known easy to fix
stuff in this document
right plus plus the spec is short enough
so you will not fall asleep before
finishing it so that's good ma generally
I it's it's kind of a common trend in in
Java EE to try and duplicate all the
same feature described in 27 different
specs with potentially slightly
different behaviors and try and say no
from North no one lets say interceptor
is this and every other spec actually
use this stuff so there's a it's a work
in progress we it will take us probably
a couple of release to to get it all
properly done but you can definitely see
the trend so I'll move to the why you
know we added some of the features in
interceptor so we didn't decided to add
them just because we wanted to add stuff
in particular hear me as a customer of
interceptor needed some of the features
so let me explain quickly what is being
validation if you're not familiar with
it bin validation is a standard that
lets you express constraints on your
domain model so for example on a
property you say you know where the
string really looks like an image so
let's constrain it as an email and we
also offer start out a PRS that lets you
let you or other frameworks actually run
the validation the engine will actually
look at the constraints and validate
stuff in an in a sanitized way from your
point of view it usually looks like
adding annotations on your on your
objects not Nolan size for example as
our part of the standard and social
security number is something you would
have written it's very easy to add your
own custom constraints to it you're not
forced to use a notation you can use XML
if you really really want to but don't
recommend it and it's yeah also
extensively in the sense as I said that
you can write your own your own
constraints and let them be validated by
you know the other part of the platform
so in bin validation one dot one we did
a bunch of interesting stuff around
integration with CDI but the other big
feature is really about offering the
ability to validate not only the
properties of an object but also the
parameters of a method and the return
values of a method okay so if we look at
it here it's a CD i bin and i just said
that you know i don't want this method
to be called to try and track who is
below the 18 year old age so i did add a
constraint so that nobody will be able
if somebody tries to use this method and
put the age of 12 or 13 something like
that we get an exception and not even be
able to execute the method okay
otherwise it's the same constraints you
have been being validation so the not
know mean and so on even the one you
have written actually will be usable
here it's sort of a particle that
promotion by constraints where you
express at the method level you know the
constraints of the input and output and
it's very readable we will show in the
javadoc but also in the code when you
when you go and navigate so that was the
goal for us and how does it work in
practice is you are the client called
the method but instead of you directly
accessing and executing the method there
is some kind of interceptor here that is
going to do the bean validation check so
bean validation literally expose the EP
is to validate the parameters so you
pass the method you say I want to
validate parameters here is the permit
or values i want to have been passed to
do the execution and if there is no
constraint violation fine we go and
execute the method if there is a
constraint violation we get the list of
errors and reach on a constraint
violation exception likewise you might
want to validate the return value so
after the method is executed we get the
return value we check that the value is
valid according to the constraints
you've put on it and then we go back to
the client so from a client part of you
it's transparent except you might get a
constraint violation exception is if you
try to cheat the system okay so so bean
validation is about you know describing
constraint on expressing them not so
much doing interceptions so we're not
into the bytecode / AO p / interception
business so
instead of trying to reinvent the wheel
we decided well let's use interception
available inside the platform we run on
and in this case that would be the Java
interceptors so bean validation
literally offers the API to validate the
method parameter and some kind of
intercept or us to go on and do this
this execution we could have sort of do
it quickly and say well there is a magic
integration between CDI interceptors and
bean validation and life is good and
don't worry about it instead we decided
to say let's properly define the
contract between bill validation and the
other specifications so that first of
all if stuff evolved there won't be any
kind of break happening down the road or
realizing at implementation time that we
really screwed it up and the second
point is that for platform that out
above you know I mean aside from Java EE
they could actually implement implement
the same logic and we have the same
portable hooks that could be reused for
that so spring as has done something
around that you can imagine all the
platform you know tree using what we
have done and we were missing a couple
of features because we wanted to be
globally available as an interceptor and
we also wanted to be able to validate
concert dog as far as constructor is
also a methyl and you can put
constraints on on it right so we I guess
I came to pick me saying hey you have
the cydia intercept of stuff and I would
like to reuse it it's like well actually
it's moved to a more generic stuff so I
moved to marina and say yeah where we're
going to you know take the e JV part and
the CD ipod and make a proper spec out
of it and then of course because we were
interacting with three or four different
specs we also talked with the global
java ee expert group to transy and go to
that to the proper direction so in
practice as i said we really needed to
validate constructor which was not
available in the
existing intercept or approach so we
added the notion of around constructor
which is a bit like Aaron invoke except
that a constructor is slightly different
you don't have an instance you are
running the method on yet right so
there's the contract is slightly
different and marina will go into
details a bit later but technically if
you think about it somebody implementing
intercept or will call the intercept or
stack and at the end of the stack the
new object whoops sorry the new object
will be executed but I usually have a
mic like so I can walk around and so on
but and now that's like where was I yes
so the instance is actually created and
we will validate the return value
potentially to make sure it's safe and
give that back to the to the user the
other stuff we need it is a to be
globally available to be able to say hey
I want to be executed on this object but
also you don't want to apply validation
just over about any anywhere anytime you
should think about it especially around
other interceptors you really want to be
as late as possible for example there is
a security interceptor check-in ejbs you
don't want to start validating the
values before the security has been done
there might be some compromise if you
should do it the other way around
likewise transaction you might want to
after election before you do your
validation because you might use some
fairly advanced service that is
requiring the validation to validate the
parameters in the example we've seen
that would not be the case but you know
that so that's a possible you know
feature request and also because
interceptor or they shouldn't but they
can actually change the value of the
parameters we really want to be as close
as possible to the method we will go on
validate to make sure the method will
execute properly and won't have any you
know incorrect behavior to do that we
introduce the notion of global priority
for an interceptor
we tried different approaches especially
around partial ordering serene you know
saying you know this interceptor should
really be after that one and that
intercept or before this one but the way
to express that became quite confusing
and you know in practice it wasn't
really easy to read as a set of Minas
code so instead we went for the I
wouldn't say lame but very basic you
know numbering where you say well the
lowest number of the earliest i will be
cold and then the highest number the no
latest i will be cold and we have
defined some kind of boundaries that
marina will describe later on you know I
want to be as early as possible but I'm
at the platform level or I am a library
library that want to be to do some stuff
from the application interceptor and
likewise I want to do it as late as
possible so for the invalidation we
decided we want to be as late as
possible so we say after the you know
the platform interception in the in the
late side of things and I'm fairly at
the end of the of the level so 800 is
800 all of 1000 so we are low order
interceptor in the future to be after us
but definitely we don't recommend it so
let me put it back together so bean
validation business is really about
validating things and we delegate the
actual interception to two other
technologies we use a CDL CDI portable
extensions to look at the beans look if
they are actually constraints is there
at not null annotation somewhere or add
size and so on and so on if there is
then we will programmatically add the
Interceptor annotation to make sure we
this method will be intercepted so if a
beam is not constrained you don't have
any cost there is no intercept or added
to it if it is constrained and yes we do
at the Interceptor and likewise we use
the add priority annotation to make sure
the Interceptor is executed as Lester as
less as late sorry as possible in the in
the stack and of course we do encourage
all the platform that wish to use bean
validation to actually use this
I'm symantec so we have really two
different levels of description in the
spec the global concept and how it
should behave January speaking in a
platform and then the details on how it
should behave inside java ee with you
know tiny details and the most little
more specific details so i explained the
why and you know let's go back to Mary
not to explain the whole and you know
what has been done so how many of you
are using CDI interceptors already and
egb interceptors okay how many of you
don't have an idea what interceptor is
all right you live okay so for those two
of you who don't know what interceptor
is it is a class or a method that
interposes on upon the method invocation
and now on a constructor or an event and
interceptors are placed into some chain
one after another and at some point i'll
explain the complexity of what there is
no global 03 there is some rule how
everything fits together but let's now
discuss this new life cycle go back
around construct that can be defined
only on interceptor plus how many of you
don't know why the restriction is okay
good i'll leave it you for the homework
I'll if you don't get by the end I'll
answer it so when normal interceptors
chain exist before this whole business
of around construct game in the life
cycle of interceptor instances and
target class instances are tied together
so if you want to execute your method
foo on your bead bar bar is created all
its interceptors are created injection
happens everything
you know ready ready ready post
construct if defined started executing
if post construct does not fail you get
your instance and you execute your
method foo everything is simple and easy
but around construct is different
because the it's around construction of
a target instance so target instance is
not there yet so interceptor instances
are created all of them that are defined
for this clause with a closer method
whatever the whole universe of
interceptors are created at this point
and injection is completed into them
with the exception of the target
instance you can't inject it here threat
it does not exist in interceptors that
you know work you know you call next
calling in vacation context proceed and
unless you want to you know not call the
actual method or event the last one
actually calls the method or something
interesting happens and something
interesting happens here because the
last vacation context proceed and in
case of bean validation we hope that
they are the loss in the gene actually
the constructor is invoked and the
target instance is created and the chain
starts and unwinding back at this point
you can now access the instance it might
not have its injection completed but the
instance is there so if there are you
know regular fields you can access them
or what note if you want to look at some
have you know cooked instance you can
already do it before that before the
instance was created you won't get an
exception if you call get target it will
return now so when the chain and wines
it means around construct completed
after that
Injection completes in the target
instance we said that we still do not
require that at this point target
instance will be injected back into the
interceptors so don't if you are using
your own construct interceptors don't
try to inject your target instance into
the interceptors and of course if post
construct was defined on any of your
interceptors now post construct is
getting invoked and if everything is
fine being validation didn't fail post
construct found everything fine you can
execute your full method and here we
have an example which is what's also
interesting is this part we added to the
juicy target constructor because you are
allowed to place your the interceptor on
the constructor itself so we added this
you know as a village type to the target
of interceptors just to see okay circle
so in bit validation we don't ask you to
put the divining annotation it's done
transparently for you you just say it's
not null constraint for whatever reason
and for grammatically we will add such
well not exactly this one but something
close to that programmatically so you
don't have to put that in your current
we do that transport key but we
literally use this this approach to bind
the Interceptor to the constructor and
this is how you would use it and you
would mostly use it on inject
construction because the coal purpose is
to validate the constructor arguments so
our construction probably not that
useful but this does it work
does so this validate constructor can
actually be placed on the class itself
and it will work the same way but one
day type you would say you know target
type not you then you won't need that
constructor type okay ordering so I'm
going to all mention this ordering
business the Interceptor binding
intercept of CDI style interceptors in
the first version to enable it you need
to specify them in the beans XML by
default they were disabled so the whole
idea of simplifying everybody's life is
to get rid of deployment descriptors as
much as possible then you need a way to
enable and order interceptors and for
interceptor binding interceptors only
the priority was added a priority is a
new standard annotation defined in the
common annotations bug that has an int
value that both enables and orders the
interceptors okay and smaller priority
first and larger priority lost it is
undefined if you if two or more
interceptor have the same priority so
don't do it and this is again this is
only for interceptor binding interceptor
egb style interceptors will ignore this
volume the ranges so we defined values
that define the ranges and the these
ranges are good practice they are not
required nobody will validate oh you
have this type interceptor you chose the
wrong well you know it's up to you but
the idea is this if you need if you're
writing platform interceptors and you
need them to be executed earlier in the
interceptor chain you would put their
priority between platform before and
library before this
if you are writing some kind of a
library and you want it to be executed
you have an interceptor to be executed
early you will put them between library
before an application your application
interceptors should be placed again no
validation happens up to you but that's
a good practice between application and
library after they ain't values but we
think that thousand is good enough now
if you want something to happen late
it's still before the method is executed
or constructor is executed it's just
late in the Interceptor chain then you
will put it between library after and
platform after for the late library and
late platform is from 4000 and tilt max
integer you could use you know you won't
be good number just just to remind you
that just hit or really sucks so this is
the ordering when you go in and then you
call the method but then when you go out
it's the other way around what the last
intercept or code will be the first call
back and so on all the way up to the
client just like a Russian doll so here
is an example both are valid you can use
relative value you know for the range or
you can just put the absolute number
because you calculated it to be correct
very simple and you define it on the
Interceptor itself not when you apply to
the close
so just a reminder a particular for
those who are using Cydia interceptors
I'll you will know why I'm explaining
this even if you don't use the GPS just
because then the whole picture comes in
so egb style interceptors at
interceptors interceptors enabling an
ordering is specifying them inside the
interceptors annotation or in the gbg
our deployment descriptor and they go by
by how they are specified and while
interceptor bindings do not allow
duplicates gb style interceptors actual
allow you to put here como interceptor a
again you can add interceptors on the
method and they will be combined class
level and then method level unless you
exclude the class level and then it will
be only interceptive see interceptor d
without the exclude clause it method 2
will have a b c and d ok and this is why
I'm telling you this global ordering is
a tricky thing because this is how CDI
defined it in the previous release and
you know we need to be backward
compatible we didn't change egb style
interceptors are always executed first
in the chain in the order they are
specified interceptor binding use
priority ok then interceptors define on
a target cloth your post construct on
your target class you can put around and
walk on your target clause these will be
executed lost before the actual event
method actually post construct is that
is that event and then target method or
constructor is executed and the chain
unwinds in the opposite direction ok
third change to the Interceptor spark is
changing rules on the method signatures
this is pure life simplification for
developers there was no other reason to
do that and this is why so around in
vogue is around method method can return
something and it can throw a checked
exception so you're around invoke method
can you know would return that value and
micro checked exception you must call
context proceed all of you who use
interceptors know this thing and you
return whatever you know happens so you
know nice and simple unfortunately
lifecycle interceptors a different rule
lifecycle interceptors are not allowed
to throw an exception and they have
nothing to return so you know it's seems
natural your message signature void and
no exception yeah simple but you need to
call contracts proceed otherwise you
won't move anywhere and invocation
context proceed declares to throw an
exception because it can be used for the
method that can throw an exception right
so to you would you know not every
application server will verify that you
were doing things correctly but if it
would you would always need to have this
boilerplate code just because contacts
precede the low throws an exception so
we said okay let's be simple on all all
interceptor method are allowed to have
this signature returned object and
declare to throw an exception we're not
changing the rule lifecycle interceptors
still are not along to throw an
exception and they're still not
returning a value it's just the method
signature is improved life cycle
callback will return null you ignore
redevelopment but you now have the
single monitoring method
without any boilerplate code we won't
hear from from the back you need to come
here and ask the question we will you
threw an exception from your life cycle
method from post construct or from here
from so the container is still there the
container won't allow you to do that it
will still wrap your exception you won't
you won't get it now you should not you
should follow the rules right the rules
are there is still there you should
follow the rules lifecycle interceptors
should not throw checked exceptions are
not allowed to throw checked exceptions
but on you you know if you are afraid of
yourself continue using the previous
option if you know what you're doing you
can use a simplified thing and the last
but not the list is how JTA changes also
interacted with interceptors gte window
to introduce EMT transactions to CD I
managed beans using transactional
annotation am i repeating something that
all of you know how many of you know
this okay okay not not that many and so
CDI beans now have CMT transactions
container managed decorative
transactions that you can opt in to by
default EG DS provide you a transaction
by default CDI managed beans do not but
now you can use transactional annotation
or to air transactional container manage
transactional support you can still use
users transactions but if you don't want
to bother with all the try catch blocks
and begin and commit and you know row
back and checks and you use this new
it's completely modeled after egb CMT
but it is in java x transaction package
because you can't take part of the egb
package and move it outside by default
if you just say transactional it is
transaction type required the same as EG
be so if there is incoming transaction
use it otherwise start for me the new
one and the values are exactly the same
requires new mandatory never and you can
also specify exception handling roll
back on this exception and its
subclasses do not roll back on this
exception on its subclasses but why are
we talking about it here because
underneath it's an interceptor like with
bean validation what's interesting is
that this is the early platform
interceptor because you want to start
transaction before anything else happens
okay
unfortunately for those of you who like
to mix and match everything these
interceptors are not these annotations
are not allowed on EG bees we went back
and forth and realized that it will be a
mess and we said that listen this
release we disallow maybe in the next
releases we will do it do you know why
how many of you have idea why okay how
many of you want to know at least Kai
level why now I'll show you why this is
why you remember EGD interceptors are
executed first and then CDI interceptors
and guess what GTA is a CDI interceptor
so egb container might start the
transaction oh my you know suspended
transaction its interceptors will be
executed there then a new transaction
might come and the rest of interceptors
are executed in another transaction and
exception handling is a little bit
different and then you know how do you
reconcile all this we we tried and we
realize now it's too complicated and the
same reason why those new transactional
into a transactional interceptors are
not allowed on lifecycle callbacks
because it's also otherwise it's a mess
then this is how you use the new
transactional interceptor you can put it
on a class or a method and Method
overrides that on a cloth so this gate
will be whatever transaction incoming
transaction and update will have a new
transaction always and it will roll back
on sequel exception and its subclasses
but not roll back on a sequel warning
even though it is a subclass of sequel
exception and it's reasonable because
your database usually their own
exceptions are subclasses of sequel
exception
so you you want to roll back on regular
sequel exception and sequel warning is
probably something that's not have
failed data and you don't want to roll
back you want to see what's going on and
you probably saw this also being Ephraim
Oracle I need a safe harbor and we have
what we have time for questions if you
guys have any yeah so the the chapter
that explained the method validation is
actually split into two but there is a
generic part that explain the concept
that it should be done as late as
possible and what method should be
called before the method and so on but
it doesn't mention any interception
technology and then I've got we've got a
subsection that is specific for java ee
because we wanted to specify the
priority and things like that so for
example if springs wants to use I don't
know aspectj to implement what we're
talking about here they would look at
the generic part of the chapter and you
will get the expected behavior from you
as an application user so i guess should
the answer is yes you you we really
declare how it should be done and then I
now sorry well the behavior on how it
should be done what implementation is
used is just up to whoever does it
another question anything interceptors
whatever you wanted to know about
interceptors go ahead we have time yes
and you can just speak up a bit
can you be a little bit more you know
elaborate guys in software election
memory oh yes yes
yes there is also transaction scope that
was added to the GTA transactions you
can mark a CDI beam as transactional
that it's called belongs to the yes but
what he's saying is really if I change
your field in my object which is not
related to the database that or if I
roll back we'd be changed back and the
answer is no we don't have what is
called softwares on production memory in
Java EE that being said if you find it
software transaction memory
implementation and body as excel
resource then you'll be able to to use
that but that's that's a bit of topic
I'm not sure JK should probably remind
us know probably no I don't know well
it's it's a much more prospective than
you know I can think of anything else
yes
one day performance incentives like the
beloved cemented says intercept full
classes start with a and
it's software right everything is
possible actually you know more than
that what I would really want is to to
sedate the interception technology is
limited by the fact that we modeled it
after proxying so once you're inside the
object that has been intercepted if you
call back a method from that object you
don't go back up to the intersect
interception stack which can be a
problem sometimes so I really wish at
some points we could solve that problem
into Java that would be a big big boost
more than some cut about John points and
you know with stuff like that do you
have something of your your sleeves for
that or no to call back in two
interceptors it can be tricky right
because you will have a catch-22 would
girls you know well there is chicken or
a sec it could be but then it seems to
me that it's because it requires white
card manipulation that we have left it
out of the platform maybe it would be
time to it because it is very confusing
when you you expect stuff to work and
all of the sudden you're like oh yeah
because of these you know somewhat
complex food i'm already inside the
object so interceptor won't be code that
way for example for bean validation
that's kind of a shame because i won't
be able to validate internal course i
would really love to be able to do that
in the fugitive sometimes not intercept
intercept or what i'm saying is that
let's take one of your example
yes well let's say this one so if
updates if a client calls account update
then the production starts working fire
but if from update I do call an internal
do update that has an interceptor on it
let's say either bean validation
constraint then this interceptor won't
be called the bean validation
interceptor and that's the issue I would
like to solve at some point in in July
so do you guys follow to how
interceptors invoked you need a proxy
otherwise the container doesn't know
what to do so if this update would call
get no directly it will be a local call
doesn't matter it's in EG be OCD either
all is the same you need to have a proxy
to be cold so theoretical speaking you
can you know if if the proxy subclass
you it's easy right you can always go
through the proxy again if the proxy is
you know real proxy then intercept that
get like local coal is tricky
it's true but then you fall asleep by
the time you go again excellently look
you you you were yesterday Mike stalk
didn't were you so you can inject here
itself actually and then you call
through the proxy are you could you
could inject self basically i know that
in a gb you can inject self it you need
to be very careful but i think you can
enjoy yourself so i guess one solution
here would be toward the same behavior
or inside the CDI but that's kind of
nasty anyway and the proper solution is
are like Remy frogs were saying have at
the language level some kind of
intercept aburre behavior so that we
wouldn't have to do this proxy trick
down the road yes
I guess you that's a good point possibly
I don't know yes that would do that I
would do that so the four people that
didn't live in couldn't hear you could
inject the bin manager I guess and from
the bin manager access the actual object
you're from it's very the it's very
inception wise but its inception light
but yeah you would be able to solve that
problem but that's you have to know the
problem and it's kind of a heavy lifting
right anything else interceptors yes
that's the whole purpose of it yes it
does so you would the container would
inject I mean inject the parameters and
then call the actual intercept or
passing the value of that parameter and
you'll be able to validate that after
yes so invocation kolchak's now has yet
constructor methadone on it on it that
so that bean validation can get to the
construction and validate the arguments
and uh the I think you got a bit
confused by the fact that you cannot
expect the ad injects points to be
usable from your from your intercept off
before but that's a bit different it's
like right that's in the intercept or
can you actually inject stuff from the
object and use it the answer is no ins
inside the around construct but that's a
different case I don't think you would
need that very often because get target
returns you the actual instance and you
can do whatever you want
so it's a java.net project with users
Elias any person with java.net ID can
send any questions on that Elias there
is a JIRA touched you can you know go
read the spec see if we accomplished
what we hoped to accomplish it was a
very quick release less than six months
and we think that the document now is
nice self explorer explanatory but if
you find something there are people who
found something and for our bugs already
so go ahead read it tell us what do you
think rhythm yep thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
