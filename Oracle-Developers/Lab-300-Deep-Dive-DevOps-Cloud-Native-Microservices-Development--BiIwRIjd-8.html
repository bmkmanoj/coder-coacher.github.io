the DevOps cloud native micro service
development workshop in this particular
lab you're going to assume the persona
of Roman de Blois Romans going to access
some code and then build a rest service
that exposes the information from the
company's back in product catalog
once the code is written he will kill
ever egde the developer cloud service to
automate the build and employment steps
and at the end of the day into this lab
you'll have an application that will
expose the product catalog the arrest
services running in an ojs application
inside the application container cloud
service so let's go ahead and get
started
Roland's first step will be to grab
feature 3 from the to-do list and move
it to the in progress swimlane once
that's in place
to the code tab and we're gonna create a
new repository here that will import the
code from github for nodejs rest service
and will provide you the link to this
particular codebase in github now for
the sake of time we have pre-written
most of this code for you and here it is
alright next we're gonna go out and
configure our building employee steps I
will start with a new build job we'll
call it alpha rest build and we'll go
ahead and this time we don't since we're
using node.js for them to specify the
JDK we can simply go out to get and
point it to our repository for the rest
service under the environment tab I mean
the triggers tab we're gonna go ahead
and trigger based on SCM polling and
we're under build steps we're gonna
specify the execution of a shell and
then paste in our shell command npm
install post build we'll want to archive
the artifacts
we can go out and start our build all
right now
is completed we will go over to the
left-hand menu and open up the
deployment tab create a new deployment
configuration this time we're going to
select the same cloud connection that we
created earlier
we'll have to re-authenticate our
password and test the connection but
it'll work
so we'll use that connection it's like
node as j/s has the run time choose our
job choose our artifact for the codebase
and at the bottom we'll paste in some
parameters here from the lab guide it'll
just keep our deployment size relatively
small so we can go ahead and start this
deployment there we go alright now we
can drill into this particular
deployment
and we'll go ahead and paste in slash
products at the end of the URL and test
our nodejs rest service and here we can
see our product catalog is being exposed
either web for your rest now before we
can complete this particular lab we want
to go back out to our active sprints tab
and we need to move feature three from
the in progress film Lane to the
completed swim lane and mark it as
complete if we want to see the report
setting point in time we can look at our
burned down reports on this particular
tab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
