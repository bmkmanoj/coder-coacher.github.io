is Bob Barker and working with Oracle
and I'm responsible for product
development particularly in to assess I
mean incense and from customer
experience portfolio leaks under C okay
so today I mean you know we're gonna
talk about a concept
Sam Sam is nothing but a scrum assistant
micro-service you know after this
session we want you guys to you know
take away with some concept which he
could apply in your scrum teams and a
day to day activities okay sure so let
me do a quick check here so what's your
release cycle you know can i maybe
please raise your hands if you are
following every day release cycle oh
that's cool and once a week Wow and once
a month almost everybody is there okay
yeah so now pretty much with all the CSE
d you know everybody is almost in in our
daily release or our weekly release the
monthly release right okay and how many
of the scrum masters mean here and it's
come Astor's how many of its come teams
okay yeah okay so pretty much you know I
mean so we will talk about the power
statement and then like you know we'll
introduce I mean you know what is Sam
and how we are using Sam and like maybe
a demo live demo unlike other demos I
think you know we have very less lights
and we will directly do a demo and then
we will give an architecture I mean
pretty much you could follow and
implement annual wound okay and yeah we
will open up for Q&amp;amp;A you know as much as
possible okay with that yeah let me give
a story so it's about you know do we
need assistant okay
so last year I mean it was my wedding
anniversary right I mean I could see a
lot of smiles when I say wedding
anniversary so that day of mourning you
know somebody is knocking the door and
hey it was a gift and my wife opened the
door and you know the person elevating a
gift I mean I wish you happy wedding
anniversary she was very happy and I
mean obviously she thought I mean I'm
the one ordered the gift right but she
came and told me hey no he's a gift I'm
and thank you for ordering I mean such a
you know a fantastic husband and all the
things I was thinking for a moment did
they order no right so I was trying to
convince my wife I mean you know hey
it's not me
I mean who ordered the gift she was
again and again no no no don't fool me
you know you are the one ordered the
gift and everything so I showed her like
you know here's my you know all the apps
and it could see my credit card I didn't
order anything so it took some time for
me to convince her you know okay it's
not me hoard of the gift any guesses who
but I ordered the gift on awaiting NSA
which assistant my assistant know
anything else somebody in bank like
Hyderabad told me like you know hates
your ex-girlfriend right so we were
thinking you know who ordered the gift I
mean so we are just an issue and going
going back to office and you know we're
still trying to put some what's our
messages to friends group sisters
parents like nobody responded back so
usual day you know even my wife and we
met for lunch and said okay now did we
find out no we couldn't find who sent
the gift so initial in the afternoon I
mean so we can have usual meeting with
my boss my boss said hey you know how
are you doing how's the wedding
anniversary going on okay did I tell you
that I mean I know everything you know
you're reporting to me so if a moment I
was thinking hey how come he knows that
I mean maybe us maybe somehow I could
have told him to avoid some meetings you
know how I'm going for some dinner you
know maybe something I told him but
still I was trying to find out you know
who ordered the gift but the guy is a
busy man you know and like he has a lot
of things and he travels lot of places
so I didn't even think you know who my
boss what are they gift right then we've
gone back to home and stop still you're
thinking we will find out so next week
we were in a meeting with all our you
know I mean direct select pretty much my
boss Terrence we were talking about like
you know our boss and everybody like
give me feedback you know he knows all
the personal things
everything and we were like giving all
the feedback suddenly ever I mean we
have bought our boss as an assistant she
came and asked me hey did your wife like
the gift and did you like the gift what
what did you order the gift like she
said I mean you know I mean boss asked
me to send that and I send that it's my
job to send all the gifts to you know
people so you know that's the power of
assistant right I mean you could never
imagine
an assistant doing the repeating tasks
you know imagine an assistant sending
gifts to all these like people but it's
my boss will smart enough to use the
assistant in a you know in a different
way so that's the power of our system
you know pretty much you know you have
to make sure as an engineer or a
developer or a QA you know if we could
use lot of assistance right but can we
afford to a personal assistant
no I guess but we could use the virtual
assistant like pretty much these days
lot of bars are available in a lot of
main chat boards virtual assistant so
our concept of my session is about you
know having a virtual assistant whatever
scrum teams okay that's a concept again
you know certain things you have to be
harnessed with the main people or
assistants because if you imagine if I'm
giving you wrong anniversary date and
you know getting you getting a gift on
the wrong day right I mean yeah so in
ought to be harnessed with certain
people certain things I mean you know so
that's that's the plan right so that's
what is going to talk about so what's
the problem statement in a scrum in a
day-to-day you know we have a daily
stand up developers QA and everybody
that and see you mean if let's say that
developer is working on a fix I mean you
know as a scrum master Asst manager
you always make sure you do make sure
everything is working and I say
everything what do you mean by that you
know I'm saying I can I'm making a small
enough code but you are asking me to
execute everything in my machine how
will I do that
like you know I have let's say those all
test cases I will execute everything in
a you know in a sink on one line of code
that's a common problem but you know if
you are in a sea a CD world you know you
have to make sure you know all your test
cases are passing even for a small
change right so but how a developer can
run everything you know in from his
machine are fairly small changes so that
there's a normal problem statement and
people always complain in I'm a small
change but it worked fine
in my machine and I get you know it's
always working locally but you know when
it goes to production it doesn't work
that's a common company always have
right and then like you know I'm a
developer I will do I have time to learn
others modules like imagine if you're a
small team it's okay but if you are in a
big team like team of hundred people and
how do I know if I make a small change
how is gonna make a big impact on other
people right so do I have time it is a
normal you know kind of counts concerns
and complaints people make every day and
another thing is performance test you
know imagine certainly there is a
slowness in the production and everybody
who check didn't last one week right who
cast the problem but how do I run
performance test in my stuff because you
know you always ask a negotiate with
your management
I can't run all the performance stuff
just in my machine how will how will I
do that I need a staff this data and
everything this is a common complaint
language you have to run a performance
testing in your local machine right and
also like imagine you know I mean your
team or schemata or manager is asking
you know in how to execute all the
thousand s cases before you commit you
know what you gonna do yeah if you don't
have any infrastructure you just yeah I
mean that's what my goal so you mean
like you know run the code and you wait
4000 disk is complete and you know for
whatever you want right so that that's
like it takes a lot of time to execute
all the test cases they're practically
another complaint is pretty much a
normal to slow you know I mean you know
it's I can't wait you know it's a you
should complain what we have so to solve
all these problems I mean we can think
of I mean our proposal which we'll talk
about now
so we introducing Sam Sam as I said it's
a concept it's a virtual assistant and
in a chat board for your scrum teams and
you could configure that from any
front-end and you can also configure it
to any back-end in the main tape that
you know you if you have different
source control system build system
everything is possible so we will show
you a demo of that one and also it cooks
very closely with the scrum master the
liquid developers QA and scrum masters
and like you know and also you could get
your code quality let's say like you
know developers I mean you know you keep
introducing new standards from our
perspective and also like you know you
have some sonar violations and
everything how do you get that like an
upfront status and performance code
audits everything could be tracked
through Sam
we'll give a demo of that one and also
imagine like us come master you know he
wants to know whether somebody come into
the code you know rather than like
always you know going to his desk and
then like maybe from somewhere in a
remote location you know you could ask
easily yeah you know did someone commit
the changes or like you know hey what's
the p1 in my team so all these things
could be easily tracked through a you
know it's kind of a bot over here right
so with that we'll get into a demo I
think probably be giving a demo yep
okay thanks Robert so provoker was
talking about the concept that we are
introducing of having a virtual
assistant in a scrum team so I'll be
demoing an implementation that we have
of this virtual assistant which we call
Sam all right so let's meet Sam and okay
before that yeah so I'm going to be a
scrum master for some time and I'm gonna
I know tripped with my family to Europe
and you know I was rushing from office
before leaving and the developer came to
me asking I have completed the feature
can I check in my court yes do I go
ahead check it I didn't remember if I
did check the you know quality of his
code if he is going to break something
in order it came to my mind quickly so
what do I do
so I thought of talking to Sam for that
all right so I'm going to talk to Sam
now so ideally I will be picking up my
phone and I'll be you know talking to it
from an app or some messenger so here
I'm going to do the demo from the Oracle
intelligent intelligent BOTS UI so
that's a simulator that it has I'll be
doing my demo from there so the scrum
master that that's myself I'm going to
just ask Sam to run my you know small
cast so runs more more tests from my
right
so I mean like so here's the concept
right now so you're just giving your I
mean local yeah so Sam is asking me for
the branches so we have in our
application we have a front-end UI
services and few you know platform
services so it's asking for the github
branch for that I'm giving a branch name
now it's asking for the platforms of any
branch if the branch name okay thing
something wrong so here I mean when you
submit your I mean like branch so in
this case what's happening is you know I
mean the cold it could be your I mean
committed core or looking up from your
local branch so when you submit a
request what we are doing is you know we
pull you a repository and you know and
we build the code completely from your
code what you have done and we build
application in a container and now the
app is up and running from your local
code right now same time we bring up
another docker container I mean for
testing purpose so if we have one docker
container with your local changes app is
up and you another docker container for
no testing app they can it could be a
selenium or it could be any other
framework as you have so we have not to
OMA docker containers and app and the
test cases and we like cannot complete
the test cases against app which you
brought up and complete all the test
cases and give back the results to the
developer and we decommission everything
over them in this case what's happening
is developer is still continuing working
on his branch you know he's just give
another parallel to request and
somebody's working on that and coming
back with the results the same concept
in it could be your you know build test
cases or you know any any any test cases
you can think of you are just continuing
working on your branch you know rather
than you know bringing bringing up you
know app your DeNooyer machine and they
start testing everything is done by the
cloud infrastructure and we are
leveraging that one say we can think of
a performance test when I say
performance does the current performance
test in from my branch like I think what
will show you that so in that case what
happens is you know we connect to the
branch
maybe we pull the branch from your stuff
and we bring the application and in a
container and we bring the same
application from a released branch so
now you have a code from your branch and
you have a code from the release branch
so me like we are to docker containers
up and running one from your change and
one from the release branch and we test
against like you know each other and we
power the results and we clearly give
back here as the recessed we could
anytime conform okay you know where is
the time taken for different things and
then you can easily attract that model
okay so if you see a job has been
triggered here which will take care of
the execution that he just gave but
ideally we beg to get the response back
but the somewhere will happen in between
all right so let me just ask Sam to run
performance test
so it will ask you for the bra name
thing now yeah so it has given you a
response back telling a job as being
triggered so if you come to the
performance job ideally you'll be
getting a request over here which will
take care of the performance test so
same thing like you know we could I mean
do for me cold coverage I mean if you
want to say okay from my branch okay
yeah you give it a kiss to the board or
anything hey can you run code audits
from my branch you know it could do the
same stuff over here so pretty much the
same concept you could implement you
know with your scrum teams you know
whatever you want to do as a manual task
or like a repeating tasks for example a
developer here always you know before
committing the changes or after
committing the changes you always make
sure you run all the test cases so those
things can be easily given to a bot and
then what could execute behind the
screen and then come back to you so this
example we show also was using oracle
intelligent BOTS so based on your
requirement you can you know use any of
your any bot framework you know any
interface you want and any back-end
services that you want to trigger you
can integrate it to this right so I'll
just just does a proof of concept we are
just showing our case with Google
assistant aspen so I'm sharing my screen
so I'm going to send some query to Sam
using Google assistant
how many prior talk to my test app talk
to my desktop
how many how many priority-one defects
do I have today yeah so it's it's come
back with you know some defects it found
from the internal database now let me
check the code quality for today what
does the code quality percentage today
so it says it has triggered a scan and
it has come back with an ID so that's
how the concept is so you can think of
now as camasta typically asking okay you
know hey do we have all the code audits
in place and you know hey do we have
enough code coverage I mean in terms of
line level block level so everything can
be done through these things currently
you know you just schedule it manually
or like you schedule it whenever you
wanna run and then like you know there
is a run you know schedule behind the
screen you get back to the result here
it's more like you know pretty much you
could leverage the technology these days
with bots and then give a request and
you get a response any time you know
whenever you already I think that's the
concept here now going to your
architecture so it has two parts the
slide will cover the first part and
coming slide we'll have a little more
details so it's tough at all starts from
the scrum master or the engineer so I
was just from us now and I just spoke to
my chat I mean the Google assistant or
the you know the you I had a BCS Oracle
intelligent boards now that takes the
normal natural language message you gave
that goes into your board framework
I mean premiere the interface you give
it goes to your bot framework so it'll
do the natural language processing and
it will you know match it to some
intense and it will basically trigger
rest request to some back-end system
that's what we are using here now the
bot framework part we saw in Oracle
intelligent BOTS and for the Google
assistant example we used dialogue flow
and when it got the text that I gave in
it will process some you know process it
and now trigger rest requests to the
back engine so where does the rest
request go now in our architecture we
have an internal rest endpoint so we
just
micro-service based on spark Java now
that'll take in the rest requests and
routed to different systems as per what
kind of rhetoric messages say I gave up
guru Chris for the defects so that will
go into route the request to the bug
database that he confess the data and
give back a response to the bot now if
it was a you know query for some you
know say I was asking for a merge
request it will go to the you know
whatever repository where you have
stored it so it's told you I mean where
you manage your code and we'll get back
the data and push it back to the board
so this is this is a common use case
right I mean I said let's say a QA wants
to know that developer has committed the
change
you could always mean ask through the
bots or like you know this this you know
framework like you asking you know hey
can you tell me whether I mean this
developer committed the change I mean
it's a simple get request you know you
get you know talk to the repository and
get back to the results same way like
you know if a manager a scrum master
once know okay give me all the open
module X it gives the results and you
could easily approve or you can say like
an approval the open Monster quest
you could do everything from the in a
bot or you know the framework itself
obviously you can do it from the
respective you eyes but you know the
difference is like you know now you have
Google or suspend or Siri you take if
you want to set an alarm you go there
you know select the time a.m. or p.m.
and say said yes instead of that you can
just take it or tell it settle allow for
me at 6:30 it out of difference right I
mean su some Yashin now you go to an
application and then open an alarm app
different tabs and select scroll down
the time and then like you know make
sure your am/pm confirmation and then
like says save it and you also verify
did I save it or not and then you say ok
hey you know pick me up at 6 a.m.
see the difference like you know a lot
of manual work but here you are doing in
a different way in a faster way and you
can do anytime so that's the whole
concept here like you know we do a lot
of you know in built for each and
everything you have different endpoints
you could do that but here it's like you
know more user-friendly and you're
leveraging the technology for your scrum
teams in a faster as well as in a
quicker way and you could access the bot
anytime you don't need to really get in
different places you know a not can
access the open box like
mah jerk and lacuna maybe the different
test cases it could access everything
from a single condition flow that's up
to you guys to decide where you want to
build that from yeah so we were here now
we saw two requests now say it was a
smoke test or a performance request that
gets routed to another Microsoft
endpoint so we have another Microsoft's
application here that will take care of
the you know other you know scrum
requests so this has a web UI as well
and it has a rest endpoint so Sam is are
taking okay Sam is using the rest
endpoint of this microservice
application now what it does is it will
trigger request to Jenkins pipeline jobs
which will do the rest of the part so if
it's a small test run it'll trigger to
one of the jobs we show so that job now
which has a pipeline code will take care
of the rest now DJ will see in the next
line okay all right so the request has
come to Jenkins now we will take the
example of smoke test alright so in case
of smoke that's what happens when the
job is triggered it will basically you
know execute the pipeline code the
groovy code in that so for before going
to the details of what is happening we
let's see we're in the stall this stuff
all right
the I mean the infrastructure side so
for the infrastructure we what we use is
a cluster console cluster console is a
Hashi core product console and nomad for
the orchestration stuff so we have a set
of VMs where we have formed the concept
cluster and all the smokers what do we
need we need an application and an
application testing framework executing
the test cases so that we have da Christ
a containerized our application we have
a docker image of our application which
is being revealed a raised here and we
use selenium grid for our testing and we
have the application UI framework also
in our docker image
so what Jenkins will do is Jenkins will
talk to nomad
to spin up a container of our
application based on the developer
scored we saw we were when we're talking
to the board it has four the branches so
the piping code will ask for a snowman
the spin Appa application container with
that specific developer branch so that
gets rigor parallely it will trigger a
selenium grid so trigger one hub and few
number of notes n number of nodes
please don't how much parallelism you
want so if a smoke test should be a
really small number of you know test
cases so you would need only a few
number of selenium nodes it's based on
that'll be enough n number of selenium
you know it's up to you how fast you
want to get it done like let's say you
know if you have 50 test case if you
wanna get it done in five minutes you
can maybe like spin up ten containers in
parallel and come back with it since
it's up to us like you know pretty much
it could easily spin up the number of
darker instances and you know do all the
testing and comes back you know faster
that's a goat once you have a grid and
and the hub in place you know you could
simply spin up a number of you know
browsers in a docker and then speed test
against and come back with the results
yes so once all these are up so it the
pipeline will keep checking if the
application quarters accessible that
console has a ps4 that using that will
be checking that once the application
and the Gerda's set up the automation
framework container is also spinned up
and test starts executing all right so
once test is completed the reports are
generated you will have the koo kumba
reports and all that and then after that
it will tell Nomad to clean everything
up so within fraction of a second
everything gets cleaned up all the
containers are gone so the
infrastructure is free same is the case
of similar that's the case of
performance but there is a small
difference which we will see in the next
slide
yeah so even before that you could may
now think of the serverless concept here
also each and everything could be a
function and you could have I mean I can
a cube entities cluster coming up and
you could do the same stuff over here if
you want to leverage the or cool the
serverless concept that's a perfect
example here you know just spin up a
number of functions and in each and
every functions begin scaling docker
image and then you spin up the function
flows and
pretty much like you know Cuban in this
will take care of all their deployment
and other stuff and then you you know
bring up the main we just submit a
request and there's like this our last
stop when our completes and you pay only
for whatever you are using and then
comes back with the results actually so
the same thing can be done in a
serverless I mean architecture also
that's very much possible okay so now
let's take the case of performance so in
case of performance execution we are
doing something slightly different we
are splitting up to application
containers one with the developers code
checked it and another with the standard
code that has gone out
I mean standard Gordon says is the code
that has gone to the customer so these
two come up in the same environment at
the same time and the application I mean
the performance tests are triggered are
also triggered at the same time which
means there are two applications in the
same environment at the same time and
the tests are being executed against
these two at the same time so you have a
better comparison of the results between
how the you know what the developer has
done and what is what is actually
released out so you can you know there
are a different you know parameters
which which are checked during the
performance test so that you'll have a
get a comparative result on okay how
much it was how many milliseconds it
something took during the developers
container execution and during the the
release code and another execution
alright so and Sam asked you so it
doesn't use any developers Hardware it's
all go into the cloud you don't have to
you know waste your you won't feel any
slowness in your laptops or you don't
have any you know when you execute
divided as you can get browsers coming
up right so you don't have any such
disturbances everything goes into the
cloud so there everything is utilized
once it is done everything is removed
and it's easily scalable say you have a
you know your team size growing up you
can simply what we use here was a corn
soup cluster can easily add machines to
a console cluster you can use our cube
inators if you want and it's also highly
available if one VM goes down you in you
know the rest of the cluster will stay
there it's not
going to make the complete system down
so again like you know the thing is
developers are QA they keep continuing
in their brand their code or whatever
required just all the things are taken
care and automatically you know through
the kind of concept yep I think with
that pretty much like you know I mean so
we are done maybe we'll open up for Q&amp;amp;A
I mean so that's up to it yeah that that
depends on your you know your specific
case you guys see if you have an SSO
implemented in internally you can
leverage that so you know you can
authenticate with your LDAP and get us
mail ID so what you know in our system
we are what the internal system are
takes us only the mail IDs so yeah so if
you are already you know say if you are
I showed the case of Google as in that
that there I am not actually
authenticating it I'm just that's just a
POC keys but in case of an internal
application it'll you know ill you
basically get the main email ids from
the LDAP and it will post you to that
it's not to the different you know teams
I mean whether you could have your own
implementation are you leverage any
other like you know security providers
and then go for that actually so for us
we use internal different things but you
know for but the concept is we are
showing with the bots actually is we
have different the sort of SS for tool
UI built for that one for our internal
imitation
I see you're done that's possible you
know I mean maybe after the test case
execution yes you could easily like you
know I mean report the yeah it's
possible like you know even if you wanna
like the way we come identify
performance tests are the way we're and
if I built this is based on the package
structure it's up to the reconfiguration
you could configure that it's possible
it's done in the micro service like an
assessment that's all the key for you
like the micro service part it will stay
in between so so the implementation is
actually up this is a concept that we
are introducing what we use so in your
case you'll be implementing in your own
way you can use the front-end chat as
your what you want
now the back-end services whatever is
possible you can you know wherever there
is a restaurant fine you can easily
connect right so the micro service like
you know you could build and deploy you
know in a OCA or any or any hardware and
then you are interfacing that with your
conversational flow you know from your
team so they could be any UI and you are
come at end of converting that into a
wherever you want to give the request
you know if you want to pass to your
issue tracking system yes it could be
like JIRA or something else or if you
have like maybe like Bill system you
could like everything is done through
the micro service and that kind of when
a gate keeps that and passes back to the
Renton yes you use the edge against a
paper that yes
not the bot builder directly the micro
services integrated yeah yeah so that's
a concept the micro-service is
interfering the front end Brandon could
change today it's like messenger or it
like you know board or assistant it
could be anything but your concept is
like you are keeping in one place and
then you are giving the request and
routing the request and giving the
response back to the place the main
thing is about speed and like you know I
mean like imagine you know like you
execute a lot of test cases I mean you
know continuously in our case what we do
is for every hour we keep on executing
the things I mean like you know it's
just a machine automatically executing
all the test cases and comes back with
the recess you know that way we
guarantee that yes we have like you know
ninety-eight percentage of you know kind
of the pass rate and everything so there
is typically like you know developers
you know they bring up the application
and they you know run the test cases
against that and then wait and you know
when the a browser is coming up and
they're all kind of different concept
these days but you know it is still kind
of you are leveraging the hardware for
that but instead of that you're taking
everything from that machine to the
cloud stuff so that I mean they focus on
what they need right functions all right
code and rest all taken care by the
concept every day you want to check at
the particular time yeah I want to
automate this and I want to get it
generate one report every day so how
does it possible you - so that's
possible like I mean it's a pure
implementation now let's say you are
already having an application always
happen turning is that correct yes so I
mean that's a different kind of use case
but our concept is meant for pretty much
scrum teams developers and QA but your
use case is if you want to check whether
my service is always up and running
there are different like you know I mean
pass offerings you know there a lot of
in a pink switch you could use like you
know for example you can think of
Oracle's and eeehm that takes care of a
lot of you know connection and thus you
know frequent pings and it gives it as
alerts back to you so those kind of
stuffs are possible exactly yeah or rpm
Enterprise Manager you know they do kind
of frequent pings and in a good
it will alert you if there is something
wrong as all these things are possible
in that batch yeah here we are I mean
making sure you can leverage the
technology for your team so that
repeated tasks or I mean you know T
tasks that nobody wants to do yet all
the things can be given to the bots
right I mean imagine your QA how long
you keep giving the same manual test
cases you know they'll execute the test
cases today tomorrow like you know after
sometime they'll say it's boring so
those things can be given to a you know
technology like Bart and they could do
the same again and again comparison it's
possible any any us possible that what
I'm saying I mean in any place and then
you could mean your service I mean you
know you built it and then you integrate
with Skype and then pass by get me chat
bot you're saying no that case you wanna
yeah that depends on a board framework
so in case of Skype I don't think direct
integration is not there currently but
you can integrate producing your Web
books so where there is no direct
interface that's what we do but in case
of other bot frameworks I believe it's
there should be yeah sorry could
directly from Skype you could directly
go to your micro service because your
micro service will have its own
endpoints and from the riku directly
like post it and then it could come from
there there are multiple ways any other
questions all right thank you for your
time really appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
