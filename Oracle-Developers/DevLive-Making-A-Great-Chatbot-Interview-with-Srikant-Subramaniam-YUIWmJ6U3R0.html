at Oracle code Israel I'm your host
Javed Mohammed here in the outskirts of
Tel Aviv and we're very honored to reach
Subramanian that kind of close I
apologize and she is I see the director
of product management of articles and he
gave a part of the keynote so she
welcomed to save life so thanks for
coming I know you had a some great
presentation and some demo and we'll
kind of get a little bit later into that
one I think the first thing was just
talking a little bit about the whole
theme of chatbots
which are very popular you want to just
talk a little bit about you know I think
we were talking a little bit off-camera
that and that we were being overwhelmed
by the number of apps on mobiles and
there's like Absa teak and some of the
solutions that are out there and it
seems like that those lead-in the
textures of messenger and chat mod so
you want to just talk I'm just kind of
using little key words here and there
but you want to just give a little
backdrop behind that so the thinking is
you know a few years ago CTD con every
everybody knows a mobile app for
everything and the goal really was that
you know you mobile is gonna take over
the world all of us would have mobile
apps to do everything but over time what
has come to realize what we come to
realize is that there are too many
mobile application and if you look at
I'm sure you're similar you see in the
phone as well you probably used about
five or six apps at the most the three
and then a lot of that is sitting there
doing nothing
I mean there's a good reason for it
right so if I'm for example if I'm
looking looking an airline booking the
airline ticket I need to get an app for
United maybe one for Lufthansa
and maybe one for any other airline nice
things you look like you looked at my
phone because that's exactly what I have
and I use them one time
the thinking is you know we serve buddy
but we have one tool that you use all
the time it is basically messenger
what's that can be exactly so thinking
is how can we use that to get the same
capabilities as a mobile app okay the
chat box has have come have come in okay
and so that's the current thinking and
you still need to do all the hard work
in the backend and surfacing of the API
and talking to the different back-end
application but at least the method of
interacting with those applications is
changing now towards the metal interface
so we were talking a little bit
off-camera and you were talking about
how chat BOTS are developing from
something which are very kind of basic
to bringing machine learning and some
intelligence into you wanna kind of
address a little bit sooner sure there
are two aspects of chat box and one is
basically a completely
transaction-oriented static you have
some questions chat box and as an answer
so that's that's that's okay that's how
we get started but I think the real
value add here is basically those
data-driven and this predictive chat pod
you're able to make some informed
guesses and informed decisions on what
you are and who you are and what might
you might like based on your fantasy
Bastion work past behavior for example
and that's the predictive chat pod and
that sounds also the things where I'm
not I'm not I'm using natural language
processing I'm not going to say it's not
rule based so I can pretty much converse
in it in free form and to have the bot
understand my intent and do the task
that I set out to be okay so I know
you've got a great use case that you
wanted to show I'm going to just switch
screens here and perhaps if I don't know
if there's any setup you need to do in
your end but I'm just going to do that
and we can take it from there and you
can give us your demo sure
okay okay so this is basically what we
call the Oracle Arena chatbot auricular
and of course being the home of the
Golden State Warriors and the goal
really is here you know I am a customer
go warriors go for you so I'm a customer
here I've come in and I'm trying to get
I'm trying to get tickets but notice
what I'm going to say and I'm going to
say you know basically first thing of
course is I have to wake up the bots and
that's what I do as a hello and in the
bot the bot wakes up okay and so here I
am but but you know I'm looking to buy
tickets right but instead whatever I'll
do is I'm not going to say tickets
explicitly I'm going to say is there is
there a game that when is the next game
for example okay enter the bot you know
once once once I say all of that don't
worry I type a lot slower than this so
the bots thinking now and what comes up
basically saying that you know the next
game is on such a said it did and you
still have great deeds on ticket okay I
notice that the bots now figured out the
chances of me asking for a ticket are
fairly high and that's why I've come up
with the B instead of asking you do you
want to buy tickets and what did you
want to buy a ticket so I think we come
up come up with this I say okay yes at
this point yes I'm interested and again
here I just said yeah why I could have
said yeah I could have said yeah okay
I'm a different shot different shortcuts
but again the body is able to figure out
what my intent is the next step here is
I need you to provide a budget because
you know the bots need to know what the
operating parameters are okay so I give
it a number and let's say I say I say
$300 it's a bit high but you know but
everybody likes the Warriors too you
know so and the bots now it's been able
to go back go back to the different
back-end system come back come back with
good data on on the seats that are that
are available okay and I can then go and
you know scroll through this for example
I can then go and look through all these
feeds and finally I know I can I can I
can make a selection lecture I select
one one for Row three that's a fairly
good seat so I'm just going to go ahead
and and select a seat
right so now I could have I know I I can
just go ahead and confirm the
transaction but I what I want to show
here is that you know there are
different entry points in this in this
slow I can now go ahead and change my
change Mumbai I think I'm thinking ten
dollars is a lot of money it is I leave
me nothing at all to buy the food or
alcohol or beer or anything
exactly okay so I can then go ahead and
change my I'm going to change the vibe
and now what comes back again with a
different set of options so I can then
go you know which one would be like
right so again I'm going to go and
scroll through this understand I'm going
to pick a seat that's not that expensive
half as expensive okay so please not a
nosebleed yeah I hope it's still fairly
by yeah but if they can see the game
very importantly I'll have money left
over to for you know to - okay so for
that I can then go and confirm this now
this is where it gets interesting the
bot now asks me I'm a running short on
cash okay so clearly the bots know
something I don't
and so I say huh this is interesting the
bot survived years which is in fact true
I am in fact running short on cash as if
they don't have spent all three hundred
dollars at one shot that's why I refer
back to the bot and now this is where
the BOD can do some cross sells and
cross-sell and upsell basically figured
out and it's also how you keep your
customers happy you know it watch I'm a
longtime customer it just so happens I
don't want to spend all this time so I
come back the bot comes back and say hey
for fifty dollars more we can get the RC
VIP room XP so this to me sounds pretty
good you know maybe I might get a free
t-shirt as well right sure I could just
go ahead and
so before I go ahead and do that I want
to find out what kind of beer is enough
okay when I go ahead and splurge and
splurge the money there so again the
bars going to go and let's wait for this
to finish
here's the bottles come back to the
whole bunch of options right here again
what you can basically showing you is
that being able to integrate Rick for
example the Facebook perusal and come up
with all these because the example so I
look at all these things I think I think
this looks pretty good so I can then go
ahead add this to my queue - I activate
to my ticket order I say yes go ahead
and order it and now the box basically
got going to come back with you the
transaction when it comes like we did
with the cost 196 dollars like so saved
about $50 I said $200 or so and the
other cool thing is dr. shows how you
get integrated with the rapid wallet
okay so which means I'm not going to be
hunting in my email for this information
so I just say you have to go ahead go
ahead and generate it everything looks
good just go ahead and generate the big
wallet and so finally finally the last
part is going to come back and say yep
here you are and it basically I can then
go and add this to me
okay that's basically a very quick
run-through of the object lorina box and
showing you how you know should you
intend the condition my intent was to
buy a ticket it did that which showed
entity X extraction indicate years being
the seeds the offers and everything else
and finally the dialog flow as well
using the intent and the entity be able
able to construct a dialog flow and then
go to the backend application retrieve
all the information is come there if
it's presented to me and then complete
complete the transaction okay sounds
like a very exciting thing and the it's
always great to get a great deal yeah
all right great so if some of the
developers were either here or you know
watching through the live stream or
later onto YouTube
want to check out the chat bot and try
it out what's the best way for them to
do that if you go to audible.com slash
mobile
okay so are we having articles that come
/ mobile okay and if you're an MC s
customer today you'll able to get the
chat box
after that you can probably start using
it today oh wow okay all right okay well
see I really appreciate you coming out
coming down here and yeah let's I think
this is a very
citing space and the I think with all of
the advancements that are taking place
today I had some of the other speakers
on before and they were just talking
about Tesla's and cars and chaough parts
and I think it the future looks they're
very interesting and promising thank you
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
