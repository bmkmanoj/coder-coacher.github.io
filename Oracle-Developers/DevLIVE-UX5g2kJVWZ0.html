what I go by I'm the lead product
manager for Oracle Jets which is the
javascript extension toolkit and we're
here kind of to talk about a new release
that we just put out last week which is
pretty cool for us we've been open
source for about a year and a half now
somewhere around there about 70% of
Oracle's cloud public cloud is written
using jet and we've open sourced it for
the rest of the world and to use it as
well the newest release actually
implements some pretty cool stuff we've
taken all of our UI components and move
them over to custom elements so
following the html5 web components
effect yeah which is a really cool thing
for us and here we're gonna kind of talk
and pass it down to a couple other guys
that are showing how those components
and web components and so forth are
being used in the wild as well as what
other people are talking about jet here
at open open world java one open world
oracle code all those fun things that
we're doing while we're here take it
away John
perfect hey guys so I'm John sent from
fishbowl solutions I'm an Oracle ace and
I also head up the innovation side over
a fishbowl solutions so today what I'm
going to show you is how to create a
oracle jet app and how to create
composite components and take those
complicates the components and deploy
them not only to visual build a cloud
service but also expose it into other
applications that could be sitting on
SAS as well as maybe content experience
cloud on the past environment oh yeah
I'm not gonna do that No oh I think
you're gonna do yeah I'll do that after
room okay yeah well gets to answer the
video then okay so let's just start this
yeah we got okay so I just opened up the
command line is that plugged on and all
the way
yeah
just our gay yeah we're just showing
wallpaper right now it's a beautiful
mountain range if other others let's see
if it actually switches over again if
you can imagine nope nope don't get that
flickering thing again we're trying if
we just accept it's not showing any Oh
well we are live that's pretty good yeah
we just proved we're live
you haven't same issues as me on my
laptop when I turned up my he's doing
something
now we can see something that right yeah
but it's locked up okay won't we just
have a conversation tell us what you
what you're working on
Carolyn introduce yourself maybe John
can talk without trying to fix this we
could do that too sure let's switch back
to life
there we go we're back to us so what is
it I understand they're a fishbowl just
won some kind of an award yeah we did we
won the CX hackathon so I think I don't
know 50 people attended it was at the
Capgemini Innovation Center here in San
Francisco and basically we're invited to
the Capgemini offices to do Tuesday
hackathons finally on Friday we had a
group of five developers and Oracle
basically let us loose on BEC wild
platform so things like engagement cloud
their mobile cloud platform and then we
did a little bit of fancy stuff with
Zeppelin and Big Data cloud service to
do machine learning from certain any of
that we did not used yet we actually
used slack as our chat interface so we
created a bot okay but what I want to do
and that what I hope to do is we'll
expose the bar in the in a jet client
that you guys will see today and then we
have full control over their UI elements
that's very cool yeah so we now have the
screen up and rolling let's once you
show some some code cool okay so come
online you see I'm just gonna I'm
running node 8.4 and I'm just going to
install the article jet combine like
tools so just standard NPM and this will
just go through install all the
dependencies for Oracle jet so in the in
the previous version of jet you had to
install like two or three different
libraries or four different libraries is
all done in one thing now right yeah
that's exactly I said before you had one
gulp and gee oh man yeah bunch of stuff
and now it's all all in one command line
very cool and and also in the past you
always had to talk about
relevant for medium to advanced
JavaScript developers because I had to
know all these different tools and now
it you just need to know one tool that's
right yeah and it really brings the
Royal Prince jet to a whole new range of
developers exactly yeah so as part of
the Oracle check come online you can see
here load of tasks and so one of the
things instead of running all of those
tools I just now have a single command
line to run so for example if I want to
create an app which I'm going to do here
all I need to do is go Oh jet create and
then the app name so I'm just going to
call that my app one out and then I'm
also going to specify a template and
there's five default templates out of
the box but you can also go ahead and
create your own template if you want
within the organization so you can reuse
and create multiple projects across the
organization if you go to Oracle jet org
and you click on the get started button
it'll give you those exact steps I think
it's like four steps and you're off and
running it out that's it so what's
happening now we're just creating our
new project it's just loading in
downloading the dependencies creating
the folder structure they'll be able to
freeze here
there we go
excellent so your apps now created and
what we're going to do is just CD into
the my app directory and this is my
project file folder now so this is a
list of files and folder structures it's
create it's part of the project so if I
go into my app you can see we've got the
node module so all there as part of that
you can see we've got oracle chat and
the two linked subsets and now what's
even more what's interesting is really
cool is that we have access to the build
and serve capabilities so what we can do
if I run around Oracle jet build I can
customize this script and this script
will run as part of the build so if I
want to move files across to a different
location or from one of the compression
of just ocation minification change the
requirejs configuration I can do that
all straight from the script file
and then the source folder again that's
to let all of your static web assets
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to serve that startup so just running
Oracle serve and what that's going to do
is it's going to set up your web server
open up the port copy the files from
your source directory to your web
location and then it's automatically
going to launch a browser so there you
can see the project but then you can
start developing at real time so anytime
you make changes in the source location
it's going to make that change straight
across in there in the UI browser
element so here's your job Oracle jet
project so your application is almost
finished
it's amazing how badly finished they're
ready to be sold to the customer you can
see it's responsive here so go
responsive navigation again this is all
Oracle jet that you're seeing today
right so now I'm going to move into how
we can actually create a composite
component so a user interface element or
an application based on a custom node
element that you create within a Dom
structure so here you can see we've got
this a demo card interface and it's
great to create a composite component
it's just made up of these five files so
we've got a loader which basically loads
in all of the assets associated to your
composite app we've got your view your
view model for your events event
bindings and then your style for the
skinning of your component right so if
we just go into the page you can see
here that we've got the demo card set up
and as part of that demo card there are
custom attributes and these are custom
attributes allow you to bind data sets
against so if I go into the demo j/s
you'll see I've got an array of objects
so we've got two objects there and you
can see above that I've got two cards
that are automatically generated on the
fly if we have another object you would
have another demo card automatically
generated as part of the looping and all
you can see here's the view model and
they basically this is the structure of
the demo card and then we've got the
v-model j/s which is your events
associated to the template so for
example the flip card here we've got
your quick event
and against that basically when you
click on that card it's going to toggle
the CSS so that animation that you're
seeing happening backwards and forwards
is just CSS doing a transition on that
Dom element and no JavaScript in that
just straight-up CSS enemy yeah all that
it's just CSS so this is a loader file
so this is where I actually load in all
my required compose composite component
files and they register it against
Oracle jet as demo card
okay so what we're going to do is create
our first composite container we call in
and it's going to be a chat application
integrated with mobile cloud enterprise
so I'm just going to copy a custom
images and these are just to help the
look and feel of the console application
I'm just going to put that in my source
folder and then I'm going to copy across
Frank bot which is our composite app and
you can see it's made up of five
different files here your loader your
view your view model and your component
properties
there we go so we just copy and Frank
bot so now that's part of the project
but we need to tie it tie him into a
page so what I'll do now is I'll go into
the view model and we'll update the
about page so we're going to about
we'll update the v-model here and we'll
all we need to do at this point is
reference the loader JS file and then
that will import based on the routine
based on as soon as you click on the
about page it loads up this about GS and
then you can see all of the items in the
defiant locks it makes sure that they're
already preloaded into a site so what
should happen is Frank Bart and the
loader script will load and the
composite component will be registered
all along the flight
now what we also need to do is obviously
supply that Dom element so we're just
going to add Frank buck to the Dom here
on the about paid and then what we'll do
is refresh we'll reserve the assets ill
create the web folder and we should be
able to see Frank bar and interact with
MCS on the fly and you'll notice here
I'm not applying any attributes and
there are some customer Massachusetts
which I'll come and cut across when we
show the visual builder cloud service so
I'm just going to stir this so they set
up this application whilst this is all
happening I'm just going to take a look
at the code and just run through some of
the code elements on here
so you got the loader here again that
loader loads up your view loads up your
view model loads up your component
properties and loads up your and CSS
your styling your skin file so that's
all pretty much in line with the html5
web component specifications right yeah
yep and then we've got the Oracle jet
way of registering your composite
component
now if you take a look at properties
you'll see that I've got custom
properties that allow me to dynamically
change the interface so the view layer
so I've hard coded some elements you can
see we've got a value there which is
pointed to my WebSocket server to Frank
but I can also change the chatbots name
so at the moment we've got a hint set as
Frank we also got an image there so you
can see images Frank and you should see
once we load up this project that that
props reference to that bar image will
automate automatically be applied to the
image source so there you can see that
we've got the binding there when we go
across to here hit about and that's our
composite component so Frank boy is
ready to for us to interact with but
before we interact with Frank let's just
have a look at some of the template and
capabilities so if I scroll down to the
bottom you can see we've got our
template here and what I've done is I
bounded an observable array so anytime
there's a message posted its editor an
array item and ultimately generates on
the UL a few interface here and then
we've got this oracle jet input text
where i've got a value change handler as
part of the eventing on that so as
you're typing that thing is going to be
triggered so if we just scroll down and
we'll just take a quick look at the
method there that's just a simple method
where we test for the event
make sure the Enter key is hit and as
soon as you use a hit sign Enter key
it's going to take the value and it's
going to post that straight through to
our web socket server and then that
message is going to be passed across to
our intelligent chat bot on the Oracle
cloud so that means that you've set up
before all of this a chat bot on the
Arado very intelligent bot Cloud Servers
yep running so in application cloud
container we've gone nodejs platform
with a WebSocket server
we're messaging that and then that's
messaging ID UCS to process the language
and then coming back so what this is is
purely a front-end view on top of that
chat bot exact
but it just makes it so much much more
flexible compared to Facebook compared
to slack compare the weekly chat because
we can define our own user interface
elements so we can make it a lot more
flexibility with Facebook on slack
you're limited to what they provide out
of the box so what we've got here is at
the visual be little cloud service and
I'm just going to actually import that
composit component so all I need to do
there is zip up those five files and
import them into this visual builder
cloud service and then I've got my
confident component available in VB cs2
to reuse and potentially when the
marketplace is available I can sell this
very easily to our clients our clients
can look at a marketplace ago I want
that component I want that with you I
want that widget and they can then drag
and drop and create their own
application on the fly and this is also
because that web component concept makes
possible a marketplace yeah and and also
the nice thing is that each of these
these composite components are found
within their own folder so you can zip
up that folder and share that zip file
with other developers and they can then
reuse those components in their own
applications exactly I have access to
the source here so they can change the
source they can reload refresh and if
you're not a developer you have a list
of properties available on the
right-hand side so you can see it for
example we've got the chapel name as
Frank but I could change that to
something else like Bob so if I just do
that now you'll see when I make that
change the properties file it will
automatically change Frank's name to Bob
so this is an this is an environment for
so called citizen developers and
non-technical people and you as a
technical coach oriented developer can
create components that can be loaded
into this environment and added to the
pellets so that that citizen developer
can use that to create applications yeah
anything yeah a dashboard if you want
whatever quickly dragging and dropping
an application together and back-end
services and those kinds of things when
we can also take these web components or
these composite components and actually
mash them up so you can have nested
doughnuts and you say like that the card
the flip card you were seeing earlier if
you actually go up to the jet website in
the cookbook you'll see that we take
that flip card and we embed it into a
memory game so someone created the card
with all the flipping animation and we
actually said well let's take those
cards and turn them into a memory game
and you can pass in an array of the
different images and we do all the
matchup logic and everything else for
now you got an entire game that goes in
is one Dom element and you're done it's
pretty cool I think that makes it
possible to create really complex views
of components nested within other
components and correcting complex
relationships of underlying data models
yeah
so I also noticed one thing John you're
running on on jet 3/2 in this in this
instance and that's fine you know jet
for oh just came out last Friday or last
Wednesday actually it was the five files
that you created to create your
composite and everything that you kind
of wrote manually or maybe you copied
them over from the cookbook yep now in
four zero just as you created that
entire starting project you just type oh
jet create Oh jet space create space
component and give it a name and we
generate that entire thing for you all
five of those files filled in with
default entries and they just go into
modify them so you have to set up that
stuff anymore with send we set up for
you now and for oh that and that's
perfect I mean I think I was gonna
actually email one of you guys and say
hey I'm this actually a hands-on lab on
the oracle jet sites where anyone
interested in learning how to do web
components from the command line on the
command line correct web components in a
JavaScript based application can learn
how to do that
very cool can we switch back to serving
as stare at our smiling little faces so
carry on you've been kind of wandering
around the floor a bit you've been
attending quite a few different sessions
and so forth what are you seeing as far
as you know what's going on with web
components
what's going on with even from the
fishbowl side I've seen fishbowl
interacting with a couple of different
other partners as well such as like
we're a player that's actually using jet
but also you've seen in the the jet
space out there well not only here but
around the world I've been to a number
of different conferences visiting a
number of different customers what
people like about jet is the data
visualization components the graphs and
the charts free open source you can drag
and drop them into your application in
the sense of copying and pasting them
from a cookbook so there's a cookbook
all the code for all the components for
other graphs and charts for the samples
of those are available there you can
literally copy and paste from there into
your application so the data
visualization combined with the cookbook
the other thing that is really
appreciated
is this command-line interface makes it
so easy to set up an application and to
add to that application so for example I
think what's very nice is you can create
a web application and a Java a desktop
browser application in jet and then
later think well maybe this should be
nice as a hybrid application I'd like to
upload this application I've curated to
an app store and not simply have a
responsive application but have a apk
file iOS file and you can just run the
command-line tool against your
application and add that hybrid folder
and and that functionality to it so so
that and the fact that all of this is
open source and it and also that it's
based on open source libraries so the
libraries in there are not things that
Oracle was created Oracle's mainly
leveraging the knowledge that is out
there in the industry then suggests more
of a toolkit than a framework absolutely
and that is really maybe the most
important feature of jet because people
who adopt frameworks which are moral is
closed
ecosystems have a real problem as the
JavaScript ecosystem changes and if
there's one thing that can be said about
the JavaScript ecosystem is that it is
innovative and constantly changing so
the most important thing you can have if
you're going to go in that direction is
an architecture that it's flexible and
that is what jet gives you a flexible
architecture yet very well organized and
very well structured that combination is
the most important thing to have in the
JavaScript ecosystem and you get it out
of the box by running a command line to
code jet I think that's about it Melissa
I you were a great conversationalist
thank you so much for leading us through
all this sorry guys we just kind of took
over didn't we did that's what we do any
anything else you'd like us to cover
you'd like to have people follow or any
blogs where so blogs or Twitter accounts
guys Twitter for Jed is at Oracle jet
we'd love to have you come and follow us
it's where we do all of our
announcements and we're actually so if
anybody's out there listening to us that
has already written an Oracle jet app
we're doing a little Where's Waldo this
week and there's a hashtag called where
is jet hashtag where is jet and throw
that in front of a screenshot of your
app and put it up on Twitter for us so
we're kind of sharing those I'm finding
them around the conference and so forth
and it's been fun it's been one of the
most enjoyable experiences well
yesterday I was at the Oracle jet booth
and I was explaining to somebody what
about jet this is jet this is what it
does he said yeah sure I have an
application that uses jets and he pulled
out his laptop when you showed the
application and we made a picture of it
put it on Twitter and everything so it's
it's getting out there it's a it's a
it's a new concept it's widely used
throughout Oracle so this is a really
good thing as well that the JavaScript
ecosystem is constantly changing the
libraries you choose today could be gone
next month whereas the the libraries
we've chosen as part of this toolkit are
stable reliable and we are based on top
of them and we're contributing back to
them as well so this is a really solid
basis for anyone doing service
Enterprise work
and yourself John where you had on
Twitter and Facebook and other places so
I'm head over to our fishbowl site
fishbowl solutions.com
we've got loads of information on chat
boards whew let's check out a blog I
often post there and my twitter handle
is Jay Asim underscore UI X that's I'm
Matt pepper check personally and you are
at taking double you figure out how to
spell that it's not that hard it's not
that I don't know all right thanks
everyone
all right thank you Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
