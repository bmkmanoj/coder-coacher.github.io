bruised Anzio again from Oracle code and
Bengal err and I'm here with with Ramesh
tena from Oracle yes Jim welcome thank
you what do you do at Oracle so I am
part of organization we call SDC sales
consulting central we are part of the
larger cells consulting recon Seco
systems in oral and I particularly part
of I asked him infrastructure is service
and we help eme I an epic customers for
our cloud solutions and engineer systems
and cloud customers so that's what
primarily I do and my focus right now is
in infrastructure service ok are you
based here in Bangalore I'm based out of
Bangalore ok great now I notice you have
a session later on today yes that's very
true Jim I have a session at 3 p.m. in
the media on a topic of infrastructure
is code infrastructure is code that's
the term I haven't heard what is that
term yes
so infrastructure is God is essentially
means that your infrastructure whatever
you want to build
that's provision modifying and
terminating is instead of interactive or
you know a script based you do it now in
a machine readable text file right so
what it means is that you know you
really do execution very fast and
because it's machine readable it's it's
kind of automation you are achieving so
that's in sharp contrast to what it used
to happen in the past and what it
happens now so it's it just provides
that flexibility to the community ok
great so a couple of things I want to
actually flush out here in terms of how
this helps customers how this helps
developers most importantly developers
is this like increasing efficiency is
this a better tool for them to use
has helped them do new applications okay
so customers and developers very true
Jim so I will give it in two part so
essentially what happens that when we
have these configuration files so one
thing is that you know it just gives you
a agility that execution is very fast
that's number one you can do things
consistently repeatability right so
you'd give a consistent repeatability is
an important things when you do what
used to happen earlier is that you know
a one that minister to do its own way
the other administrator or the other
developers will do it only way so that
used to give a problem so that's been
the fixed in our infrastructure is code
it also gives you because it's the one
source of truth it gives you a
standardization right and and along with
all this benefit if if if developer
wants to now spin up an additional
servers it gives them the extensibility
so current infrastructure you want to
add you just change the texture file and
then you run it and you have added the
more infrastructure so that's it gives
the extensibility now is easy where it
sounds much simpler much simpler yes now
looking at the other angle it also helps
in a DevOps so in a DevOps what happens
that you know when developers and
operations teams are working together
and developer wants to say release a new
feature fast so that's where it hurts
so now developers can also consume
whatever the operations teams has
written these know ready code to spin up
these new infrastructure they can simply
consume it the linkage of you know
dependency of the developers on the
operations teams and administration team
is broken so they can really move fast
to really staying competitive winner in
business context now it also means that
you know developers can now do a version
control of these configurations which
has been codified right and and along
with that they can now use all the
DevOps principles for examples code
review if if it is applicable they can
now do automated testing right or false
release management
so all these things which was earlier
not possible because it was done
manually orbit was it was done
interactively is now made possible for
them so when this principle applies to
DevOps principle so you know it's a
win-win for both developers as well as
operations so that's how do you not we
are empowering the developers with this
infrastructure as code and it's just
really helping so they so are they
embracing this or they even aware of it
at this point yes so it's like this that
you know many have started their journey
right but still these concepts is
relatively new right it's a relatively
new but it's speaking of the there is a
eagerness to not really put it into the
practice in the customers environment so
people are in that learning curves they
want to know more they want to find out
how they can use these in Oracle public
cloud if they have bought the really are
able to put it into practice is this is
this is this technology or a process
that's been used in other areas and it's
coming to India or is it really starting
here is there so is there a region
involved here in terms of like a
geography are more developers involved
with this here than in other areas so in
its it's a global principles of
infrastructure is called but what
happens is that India as in a large
development community we have a very
large Oracle community in specific and
lots of large companies are you know
operating from India so that way lots of
developers are sitting here in you know
the IT hubs of India like Bangalore
Hyderabad Chennai so they are really a
good to put it into practice right now
how was work or implementing is know for
its customers absolutely right questions
so what we in Oracle are doing is that
right we are providing a certain native
tools as well as you know external tools
so we partner with so say open source
provider like Hershey coves terraform
right so Oracle has extended a support
to the terraform now what
it means is that if somebody just
downloads the terraform Oracle public
cloud Oracle cloud infrastructure Class
C is already you know in a tier 1
partner of aterna form so it's out of
the you know a box for terraform so they
can download the telephone and use it
against the OCI classic to really spin
up in a fast the OC a classic
infrastructure that's the OCI classic
but then Oracle has also providing orko
provider for or C I it is our ban metal
infrastructure cloud infrastructure so
that's also in a minimal you know we are
providing through our DITA so after
downloading Tara form a community or the
developers can download this Oracle
provider plugin for OC I and just start
using it in practice now this is our
compute storage and networking what they
can achieve with this is that you know
all the software-defined networking Sdn
they can really codify into this
configuration script not only that this
is just the I aspire but we do support
recently we provided a support for you
know past services as well so all can
all customers can now use a terraform
for our past service such as DBC is
jesse a's etc as well now this is we are
talking of a external tool but then
naturally Oracle also provides a tool
for our OC a classic customers we call
it stack manager now what his tech
manager is that you know are you can how
dependable or having a dependency
between your multiple services for
example you have a Java cloud service
which depends on your difficult day
under this cloud service and database
cloud service depends on you know the
object storage container so when you
want to have these depended services you
can define it into a template which is a
yama template and using our stack
manager you can just spin up so this is
our internal tool and and if we look at
the broad spec
from of infrastructure discord now
terraform and spec manager sits on top
of the table but if we really you know
understand him in a broad context so
Oracle also provides a vast support in
its CLI a REST API so we provide a CLI
support for OCI or CI classic and our
past services so customers can use even
a CLI also which are very friendly and
provides support for our compute storage
and networking and past services so lots
of tools Oracle provides - for customers
to implement in put it into practice the
infrastructure as code and derive the
you know business benefit of agility
cost reduction and risk management and
risk reduction great well
Umesh thank you very much for coming by
I appreciate that and you guys out there
this session is at 3 o'clock to learn
more about infrastructure as code thank
you so much Jim and thanks for having me
thanks for sharing Thanks thank you bye
and we'll be back soon with more
conversations about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
