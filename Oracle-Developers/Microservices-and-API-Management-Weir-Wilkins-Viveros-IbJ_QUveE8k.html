you live from the developer lounge here
at the intersection of Java 1 and Oracle
OpenWorld I'm Bob brew Bart with the
Oracle developer community and in this
this segment we're gonna be talking
about API management and about modern
software architecture so I'm gonna let
these gentlemen introduce themselves so
yeah hello my name is Sir Toby barrows
I'm from Mexico based in Oslo Norway and
yeah I like these guys introduce
themselves as well my name is Luis we're
a match he parked in Capgemini UK I
lived in the UK for I'm actually from
Venezuela and then I'm a named API
evangelist as well and an Oracle ice I'm
working with a lot of wife has an API so
Louis I want to direct the first
question to you because you're at this
event you seem to be mister API you're
speaking in four different sessions at
open world right you've you've already
got one book out this is in 2015 that
was actually on a different Oracle
plotter yeah product but implementing
API management through that product
you've got two books in the works now
that are on API man yeah that's right
why I know you're a middleware guy going
way back and you've and you you've
written and talked and presented about
service-oriented architecture why this
passion about API management well it's
like everything we wanted to accomplish
and so now we are accomplishing it's
like we went back to basics and now
api's our own students buy the business
if you google for example eBay API
program or developer program you see the
CEO of eBay talking about API how cool
is that
rewind five seven years people no one
got it it was a boss everyone one
develop services the benefits were
around yeah service-oriented
architecture is a silver bullet blah
blah blah but in reality tangibly we
didn't see the benefits realizing as we
can see an API API created an economy so
so what still actually the principle of
service-oriented architecture are pretty
much rock-solid it's just a different
way to talk about it it's a different
different implementation of style but
you know the transition was for me very
natural it was a it's been a journey and
it's been great and and I just think
people get it and I love talking about
it because people get it so so that's
probably the reason or maybe because I'm
a geek and I just like it what drew you
into this not too different from Louis's
story when when we were working with
Sarah and we got killed by the over
complexity of the technologies an API is
really encapsulate that the real value
proposition of abstraction and service
thinking and it's so much simpler to
achieve that we can deliver now against
some of the ideas that we've been trying
to achieve for 10 15 maybe even 20 years
but that simplicity of abstraction of
contract and so you don't have to
understand how something's being built
you as long as you understand the
contract you just call the service the
API and magic happens
even if that means that's a little robot
running around in the background
well said man yeah Arturo you're a so a
guy from way back what's your interest
in API management yeah I think with
Lewis particularly we've been talking
for a while and I think since two or
three years ago we agreed and when you
are suspected that API management was
going to become a big in the near future
and he said that we are seeing that it's
materializing we are watching we
fertilize this like new generation or as
he has put it the third generation of AP
ice which we have to work with so so
yeah I mean you cannot even though the
the principles of service and there's an
hour of course still valid but you
cannot stay in the past with this
technology to it you have to provide to
the customers value with with all these
new ways and new paradigms of doing
things and and designing software
effectively economy we know it's true we
know companies are profiting on that we
know a lot of services that are
available to us are given to API
services so interesting talk about
opportunities for developers in
developing api's if they're not already
taking an interest in that particular
field why should they well ap is our
valued to the business right it's very
simple but more than that if you combine
api's with other architecture styles
like micro services for example you
deliver more flexibility and agility
right which means that you can create
modern business solutions write quicker
in a market that's been you know pushed
very very heavily by disruptors and in
the startups right so and all these
comes if you rewind it all comes from
you know the likes of next describe this
guy that created these architectures
that could scale because you know
internet was their audience right and
and it has to support a global audience
right and and these architectures are
now cascading down right people are
adopting them but as Adrian Cocteau said
who was from from Netflix and now he's a
VP in Amazon he said you know speed wins
in the marketplace and these type of
architectures are helping you also gain
speed so if you are a developer right
the techniques that the approaches are
so cool because you know you know you're
not constrained to a monolithic platform
you can choose I mean within the range I
have my you know I have my own views on
on how flexible polygons you should be
bored but nevertheless you know you have
more options to create stuff in
different languages right you can create
these services there
or atomic and in the glow of all right
and easy to scale you can use containers
I mean the technology is there to be
used and there's so many options now
which in a way is really really
interesting but on the other hand from
an architectural perspective it's also
important to to understand what is it
that we're doing and what is the role of
each technology with an architectural
landscape so Archer oh you're nodding
vigorously I think as a developer that
the nice things about API management is
that it really it really allows you to
bring together the design with the
implementation in a way that wasn't
possible before and what I mean is yeah
you always can do like a great
assignment and in paper it looks great
and the architecture looks right but
it's sometimes it's difficult to
translate it to an equally great
implementation you know and this has
always been like a proposition of so for
example like design first approach but
we weren't quite there yet for the past
few years and now with API management we
can finally achieve this you know you
can design great ap Isis for example
with apiary blueprints and swaggered is
this definition languages and it will go
hand by hand with the way this API is
are functioning you know and the way
your API consumers are really
experiencing that
you're providing so I can flora
developer that's that's yes I think
developers have been working with API is
not necessarily associated their idea if
you go back 20 30 40 years ago P I was
kind of we agreed a file format and I'll
give you a file with a goomar great
structure that was a kind of API in a
very very primitive form we've got to a
stage now where we can try and describe
very easily very lightweight in an API
first style mindset you know if I give
you this you can do that and I'll do
this and we can work collaboratively but
the same time develop independently
which is really how a team becomes very
effective either in delivering a small
component together or delivering
separate components that want to be
reused across multiple solutions let's
explore that a little bit api's have
been around for a while
how do in what other ways do today's
api's differ from the api's of way back
fill so the different scenarios is that
we've got a lightweight way of
describing it through standards that
have evolved so that the not overweight
we used to use whatever is doing things
like that which was so complicated and
you'd spend the hours just grafting away
in some design tool now you've got a
very lightweight very easy form through
swagger and API blueprint using tools
like a fury during an Oracle case to
quickly graft and demonstrate and
document the API
yes I have a very good answer so so from
my point of view I think API are just
becoming I've said before an enterprise
asset so now they are accessible right
and in that's point number one
but port number two and I complement
what Phil said of developer experience
right in the past we used to develop
api's well we used to call them web
services right well inside out so we use
a standard total US web services
standard try with soap and with those
and etc and then interpreting that
weasel was like you couldn't you have to
you know know four different standards
to interpret just a wizard right you
have to know xst you have to understand
the wisdom notation if you watch our
piece encoded or PC literal token little
document coded and all these types and
then you have that it was a very
complicated you know way to model an
endpoint now in the API world you don't
have one standard you have a few right
but these standards were created by
developers like to make it easier for
them to interpret what the endpoints are
so it's a different from the start right
the approach has being okay let's create
stuff
if endpoints that we can consume and
let's use these languages to make it
easier for us to understand what the
endpoints are and in what you know what
resources expose right and in what what
do I need to send it what do I need to
get right very simple stuff right and
that makes API so a lot more usable and
if IPS are usable they're going to be
embedded in more for applications right
and the more this happens right the more
eco systems you create and the beauty of
this whole thing is that the ecosystems
are not within an organization anymore
the ecosystems are b2b b2c add to our
machine to machine and all pieces in
there will be our API so it's just
mind-blowing the the hyper connectivity
that has been enabled via API and of
course one thing is api's and all things
API management APN management is the
managing of all the same points because
you can imagine that you can end up with
a hyper connect to connectivity mess
right and putting some sort of
lightweight governance to make sure that
this you have visibility over those
endpoints work who is consuming water
and things like the DPR and all the
security compliance issues is important
that you also have you could you can
manage and embed to the strong security
right so so if you a management as a
discipline right is it introduced it
capabilities right to make sure that
that all the API is that you build don't
end up into our more complicated or more
complication story to the enterprise so
I think extended early will be more in
your question but yes yeah for me I mean
answering to your question one of the
big differences in API is before and now
is that in the past if you go develop an
API it would impact probably only the
developers trying to use it you know
that specific community of developers
now the impact on the week it's much
much bigger for example if you develop
an API it's gonna impact both the
business the customers the end-users
several developer communities even
outside of your organization and even
the revenue streams which is part of
this API economy stuff so yeah it's it's
it's become so much more relevant
it has a very big impact in everything
that we are the developer the
dependencies are far-reaching and that's
that that is why also the world of the
term is out there much more than here
before it was like a developer world and
now it's a
let's shift gears for a moment the three
of you gentlemen are involved in a
project called the open modern
enterprise software architecture talk
about that project to talk about its
origins and where it is now Louise
very good question it started last year
in open world on the back of a
presentation I did on API and API so
micro-services I you know at the time
it's actually just been a year ago and
it feels like 10 years ago you know that
that past everything is evolving right
it's like I came up with this
architecture trying to join both the old
and the new right so okay you have micro
services for your services right you
still have all the type of services that
maybe I'm not so the kaput but but there
are services at the end of the day but
then how do you marry that into an
enterprise type of reusable asset but
then not all api's are usable you're
creating an API for mobile devices in a
mobile backend MCS to use a an Oracle
product for example right how does
everything everything hang together
what capability you need so I did this
capability model right which I've shared
in a few presentations right but it kind
of the feedback was so positive right
and how you normal unfortunate he's not
really know the world from Accenture I
came to me said Luis I think we should
take it to the next level I think we
should you know I would like to use your
content in some of my projects and how
do you know less this will you be
interested in opening up at the project
right and then with all the race
directors a Dani law and Spain and
Torsten they were also born said yeah
when I use it to later I want to
contribute and then Arturo so wooden
board in Rolando and then it's like all
of the same Lucas as well and then it's
like all the sudden everyone wanted to
contribute to it and in well basically
what I did is that you just open sourced
if you can open source a powerful deck
but that's what happened right the
thinking was all the source right so so
we all could contribute to it and then
in in a split in the partner community
forum we all got together and we can oh
would set out a goal to create our a
proper
tomorrow that we could polish stronger
and then very quickly we decided where
to put it or not you created a portal
for us in the in the Oracle developer
community side which Muse but then say
well it helps probably easier so at the
end we ended up producing some content
which is now available no mess at Ohio
that that everyone's contributing to you
and everyone can use in your own
projects and your own organization and
it helps it helps because it's kind of
bringing some structure into an area
that's moving very fast and it's very
easy as well to get it wrong and that is
view if you may see a counter side of so
much cool stuff that's out there that
you can very easily they start using
absolutely everything right deliver
quickly well then you can end up with a
lock silo solution solo the enterprise
then that that's also not good right so
there has to be a balance I know Mesa
helps you put you know concepts right
around the capabilities and then be able
to construct act you know the try fact
architecture right but also innovate so
that's kind of my two cents on the
Meritor you've been really active in law
a masive recently talked about what
you've been doing I think for me I am
quickly what loses this idea I thought
it was great and really needed and one
good thing is see I've been contributing
but also using this in my own project
for my company to spread with very good
with very good experiences a very good
whistles why because this will provides
a lot of value right out of right out of
the gates there's a lot of knowledge
very good knowledge about the API is
about my concern
is about decoupling service-orientation
out there but it's very scattered you
know and when you take on a project a
challenge in the hybrid diesel
transformation project you need to
justify a lot of decisions you need to
find the right capabilities we need to
talk to the stakeholders to the
architects and you cannot tell to them
just yeah I'll go looking to Martin
college definition I will give you the
link you know or go look into this
PowerPoint deck because that's a good
conversation to have here and there's
nothing that I have found so far in the
web or in the community that that really
put something together that really lets
you pick a common language mess is just
that we are not trying to invent the
wheel or anything we're just building
upon the good stuff that is there we are
yeah providing some new terms and some
new ideas but
like reading together a lot of
technologies making it easier for for
both architects and developers we even
have a smaller than notation language
like radical Y annotation which you can
use and I've been using it and it's
people have actually because it's simple
different
it really makes life easier I think it
has great potential skillets are working
for us we have we have made strides but
we still we have a lot of people very
brightened to the cause so yeah I think
this yeah in a year it's it's grown a
lot but I think you can still grow very
much it can be used by by many people
and that is fill what sort of trouble
are you getting into with Oh Mesa so
I've not done so much of the writing the
documentation
I've more been the critical eye and
challenging the guys to say well how
does this work in this scenario and
bring in the experiences that I've had
to the table to say well what what does
it mean when we actually come to realize
it is that it's great to have these
reference architectures but they need to
be practical as well and we're world and
that's one of the nice things about a
message is grounded it recognizes not a
lot of organizations that have got these
monolithic systems even the the babies
of the micro service world are going to
have some big back-end systems that do
their accounting why would you rebuild
that so it's been very much okay so my
contributions Ben look at it how does
that relate to real world stories that
I've seen and worked with and have we
ticked all the boxes very easy to get
caught up with the noise fangled new
technologies you know API is things like
that but there's some really tedious
details that we can't escape compliance
security all of those style questions
and it's like we tick those boxes it in
this model and I've helped the guys then
just to start to flesh out some of the
ideas and terminology that we've put in
you know you know one cool thing I
remember in this fleet we decided not to
use the term micro service we called it
semi D COBOL service in fully decouple
service as micro service right and then
we saw these a podcast with yourself in
a
in a preacher Nicholson Richard
Nicholson freeze reaches I was there are
we talking about him all the time and I
did a possibly I don't know why crossed
anyways we preach Richardson in and I
he's saying there's no such thing as a
microphone right right and they were
like whoa school it's like you know very
common thinking and I mentioned to you
that I met him how the deflection
meeting Amina in a Beijing I was in the
Oracle virgin in Oracle : Sydney and we
had a nice excursion and and it's a
local I mean you know some of these
patterns are actually been referenced in
domains as well so so yeah it's been a
very fruitful project and there's a lot
more work to be done and and of course
you're we're all very busy in the
proteasome but we all contribute to it
so it's looking good and that and that
content is is publicly available at ome
Shi oh yeah that's right okay great
I've one final question and I want it
directed to to fill and to Arturo why
didn't you guys wear suits now you're
teasing gentlemen thanks so much for
stopping by taking the time to talk
about about API management and about a
Mesa this is great stuff I hope people
will check it out and you should also
check out developer Oracle calm where
you'll find all sorts of great content
for developers for the diff Oracle
developer community I'm Babu Bart thanks
