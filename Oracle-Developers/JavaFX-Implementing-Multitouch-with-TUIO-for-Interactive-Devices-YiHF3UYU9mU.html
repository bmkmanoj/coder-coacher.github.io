from columbia and i'm here to show you
how it is possible to connect your by
effects with with some multi-touch
technology some the years did are
present on most multi touch devices
today nowadays right so let's start
talking about how we can use your by fax
to develop software for interactive
devices multi touch devices using the
two-wheel protocol it does a special
protocol that we are going to talk a
little bit later e why javafx will be a
good alternative in some context yeah
that's right in some some scenarios are
very good for use you have effects on
those applications we also are going to
talk about different technologies there
connect gestures and detect movements
from the user allows interaction without
touching like the fields leap motion and
many others you might know how those new
technologies could be easily integrated
into javafx yeah okay at the end I'm
going to show you a little demo and a
video of a real-life application of this
technology as a company is marvis a
company where I come from we are seeing
a big demand of interactive devices and
we are not talking just about cell
phones or-or eps device on all of them
we're talking we're talking about big
interactive devices in places like
museums parks and many others so right
now we are building a lot a lot of them
my English is not so perfect from I want
to apologize if I made a mistake okay
and the effects supports multi-touch in
many of its implementations but
it don't come with support for the to
your protocol so if we try to run yeppa
effects on an environment where the
input from for the multi-touch is
different we are going to have some
trouble so that's what we created we
created a liar that connects to your
protocol with javafx and i'm going to
show you how well creating creating some
interactive devices we get to the same
problem that many developer have that is
the graphical user interface problem how
can I make a pretty graphical user
interface how can I ruin it on many
devices many environment without without
making it a big problem that's right and
this is a little bit cooperation and the
old-fashioned awt and the new javafx how
the change is big and now does these are
some modern graphical user interfaces
they're almost all of us are we are we
it is normal for us right now almost all
everybody has a smartphone with this new
this new kind of graphical user
interfaces add the the other side at the
left there is an example of how it's
supposed a week oh we can room this kind
of interfaces on over javafx that's the
idea so when the effects could be the
right choice is not perfect so it
depends what you want to do if you need
extremely high performance where
worldwide I don't recommend recommend
you have effects sometimes even we will
use something like see an OpenGL to
develop this particular applications but
in almost all the cases were where the
you need a pretty interface and
it's not really heavy the other FX is a
very good choice for all the resources
oh my no we can call one and run
everywhere or almost everywhere and all
that all of that things that will that
make us love Java we can see if we are
developing interactive devices we
immediately get the problem of where I'm
going to run to run my application how
I'm going to create it on which
processor is going to run with Java and
Java facts we jump all those problems
and it makes easy development is he
testing we can develop on an egg on a
normal computer even a mac and run it
directly on beaming and modern devices
like raspberry p and etc during there
are many traditional approach and how
multi-touch is handled those are some
examples of the most common is is the
projected capacitive it is what is used
on most Android and iPhone technologies
those are you to ATMs GPS devices I
smartphones on or everyday life and also
there are some new sensors for human
machine interaction may you might know
some of them may Microsoft Kinect and
leap motion any of you here before a
fluid motion yes that does that's very
cool I've been trying it for a few days
so it today suppose there is not
possible to integrate these technologies
with ya by affects their why i'm going
to show you is it now it can be done
that's right even there is a new
software that may help you two with a
simple key net and any projection system
you can turn any wool into up
surface it detects where your hand is
and what you are trying to do and
becomes that a touch surface a touch
screen that's very cool because now we
can bring touch screens or total surface
to any place that before we can we call
not how it works well well that those
are details there there is a bridge that
connects to you wiki net so we have our
connect and these we can destroy it
translated immediately to the to your
protocol so we can use it on every two
you're ready application so these this
brings new possibilities now we can use
to you we can use for example leap
motion in it or any other deep field
sensor and use it use it with the ax by
FX into our applications dad that's very
interesting because now we are having
the effects applications running on all
sort of devices raspberry p I don't know
it may be some of you of you hair before
of an initiative by the name of parallel
there is is similar to raspberry p but
we with up in CL embedded and it should
be it's going to come with even 64
course of opengl processors dad's gun is
very interesting become we can we could
put all these together until a small
device and create a whole new things
there there is the late leader having in
many research about human computer
interaction this these guys they are
from the university in singapore they
are trying to commercial side
commercialize a system leak answered any
surface any surface any windows in the
table into
you are into an interactive touchscreen
detecting any vibrations the idea here
is to put sensors on the borders and
when we touch it it's the text the time
gap between the weather be ratios
arrives to the sensor so every time
every one tab is on the surface the
vibrations spread all over it and the
sensors and now the time difference
between that so we can create only all
new kind of surface or touchable super
surfaces like all tvs and any other i
can put it right here the sensors and
wherever I told it's going to detect and
become that touch surface so play inter
interactive surface are everywhere on
our phones / it could be everywhere on
or objects on our lives on our house and
this English that I show you before is
very important because because it makes
a really a low-cost solution for
multi-touch so it could be touched
surfaces everywhere well as we were
talking we can we can use raspberry p
the effects to you and many others and
we're going to start talking about the
trio protocol the to your protocol was
was define it as an standard way to
handle multi-touch on every surface any
emerging devices it detects tabs it
detect objects it detects gestures
monuments and many other things it's a
very very each other right now many
there are many implementations on many
hardware many contexts
let's let's start talking about the
implementation of it every the to you
protocol and here it's a session ID for
every tap that we made when we touch the
screen it creates a pointer and that
pointer has its own ID if we put many
fingers it's like every time I start a
movement or a star a touch it creates a
new a new station ID and ID for every
point so we can track any pointers and
objects on our surface without any
problem that's going to be that time for
that information is relevant for the
implementation code error i'm going to
show you later okay let me go
specifically we are here going to talk
about the other two you implementation
it is on see it is a it runs on windows
it runs on linux mac and many many many
systems but here we are going to use
that java implementation so let's talk
about the JavaFX structure every javafx
application has a stage and a scene and
we put components inside of it so in
some way later we can search through all
this note if we need it for example if i
touch in a pod i touch the surface or
the screen and any point I cool later go
through the three and find out which
object I was touching and if i had the
two-year protocol i can know where the
touch was made and search which element
was tortured and become that part of the
javafx happy or how the javafx
applications understand the process so
it becomes a
constant loop of wear them for a to you
event then translated to javafx isn't
coordinated then then search for a note
related to the event if we found one we
create the equivalent javafx event yes
there is there is basically basically
mne toje hundred-plus this class handles
the scene is the stage and started to
you listening process it comes with this
is the way of it this is very important
here we start to listen for to you event
the that events could come from
everywhere even from the network or
could be running on the same process the
same application after that wastes are
handling the event we wait for a cursor
to be created then 22 we wait for any
update the cursor is created when I
first for example touched a point if I
move my finger aight guys is going to
fire update to your cruiser and after
that if I take out my finger it calls
the remote to your cursor so this
happens for every finger tap there I
made on the screen after that we have to
make make some compressions due to the
size of the of the screen or the
application and the size of the
touchable surface some sometimes they
are different is not it's some kind of
of adjustment to make it correspond
exactly where the application is showing
I can have a window imagine a we are on
a on a normal system I have a window and
I move it through the screen so these
this part make sure their if I touch
again
it converts to the shack point on the
screen where it is so after that we fire
the equivalent javafx event could we
create a most a mouse event and there is
an hour or method touch it created the
desert run tricky tricky some tricky
yeah by FX methods there are all the all
of the knowledge of FX documentation
that we have to use them to create the
equivalent gif XML before that we
searched for an old then no wait wait a
minute ok it was ok right there right
there we searched further we're boarding
for the note is if it is present on the
SN is or are seen let's I'm going to
show you a little bit practical example
of that
first cup for example this is on the FX
application I'm going to run it here I
have a two-year client installed on an
iphone so I let's let's see if it works
I've touched the surface of the client
it becomes it passed through all the
processes that we've been talking about
and it becomes an understandable event
for ya bye effects on the FFX
application now I can use my application
with my fingers in a normal way for
example
is very responsive it feels like a
normal touch application
ok that's right
now let me show you a real device using
this certainly
this is a big interactive wall in the
museum showing the exact same
application but in a real context
okay all that is amusing javafx after
you can see there's a nice-looking
application not very high not very
complex on graphical needs
okay bye it's enough show you the thesis
there's are some of our interactive
devices we made them with the same
technology to the left there is a
special music table where everybody can
touch and can create music in the middle
there is the walls done with this
technology to and the right there is a
special table for first checking home
information make some drawings etc this
is a big really big interactive advice
that we made to it is like 90 90 meters
wait with 90 meters is really big we
also created an interactive hologram and
I'm in a live show your Allah Graham is
the character to the right interacting
with the singer in the left it's a
person there is dead so maybe many maybe
some of you so at some point 2pac show
where 2pac was singing with another
person where this is something like that
we create all those kinds of interactive
devices and that gathers to the need to
develop this technology this is an
actual prototype where we are working on
where the people can there there is not
going to be need for any markers the
people can stand in front of of this
kind of holographic grass but it is not
solo grafica at the end it uses common
projection systems and the tracking is
going to detect where where the person
is looking and it's going to render the
exact position of that information on
the holographic surface the intention is
to put it in a high place for example in
a city where you at night the person
called stem and a point I look to the
city and all the information of the of
the relevant points is going are going
to appear in the in the right position
if I move my my head there's going to be
a live render and I come to it I'm going
to see always to information in the
right point that's going to be burying
13 where we're working on the prototype
right now the video i show you I'm will
let's get to the conclusion i have shown
you the a way to integrate the other FX
with those new possible torches or multi
touch devices technologies some human
machine interfaces interfaces and the
that's very interesting we know that
yeah week maybe cannot use the of
affection on every application that in
that wonders that could be done maybe it
brings new possibilities to the
development of interactive devices okay
