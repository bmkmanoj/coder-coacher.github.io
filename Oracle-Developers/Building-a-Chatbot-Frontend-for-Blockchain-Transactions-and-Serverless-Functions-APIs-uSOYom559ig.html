there I thought this is spring but it
doesn't feel like spring I'm coming from
California I flew in last night took me
a little longer to fly in and talking
about flying they sent they seemed to be
sending me to cold places on a regular
basis because a few weeks ago I was
flying into Oslo and you were landing
and the pilot announces it's -6 degrees
and freezing fog has rolled in now is
okay what does that mean like well we're
gonna try landing but if we don't make
it this time we have 45 more minutes of
fuel to keep trying so I was like what
happens after but hopefully it's not
that cold out here so so I'm gonna talk
a little bit about feature so I just
have to say this don't make your
purchase decisions based on anything I
say but most of the stuff that we're
gonna talk about is there today so you
know it's an exciting time to be a
developer following up on what ken had
set around Java 10 etc but one
serverless programming is becoming
really popular which is how do you spin
up instances on demand but as you think
about these you know you now have to
think about distributed programming you
have to think about taking events off
you have to think about how to
synchronize the data storage etc
chatbots you know now bots are becoming
really really you know the buzzword out
there as the user interface but as you
think about bots you have to think about
natural language processing you have to
think about AI maintaining the state and
context of a conversation so it's
becoming hard for developers
DevOps DevOps has been wonderful it has
improved our productivity significantly
but now what we're finding is that
developers are spending 40 to 60 percent
of their time in just doing DevOps
setting up Jenkins setting up you know
the various parts of a CI CV pipeline
figuring a heart and get kubernetes
going etc how do we move towards no ops
where you get the benefits of DevOps but
with less work done by the developer so
the developer can focus more on writing
code blockchain you know everyone's
talking about blockchain not everyone
knows what blockchain is and the key
thing is which use cases in production
will actually result in value
for the business organization that's
really important to figure out before we
go start implementing hyper ledger open
source open source is wonderful lots of
innovation going on in open source when
we think about kubernetes which is used
for orchestration kubernetes releases
every six weeks
hardly upgrade kubernetes hardly set up
kubernetes hardly scale kubernetes
getting at CD in front of kubernetes for
high availability etc you end up
spending a lot of time doing that just
so you can write your programs that can
run in containers that might give you
portability or that might be give you
better functionality so how do we reduce
the work effort there for developers and
then the last one is machine learning
today if I didn't mention AI and machine
learning then my talk would absolutely
be useless so let's talk about machine
learning the key thing for developers is
you know one how do you get the platform
to give you AI built-in and - how can
you embed machine learning into your
applications without necessarily being a
data scientist without needing to
understand machine learning and making
it very domain-specific so these are
some of the things that we're going to
talk about is how do you make the life
of developers easy as we go down this
path and you know I'm not going to talk
that much about the Oracle cloud
platform but we have a platform where
you can develop your applications
written in any programming languages
deploy then run them scale them based on
containers we have the ability to
integrate SAS applications to SAS
application SAS - on Prem and on Prem -
on primer applications so as you're
writing your custom applications how do
you integrate those applications other
pieces of packaged applications that are
there to be able to publish your content
to be able to secure the content to be
able to analyze and predict so how in
your applications can you embed
functionality so you can be looking at
data analyzing data and being able to
help your users of your applications be
able to predict and finally security you
know security and manageability how can
we monitor and manage from the cloud
without needing to worry about
installing monitoring and management
tools and aggregating large data
performance data user experience data
without worrying about where that stuff
is stored and securing making sure
there's single sign-on etc so that's the
Oracle cloud platform but before I get
into
you know the demos that I wanted to show
which was around several s and functions
and blockchain we did have an
interesting announcement and that's
around growl VM so with that I'd love to
welcome Eric Sedlar who runs engineering
for growl Eric let's talk a little bit
about growl so first you know what is
growl not everyone knows what growl is
okay so thanks for all is an efficient
language virtual machine and so the
vision that we have for this project
which I'm working on the labs for about
seven years now is that you write your
code once and whatever language you want
and then you can use it in any
application written in any other
language and run it in whatever engine
you want to so you can run it in Java
hotspot you can run it node you could
run it in my sequel or the Oracle
database or you can just run it
standalone in a container it's already
in production in some Oracle products
like OPA and but the big public website
that we're on is in on Twitter so all
the tweets that you're tweeting and
during this conference are going through
Gras VM today there are a lot more
things in progress so what what about
growl makes it special that makes
Twitter use growl what's the underlying
architecture around ground so the the
architecture for growl is is one where
we did rather than designing the
language runtime specifically for a
particular language like designing it
for Java or for JavaScript we designed
it kind of one level meta so it's it's
running things that run languages and
it's it's kind of a part of a larger
trend in a history of virtualizing
software and one of the reasons that
we've done that is to have this idea
that the Java introduced back to the 90s
of write once run anywhere and what that
actually meant was what I'll call
hardware level virtualization it means
you can run your app on any processor
regardless as ISA and that was what Java
tried to do in Microsoft came along with
CLR and then there's a next step in
virtualization that you'd see with
virtual a VirtualBox or VMware or
whatever where you can run your app on
any operating system regardless of what
you an installed on the hardware and
that was another level of convenience
but today you know if you
code in in Java and then you want to put
your Fortran app on it or vice versa
like Ken does you're kind of you know in
trouble
we actually would allow Ken to do that
because you can run for Trianon our LLVM
interpreter and then run a ruby
front-end or a JavaScript front-end or
or a Java front-end on it and so what
Grall does is it watches the the
interpreters which have taken the for
the front ends of all these different
languages we reported them to our API
and then what girl does is it watches
what the API does learns the language
semantics and then generates a compiler
for it and all that stuff can be linked
together with zero cost overhead to to
go between languages and you can make
any memory structure for so foreign
objects can look like the native local
objects to avoid an allocate and copy
and then all that stuff can run in any
of the engines I mentioned there along
the bottom and standalone you can
compile ahead of time which gives you
fast startup and low footprint rather
than running another VM well it sounds
pretty pretty cool pretty awesome but
I'm not sure that we should sell this on
the basis of it can run Fortran for you
and where should people go to see you
know what's going on with growl well so
crawl is actually one of the US a big
community effort and so it's built in
the open there you can see here and stay
close to the mic please oh yeah yeah so
I love this is going to work no the
point here a point here and put it in
this little dot here yeah okay great
24,000 commits right and you've got 73
contributors on github so it's actually
a pretty big project at github and we've
had commits from a number of vendors
like I like dozen universities and some
individuals as well so it's been done in
the community you can see what we're
doing as we're making commits and you
can try this out running any of the
languages that are supported by the JVM
but also supporting all the note
languages or the JavaScript stuff and
you can run these things in the database
we released that last fall or you can
run it in my sequel we'll talk more
about that next week at procore nough
live which is the big open source
database conference and we just lot
like a few minutes ago bravia morgue we
have a lot of documentation and
downloads there and then when you get
something running you can dock you can
debug this stuff with Java tools like
NetBeans but you could use JavaScript
tools like Chrome and it'll work on any
of the growl of um languages and you
know please join us
you know on github if you want to help
commit or come to the web site and see
more about it
that's wonderful Eric thank you so much
for being here and this sounds pretty
cool you know this whole thing of write
once run anywhere now it's like write
anything in any language and run
anywhere so that's wonderful thanks a
lot Eric
and by the way Eric the performance on
Twitter what was the improvement in
performance on Twitter yes Eric said 11
percent faster Twitter on Twitter the
performance is 11 percent faster and
that's why they're using growl VM so if
you want to drive for better performance
and you have scale of workload you know
that's a good alternative so no more
pressing off that circle button for you
okay great so grout via morgue so with
that let's get into you know what we
wanted to share with you about you know
server less functions etc we're gonna
work on this scenario of selling a car
and I happen to be walking in the Oracle
parking lot and took the photo of Larry
Ellison's car he has a particular spot
and actually there is a security guard
that is watching so if you ever parked
there within about 30 seconds someone
will be on you saying that's not your
spot it's a Lexus MFA LFA there's a
pretty expensive car and so I said hey
why not try and sell that car now don't
tell him I actually sold the car
otherwise I might not have a job after
this keynote here so and someone loved
cartoon so here's the cartoon of the
scenario that we're going to walk
through so if you go through the various
stages of this first I'm going to show
you a bot that's actually going to put
his car for sale on a blockchain I'm
going to show you how a chat bot is
built so the interaction paradigm for
the
selling of the car and the buying of the
car is done via bots chat bots on
facebook messenger so I'm going to show
how that is built and then we're going
to have chat bot creating you know car
fax requests putting the car onto the
blockchain etc using several s functions
based calls so we're gonna walk through
Matt Baldwin is going to come up and
talk through functions and then finally
we're going to look up on the blockchain
as to you know what cars are available
and be able to buy the Lexus MFA so
that's the scenario so with and this is
the architecture which is not cartoonish
though it does have some cartoon
elements to it I'll show you in a second
but so you know the customer that's me
is selling my car that's the Lexus MFA
and we used the chat bot platform from
Oracle as part of the mobile mobile
cloud to be able to interface with the
customer and then the part in the middle
oh I can use this guy here this guy here
is an event-based you know Kafka engine
that we built and then finally you have
functions based development so you have
several s programming and then this car
there's the cartoon part this car is
then put onto the blockchain Network
that's the one in the middle and then
from the blockchain network we're able
to purchase the car also so a different
dealership is able to for a different
customer enable them to buy the car so
that's the experience out there so let
me just show you what the experience
looks like here let me just go to my
mobile phone if you guys can plug this
in so here we go can you guys see my
iPhone if the folks can put up my iPhone
here the folks in the front or the back
my iPhone please ah there we go
okay and yes I have a few emails to read
please do not comment on that people
wonder if I'm doing work or not but
let's go to facebook Messenger here so
this is just me going to Facebook
Messenger and here I friended John's car
dealership
and I just say hi to wake up the the bot
here so this is just no education needed
on my part no read the manual no book
needed and here it says welcome to the
art are you interested in buying or
selling I want to sell Larry's you know
Lexus MFA that's great we offer
competitive prices for clients it knows
who I am
so can you upload an image so I go in
here I go to my thing looks like I've
taken a lot of photographs of his
license plate not sure why but here we
go it's asking for a license plate so
now reading optical character
recognition on the license plate can you
upload recent pictures of the car and
here's the actual picture of the car and
this is his actual spot that's right in
front of the 500 building that his
actual car that's oh I'm a little
worried doing this demo but okay it's
already done some parsing figured out
you know some details I'm gonna look at
few more details out here so it's gone
look up maybe CARFAX report or something
got some information navigation system
seven speakers that looks wonderful and
the mileage so let me see is this
correct it I say yes and the one thing
that it asked me is what's the mileage
on the car because can't get that
necessarily I gently Drive you know
between 150 miles to 180 miles and I can
only do that on the 280 close to San
Francisco between 2 and 4 a.m. on the
night so I don't really drive that much
so that's 1,100 miles so far it says oh
so it's looked up Kelly Blue Book and
says Kelly Blue Book value is the price
of a car to be three hundred and seventy
five thousand dollars today and since
it's great condition I'll buy it for
three eighty five that's kind of a
bummer because these cars supposed to
appreciate in value and I thought it was
supposed to be 425 and I'd be making
some money but oh well you know 385
what's another fifteen twenty thousand
dollars when you can buy cars like this
so I said is this okay with you yes so
there we'll continue to process the
vehicle and send you the documents for
the transfer so that's the kind of
interface that can be built and we will
need this a bit more later but let me
just put this here for now so
talking about yeah if we can go back to
the slides please you know there's a
pretty significant transformation that
is happening we're moving forward from
the app era you know everyone was
building mobile apps but now chat pots
and messaging are becoming the key form
of interaction with embedded arv our
capabilities in there so image
recognition is built-in as you're doing
jack-bots and virtual personal
assistants are going to be taking over
if you think about your mobile phone
what's the most popular app on your
phone I have two kids
my daughters almost 17 I was actually in
Boston just two three weeks ago showing
her colleges out here and I have a son
who's 13 and a half they live by their
phones but they don't have voice mail
set up how many of you have kids yeah
and how many of them have phones pretty
much everyone and how many of them have
voicemail set up no one so they don't
use voicemail email they only get to
email if I force them to use email by
saying you have to go look at that
there's something important in school
the way they all communicate is
messaging either Facebook message
Instagram snapchat iMessage etc so the
paradigm of conversations is moving
towards using AI and you know when you
think about if you wanted to build that
kind of a bot interface what are some of
the challenges that you have one there
lots of channels there there are two
sets of channels one is the input
channel which can be you know Alexa
Google home etc the other is the app
platform hook upon which you working
which is facebook Messenger whatsapp
WeChat so you not have to integrate with
Alexa you have to integrate with
Facebook Messenger and then you have to
have national language processing what
did the person say you have to
understand the intent of what was being
said so you have to use AI techniques in
there and then you have to have security
backend integration so for example you
know I might be needing to go to some
back office applications to get some
information and maybe you know the
policy or insurance capabilities of the
car etc so there's a lot of work that
developers have to do and so how do we
make it
and this is actually I've done the demo
here of the chat part what we did was we
built a platform to be able to help
developers to build the chat BOTS easily
so first we built the integrations into
Alexa Google home etc so that we're able
to take the voice to text they give us
text and then we've got a national
language processing engine and that
natural language processing engine goes
in and understands what happened what
was the intent of the conversation and
then what are the entities upon which
that we need to act on for example here
an entity might be the type of car that
we're working on so we built that and
then you saw the interface you know I
was able to load in cars and things like
that and if I were to say show me all
the cars available for sale it would use
the Facebook messenger card layout a
look and feel so we've even integrated
into the UI off the messaging platform
so you as a developer don't have to
worry about this and then we've got deep
learning algorithms that are built-in so
they were maintaining the state of the
conversation you know what if the person
say you know did they say something that
indicates that they might have reached a
decision or is the tone of the
conversation heading south in which case
we should transfer that conversation
over to the customer service rep right
so that's all we've built into the
platform so that you can build with
these BOTS pretty easily and I'm going
to switch to a the UI of how to build
BOTS so let me just go in here so
browser where's the browser Matt where's
the browser here here we go okay let me
make sure we logged in here so this is
the mobile cloud from Oracle and this is
the BOK piece of that so here for
example you can see from mobile cloud
you can build mobile apps native mobile
apps with mobile backend as services
like push notifications you know storing
securely on local drives etc you have
the ability to build visually developed
apps but without writing a single line
of code you could write a mobile app
that can run natively run as mobile web
it's
you can build BOTS that's what we're
going to spend time on you can do
analytics you can get insight into how
the application is being used whichever
application it is whether it be a BART
whether it be a native mobile app etc so
let's go to the bot here and I'm going
to go to the car dealer by bot so these
are BOTS that are built and here you can
see there's notion of intent and as a
developer what you're doing is you're
asking the business user what are some
of the intents that you have
so here the intents that maybe people
put in was buy a car I'm looking for a
car I want to buy a car now there's no
way that you can put in all the intense
and so we that is where we're using
machine learning so here for example
we've got different models for machine
learning that are built in here that can
be used to train this bar so let's play
around with this bar a little bit and
here I want to see you know I want to
test the intent like by Lexus
okay now here you see there is no notion
of Lexus but when I say by Lexus here
and I say send this is actually in the
build environment so I'm testing what
this looks like it actually comes back
and tells me here's the confidence with
which intent was the person trying to
execute on so by car is the intent with
30 percent and if for example I want
this by Lexus
to be added in here I can add that as an
example which then results in retraining
the bar such that the confidence level
is going up and if you had a number of
conversations that you know you had
already recorded your customer
conversations you could actually stream
those customer conversations in and we'd
be able to learn from the bar and if we
went here and if we said you know this
shows you what the response would be to
an end user if they were interacting
with a with this bar if I said buy a car
now it's actually executing the code
that shows you what the response would
be right and here this is the interface
that is showing you if you were doing on
Facebook it'll look different so you
have the notion of intense that we
figure out based on just some hints that
you've given and then we keep on
learning on an on go
basis and then we have the notion of
entities so entities are you know
address currency date etc these are
system entities that we've created so
that from the conversation we can pull
out things like address or currency you
know if you're doing a bank account
transfer and you say pay mom 50 bucks
and you'd ask you know before what's my
balance in checking we no longer ask you
which account you want to transfer form
from and we're able to pull out $50 as
currency out here but you can add your
own custom you know entities also so in
this case you know I've got dealer as a
custom entity and here I could add for
example name so based on which dealer
you know you might have different
dealers that you're working on okay and
then what we've done is we've created
these bundle packs resource bundles so
we already have multilingual national
language processing in there but if you
have a better way to process you have a
resource bundle that you want to use you
can integrate that resource bundle in
here and we've also got here the ability
to have custom components so in this
case if you wanted optical character
recognition and you wanted to integrate
optical character recognition in here
through a web hook you can actually call
a particular you know OCR package that
you have and then here you can see the
channels that are available to you so
for example here is the Facebook channel
and we're already enabling secure single
sign-on three-legged OAuth etc for you
so making it really easy and then we're
also giving you the ability to use web
looks to add other channels so the goal
of this was to show you that as a
developer it becomes very easy to be
able to actually build these BOTS and
we're giving you a visual drag-and-drop
paradigm of how to layout what the
conversation might look like based on
what kind of decisions made by the
engine what you might want to happen
right like buying the car or putting the
car in the blockchain so here's the you
know overview of our platform one we're
giving you you know cross channel
integration across both slack facebook
Messenger whatsapp Syria et cetera plus
on the voice input side with Google home
Alexa
dialogue flow execution so you have a
declarative builder which I showed you
you know you're building the bot
declaratively as opposed to writing a
whole bunch of code and it has a state
machine built in so for example if I was
looking for a new laptop to purchase as
an employee and I saw the three laptops
and then I said you know yeah I'm done
with this you know view it is it knows
to ask me well have you made a decision
because it's maintaining the state of
the conversation and then it has the
conversational AI engine in which is
using machine learning to be able to
learn on an ongoing basis and really
importantly it also has integration to
back-end so we make it very easy for you
to be able to integrate with back-end
SAS applications back office on Prem
applications with making very simple API
calls and we do the integration with the
backend so with that I'd love to bring
Matt on to talk about server less
functions where the server let's fit in
into this whole paradigm here well it's
actually kind of nice little girl next
slide and kind of fit we're fit in where
fits into Siddhartha is that where we
have this code there's Kafka event
engine that actually is kicking off
events and then we have these service
functions acting as almost like micro
services or nano services talking to the
blockchain architecture and so that we
can talk to it and spin up something
really quickly and then tear it back
down real quickly so it gives us
scalability as we add more dealers and
more participants and organizations to
the to the solution okay so so let's
kind of kick off into what is service
and so what is service is yes let's
let's let's lay down flat is that there
are servers there
okay everyone there's servers there then
lots of servers actually but what's
what's important about servers service
is that you don't have to manage the the
cruft underneath you're just writing
code you're building things and and the
server list components are all being
managed for you and so that is important
for a variety of different reasons and
what we're going to talk about today is
about functions as a service and really
functions where
is a component it's really the kind of
runtime the the the the infrastructure
that we'll be talking about underneath
so why Cyril is why do we have it and so
first of all is just very simple it's
cheaper because if you're looking at a
traditional application a traditional
application say is stand up a a jetty
server a tomcat server you you when you
stand that up you then run that for a
period of time and you're constantly
running it and there's a cost associated
to that what we can do from an economics
perspective is that we can say let's
just run that function for a moment and
then move on and then tear it down bring
it up and tear town we out for example
we we can also make it hot so it can be
up for a little bit and then torn down
for it torn down after a period of time
the next point is agility agility is key
what we're building new applications how
we want to reduce the over the amount of
code that we're actually developing and
we want to be able to not introduce
errors into the code that were that
we're building and then reliability is
that we're not managing the service we
can offload that management of that
service to the cloud provider and so
that gives us reliability the patching
we don't have to deal with operating
system updates or patches or any of any
of any of those things and then finally
innovation if I can write code and kind
of think at the speed of light where I
can I can innovate faster and I can
compose applications in a much more
efficient manner and deliver overall
value to the business much quicker so
announcing it was announced in Oracle
OpenWorld 2017 is the FN project do and
what the FN project I know is an open
source project it's tied to the CNC F
the cloud native compute foundation and
what it is it is an open source project
that delivers functions as a service
where you can deploy these and this
capability on premise and then we will
be offering a function to as a service
capability
as a managed service as well but the key
thing here is that you can get started
today building functions that are
portable and with the underlying
technology mean being containers and it
it's just it's just a really exciting
project because when we look at we have
5050 committers now 50 plus and Oracle
non Oracle committed to the project so
it's a very active and dynamic project
and there's also 2,500 commits actually
2,500 plus commits that have actually
that have actually been committed to the
project as well this is very exciting
great investment it's and and really
kind of gets you going and thinking
about how to build functions and with
multiple languages as well so let's look
at what is a function so functions so
the function project takes the basic
concept from 30 years or 40 years ago
when when we're building UNIX streams in
and out very simple so you put something
in the black box that function and then
something comes out and so you and then
and then we have you know basic output
to standard out and then log into err
the function server and the function
service handles everything else like the
API gateway piping things about storing
calls logs it takes care of all that
cruft underneath so it's a very simple
very elegant solution in terms of how to
kind of and how you're going to build
your you know your that that nano
service under underneath the micro
Service and then when we start looking
at the the CLI the CLI is very
straightforward FN and it creates an app
it builds a scaffolding for an app and
this time in this case F Annette run one
time go FN run FN test FN deploy FN call
and then and then we basically build
routes everything when it's deployed is
a rest service so all you have to do is
be able to say ok F and deploy and then
that that route comes forward but really
kind of enough of that let's kind of
walk into some of the code effectively
this is really portable across multiple
and
you could run it on your laptop you can
run it in our public cloud you can run
it in a third-party cloud and he not
just locked into running everything in
one cloud right correct absolutely
correct and let's do run time typing is
good by the way this is pair programming
I'm one pair you guys are the other pair
so you can always help me if you want
and one time go and we'll call it hello
so what we did there is we built a big
basic scaffold of a function so we'll CD
to it and what you see are three three
artifacts really three key artifacts the
service itself the actual function self
funko fungal intestine Aysen so let's
take a quick look at these and let's
look at that func does make this a
little bigger I mean nothing really
special but what it is doing is using
basic standard in standard out so you
can see right here saying we're looking
for the person name and guess what it's
a hello world kind of capability and
then the funk funk yam will actually
defines what language it's going to be
where the entry point is and then the
tests we also build a basic testing
testing for a black box testing on the
on the environment as well so let's go
back to here so the basic simplest thing
we can do is function run and what it's
doing here is building
it's basically building a container and
then it uses that container it says
hello world awesome but now let's see
what what's actually so for those are
doing verbose here's what it's actually
doing under the under the covers so in
other words it's doing all the things in
terms of building in terms of using and
leveraging a container but you don't see
any of it so for those of you are
interested in doing something like this
right using like I'm using a MacBook you
can do a brew install FN and you'll and
you'll get the
function development kit and so it's
part of grew so you can use that so now
let's let's try something because we
said what is it standard in standard out
kind of thing so let's do that go and
that's calling this let's write some
jason and we'll call it that and we'll
call it Boston strong yeah there and
then we will pipe it to run now with all
luck it should then it's gonna build the
image here and say F N and then F and
run oops
what did I do I must have an error here
there
there there we go this is nearer come on
I need your help a little bit here guys
you know you can't give me a hand here
so okay so so so that's actually
building that but then what we want to
actually do something more with this
this is running inside inside of my
develop environment see it's very
elegant very straightforward
we just manipulate the code the go code
we can run function start and function
run and and build right just like that
and we can even do a function test for
example like that and we'll do a
function test and it's doing that it's
running the test cases and then we can
then say ok so let's let's actually
deploy this so do boy stop app demo ok
a function to boil a demo okay just make
sure I got this right app demo there
okay so what's doing here is that's
actually building a new container and
what it's doing is then publishing it to
a service so we can say function apps
list
there so now we have demo demo deployed
Oh code deployed and then what we can
then say is we can say routes list demo
and see that's the end point because now
we have a radical endpoint that we can
use and so now we can say curl right and
we can say curl and we'll say HTTP my
mouse is somewhere here and and we can
see that and so we can also so that's
actually deployed on a server could be
deployed as function as a service its
server as well some function as a
service and it can be deployed and we
can do we can pipe things in in and out
of it just like we did like like we did
before so that's the basic concept of
what function is from a CLI perspective
so let's go back to the presentation
because when we're looking at more
complex things we want to but we want to
be able to put them to provide some
level of orchestration for for for those
functions so in particularly for low
excuse me for for longer running type of
functions and want to do additional
parallelism so what we've done is and
from the we've leveraged the completable
api from from the java from java 8 and
to allow us to build these parallel
functions and so that you can build some
very complete very complex
orchestrations so for example your boss
comes up to you says sell car is kind of
the micro service but it actually has a
variety of things underneath it such as
I want to have a CARFAX report I need a
criminal lookup I have an FBI lookup I
have all these different little things
that make up cell car and then I'm gonna
write that to the blockchain and once
that's all complete so I'm gonna take
the completable the completable futures
api and we can pull all that together
into an orchestration so that
orchestration then looks like ok here's
the current flow it's a little bit long
a little bit dense but the the point is
that you can build this in terms of
getting cars and then those get cars are
going to process the car so I'm going to
get some particular
data and that particular data then is
going to drive down into you know get
the car fax get the criminal lookup and
then finally come to the end and do a
print line to the end so so so flow is
the capability taking many functions and
then kind of orchestrate them into a
series of events so let's kind of walk
into here ok and what we have here and
so I have a quick le assault code flow
and what's that what's that doing is
actually running an execution and so you
can see the execution of these API is
actually in these functions actually
going and so we can then drill down and
see how fast and what they're doing all
the way to the end and as they complete
so what this does is it gives us so
everything from code get cars what it
does it gives us kind of a trace route
all the way through the through the
execution code then the next step is
saying that's that's the positive step
but then then there's also the it helps
us in terms of debugging so just to kind
of finish up here coming as a service
based on upstream FM we're gonna be
delivering functions as a service ii
they'll obviously be integrated with
oracle security solutions from end to
end protection and then as you can see
all these functions have an API driven
associate to them and we're gonna be
integrating tightly with our API
platform so that you can build mock
services and then as you build your
functions out complete them so
Siddhartha yeah here you go and the next
one is gonna have to be really fast that
was wonderful
that's ten stage that stay on stage yes
so you know the difference is here with
AWS lambda for example is that you know
you can run it anywhere not just on the
cloud platform until you can write the
programming language you can write the
containers in any language the function
flow chains everything together and then
lastly should I forgot what I was gonna
say but
okay we're going to blockchain now so
unblocked chain just real quick in this
architecture we're now going to talk
about that function placing that car
onto the blockchain network so let's
just talk and then you know the the
person on the other end actually blind
buying the blockchain so what is
blockchain you know it's a system for
managing distributed Ledger's in a
peer-to-peer network which means that
not everyone is fully trusted but you
have many players who want to be able to
do a transaction and today the
reconciliation of those transactions is
all done via emails or Excel
spreadsheets being exchanged for example
your manufacturer who then ships the
good via a shipper the shipper then
delivers the group goods through customs
and over to the end you know person
receiving the goods there has to be
validation across the board and today
that takes a lot of time so now if
multiple parties can actually transact
on a blockchain you have transparency
the minute the transaction is done
because you know the transaction is
immutable which means it cannot be
changed and that you know there at least
two or three people who endorsed the
transaction which means the transaction
actually happened so if you look at some
of the you know key use cases that we've
seen this is where I was talking about
everyone's thinking about use cases we
have financial services based use cases
and we have supply chain based use cases
I just talked about the supply chain
with the shipper we have public sector
based use cases and health care based
use cases and one of the use cases that
is becoming very popular is identity how
can you have shared identity so that for
example the government of Canada is
saying that you know if you set up a
identity with a bank then you don't need
to recreate your identity when you go to
get a new cellphone account with
t-mobile or whoever it might be they can
actually share identity by requesting
off a blockchain if this person has an
identity that's been well authenticated
so let's work for the consumer less work
for the you know authorizer on the front
end and you know if you think about the
patterns for blockchain you can enable
you know distributed autonomous
marketplaces like the you know identity
case reduce friction so that's reducing
the amount of effort needed the time
needed for reconciliation
you can securely maintain and share the
decentralized records like identities
and very importantly track the
provenance of documents provenance means
where was this produced what were the
goods used that were produced so for
example for my Lexus MFA I want to make
sure that when I'm buying the car not
only do I know yes the car is there but
also that it was always taken to a Lexus
dealership where were the parts
purchased from where the parts original
parts or were they not original parts I
want to know all of that about the car
and that could be put on the blockchain
and if you think about challenges in
terms of when you're thinking of writing
blockchain applications is that one you
have to figure out how to integrate with
supply chain systems you have to
integrate with back-office of
applications you have to integrate with
identity system so it takes a lot to do
that integration and production resinous
you know blockchain is not easy it takes
a little bit to scale as the chains get
longer performing gets impacted so
hardly make sure that you can have a
high-performance secure permission
blockchain that is running for you and
also technology is changing really
really fast you know you look at
MapReduce for example on the fast data
side that was D technology 2-3 years ago
now it's all spark so how do you
insulate yourself from these technology
changes we're hyper ledger fabric is
just in its version 1.0 and then
operational challenges so when you want
to set up this metal network how do you
bring on members how do you monitor
what's going on
how do you support and lifecycle
management for this entire blockchain so
what we've done at Oracle is we've
delivering blockchain as a service and
Matt's going to demonstrate that which
makes it very easy for you because we're
using hyper ledger and we're giving you
an implementation that is extremely
secure and scalable we in fact took you
know the team that was working on our
you know a tuxedo application with the
distributed transaction management
application and I've been able to
leverage that team to make sure that we
can have a highly scalable distributed
transaction mechanism so now you can
just come and say I want to implement my
use case use a couple API is to be able
to execute transactions onto the
blockchain and that's what Matt's going
to talk about and it's running on our
infrastructure platform which is giving
you a lot of hype
formants built into it so Matt if we can
do a quick demo now certainly well yes
okay so first of all what we're gonna do
is do a quick close out of here so and
say because then we got to buy the car
we're actually going to buy the car car
back and so we're gonna buy the car and
it's it's relative to to the blockchain
discussion so you saw this with
siddharth since we have different cars
that we could choose from but let's say
if I want to say I have a Lexus I'd
prefer to have a Lexus what we're doing
here is that we're searching across the
blockchain saying oh I don't have one in
my dealership but I may have one in
another dealership and so that's the key
thing it's finding this new new car so
we can prove that that's a you know the
right car and then I can say I'd like to
purchase it so we're committing a
transaction on the blockchain network at
this point and so we can say hey wait a
minute it's three hundred ninety nine
thousand somebody made a markup and what
this means is that's permission
permission between two dealers so that
we can we can look at what the two
dealers are actually talking about and
they're only they are involved in that
transaction so I'm gonna say yes I want
to confirm that and so that's a and so
though we'll complete the transaction
we'll do the paperwork we'll go to the
dealership and take care of that but the
other piece of this is that this is an
application for the blockchain network
right and so what we can also build
other applications that are associated
to this both of them are using what's
what's called the rest proxy so as a
developer from a developer perspective
we want to do 6 lik 274 I think is the
is the car we can build custom
applications on the blockchain you using
it using a REST proxy so as a developer
there's three things that you're going
to be doing you're gonna be developing
applications which are outside of the
blockchain and then those applications
will interact with what's called chain
code and chain code is usually built and
go something soon and Java is that it
will be it will be built and that is the
contract that builds consensus on the
transaction on the blockchain so the key
thing is so what you're seeing here this
is a custom app and we can see that the
transaction
has occurred and you can see it several
transactions part of the testing we've
been doing and also what are the API
details and this is showing all the
detail of the transaction that's
occurring on the blockchain so this is a
call I said that's a rest call that's
good that was a sample application that
was using the same API called that your
block was using exactly so we build
multiple applications multiple
applications act accessing the
blockchain and accessing the chain code
so from the network perspective we have
multiple networks here we have one
network then an originator and this we
can then say what does this network look
like and this is how the blockchain we
can visualize the overall blockchain we
can see there's organizations there's a
founding organization then there's
multiple organizations in that
blockchain and then there are peer nodes
and these are the green things and those
peer nodes process basically process
what's what's going to be happening on
the hyper let your fabric and then
finally and before we kind of go off and
finish up here is that we have this
concept of nodes and this is what is key
it's important think of what nodes are
in blockchain and particularly the hyper
ledger fabric is that these are subnets
in terms of organization a tux to
organization be an only organization a
can talk to organization will be and so
we can set up these subnets so for
example the difference between Bob and
john's blockchain is that i don't care
about what other parties may not may not
need to know about what price was paid
for the car may not need to know about
the shipping and how that car was
shipped to the other dealership in other
words we can do this in a permission
manner leveraging channels inside of the
hyper ledger fabric so i'll kind of
stand down from here and go back to the
presentation so we keep us on schedule
and so basically on the left-hand side
the key things from a developer
perspective is you build really three
two key things one is on the left hand
side are the applications and so you
know whether it be a chat bot whether it
be a trace application and then you
define the network which is in the
middle how do these how do these
channels work and then you define what
the chain code is going to do and that's
the most important piece that is the
smart contract
that is the piece that actually builds a
consensus that you're going to install
into the blockchain and on the right
hand side we're adding value in terms of
getting administration council arrest
proxy in these other capabilities and
and really hardening the overall hyper
ledger fabric so siddharth great thanks
a lot sure enough thank you
great demo there so we need to work hard
on the leveraging the api's and then
using or writing the smart contracts in
this case it'd be putting the car onto
the blockchain network so just to wrap
up really quickly about our application
development platform we've shown you
some parts of it but we've got an entire
CI CD pipeline so that you don't have to
set up Jenkins or JIRA etc if you don't
want to but if you have Jenkins for
example continuous integration you can
easily you know blend it in we've got
maven already built in there in addition
the CI CD pipeline understands
containers natively so when you for
example check in code and we know you're
gonna write a container based
application will automatically build a
docker image the pipeline knows that
that docker image needs to be registered
and that it could be put in a public
registry or in a private registry and
then be able to deploy that as a
container onto a kubernetes based
platform we're providing you kubernetes
as a service so that you don't have to
worry about spinning up kubernetes
maintaining kubernetes scaling
kubernetes etc your containers
automatically get deployed on the
kubernetes or if you want you can say
I'm just gonna bring my code and I'm
writing the code in PHP Ruby go Java it
doesn't matter we actually manage the
runtime for you where we're running it
on containers but you're not aware that
it's running on containers so either you
can be container native or you can just
bring code and we can run it on
containers for you and then we talked
about the mobile cloud capabilities the
chat pod functionality plus all the
mobile backend as a service capabilities
and the integration to the back-end
applications the API first development
you should check out a period il so that
is a place where you can go and write
documentation and that creates an API
that API is actually running on a mock
server so that without writing the
implement
of that API you can actually go to
someone who's going to use your API get
them to use it collaborate and what the
actual contract should be once you have
that contract agreed to then you can go
and implement the API and then we're
giving you lifecycle management for the
API so that you know from you know build
to tasks to run etcetera you got insight
into the performance of the api's you've
got an api gateway that gives you
security it's a validation rate
authentication rating throttling
etcetera and that API gateway can run
anywhere so it can run in your
on-premise application environment it
can run in the Oracle public cloud or it
can run on a third-party cloud it's an
entire API management platform with a
portal to exposed to developers who are
going to consume your API so obviously
if you're writing in Java and wanna use
web logic we're delivering WebLogic
delivered as a service and then finally
for those folks who want to do rapid
prototyping and be able to build
applications where they're not writing
code but they want to work with the line
of business users show them what the
application could look like we're
actually giving you a visual development
environment where we'd drag and drop you
can build out the application very
easily and then it can generate the code
for you from that you know visual
developed environment and you can extend
the code from there and this is what all
our you know platform looks like we
talked a lot about the front-end tooling
the API design and the visual
development capabilities the backend
services with functions jack-bots and
then I didn't talk a lot about the
performance management capabilities so
from the cloud we're able to monitor and
manage your applications where you don't
have to where we've created one
consolidated data platform for log data
performance data user experience data
config data and we're applying machine
to this data because you got tons of
data and we got tons of compute capacity
in the cloud where you no longer have to
tell us what thresholds to set we learn
the thresholds over time we learn the
server topology over time so now you
don't have to monitor and manage your
on-premise monitoring management
infrastructure and you don't have to
spend time setting thresholds etc you as
developers can get real-time feedback
into what's going on with the
application and then the event have
cloud service you know
Kafka giving you scalable class Kafka
clusters you being able to leverage the
eventing but you don't have to worry
about the infrastructure and the scaling
when message storms are coming in
identity being able to do single sign-on
from your application to other
applications and then integration being
being able to very easily integrate your
applications with back-office
applications we've given giving your
adapters to various SAS applications and
on-premise applications and finally data
stores you don't have to just use the
Oracle database we're giving you my
sequel delivered as a service we're
giving you Cassandra no sequel delivered
as a service and if you want you could
even run longer DB on RIS and all of
this is running on a very performant
highly scalable secure I as platform
lots of traction for the Oracle cloud
the analysts are rating us at the very
top in terms of Magic Quadrant and the
Forester waves lots of apps in the cloud
marketplace and then for developers you
know go to developer Oracle comm and
that's the place where we're putting all
our content for developers you can see
blogs you can see the content on
containers api's DevOps tooling etc so
thank you you know and we'd love to get
your feedback we'll be around if there
are any questions we can take those
