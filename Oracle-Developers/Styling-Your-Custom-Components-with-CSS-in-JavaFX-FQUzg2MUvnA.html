with CSS and Java FX and before I go on
I want to point out a couple other CSS
and custom component sessions that are
going to go on during this conference
4:30 p.m. on Wednesday Jesper Potts is
having a session on CSS gold nuggets of
how you can apply some great CSS if you
want to download the sample app I'm
gonna be referring to that a lot during
this app I have a bitly CS abili URL
slash to GFX CSS or you can go to the
bitbucket repository another session of
note is the CSS and deep dive at 4:30 by
David grieve I think he is the big
implementer um I got a question earlier
about a is there still certain memory
leakin JavaFX CSS and I believe that's
the session that's the guy who would
know that most about it don't forget to
fill out your session surveys I had
single-digit response rates at last
year's talk that I gave ideally we get
50 to 80%
the last one is Gerrit Grunwald he is a
JavaFX master he's presenting a session
on creating your own custom JavaFX 8
controls on Thursday at 2 p.m. near the
end of the conference so before I go to
the slides
one quick question I would like to know
is how familiar are people here with
JavaFX CSS just not Java FCS yes just
CSS in general there are people familiar
with the format of it do I need to spend
a lot of time going over how to use CSS
and apply to your components that's good
a lot of us really have experience we
can just drive dive right in to the
details of how to make your own
properties CSS style of all the bit
about Who am I my name is dan o Ferran
and for my whole career I've only had
one job where I haven't touched the Java
Virtual Machine and that was a job where
we actually worked in small talk and we
all know what happened there i
co-founded a project named Griffin with
Andres on Mary and James Williams on
various is actually running the coder
garden up in the expo hall if you want
to go and contribute to open source
software and also I've been contributing
to the JavaFX open GFX project and I've
been working on a lot of that within the
past year doing a lot of that
so what's the plan what are we gonna do
today and we're gonna talk about how
you're gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna treat
this like to a treat a video game like
Angry Birds there's gonna be the one
star solution there's we made a two star
solution in the three star solution each
one getting more progressively and
progressively away from the baseline and
more exotic towards things you'd want to
do the both of the presentation is going
to deal with the one star solution of
just getting CSS properties style in
your custom control and then the other
ones they get easier once you have that
base to build upon you can't get this to
2 star solution without the one star
solution now like any good video game
there is a zero star solution you need
to be able to finish the level first and
that zero star solution for your JavaFX
components is that you must use the
JavaFX properties every single bit of
code that I'm going to talk about later
on is predicated upon the fact that any
property that you want to expose to the
CSS engine is a JavaFX property there's
a lot of hooks that go in with the
invalidation the validation framework
and using the properties an object that
is absolutely essential so if the one
star solution I'm going to be using the
flipping a property from my my demo and
these are the properties let's go ahead
and look at the demo of how what I'm
gonna do so what I've written let me
move this to another page so I can come
back here so whatever it is a little
simple flippy control Gradle clean run
yeah this is not my deployment talk so
I'm gonna be in Gradle the whole time to
build this this is a little control it's
gonna come up and it's like a baseball
card you can look at the front and you
can look at the back so here we have you
know here's I I love the new mad
scientist Duke logo for this year's Java
one I think it's great but you can flip
it and look at the back and the property
we're gonna be overriding is what the
angle is when you finish a flip so the
flip it comes to the ninety degree in
front and the ninety degree in back and
so that's this property so if you flip
to the front it would wind up there and
that's the one that we're going to going
to be showing you initially how to style
in CSS
so let's look at the code itself for
this control flow down there flip pane
so here we have all the properties that
are running this this particular flip
pane demo we're going to come to whether
it's run or what the front back objects
are in the career angle and it's it's
not too complex a custom component until
you get down to the update angle where
we do all sorts of interesting things
with the transforms and the flip doesn't
you know a little a little can you all
read that I should make the font bigger
there we go
so here's here's we're gonna come to
this update angle method later on but
everything else around here is just very
simple properties and the CSS style
sheet here is pretty simple we just set
some colors so what is involved in
getting to make the property style a
ball so there's really four steps and in
three steps of work that you're actually
gonna do first thing you need to do is
you need to make your control implement
the styler bill interface that provides
a lot of life cycle methods from that
the CSS engine uses that it refers to
for the object that is going to style in
its CSS passes the second step is that
you need to create CSS metadata
instances and classes CSS metadata is a
class that JavaFX uses to get important
information such as what is the name of
this property how do I take it from CSS
speak into a Java type and how do i how
do I deal with its lifecycle the third
step is to take your property and make
it a styl ability for the most place
that for the most part this is a a copy
and paste type situation where you just
change one type into another type but
there's some instances where you might
need to do some more exotics changes to
that then the fourth thing you need to
do is you need to enumerate your style
abilities to the CSS engine now usually
it can still skip step one because in
almost every situation when you write a
a custom component it is going to extend
JavaFX seen node so you already have
that first step done there are some
exotic situations where your custom
component would not be a node but that
is beyond the scope of this talk
the the styler will support in node
supports everything you would need to do
so the second step of making your
property styler ball is need to create
the CSS and metadata the CSS metadata is
actually a generic class with types s
envy the s is going to be the type of
your styler bill node in this case is
going to be the flip pane know that I've
created and this is the actual JavaFX
flip pane and then V is the Java type of
the property for the proper that you can
be using now in this case in the code
it's going to be number and the reason
it's number is because the CSS engine
passes back a number instance that does
not distinguish between doubles integers
floats shorts and bytes cares or all
those other types it just cares about
numbers and then are the covers
you're gonna it'll it'll do the
appropriate type math for you with your
style converter so if your property is a
double integer or float when you create
your CSS metadata you're going to create
CSS metadata for a number type now the
CSS metadata has four constructors five
constructors actually there are two
required arguments and then the rest of
the arguments come on one at a time
and in a standard pattern they have for
the optional values so the first
argument your CSS metadata constructor
is going to be the name of the property
a lot of the JavaFX CSS properties name
- FX - is something that's just our
practice with FX components it is good
practice of it's not a standard CSS
component to have a dash in front of it
to show that it's custom somehow but
that is not required really you can name
it anything that you want the second one
is the CSS converter I'm how are you
going to take the parcel value into your
type and for the most part those are
just going to be using the existing
converters in the JavaFX system the
initial value is an optional and that is
when CSS goes through and sees that you
do not have the initial value in the CSS
stylesheets what value should put in its
place if you don't specify an initial
value it's not going to initialize it
unless it's set and the last two are
some CSS specific ones that are there
they're fairly advanced the inherits
whether we use the CSS inheritance for
inheriting values from the other know
and also the list of sub properties I
think FX font is the only one I am using
duplicate desktop is that a problem on
not getting my signal so now this is
getting recorded yeah alright technical
difficulties if you're listening at home
these slides will be online and the code
will be online so we'll just get that
resolved so finally the sub property is
FX font you can set FX font face FX font
would it help if I went to a an extended
desktop okay so these last two arguments
so here's what the okay let's go back
page so those are constructors you need
to worry about
and then the CSS metadata is actually an
abstract class
you can't just instantiate a CSS
metadata you have to extend it to
provide a couple of methods that are
sometimes they are boilerplate but
sometimes they are pretty pretty
involved I've looked at some of the code
in Open GFX and I've seen some pretty
involved thing tons in these two methods
actually the yet style bold property is
a pretty basic one you need to return
the Styla property for that instance and
in this case the s is going to be in
your code is going to be like the flip
pane or whatever custom component type
it is and the next question is this
settable and this is something that CSS
engine is going to ask when it's doing a
CSS passing a component when it sees
that it is a CSS properties can ask
itself a question should I set this
property and why would you ever want to
say no the number one reason you would
want to say no is because the property
is already bound to a different property
if you've ever bound a property in
JavaFX and then try to set that bound
property you get a nice big long stack
trace that says that was a bad idea
because I'm down to something else
already so this is where you can tell
the engine that I'm a bound property you
shouldn't try setting me and another
reason you might want to override it is
you might want to override the
traditional CSS cascading and say when a
user sets this value that value always
wins there's a few instances and Joe
opened JavaFX code where they do that
because it is surprising to the user to
have there
custom set code in code overridden by a
stylesheet is like I guess the the
super-important version of important the
CSS metadata methods and this is an
optional one that you might want to
override and that's get initial value
and the reason you might want to do that
instead of just using the one passed in
in the constructor is because the
initial value might vary based on the
component to the state of the component
that you're setting it on for example if
you have a text field you might change
the change it to be a white color if you
have a dark background or a black color
if you have a white background so this
gives you opportunities via the state of
your code to change it so how does this
all look like in code oh sorry I'm
really there's it there's a bit red show
code here up here okay
one last thing is the style converter so
this the CSS metadata is the hugest part
about getting your properties done once
you get over the CSS metadata it just
all is easy from there
but the last part you need is a style
converter and this is what takes the CSS
parser values and turns them into your
java data types and JavaFX provides a
pretty comprehensive list of most
typical style converters that you would
want to use again another pro tip they
do some strange things with doubles and
integers and shorts and long so you
actually use the size converter if you
want to get a double or an integer out
of your CSS properties it has some nice
implications of that if you're getting
an angle and it specified in radians
it's going to come back at you in
degrees so you know you'd by using the
size converter you also get for free
some of the unit conversions that
happens in the in the engine it's got
handlers for enum enum is that the the
odd duck because you have to specify the
enumeration as you get it now it's
easier to override these style
converters than it is to override some
of the more exotic stuff and that's
actually going to be discussed in a
3-star solution to this so finally how
does this all look like in code and this
is going to be the most code that you're
going to have to add to your program to
get each of your properties CSS style
it's kind of long you know who knows
probably the next year might submit
pash to open gfx to make this shorter
and deal with the basic case but this is
what it looks like right now so here we
set the property name is going to be -
flip - angle it is going to be a number
converter and the styler Bowl property
is the flip angle property from the flip
paym object and is it's edible only if
we're not bound and this is one of the
nice things about the JavaFX properties
when you make properties first-class
objects you can go into the property and
you can ask property specific questions
like have you been bound to some other
object okay step three once you have the
CSS metadata you need to make the
property itself style there whereas you
might have a style property of some sort
you would replace it with one of these
two columns of types and probably the
easiest thing to do is to take your
simple boolean property or simple double
property and make it a simple style
double property and when you the the
simple style of all series of properties
as we see right here these are all
already um coded in to handle all of the
the the heavy-lifting that needs to be
done to make it style of all all the
lifecycle interfaces that are being
implemented these style of all
properties don't have some of the simple
property logic already bound in but they
have all the style of a logic bound in
so that's a great starting place if
you're going to do not so simple style
properties so here's how it might look
like in code you know here's four
different ways you might do it version 1
and version 2 are the ones that you're
going to want to do most often you're
just going to want to create a simple
style property and reference the
metadata if you want to set an initial
value and this this this initial value
by the way it is separate from the CSS
initial value this is an actual initial
value in the code that will be
initialized whether or not the CSS
engine runs a pass on your code or not
these last two have to do with some of
the more exotic situations of JavaFX
properties if you want to spy specify a
different beam that is being applied to
or if you want to specify a property
name that applies to this and this is
actually kind of useful in tooling and
stuff like the the scene the scene
builder uses some of this
meta data so if you're gonna create a
custom component that you're going to
bring into some of these these toolings
the name of the property is is sometimes
more useful than it normally would be so
quick sidebar what if you want to use a
simple property that is a styled
property that is not so simple what you
would need to do is you would first you
got to think about why you'd want to do
it I found two instances in the open GFX
code of why I wouldn't want to do it one
of them is when you want to restrict the
values that you're gonna be allowed set
to it this is from the table header
column if you try and set a table header
to a negative value we are going to
force it to be 20 20 pixels wide so this
is one reason why you would override the
property you wouldn't let the property
set invalid values another one is if a
change to one property has a cascading
effect on the rest of the component for
example in bar chart if you change the
bar gap they're going to have to relay
out the bar chart so really the reasons
you wouldn't want to do as simple style
property have to do with why you
wouldn't want to do a simple property
there's a reason you would do a more
complex property you would just use this
dialog doublet property and do what you
would normally do and you begin
everything you would need in this style
of all now the things if you just use a
style the property the three methods you
would need to override or get CSS
metadata get beam and get name these are
pretty simple and again this you just
provide the CSS metadata that you've
defined before you can override any
other property methods for your desired
effect now the final step to get a CSS
table property we're almost there is we
just need to tell the CSS engine what
are my style properties and as part of
the styler Bowl interface you gain a
interface to get CSS metadata and this
you would return a list of all of your
style able elements now because you
returned a list this is not a static
method this is an instance so this is
the instance of your style of property
the instance of your component that is
going to be returning your style pool
property so if you want to remove a
style bill property that a parent
provides it's very simple you just don't
return it but on the other hand if you
want to have your parent classes that
will proc
still styler ball it is imperative on
you to on return those properties that's
where this code snippet the first two
pages actually deal with keeping the CSS
style properties from the parents so
this is a the the standard boilerplate
that I've seen a most of open GFX you
would take your CSS metadata and you
create your own list of your own
properties as a static field and then
you have a method that we return that
static field and so each you and each of
your parents has a static field and
method that enumerates these diable
properties you declare in your type the
next step is create a static final
variable continuous die levels and you
basically collect all of the styler
bolts from you and all of your parents
into this list and that's all a big
bunch of setup for an incredibly simple
method you just return the style of the
list if you do it statically you only
have to have it configured once and it's
going to work like magic so let's see
how this code works in practice so let's
see get check out styled Gradle run so
let's look at the code while this is
setting up to be run so what we've added
here is here we have up in the header
now the downside is this adds a lot more
boilerplate code to the header of your
code here we have up in the header we
have the CSS metadata all of the
rigmarole of enumerated value x' and
here we have the styler bill double
property so what we can do in the
stylesheet is we can now add - flip
angle 45 and that was a lot of work to
let your users do this one magic line so
now when we tell this control to flip
it's going to stop at 45 degrees and
that's one of the things that you just
need to accept when writing custom
controls for end-users is they're going
to overlook a lot of these things and
say hey that looks simple because it's
going to look like a magic trip to them
and the thing about a good magic trick
is is almost all entirely in the
preparation and it's almost all entirely
what the audience does not see so your
end-users using your custom control
won't see this but it will work like
magic
it'll be pretty slick so any questions
before I go on to the to star solution
and again if I'm going over these slides
and they don't look clear to you or you
have any questions just raise your hand
at any time and I'll make a point to
answer it during the presentation you
don't need to wait until the end so the
two star solution is to use
pseudo-classes and that's to apply
pseudo-classes to your style property
now pseudo-classes are really just CSS
classes by another name and by another
mechanism instead of using a dot to
specify our class you would use a colon
and what's different about pseudo
classes has to do with more of the life
cycle of what you're doing with with a
CSS really they're supposed to reflect
the transient state of a component stuff
that the user might do like moving a
mouse over it to change the hover on a
link or on a button or on some other
component to say that it has keyboard
focus things that are inherent to the
user interaction but not necessarily
inherent to the way that you code it so
for the example that I'm going to use
I'm going to add a front pseudo class
and a back pseudo classes flipper
component and that is going to tell the
end-user whether the front of the
baseball card or the back of the
baseball card is currently being shown
and in those cases just change the the
background from yellow to orange okay so
there's a lot it's a lot simpler than
creating a property in general and in
some cases it's tempting just to use
pseudo classes except for the
established practice of what they mean
so the first thing you would do is you
create a pseudo class helper field and
then you might need to initialize a
pseudo class if your pseudo class starts
off in the true state and then you would
need to update the pseudo class state as
state changes
now one thing pseudo classes are is they
are simply boolean x' they're either
there or they or not they don't allow
the end user to provide any more
information to the control they allow
the stylesheet to react to the control
so they're not a total replacement for
the for regular old CSS properties so
the JavaFX CSX
pseudo class class itself
all of the pseudo-class instances and it
always returns a singleton from the
method get' pseudo-class so here where I
say front and back if I call that again
in the future I'm going to get the same
instance of the pseudo class from there
no matter what now I still would
recommend using a protected static final
field to reference it that's mostly to
get better performance at runtime so you
don't have to go through the hash map
and look up patch and bring it back
every time you'd want to use it it'll
just go a lot quicker the second step is
you might need to initialize the pseudo
class state and the method you would use
to do that is just to call the pseudo
class state change method you provide
your pseudo classes the first argument
then the boolean state whether the
pseudo class is enabled or whether the
pseudo class is not enabled now this
method is actually a convenience method
on the node object if you were to take
something that is not a node and you're
going to implement pseudo class support
for it you would need to return the
method get pseudo class States with an
observable set but since almost all your
custom controls are going to extend node
it's going to come you're just going to
be able to use pseudo class state change
and letting know do all the heavy
lifting for you and the third step is to
update the pseudo class as your pseudo
class state changes and generally
speaking you're going to want to change
it as the state change it on the
application thread I've nearly said
event dispatch thread JavaFX it's the
application thread and that's the one
that you're going to want to change it
on and Method you might want to do that
honor in invalidated methods in set
methods and change listeners and
validation listeners but in my case for
this example we're actually going to use
another method that I've gathered
together when we do the updates to the
transform so we do the updates to the
transform we are going to also check to
see if the front is visible and that the
front is visible set the front pseudo
class if the front is not visible set
the black set the back pseudo class so
let's see how this looks in code
okay great run while it runs I'll look
at the code so here in the code Oh we'll
come back to the bonus bed really
quickly but I have the front of the back
sitting to yellow or orange depending
upon whether the front or the back so
here we've changed the border to yellow
and as we flip it over when it flips
over the back it changes to orange I
don't think I've chose particularly good
colors for the screen I probably should
have taken yellow and purple as very
contrasting colors as you can see as it
flips over from one side to the other it
changes and again in the animations it
gets it to now one bonus trick that you
can do with pseudo classes is you
probably notice from the code is that
you can do random acts of pseudo class
you can set pseudo classes on any other
random object whether or not is your
custom control now with great power
comes great responsibility you don't
want to abuse this and if you if there's
cleanup that needs to be done it is your
responsibility to clean it up but if you
want to take a slider if the slider
value is greater than 270 degrees you
might want to say that the pseudo class
is hot and you might want to do
something fancy like set the background
color the tractor red when it gets hot
so you can do pseudo-classes on any
random object you don't have to do it
just for your custom control it actually
has some nice nifty side effects if you
know you could you could actually change
it you could have two stops you could
have cold warm and hot you could you
could do various degrees so that it
could change to very certain levels and
you could have react in theory to any
other and the other control you might
have a separate control then that says
that things are going bad and change the
screen to red unrelated to the user
interactions so pseudo classes can be
used in any instance on any class
whether or not you're inside the object
or not so any questions about pseudo
classes yes
and see this time
yeah so the question is sometimes I lose
other properties when the pseudo class
matches that has to do with the CSS
cascading of the properties and if you
were to change the ordering that you
declared the pseudo class if you
declared your style sheet before the
Caspian style sheet then the castle you
might win on some of those properties we
I'm not I'm not an expert on the way
that the the rules fall down and go down
but generally speaking the last set
value wins and if yours matches just as
well as any of the other properties all
the properties are going to set and
that's probably where the inherits flag
comes in in some of the properties yeah
it's that's that's just a CSS Evo
secrecy probably that might be a good
thing to ask in the CSS gold nuggets
talked by Jasper Potts no or the CSS
deep dive actually CSS deep dive
probably the best one that David grieve
is having on later this week he would he
probably he knows way more about CSS
engine than I do because he writes it
maintains it okay any other questions
all right so what I want to submit of
this talk to Java wine I thought that
the adding exotic values into the CSS
would be a lot easier than they were and
it can be done but not quite in this
style that I expected so what we're
gonna do in here is we're gonna write a
style converter that is going to take
we're going to create a flip duration
CSS attribute and we are going to
control it via how long it's going to
take it's going to turn a duration for
us the CSS engine in JavaFX right now
does not let me get the new version data
type not agree get Ranji word get to
checkout all right so what we're going
to do is we're going to implement this
this two seconds in 250 milliseconds now
now the disappointing thing that I found
out about JavaFX is that you cannot add
your own custom data units but it can
parse any old string out there so you
just treat your string like it would be
in any old custom format there's there's
good reasons for that because
GSS only to find certain units and if
you were to start adding random units
you might just break the CSS standard in
general and it you know the more we do
outside of the standard the further
further we get the harder that the lower
the value CSS gets inside JavaFX so the
fact that it only supports in this
method is fine it just wasn't what I
expected but it can be done so the way
that I implemented to take these
two-second and 250 milliseconds in the
flip duration is I implemented a style
converter I created my own style
converter now it's a generic object lots
of lots of the JavaFX code loves the
generics and this is probably in a
poster child for use of generics in java
so v takes on one of three values that
i've seen in the code it can either be a
string or it can be a parsed value note
these three dots I'll come back to that
later or it can have an array of parsed
values because as you know in CSS you
can do all sorts of goofy things like
let's see FX background in sets one two
three four so i specified the four sides
of the border and then I can do another
series of borders onto it I can nest it
there's all sorts of interesting things
that parsers actually quite clever about
handling and quite efficient about
handling so that's where this parse
value comes in and T is of course your
data type now these three dots I was
talking about that can be one of string
parsed value pay attention to three dots
or parse value of araignee recursively
and in the code I've actually found an
instance where it actually encode today
nests up to three levels deep of nested
generics an amazing thing as it works so
that's you know well I think it's a
poster child for how nested generics can
actually work well now when you write
the style converter there's really only
one method that you have to overwrite
and that is the convert method it's
going to give you a parsed value in a
font of your arguments and from that
parse value you're supposed to tell it
what the Java object type is that you're
going to get back why is the font passed
in the font is passed in as the
in CSS you can set sizes relative to the
current font so what the CSS engine is
going to pass in to you is what it
believes should be the fonts for that
note at that time and it takes into
consideration if it's a text note what
the final that text note is because
unlike swing not every component has a
font property but the CS engine CSS
engine does have a font property for
every note so like the region doesn't
have a have a font itself so that it
passes it in for you so if you're
specifying the height of your VBox in
terms of MS or X's it provides the value
for you so you can calculate it now like
I said at the beginning of this section
you cannot add new new units into the
CSS parsing so the workaround is you
just put it inside a string you can put
anything in the string and you can put
any complex and arbitrary value in a
string that you want and just treat it
like a string that's what's magical
about this this little backdoor then
this won't work you can't specify a new
value because I looked at the code it's
a really fast switch statement that
enumerates the specific codes and the
default case does not have a situation
for new random units just probably a
good thing because we don't want to get
too far from the way CSS works so here's
what it looks like in code and this is
in about three pages for my converter
from a string Twitter ation first i
numerate what i might expect for my
units put them in an array you know this
is just CS 101 the the convert value is
the actual CSS part here we're receiving
where we receive a parse value of string
and a font we just take the string start
out with Millie's see if it ends with a
with a different unit and we change it
and once we get the unit we parse the
long and we go fall through the rest of
it and apply it as we need to and we
return a literal JavaFX duration object
and what this object is run is this is
the animation in my CSS that I'm using
here this 2 seconds in 250 milliseconds
of how long it takes to flip so because
the front is showing it's going to take
two seconds to flip over to the back
side
and because the back is showing it's
going to take a quarter of a second
because I said that animation up when
the front is showing it doesn't change
halfway through I've set that control up
it's only respond on a flip request
we're right so those are three video
game approaches of how you can apply CSS
styling to your custom component and
again this this code is on bitbucket
under the JFX custom CSS code we could
get all the various codes and you know
being a total total good person each
branch corresponds to each of the
various versions and you can look back
into the code diffs and see what changed
between the two versions of what I
needed to do to make it do what it
needed to do to become a property a
style liberal property so are there any
questions anything that wasn't clear did
I technically get any of this wrong sure
there's someone here that knows more
than me
yeah it for the ones that are stylin
well I'm actually probably my last talk
is tomorrow morning so I actually have
two days off at this conference I'm
probably gonna start adding some more
style of properties into the controls FX
probably the first time gonna have the
ratings control you know the number of
stars the current rating is is perfect
for CSS styling but yeah I I've
contributed a little bit to it but not
nearly as much as Eugene and Jonathan
it's the metadata the metadata is the
only real scary part about it once you
get that done you just get your style a
little property it's you know like I
said it's a magic trick there's a lot of
scary preparation goes up into it and
you know if I have more time to
contribute probably the next year you
know I'd probably get some more standard
on metadata you know because almost all
the metadata just asked says it's this
property and don't set it if it's
bindable so probably here I mean one or
eight to release I'll get a contribution
in so you can just instead of creating
that big scary anonymous inner class you
just use a boilerplate class and
reducing the number of in Thomas classes
will also increase performance so we'll
have a nice side effect there too
okay well uh any questions coming in no
questions okay um you know this this you
know once you get the metadata down and
you get you get that loading Stovall
property it's actually a lot simpler
than it looks
and I was surprised when I went through
this is like wow that's that's really
all there is to it you know after I got
over the hill of writing the CSS
metadata and that's really the hardest
part I've actually done this before in
the JavaFX to code and it it was
actually more difficult in the JavaFX
tool and they did more than change the
change some of the properties they
changed also some of the interactions
they've cleaned it up and simplified it
a bit in JavaFX 8 so it's it's it's
really you know it's easy as a as a
control author to to write these so that
they can be used and consumed in a more
generic fashion so if there are no other
questions I see no reason to keep
everyone here until 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
