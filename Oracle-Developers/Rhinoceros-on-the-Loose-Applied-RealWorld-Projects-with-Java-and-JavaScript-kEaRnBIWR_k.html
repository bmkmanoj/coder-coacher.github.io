very excited to be here it looks like
rest of the people who interested in
JavaScript and ask for an in enterprises
in practical attending another session
for java champion java rock star at them
being so it's fine you will have a great
time here i will i'll promise you so my
name is victor and i'm here from New
York work there as the software engineer
and today I'm going to talk you about
the nest corn and I think the main theme
of my talk today is going to be this
Chinese curse so and this is like very
you know if you want to wish something
to add really bad to your your enemy
your nemesis you usually say that if you
Cheney's guy so and we right now today
we're living in this interesting times
we're living in the times and in the
software industry everything is changing
so fast so last year in the jar one they
announced the natural project Nash horn
and the open-source did now we have
different news I will talk about this
little later so everything is changing
everything is very very fast paced and
this is exciting to live in this it is
in this time so I don't know why Chinese
people maybe they need to they want to
be the calm they want to be you know in
the safe safe place so first of all
every time I speak in the conference
center I understand why people should
care why they should come to my to my
talk so when I try to understand why you
hear something it's a Java right you all
excited about new features in Java and
Java 8 brought lots of new things
including the project NASCAR the new
implementation of JavaScript engine so
also because we're talking about NASCAR
and JavaScript you most likely somehow
involved in JavaScript maybe you try it
on the front end maybe you did
previously some scripting before I know
something like you feel like your
JavaScript enthusiastic oi and
apparently someone just couldn't fit
there all right so you can ask who's
talking and why
listen this guy so I work as a software
engineer and the consultant and the
financial industries I do front-end
back-end integration different types of
projects and also i wrote this company
and we do lots of things we're doing
like mobile development development with
the hybrid for example this is like a
huge system that allows you make build
like a payment systems and etc and we
also do open source we have a bunch of
projects open sourced for different
serve like productivity tools also I
Corgan either of priests and Java user
group and co-author off one book and you
want us to do you really actually know
JavaScript as a matter of fact I think I
do because I'm co author of this book
and this book is available in the stores
right now and is a matter of fact I have
it one copy here with me and I will give
it to one person before the very
interesting question that will just
knock me out so this is like a very cool
book if you work on the enterprise's
lots of frameworks covered sorry for
product placement but I think here this
is a really interesting book for if
you're developing like a JavaScript
applications all right imagine this this
the guy lady is a Java developer a
couple years ago when you asked java
developer about javascript he actually
doesn't care because Java developers
care about memory leaks threading
everything fast everything smooth
performance all this stuff no one cares
about the fancies snowflakes on the page
no one cares about the things like make
this different UI fixes for the hipsters
for these new kids that they just
graduated from some University to try to
do something they did try to make
something fancy nice-looking it's
nothing for comparing to trading or
companion to performance but with these
new trends and I see like a tremendous
amount the session this year compared to
last year about the JavaScript and Java
and even typescript which is a sort of
language that you use to compile down to
javascript actually java developers do
care about this thing so and this is why
we're here and to learn more so this is
the nice thing I think we start with
JavaScript who can tell me what this
actually print as a matter of fact it
actually doesn't make any sense for like
the same person as you are guys because
we trying to get something from number
three use notation of sort of index axis
we try to get something from SS array or
maybe it's a property by we try to get
something from / index let's actually
try to see what we can work in we can
get absolutely right so with net scored
these days we got new tool called jjs
which called Java JavaScript it's
actually wrapper around the NS corn jar
that allows you to enter to interactive
console and when we type something like
this oops it's my looks like it's
something left from I need to restart it
alright so we have now empty session
sort of and when I try to do something
like this nothing has happened when i
try to print it oops
I'm just kiddin and yeah correct I'm
fine because it's like I said it's a
sort of gibberish it doesn't make any
sense of course and but with this sort
of thing with this kind of the hack we
can do very interesting thing as a
matter of fact so what what doing here
the value of three will be casted to
object of type number and for because
it's an object in JavaScript you have
the prototype property which refers to
sort of object your parent object sort
of in JavaScript this is how you usually
do on inheritance there's a call there's
term prototypal inheritance there's not
really inheritance as we used in Java so
what we can do in object prototype we
can assign value to property by index 3
and when I sign this property to some
some string in this case Joe one and if
we can do this
now if we do the print will see this as
a matter of fact if I do print for I
will see the same because by the same
reason for value for will be converted
to object of type number and because we
assign this prototype to any object of
type number and assigned this sort of
very strange thing here we will see for
each and every number if you try to
invoke by index we will get this same
result sounds like sounds like lots of
fun and you should expect lots of
interesting code but actually this kind
of concepts are if you use it it
properly it will actually give some huge
benefits if you want to learn more about
this what and funny things that might
happen in JavaScript I highly recommend
if you haven't seen yet I highly
recommend to see this talk it's like a
five-minute talk by gentleman from I
guess he's from Ruby community and the
heat ultra also took some very
interesting syntactical which is like
the valid from the syntactical
perspective but absolutely doesn't make
any sense in the terms of like a real
software so but again we Java developers
we like use classes we know there's lots
of frameworks and how we can use a
javascript from the Java since Java 6 we
already have the ability to do that with
scripting API it's actually called
scripting for java platform jsr 223 and
there's a bunch of AP is that this GSR
defines the define script manager and
script manager gives the access to
script engine a script engine and get
actually eval this JavaScript code so we
have this in line string which
represents JavaScript
and the when the wall will be invoked we
will see absolutely same result as we
see in interactive console so mm not a
big deal right but what NASCAR gives us
these days is to actually improve
performance and improve something like
this is like very generic you can use
any type of scripting language that can
implement this groovy does job JRuby
does even if you on the neck and you
know what is the applescript for
automation applescript actually
implement the this GSR if you're running
the apple java 6 thing you can actually
try to instead of net score and get food
applescript and at right p and you can
invoke your automation scripts from on
from Java it's also pretty cool thing so
but also if we want more something more
we want for example use some features
that developers of Nazareth nice corn
put there by by design to improve
something so at this point we need to
use DPI that an escort team provides us
it's a little bit different for example
get ng get script engine method in this
case can accept the options and with
options we can actually play around and
see different things for example with
jdk 8 Update 40 which will be available
as the release very soon I use like very
early access thing options like a
persistent cold cash can be available
what it does it's actually the Nash horn
works not as the regular JavaScript
interpreter it works as the sort of a
bytecode compiler first time it loads
the code try to compile it into bytecode
it so the next time it does need to
actually go back and try to really read
it and do all this interpretation once
again it
everything would be compiled the
bytecode it would be very fast so and
with the addition of the persistent cash
the network can save result of this
compilation as the file and the next
time when you start this natural engine
and if your I guess I'm time stamp or
maybe check some of the file that we
tried to execute probably it's probably
it's the checksum because we can use not
only files we can just pass strings also
and also you can disable some features
that allow you to access to Java code
for example i will i will show you a
little quicker we can do this so this is
very strange thing i'm trying to invoke
scripting epi from the script right but
it's it's nothing no one prevents us to
do this because it's absolutely legal
from the script we can get access to any
api a java api so in this case we're
using syntax that says we can load this
class for this type into javascript and
after that we can instantiate this guy
this guy over here um so when I run this
so when I me
I can run it from the current line using
these the ggs and I need to pass
scripting parameter and when i say ness
horn dodge ears it's actually execute
this code so pretty pretty what and
weird things but this is very powerful
and i will show you later how it can be
used in the for some actual practical
things so this ggs thing actually has
very interesting hiding parameters not
safe for for regal persons but I'm not
sure Adam being will not show this thing
definitely so and there is a net score
scripting API for this particular guy if
you want to stick to NASCAR you don't
want to use anything else why you want
to do this because maybe you just you
know you're ok with Java eat and you
don't need to any other permutations
like rhino invest yeah it's pretty
pretty real think it's available there
for free for you know so let's talk not
GS right so all these cool kids that
wanted to make some fancy you I they
also want to use the same JavaScript on
the server side because it's also cool
that they don't need to learn threads
they don't need to learn everything
because they know Larry JavaScript they
don't need to worry about things that we
worried a lot about servlets about
containers GBC all this stuff very cool
stuff then you can open any more because
the JavaScript allowed them to program
the web applications in the same way is
the programming a JavaScript on the
front end not read everything is one
single loop they ok they know like
things as share sharing something
between threads no context switching and
it's pretty fast as a matter of fact
because our no GS itself this is a set
of the framework in the api's but under
the hood of the nose es we have very
powerful
a engine so I want to make it clear so
net score is equally like does the same
thing as VA so it just interprets
JavaScript same thing as VA no GS
provides some sort of additional
libraries on top of deviate that gives
you access to file system to socket and
so far so also another great selling
point about no GS lots of software
available you see let's 97,000 packages
available I'm not sure about the quality
of the pet this package is because you
know there's a joke in JavaScript
community that number of the
conference's for javascript is even more
than number of the actual like a real
framework that the JavaScript guys uses
so still it's pretty pretty cool thing
and we have lots of things available in
Java since the nineteen ninety-five 20
years of development lots of jars open
source things and we have also enormous
amount of packages in JavaScript why we
cannot combine this beast world so why
we cannot run the null-gee as a pond JVM
it's a good question right as a matter
of fact we can do it so the as a part of
the representation last year with the
project Nash born I don't know but they
for some reason they so terrible with
naming they have like project Ness corn
and after theirs oh sorry project avatar
and there is a project avatar GS so for
good we don't have to deal with project
Avatar anymore so I will you know as a
matter of fact I aw totally written my
slides last night because of this Java
one it's called like conference driven
development because he gained something
something new I prepared slides to show
you guys the project avatar but they
said ok so no more project that what I
would throw it away forget about this it
was mistake but avatar GS it's actually
still there so and what it does is
actually implement some of functionality
that not guys implemented but for JVM so
you can use existing application written
in the only for node one hundred percent
uses node module systems and etc but
what about running it on the JVM so my
idea was just to go to internet take
first available more or less complex
example of application written in the
node and without any code change just
drop it and use it for for this today's
demo sounds like a great idea right ok
so I just find this you know ninja ninja
store thing I don't know so let me
actually show how this application it
looks like ok he looks like someone
actually holds the holds the port let me
change the port I don't want to waste
some time on the find out who is holding
it
okay so i started the Express Express is
the sort of framework in in node that
allows you to write like a web
application it's some sort of like some
sort of prototype for the store where I
can log in say my name is Victor and I
can buy some stuff for my ninja thing
whatever lots of things it's actually
doesn't do much but it demonstrates some
interesting concepts in not verification
to welcome so for example in my job can
you guys see screen well can you see the
files on the right side yes great so
once again so this is my project
structure let me clean it a little bit
so in this project structure in this
folder where I have all this javascript
thing I have one entry point for this
application called a PPG s also because
I just took it as is from from this
internet there was some readme file
everything is inferring is great also
very important thing that the guys from
the node community they also come up
with the idea of package management so
everything that you saw in the previous
slide with this 97 things available to
you using the utility called NPM this
comes with the note and this NPM tool
there just you can say NPM install in
this case Express and it will download
this modules and put it on the right
structure and after that you can require
which is syntax in JavaScript it looks
like important in our world in Java
world I will show you in the code so
oops
so in this case when I say require
Express note actually knows that it
needs to go to node modules find Express
and initiate this object occult Express
so there's a bunch of modules that this
application uses Express like I said as
a web framework it's very convenient to
set up different routes you think about
this something like develop them like
restful web services when you're just
annotating something and some some
poachers pretty much the same but you
can do with JavaScript synthetics Jade
this is a very popular templating engine
so you don't need to write raw HTML for
example and you can write some templates
using the syntax like this so this is
visually there's no bracket and there is
no like HTML things but you can do
inheritance of different things for
example this this particular file this
particular piece of the code actually
inherit some some some common layout and
there's the syndics for different for
example for for ids for classes and etc
and we can also include an additional
footers additional a template which is
which is sort of like a nice way not to
deal with the HTML open closing brackets
everything would be pre-purchased on the
on the run time there is also same same
thing for for developing the full not
dealing with the CSS it's the stylus and
etc I am there some some actually
handcrafted code which is related to
this application logo style sheets some
store which contains information about
items etc so so far so good right so we
have it
we have it as a native not app let me
actually run it as the Java app right so
for that I will make some additions
there's one gentleman in internet
somewhere then developer his Twitter and
he developed some extension that deal
with the the air Saudi because we ate in
the nest horn the deal with sector Isis
differently so we also for for better
which presentation we have this
extension I just took it from from him
looks like it works you know it's open
source what possibly could go wrong and
again i'm also including this piece of
my code to show you that actually
invoking java things from the javascript
which is actually node application for
that i will need to have something more
in my class pass so in this case if you
can see this this is dying Lib file
which is a dynamic module and this is
native thing so this is should be
compiled for your operation system if
using linux it would be a so i'm using
mac OS it's dialing if it's the windows
a dll so this thing uses some native
some native things to access HTTP parser
and some access to to the file system
pretty much they took it from the note
because not uses the same approach and
also in my class pass i also can see i
will show you i also need to have the
avatar GS jar this is one one guy so i
have to i have jdk 8 and i have the
avatar jizz jar so for that
because you know we we in a job because
we in a Java we actually need to write
some Java to start but we can actually
do without this but i found this way
also very convenient so you can back
this application some and run it from
the comment line for using bill to what
this is exactly what i'm doing so at the
first step we're trying to load this
native library into our java java
process the delat RGS library and after
that avatars GS gives us this server api
and with this server p i would pass this
the AP p GS as a matter of fact i didn't
show you how the node actually starts
this process it's very simple basically
you can do an old and AP p dot g s
that's it so here we doing pretty much
the same for for java so in this case
we're wrapping this thing server domain
and we passing this of the AP pgs file
here also there is some own small small
augmentations for example here on the
very beginning I'm just checking if it's
am i running under real thing or running
under v8 so if it's running under v8 I
will not blow these files it's just
because it doesn't make any sense me it
doesn't understand Java but if it's nice
for if it's Java this these guys will
felt a lot so without further ado I will
run this
so I use the Gretel to run it because
for some reason IntelliJ IDEA doesn't
deal good with class pass maybe I don't
know how to do it right maybe it's my
fault not until JD as you can see here
this guy was in the world from minus
horn the GS this is was invoked from my
errors extension javascript file so now
imagine we took it without any code
change slide which doesn't count
actually we took the existing app and
brought it to our let me show you that
I'm not not lying and you can see actual
application and so like I said first
time this would be a little bit slow
because Nash horn needs to process
everything and create actual bytecode
out of the JavaScript because it's a
huge know that there's lots of net score
needs to compiled Express Jade stylus
other things it will take time but the
next time when we try to do it would be
almost immediate
so when I log in and I see absolutely
same application same functionality
absolutely identical behavior no one
actually notice the difference except
that this application only prints this
thing so cool stuff we took the existing
app we add some Java if we need to we
included this in our app and we're
running under java 8 success right yeah
I'm not performance guy i'm not selling
you performance my i have like up a
couple slides with recommendation what
to read about performance as a matter of
fact Marcus yesterday said they will be
v8 on performance so don't worry about
this they will get there they have very
smart people they're awesome awesome
awesome team they will they will make
performance closed last year last year
the performance was even worse and they
were for the last year especially with
the release of this eight-point update
40 they did tremendous changes in the in
the performance so don't worry about
this just you know concentrate on
solving the problems of clients and I
think the Oracle guys will fix it it's
because i have a huge trust in this team
if they not will be you know laid off or
I don't know it's yes it's slower and I
will actually can show you so i will i
will share this slaughter this code and
you will see for each never request the
Express actual prints out the latency
for particular thing so how long it took
you know to reset to send a response
back and you will actually do your
kitchen compare if you're running under
node and if you're running on the nest
horn yeah please never
um well come on it's it's it you can
always have preheated the JVM it's not a
big deal some some tools like gretel
they saw this problem by have the
preheated vm if they need to deal with
big groovy dsl that they use for the big
big for big builds so we can optimize it
it's also matter of the we used to wait
for six or seven minutes to websphere to
start come on guys this is just a couple
of seconds it's it we will get there it
definitely will be better again if you
feel it's not very not very fast your
machine just you know get new machine
it's very cheap we heard it a lot on
this conference right memory chip card
ref is cheap okay sounds like it's sort
of very not ill not very little thing is
happening here right we were even
walking Java from from JavaScript and
etc but let's see that we're not alone
here so there's a bunch of project
they're already doing this for some time
the vertex I don't know how many of you
familiar this but i will tell about
vertex in couple minutes the avatar 2.2
I yeah probably point to be there moved
like a project avatar will call avatar
just water and there's a not dine so the
vertex how many of you actually heard
about the vertex okay cool so the vertex
is very cool project is actually on it
actually embraces whole lot of things
that available to developers in the Java
platform so vertex is actually framework
that allows you to write also web
applications sort of like real-time
meaning that you want to do some fancy
stuff you want to send messages to the
client use web sockets those are
side push sort of like real-time thing
and it doesn't it doesn't depend on the
servlet API it does require you to have
container you just start the Java
process and you're good to go you have
like a full-blown server and the most
important thing that you can write the
vertical this module in any language
that you want you want to write a Java
in the JavaScript JRuby guru a giant
enclosure Scala even PHP UN PHP starting
with version even today they have module
that allows run everything on the net
score but it will require the Java 8 in
the future next version that scheduled
for the end of this year version 3 will
be minimal requirement for the vertex
would be version of java jdk 8 and net
score would be used by default so and
one of the coolest thing in the am in
this vertex is actually you also they
have to deal with threads you can forget
about all this horror things about
threading like all the school guys and
not in environment because you can span
additional verticals instances and they
can communicate to each other using like
a message passing through event bus and
most importantly they even have a client
for this message bus on the browser so
basically your application can deliver
messages from from your back end right
to the browser immediately a very sleepy
eye works great it might use web sockets
if your browser doesn't support it can
fall back on to other mechanism so also
they announced that they're going to
support some distributed data things I
guess it would be something similar to
any like distributed cache that
available today
so it's actually pretty cool project
open sourced and now it's under eclipse
foundation umbrella but the team
develops it there's a gentleman from the
neti team if you hurt Nettie's day as
synchronous and in our framework for
writing like real Network intensive
applications he's also not one wire his
oh here's the team member to Fox and
they both works they both work on the
unread hat so the avatar 2.0 I don't
know anything about this except because
actually I learned this like couple days
ago because there was nothing in
internet before that they just announced
it and they just show couple slides they
show some damage but there's they they
just didn't show some code which is
unfair young with developers here we
want to see some code right so
integration of if nice corn out of the
box presumably the this also sort of
like a polyglot platform so right now
they support javascript and java pretty
much your programming model will we look
like as the i just showed with this
wrapper but we don't need to write this
wrapper it will give you a framework
will give you everything that you need
to start with so and actually you don't
need to even be you know java so you
will start this just from the i guess
from the comment line is i guess from
from the things that i show I saw here
on the conference I I guess support
ninety-five percent of an old API I have
a type of here why ninety-five percent
because um the v8 is the google project
and v8 itself and some v8 itself can
provide so-called like extensions that
might be some some modules can use this
extensions next one I guess also avatar
for I guess maybe legal reasons or
something like that decide not to dig
into this proprietary extensions
and this is why some some five percent
of the modules that doesn't support this
will not be available in in the avatar
cool thing is that also you don't need
to deal a lot with the databases and
work some gdp see low level code they
will give the model store api for for
working with databases and also they
said there would be some sort of event
bus support you see where I'm going
right but they cannot actually propagate
message to the browser yet but again it
still open store JavaScript libraries we
can we can we can integrate we can play
around with this it's already just
support distributed storage by some
coherence and also they said that maybe
right now you cannot use but in future
they will you can use them j JK our API
and use any implementation we'll see and
like I said nothing I'll try to keep in
touch with them to to to learn more
about this but still nothing is there
except likely to talks and some
assumption of other developers so as you
can see they pretty much doing the same
thing right they doing the same
directions and it actually is good that
they drop this very odd thing called
Project guitar because it requires
dependency on the GlassFish it gives
some very strange UI framework that
supports some jQuery adult you think so
they decide to concentrate on things
like like these frameworks to
implementing microservices maybe or
Suffolk for the Internet of the things
world so not dying is also one project
that you might want to look at if you
interested that kind of things because
not dying is an implementation of not
API
from the redhead they not use nests were
they using dad I'm Jess which is also
implementation of the JavaScript engine
I don't have answer about performance
unfortunately I didn't have a chance to
measure it and what good thing about
down dine GS is that it can be run on
java java 7 so if you have three key
requirement to have java 7 and you want
to try to something first i guess the
the digest would be faster than ryan of
it for sure so you can give a short for
dungeons and this node API will be
integrated in in the vertex in 3x branch
all right so as I said there is a
multiple talks in this jar one I would
like you to pay attention to this for
really awesome talks if you wanna like a
chap the things about the javascript in
the Java world i highly recommend this
so this is a very practical and very
interesting presentation you can also
see the performance of grads there they
have it here this is this story from the
Avatar guys this is the story from the
Marcus like a grand about the
performance of the nest horn it's also
very practical talk not from the Oracle
guys I highly recommend this talk it's
very lots of interesting thing there so
I have time to do to talk about some
questions
I for what so yeah there is a yeah there
is a there is a framework FS it's a it's
already implemented a note and there's
JavaScript no no no no no no ok so once
again you may have to run note at all
you don't have to have it even install
your machine the only one thing that you
might want it to have it is convenient
because NPM if you want to use NPM
install and the download stuff this is
why you need to have not if you don't
want you could just go to download this
modular zip file and zip it in the
directory under node modules pretty
mention p.m. does the same and
everything would be would be handled by
avatar GS library Nash horn is the
JavaScript engine that interpreted right
like a compiler JavaScript everything
will be done by avatar GS this native
native library + jo APR yeah yeah yes
i'm working in maine in a job
customers
but I still have some convincing them
that it's a good idea to incorporate
choice given to corporate good selling
point so I would say like you know you
need to think about like a three things
that proprietary us so JavaScript can be
can be can be available to you in two
forms you developing the Java on the
front end you're doing lots of
interesting fingers html5 and you
already have developers who know
JavaScript second thing if you want why
you want to incorporate the with Java
again if you have some some people who
already worked with node and they doing
something in the North world also this
is this is you can integrate to your
your project and the third thing you see
you can use the JavaScript for person
for automation you can use scripting to
write instead of using this odd bash
script you can use JavaScript to write
scripts in an evoke java so as a matter
of fact I can show you the you can stop
by after I'll show you some code that
you can actually in JavaScript query
database from the comment line it's also
very powerful for yes absolutely if yes
yes exactly if you can do this in your
Java API if you have servlet we can do
it with the JavaScript so the purpose of
the Avatar GS is to actually run
existing modules written in JavaScript
which is depend on the foreign API which
is API of node but still if you have
nests horn API or you can use GSR API
to work with JavaScript you can do
whatever you want but I showed like I
will I would give a link to example
where I can use like GDB see Rob jdbc
from JavaScript known as no no no no
avatar nothing just use just plain old
java stuff yeah I don't know they doing
weird so they doing because it's
C++ is written in C++ and they're doing
lots of optimization which is not
available maybe 44 nesslun guys again
i'm not expert in performance i highly
recommend find this video of marcus it
will blow your mind it's awesome lots of
like actual meat end of performance he
explains the things
they they not there's no threats in a
sense of that we used to have there is a
the model engine itself can be whatever
it is but as a developer through the API
you have you don't have access to any
tracks javascript is a single-threaded
everything runs on the loop and you can
also just assign some callbacks it's a
synchronous it's not the multi-threaded
yeah yeah but with Java you have threads
like I said and you can with JavaScript
you can instantiate thread and use the
threat from your JavaScript from your
note app so it's quite powerful if you
if you like miss your threads in your
note world welcome to to my world of the
nests horn and avatar everything is
there yep for production no i don't use
because i don't have any projects that
use java 8 right now this is everything
that I to you is my personal things that
I'm personally interested in and I see
lots of things but I use JavaScript in
some projects as the scripting AP API
for my job yeah yeah because it's
available out of the box and for example
I use it in the reporting gap we're
doing some we want to do some scripting
and we will pass this script to the
Rhino but once it would be the job it
will be widespread I don't need to even
revert the code because I use standard
API yeah
so angular is one hundred percent
framework for writing web pages so from
the perspective of the JavaScript if
you're running valid JavaScript you can
run it through the nests corn into some
validation if you care about this for
example you can include in your build
and do a validation to check if your
developers actually you know don't
forget some semicolons comas and etc but
if you asking me about front-end
experience yeah I do I actually do a lot
angular so and we actually doing it yes
you could everything that you can do
with selenium you can remove and use
directly Java API but protractor it
gives you against nice CPI to deal with
your test dsl and injections and things
that you can stop by we can talk about
this because it's not maybe not everyone
is interesting about fronted some stuff
but any any other questions about
suicide thing so there's my personal
project I putting like different weird
things that I found interesting I
putting it there my demo of this net
node and avatar GS integration will be
there as well there's a even example how
you can build web applications you can
actually build the application dropped
on the GlassFish and after that
everything logic can be written on
JavaScript so I can invoke my javascript
stuff from the from the restful web
services and etc as a matter of fact
thank you very much for your time I
really appreciated that I thought that
would be less people it was very nice to
talk to you guys if you have any
questions you can ask me in the Twitter
I should
make it a little bit bitter and yes i
still have a book so yeah because i like
the questions about JavaScript and there
may be some some front that stuff I will
give this book for the gentleman you go
enjoy thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
