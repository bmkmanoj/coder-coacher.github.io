coming actually this is a very weird
time I think for 4pm so I really
appreciate the crowd and apparently I do
appreciate that everybody loves internal
things I guess right everybody likes it
and wants to hear more about it so again
I my name is Anton lie and I'm a UX
architect and you'll be surprised I'm
actually within the oracle applications
user experience team I'm not part of
java java java team but then we actually
have a lot of collaboration projects
together working together and this is
part of the things that we do for makers
faire we're going to share you the
experience of what we did in there and
then show you possibly how you can start
your own stuff and make it work for you
and something that would be fun for you
or your kids to do so just just a quick
raise of hands for developers here
developers I'll default for you ok so
that's a fantastic time to work all
right so as you may know how about
statement that then I don't think there
is any much harbor statement we need to
talk about but one thing is if you ask
me anything about Larry Marcos of
saffron I don't know I have no
relationship with them but then I do
understand every stepping down but from
my understanding there he's actually
still in charge of a lot of things so
all right so Oracle Java sewing workshop
so we did this over a makers faire / /
just couple months back essentially we
made a sea of devices connecting to each
other so that's does everybody know
what's a raspberry pi is I assume quite
a lot of people knows okay so so we and
then also if this then that kind of
notion thank you yeah so so for us we
have to something called it this then pi
essentially we allow users to put in
inputs and are to indicate what inputs
they want to use to control
things so as you see here we have the
tweeter you can essentially if you say
tweet twitter i will look for certain
tweet and then once it we receive that
Twitter will do something except SMS
messages send a specific SMS message
through a number will do something we
have the rest free pies we this is one
of those and essentially there's a
little chit there that we integrate it
with and that's a ambient sensor as well
as a proximity sensor so if you move
your hand closer to the to the sensor it
will do something it will realize the
proximity so how close you are with with
this device and also if you flash a
flashlight on it it will recognize how
bright it is so that's another stuff
like an input to to be able control
certain things and of course makers fair
you know it's a family if and and a love
well yeah part of family event and
there's a lot of kids coming so we want
to make it fun for kids what can we
control we can control at that point in
time we can control the fan we can
control the Sphero anybody know what the
Sphero is so yeah perfect so I think I
have one here this is a sphere Oh ball
essentially this is a robotic ball you
can buy in a lot of places i think it's
an apple store sells it it's like 80 90
bucks but then what they can do is it
can change the color it can move in
different speeds and different
directions however you like by using
your smartphone but also it has we also
have the it also have api so that you
can integrate with it so for example
what we did is we use the raspberry pi
and in the grave of the 0 so that the
Murray Park can actually control this
fuel wall and also we have a robotic arm
which I'm showing you this year that's
the minimum serve i have here in the hue
lights oh so in the makers faire
actually we have like eight workstations
so that the user can put in the inputs
we have like another couple output so
these are the four physical outputs that
they can do and also they can also send
SMS for example
so it's my demos up it well my special
little bit different i'm going to show
you that then we'll right away so that
you can tell exactly what's going on so
again half a rest root pi which is a
workstation and then
and then over here I have a so called
the GUI for the for the user director
interact with it and this school is
actually a a we just use the HTML html5
JavaScript and the surf the web server
is actually running straight from the
Raspberry Pi as well so all the
technology were using we are using jetty
server we're using Java because Java is
now available and Java embed is
available and can be installed onto
these raspberry PI's as well so you can
try it and then on the other hand we
have the server which is the arms the
robotic arm server it's probably hard to
is for you to see it but there's
actually Raspberry Pi the back of the
robot and it's connecting to the robotic
arm so that it can be controlled so
without further ado so let's say I'm
going to move the tweet Twitter thing
down and as you see this is java code so
the kids actually writing Java and let
me say I want to move the right arm if
let's say I receive a tweet about Java
and then let me click enter so
essentially oh I already found the tweet
that's quite amazing so senior QA a
position anybody wants to go into New
York you can go there like right now so
so we received so so it's an ship thing
about this right this is all this
there's a lot of interactions happening
here but my computer is connecting to
the work station which is a web server
the web server we received a request
saying oh this is the input and output
dentistry done and then it's going to go
to Twitter and look for specific tweet
while I a tweet that with a specific
hashtag and then it comes back and they
realize okay it comes back and then I'm
going to look for the robotic arm and
then start moving the robotic arm so it
looks pretty simple from the UI which is
on purpose because i'm working on the
user experience team as i said and we
also try to possibly integrate this kind
of experience very simple experience
into applications
but of course not that colorful but
hopefully it will be nicely so any quick
questions how out and then out go on oh
ok so so this is a this is the demo go
back to the slides
alright so what have you seen
essentially you've seen the
possibilities and the horizon of
internal things there's yeah they're
just you can almost control anything
nowadays with the internet and sometimes
they're connected in some way you're
able to even able to program it user
experience as I said it's a first simple
interface and the setup is pretty easy
too it took me the snow with just in
about ten minutes to set up as long as
we have internet that's the main thing
and we do have a booth in Hilton Grand
Ballroom in the demo grounds so and we
have a set up there and we actually we
we extended our setup so that we have
added a porter and now you can actually
print your name print a little Duke logo
on there as well and then and then you
as a gratitude of token for you so so
stop by and take a look and try it out I
think that's a great experience and also
of course you can try sirable and also
we have the hue lights 20 and the hue
lights are the essentially some like
that you can
the one
hello yeah that sounds great yeah yeah
so for the experience also think about
the work you do right essentially you
you all usually wants to just move
things around you don't want for example
you create an expense report you
probably want to feel all the different
details about X each of the receipts and
things like that so what if we have the
Intel things we can scan it we can
recognize that the actual amounts and
then automatically process it through
the expense and then and then just what
you need to do is just take a look at
the prepared expense report and then
click Submit that's all you need to do
so so that's also something that we're
trying to do within Oracle to to make
that happen right so quick agenda
internal things and then talk about why
we use Java for internal things why we
think that makes sense we will talk
about the architecture is how we build
it and and then of course there will be
some controversial have discussion I
assume in terms of how you do in terms
of things but we can always have
discussions and that's just a good thing
mm okay so inter of things I tried if
you talk to you kiss or to your grandma
or grandpa I think I'll try to make it
simple like oh you can use a mobile a
smartphone to control a TV and it's
going through internet so so that's you
use a lot of times you may not think
that's enough things because TV and
smartphone you don't normally think of
it as inter of things but they are in
fact internal things and and you just go
through the connection and try to make
something work right and a lot of time
smart meaning Intel things so you see
smartphone smart TV and whenever you're
hurt smart that means a smart kid means
internet kids I guess okay so so what I
inter thing so it's this an entire thing
have you ever seen this before this is a
personal pie smart jacket so smart means
Intel things and it is a is a pretty
heavy jacket it has a rest rate high on
your right hand side a keeper on your
left hand side webcam with
microphone at the jacket out here a
speaker in color let's building arm
display there's 4-port USB solar
charging Wi-Fi hands-free voice command
extendable USB dongle when you're a kid
you probably want something like this
right frankly like for me well now it's
good I want a good jacket a powerful
deck and here you go we have a 6,000
canadian dollars and the cool thing
about it is if you see this comparison
you will be probably pretty happy that
was the fact that now with your android
phone or cell or iphone you can do most
of the things that you want here
hopefully you agree and the other thing
is that this guy don't have a parent
don't have the 3g or 4g module so if you
are out in the few you are out of luck
i'm not sure how i do you deal with this
jacket it's only Wi-Fi available and and
especially you can see so much features
right and if you look at android or iOS
iphone it nowadays don't need tell you
one or two key terms not like a list of
all things which is a big change in the
paradigm with tell ology it nowadays so
thanks for me i think that they are
anything ya again is anything that can
connect to the internet which google
glass what we're smart watches raspberry
pies and the one thing that i want to
focus on the fact that i do think that
for if you connect things together with
other other things so for example for
the rest reap eyes you have the
bluetooth dongle which other devices you
have other like a switch control that
can turn on and off certain things for
the I photo photo photo for the iOS the
headset with anything right so so an
example would be like a smart home
system I think that's more Africa
people everybody has a home hopefully so
at the top so second thing about your
own use cases so right now you can
program yourself have a good morning
with one and then the fresh I guess
using rest reprise using using these
smart devices and a lot of companies are
going on board right for Nast is being
bought by google and also all of the
shoe lights essentially as I have is a
wristband that can detect your your your
unique happy right so so once you wear
it you would they would detail oh and
authenticate you and so that everything
all your devices know who you are and
making sure that nobody else can open
yours safe or your door by by accident
and these type of things authentication
stuff security is definitely important
we're actually also looking into this
device which is caught a muse and it's
essentially happen that you wear on your
head and it detects your brainwave so
potential you can telepath and control
your smart home system by saying open
the fridge door and then it will open
the first store ah so so we're looking
into these things as well because we're
that's what I'll him does and then and
then this guy is essentially in the
detection for sole action so so when you
move your hand you will notice and then
it will it will try to understand the
action that you
did so so there's a lot of things going
on so something about it one one quick
example is let's say in the next day you
are going to see a CEO and you could
present something so you what you did is
you create a calendar event on your call
your calendar so now we since we are all
on internal things we can be smart
enough to realize this calendars event
is very important it will go ahead and
if you have hue lights at your home so
in the morning at 7am it will go ahead
and shine a different color than the
normal color so normally maybe green now
is like red ants blinking blinking
blinking blinking blinking telling you
to oh you need to wear a good jacket and
make sure that you're well dressed and
then make sure you're well prepared for
the calendar right so so there's just a
lot of examples they can possibly do
that can be convenient to yourself as
well as very useful to others that you
can potentially create a business of
your own to do these kind of things and
I'm just hit and that's why I'm here I'm
trying to make it very simple and show
you how easy this to do that do so and
also nowadays we'll talk about like
force for example before Steve Jobs
worth how about walk up and use you go
up and then you can start using it it's
very simple easy now with all these in
terms of things and all the way how you
can detect and how you can sense the
environment you can potentially just
walk up and for example your phone has a
GPS it knows where you are you can
already do a lot of things for you now
we have beacons we have NFC that can
exactly know what what who you are in
trying to figure out what you're trying
to do yourself and we're also looking
into those colleges as well so why Java
for internal things yeah as I said
earlier java and bed is available since
seven and now is eight so before you
cannot really install java on top of
these stress free pies which has a risc
processor and now you can
so so it means that expanded the whole
lots of devices that you can be
compatible when once you install the
same you can install Cinco everywhere so
its robust and secure I think everybody
knows that I don't need to explain that
it's architectural neutral and portable
so you can pour it to any devices you
want and that's really important
inheritance I really want to stress on
that point so so you realize that for
for for a lot of at least four when when
I was working on the one on the end of
things I realized that hey this device
needs security this device needs
networking this device needs how to
communicate right so if you use Java in
her senses provide a free for you and
then you can just add some modules and
then you can just extend it you can
implement the interfaces and everything
will work there is no trouble in figure
oh there there are certain things that
is incompatible because i am using
another interface and then of course
interop bility and standards you you can
use rest you can use web sockets you can
use HTTP connections everything is just
come available as standard for you and
then when you integrate with
third-parties is going to be very easier
and of course it's proven technology I
think everybody knows that and do does
anybody know what this is this card is
is a java car yep and you you realize
that properly in your wallet you have
one of those right I in my wallet I just
put a wet one and you see this little
thing that's the jophur card and this is
a JVM smallest gb am running on top
using java and we and right now i think
there's like 10 billion got these cards
it's in your credit cards everywhere and
you can actually buy your own developer
kit this is the developer kit that you
get and that's how it looks and then you
can program something on top of that
which is pretty cool story so small
so easy to use and that's why we propose
job we propose Java as the standard okay
so model I always try to keep things
simple again it's just client you have a
client you have some type of input
there's something in the middle which is
? specifically you can it can be
anything and they connect your device
that's what I want them and then and
then once you once you do that you can
start extending it when you're
developing your own application your own
internal thing so you can just start
adding a client another device in a
client in the device and then you're
done that is very simple and easy so for
the basic architectural abstraction I
would like to make it just you have the
communication layer which needs to talk
to the to the devices you should
hopefully add a security layer so you
can use any type security layer in
statute what your specific use cases so
some requires more secure thing in some
doesn't there's the input driver and
input in the face for you two to do
stuff so for example I will show you the
ambient sensors or other things device
wise same thing you definitely the
communication security there essentially
there is a pairing of those two and I do
really suggest after after working on
the makers faire on the Internet of
Things we realize that we need a some
sort of reservation system so there
could be multiple users trying to access
the same device at the same time so if
your device is not supposed to be used
by multiple user at same time you need
some self a reservation system so that
you can make sure that only one user use
it at a time and also queue it up so
that the other user will be of weapon
available after the first one is gone if
it's done and then finally some sort of
output driver so for our setup we have
the laptop running a restroom
acting through a raspberry pi the rest
of a pie is running on chatty server so
that it serves the web content and then
of course we're running java and then we
start adding multiple of them and then
the on the other hand we have raspberry
PI's just like here we have the robotic
arm that is connected to the to the
Raspberry Pi so we do the same thing and
by the way I'm peace you don't really
have to have to do a one-to-one mapping
app at then for us we want to make it
like a sea or rest revising we did a lot
of things so we made one for each but
then then you can actually do whatever
you like and of course there's the
internet connecting to them and then one
another another thing that which I'm
probably not going to talk too much
about it at the scariest surface but
then this is really important because
you never when you start up a device you
either need to know the mac address or
the well you should or the IP address or
some sort of identifier or some sort of
surface you realize that it's a specific
surface so that the client understands
what it is and be able to connect to it
and then do something so the discovery
surface is actually quite complicated
it's the relatively complicated part but
then that needs to be done in order to
make sure that it's working for example
because lots of times your router may
give you like a dynamic IP and dynamic
IP wouldn't work for well so in that
case for example for us we make it
simple since every of the Raspberry Pi
has a ethernet ethernet card and that
even the car is there's a desa that's a
versus there's a unique MAC address so
so we just rely on that and then every
time when it starts up we actually send
the IP address over to the internet or a
specific to outreach discovery surface
so that all the other audio devices know
about the existence of this device and
then also can recall
the IP address so that we can
communicate to it so so actually when
i'm setting up here is also dynamics but
then once i plug in it just know about
everything about this network and
understand so they can send the execute
the command so for us for specifically
for our architecture we were using web
sockets we use web sockets everywhere
you can one of the main reason is
because we're using I'm sorry using web
server so web server use web sockets and
then also we can easily open up a web
socket in Java as well so so this is
like a perfect way of communication for
us security we added some simple
security the assist devices are not
requiring too much security involved
I'll as I said web server will use
section fi javascript Twitter we use the
Twitter API I'm going to show you a lot
of code as well that's all but then I'm
just simply talk about how we how we do
it so these are the input stuff we have
to twilio and then we have the pie for
Jay and I square C essentially they are
used to control the actual pins out to
to end up to the interface for the rest
or pies and those are open source and
available which is fantastic and of
course will you answer you can they are
also having interfaces for different
languages and you can just choose and
pick what you want so if you're a Python
or anything you can also do that too but
for us we're java and it worked server
side we have the WebSocket same thing
again I said through the communication
and the security as repair to each other
and then same thing we have the pie for
j i square C to control the fan in the
robot the blue cough library is
essentially used to establish any
Bluetooth connection and communication
so a sphere oh it's you can make kiss
with a sphere with bluetooth so that's
what we use to communicate with the
Sphero Hugh light they have specific
QAPI in rest so that's how we do it and
then
yeah again if you go to the demo Graham
you see the plotter and then we're just
creating our own self created some rest
surfaces so that on a motorcycle so that
we can just call to the rest services to
print out certain things ok so now I'm
going to the coaches to show you how
easy it is so hopefully you'll get you
started if you haven't started with
enough things so in JavaScript for
WebSocket klein all you need to do is
just to create a web socket specifying
the destination host name in the port
and after that all you need to do is
just to create some events so you have
the own an open event so when somebody
is creating a socket for you well with
you you go do something on message is
after its opened then you can start
sending messages communicating back and
forth so in that case you will get back
the you'll get back one whatever message
is received in the event oops and then
on clothes is when when when you're
actually the WebSocket is closing and
then on error is if there's something
happened in the in a web socket and it
errored out and you need you to handle
it some way that's it right hopefully
simple WebSocket server we're using Java
so so so this is actually good because
i'm showing you both the javascript
world and the Java world so for java we
just import or java web socket our
server that WebSocket server and then is
if you if you look at the slide that the
previous slides pretty similar you also
created a specific socket and then you
have couple functions on open function
on message function on clothes function
on the error message on their error
function so these are all standard stuff
and once you connect it and then you can
just use it Twitter we import the
Twitter for J which means Twitter for
java I believe it's a library that you
can just download and then all you need
to do is create a configuration builder
and Twitter factor it's just standard
setup gold and then the main thing is
you get a twitter instance and once you
get a twitter instance you can do
anything with it for example the example
I given here is just update status and
then send a specific message and then
you after the message to send you get
back a status in terms of whether it's
successful or not twilio they have SDKs
for it also in Java so you can just
create twilio rest client with a
specific off token in the account and
then you can start making calls so so
you do know what twilio to do is like a
text messaging surface so you would be
able to send messages you'll be able to
receive messages as well and we and they
will show it on on the phone so so you
can actually for example you can say I
want to text a specific message to this
phone number and it will do that so so
this is a very way we actually working
with this is a very cool way of just
programmatically be able to do something
around the phone area and we were
actually working with to do quite a lot
too so yeah if you never try to attract
it out and also I can show you a quick
timeout here if you like hmm and I think
that's really I actually didn't I guess
I'm getting running out short of time
with this I'm packing a lot of things
together so credits and this is some you
can also look into it so web sockets is
from Java twitter is from Twitter for
jada org 20 AP is you can get it from
developer twitter com I square C
proximity we actually you can go to this
google code site to download it and use
it pi for j is from PI PO che com blook
bluetooth is from blue dark and
Spiros from another github open source
and Phillips you lights from the
Mediacom developer stop me meet you back
home in the event of interests well I
have another session on Thursday it's
actually with OS n Oracle social network
and we essentially with how about vegans
we talk about how we can integrate a
social network with beacons and how how
the interaction will look like so if
you're interested in if you think that
my session is it sounds helpful come
first but then it's on thursday at four
fifteen saying about the same time this
book is emotionally center um tomorrow
we actually have a wearable speed up
which is headed by one of our team
member Alton Oberon and he essentially
he has like grow every day he wears like
10 wearables on his wrist haha so so
there's a lot of fun stuff that you can
see and will show you I think will show
you a lot of cool stuff there it's
Tuesday seven to nine p.m. is pretty
late but then hopefully you can make it
and then an end there there's of course
that's the Oracle Java song workshop
again is in the demo crown you 10 grand
ballroom which going to showcase what
I'm showing here the mini mini minimized
workshop here and then of course tonight
we have the orkut ology network stack
fast work what's going what is going 12
yeah so it should be fun that one should
be really fun okay and for me we have a
blog i highly recommend you to go there
if you interested essentially talk about
all the things that we're doing in our
blog we are the apps lab team again and
we essentially look into emerging
technologies we look into all different
kinds of things and try to see how we
can apply to the enterprise context
because we're from oracle applications
so if you're interested check it out
it's the
again it's the ABS lab calm and then and
then my tweet is Anthony I sly and my
email sent minute I start light oracle
com so that's sort of concluded my
session hope you like it and make it
quick so that you can go back home early
or do some other things if you like yeah
questions oh okay yeah sure so normally
you just be running raspbian which is
just the standard way of an investee us
the linux OS distribution is raspbian
normally you don't install other things
and what you need to just get installed
java and um or specific i think sharper
dash 8 or java at seven if you search on
the internet just rest ian install java
you yeah it's just one single comma is
very easy well a little bit more than
that you need to update your
distribution
sorry which wish one in action oh oh oh
oh oh yeah yeah come on up here yeah
i'll show it to you again yeah that's
perfect cool any other questions yep
yeah so this is embedded which is soft
different this another one it is another
version Emmy is like the micro edition
right and then se yeah so so this one is
called embedded which is a completely
different variant because you just have
to fit that specific architecture for
raspberry PI's but then for normal usage
if you talk about regular machines I
would suggest just to se yes you would
make a lot more sense just making sure
that you have everything don't don't
blow yourself down all of a sudden if
your knees are in the features it's not
available that would be bad yeah any
other questions good
you have substitute other like a already
know yeah at Reno is essentially a good
extension I would say it's a good
extension to a referee pie so in that
case you will just plug in the adrenal
what you call it the have a shield right
actually no shield and then you just
plug in there and all of a sudden you
open up with so many GPIO port and and
they will connect you so many different
things yeah I would suggest to be
additional to raspberry pi yeah or else
you will be pretty limited to the lot of
the processing on how what what you can
do with that feature yeah and and it's
just a great augment to combine the two
and then now you can do and for example
we are also looking into drones we're
just having fun with lots of things
we're looking at drones I try to
understand for example how you can maybe
ship a coffee cup from one office to the
other and give a credit you hopefully
then then fell off so yeah there's a lot
of things you can do yeah Adreno is
great hi hi yeah you try that but but
for now for simple stuff like if you're
just trying to connect different things
to each other you probably don't need
adrenal unless you need specific ports
to access some let go like a car like a
race car or something that you built
yourself to integrate on it you fill out
your dual port on there that would be
cool yeah
you there one destiny bite on the device
ID and other on that website so why was
the oh that's because we have the main
thing is because I get out it's certain
has the yeah this one is the one that is
on the near the laptop side first thing
is a jetty server so it's running a web
server for ya so let me just show you
one more time so this page you see that
is being rendered comes from the web
server running in this webster in this
recipe and we prove that the power and
the yes also a restaurant is like 512
megabytes in the processor is not that
great but we proved that it works very
well if you can see is how fast it
rendered that's one reason the second
reason is because of this specific chip
so this is a you is a sensor for mbn
sensor for lights essentially and then
also for processing midi sensor so so if
this workstation is not next to the
workstation the user would not be use
these sensors to control for example the
Sphero or send an SMS message right if
you feel it thanks to the server right
next to the right next to the device
then you can't do anything about it so
that's why we have one so thank you very
much for coming I really appreciate it
and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
