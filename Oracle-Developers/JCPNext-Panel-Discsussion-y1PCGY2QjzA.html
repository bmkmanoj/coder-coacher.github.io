organization and today we're going to
have a panel discussion about JCP next
so let me start first of all I'll ask
the other members of the panel to
introduce themselves then I'll give you
a quick overview of the history of JCP
next what we've done in the past and
what we are working on at the moment and
then I'm going to ask each of the
members of the panel to give their
thoughts on what we're doing and why
they think it's important or not as the
case may be and then we'll open it up
for questions from from the audience so
why don't we start stage left start with
so each of you please introduce
yourselves yeah Thank You Patrick good
afternoon all my name is Scott Jameson
I'm with hewlett-packard hi everyone
thank you for coming I think that's a
extremely important discussion glad that
you guys are here my name is Bruno Sosa
I'm with so Java hi i'm mike blake fitch
and I'm with the Eclipse Foundation and
hello everyone thanks for coming my name
is ben evans and i'm here representing
the london java community okay so JCP
don't next what is it basically it's a
series of j srs we're working on to
change what you could think of as the
constitution of the JCP the defining
documents that define how we operate and
how we're structured and function and so
on there are two documents that are of
interest the first is called the Java
specification in participation agreement
or JSP a and this is the legal document
that people sign when they join the
organization its primary purpose is to
address intellectual property grants to
determine the way in which IP is granted
and flows through the process and to
define the terms under which the output
of the process the specification the RI
and the tck will be licensed this is
available online you see the URL there
it's a legal document so it's kind of
complicated and needs needs work to
understand it the second document is the
process document this is a little
simpler it defines the way we are
structured and governed defines the
processes that we use to submit Jay SRS
and to develop them to review them to
move them through the process and it
defines the obligations to produce not
only the specification but the RI
reference implementation and the tck the
test suite and that too is online and
you can see the URL there so changing
the way that we operate basically means
changing one or other of both of these
documents and since we already have a
well-defined process for creating
specifications or revisions of
specifications this process being the
the heart of the process itself the
process of filing a JSR we figure we use
the same process to modify the process
so what we do is we file a JSR to say we
intend to modify one or other of these
documents i act as the spec lead for
that jsr and the executive committee of
the JCP that is think of it as the board
of directors all of these members are
all these panel members are members of
the JCP executive committee in fact we
have others in the audience maybe the
rest of you would also introduce
yourselves so Susie
Suzanne check from Credit Suisse I have
to repeat for the for the recording
Thomas Lampard from jamel toe guilt na
from Azul Steve Harris from cloudbees
verna Kyle and Mike de Nicola from
fujitsu ok so collectively the executive
committee forms the expert group for the
jsr s to modify the process and we work
through the process just like any other
jsr except we don't produce a test suite
or a RI it's been suggested maybe we
should produce some kind of test group
some way to validate and verify whether
what we intended to do we actually did
and I think that's a good idea we should
think about that isn't that called the
Google lawsuit so the output of our work
is a new version of one or other of
these documents which you can think of
as our Constitution and since not 2012
2011 that's a typo there we've been
working on a series of three jrs to
reform our processes and that's what we
call JCP next first of these was jsr 348
and its purpose was to change the
perception given in this picture people
used to say that expert groups were
secretive that they met behind closed
doors that nobody really knew what was
going on they'd go away closet
themselves for months or maybe even
years at the end of the process a spec
would pop out that you never knew why
they made the decisions that they made
how they made those decisions there
wasn't always true but there was a
certain amount of truth you met though
there was an element of secrecy to the
way we operate it so we said let's stop
we wanted to do a JSR that we could
complete fairly quickly so we decided to
kind of pick the low-hanging fruit and
we focused on basically on transparency
and participation we spent about six
months working on this we define version
2.8 of our process document we didn't
touch the jsb a the legal document we
decided to postpone anything involving
that until a later jsr and we basically
introduce changes to to make the
processes more transparent and to enable
broader participation basically what we
said was expert groups instead of
operating like this must operate out in
the open let's do their work on a public
mailing list than anybody can subscribe
to must have a public issue tracker that
people could read a lot of issues to and
so on so we finished that as i said in
october two thousand eleven and it's
been pretty successful just about all
the ongoing jsr s are now operating
under its rule so there's a JSR that's
in progress that you're interested in
you ought to be able to go to JCP or go
to the jrs page there's a tab labeled I
think community and there you should
find information about how to join the
mailing list and get involved second of
the three jay s RS JC p dot next to it
was very simple we used to have two
executive committee's one for java a
mean one for SC and EE combined as you
heard if you were at the keynotes
yesterday the expectation is that Emmy
and se will converge over the coming
months and year or two so under these
circumstances it didn't seem to make
sense to us to have separate committees
by the way they always used to meet
together anyway so it was kind of a
fiction I used to vote separately on the
jsr it was excuse me really the only
separation so we said let's just get rid
of the separation create a single
executive committee we actually
downsized the number of members slightly
and as a result of that the election
this year
when the reduction in numbers will
formally take place so all of the
sitting executive committee members will
be standing for re-election this year so
this jsr was completed very quickly last
year and implementation started with the
elections of last year and finishes with
the elections of this year that was an
easy one the third one is the big scary
one JCP don't next 3gs are 358 is in
progress at the moment and it will
involve modifying the JSP a which hasn't
been significantly changed since 2002
although the environment were operating
in is very different now from what it
was then specifically you know we have a
widespread adoption of open-source
licensing and development practices and
that's not the way things were back at
least with Java back in 2002 the
expectation then was sun microsystems
would do most of the development work
would take some input from others sun
would release the source code for the
implementations others would license it
and will create their own
implementations that's not the way it is
anymore so it's really is time for us to
modify the jsb a it also needs a little
cleanup work but it's complicated it's
difficult to understand it's kind of
like maintaining legacy code you've got
to be really careful sometimes you don't
know what some piece of code is for
whether it's vestigial whether it's
actually serving some really important
function and you only find out when you
remove it that hoop session and done
that similar issue is with with a legal
document so it's complicated and we got
to move slowly plus because it's a legal
document all the lawyers have to get
involved the oracle lawyers and the
lawyers for the other executive
committee members who have a vested
interest in making sure that this comes
out right and the way that they want so
because of all this it's it's taking us
a considerable amount of time we'd be
working on it for about a year and we'll
probably spend another year on it before
we're done
it's important because the jsb a is what
defines the way intellectual property
rights are granted and what defines the
terms under which the output of the
process the spec the RI and the tck are
licensed we want to make sure that
everything we incorporate into Java is
safe from an IP perspective so that
people can implement it and use it with
confidence knowing that everything is
clean and legal so we have a long
shopping list of things that we have
been looking at I won't go through them
in detail but I've put a couple of links
here to a presentation that summarizes
these and the ultimate source of
authority is our issue tracker where we
will have we do have an issue open for
every item that is under considerate
consideration but up till now we've been
focusing in a couple of areas one IP
policy licensing open source and the
other the role of individual developers
as members of the JCP we've created a
couple of working groups that are
focusing on these areas these groups
meet regularly they report back to the
full expert group which is the executive
committee at each of our monthly
meetings and you can see summaries of
those meetings we publish all our
executive committee meeting materials
online and also we have a java.net
project for for this chairs are for GSR
358 our goals are to maintain
compatibility guarantees we think it's
really important that people know that
when they get an implementation of Java
it is complete and it is compatible with
other implementations we want to embrace
open-source licensing and development
processes to the extent that we can we
want to simplify the IP flow and the
licensing model at the moment we have a
multiplicity of licenses for the output
of G SRS and we want to build on the
work we did with Joe SR 348 and increase
and guarantee openness transparency and
broad participation so having said that
let me go through these one by one
strong compatibility all j srs we expect
to be covered by a standard
specification license that includes as
as spec licenses do today strong
compatibility requirements basically
saying implementations must be complete
they must meet a bunch of compatibility
requirements and they must pass the
tests in the tck we want to embrace you
open source by requiring the reference
implementations be developed through
open source projects that anybody can
participate in and that they be released
under open-source licenses we want to
make broader access to TC k's available
to the test Suites so we have at the
moment for OpenJDK a special what they
call a community TCK license that gives
participants in OpenJDK access to the
the tck for java SE we want to create
similar licenses for all j srs so that
not only will they be developed through
an open-source process that people can
participate in but so that participants
can access the tck in order to verify
that their changes are compatible and
finally we want to create a new class of
membership specifically tailored to
individuals which will be hopefully
considerably simpler than the membership
agreement we have today which is the JSP
a itself many individuals are
intimidated by this quite rightly and
sometimes feel they might need to
consult a lawyer in order to understand
what they're signing but the majority of
the language in the JSP area is about
the obligations of the spec lead with
regard to licensing and so on and so
forth and since you know if an
individual just wants to join in order
to participate in discussions or
whatever none of that stuff applies to
them we want to create a simpler
agreement which will be a simple
contribution agreement that says I wanna
participate in the JCP
I make grants of any contributions I
make to be incorporated into jrs and so
on I hope the effect of this will be
considerable increase in the number of
individual members over the next few
years so as I've said we have a public
java.net project that's linked from here
in the slides if you go there you will
find a link to the observer mailing list
which is one that you can subscribe to
and everything we discussed within the
expert group is copied to that there is
an issue tracker where you can see all
the issues and comment on them if you
wish and there's a document archive
where we have all our meeting minutes
and are working documents so you really
can keep an eye on what we're doing give
us your feedback and we really want your
feedback we want to make sure we do the
right thing with this jsr because we
don't change the JSP a very often it's a
painful process and we want to get it
right so that's that's all I have that's
the quick overview of what we're doing
with JCP next so now I'm going to ask
each of the panelists to give that
perspective on the web that we're doing
so I once again start with with Scott so
over to you Scott Thank You Patrick
again you've touched on many of the
points that I wanted to make but I think
your last one is really worth
reiterating the current JSP a has been
around now for more than a decade and it
was developed in the environment that
we're in in the late 90s and obviously
things have changed pretty dramatically
since then with the mass movement
towards community development towards
more predominant common use of
open-source licenses and so we're
approaching this to making sure that
we're going to serve the community and
the JCP process for the next decade the
next ten years so it's not an easy
process especially when you get
attorneys and others involved but we
really are trying to think ahead I think
you know the challenges that we face
really are maintaining the good things
that we have
in the community today that the strong
compatibility you know that the security
that everyone has with respect to
intellectual property the broad
community involvement and engagement in
the processes and we've taken more steps
to increase that so I think we need to
assure as we move forward that we really
don't harm the good things that we've
done and at the same time simplify you
know the IP flows obviously if you read
the JSP a today the bulk of the document
deals with that and it makes it really
difficult to understand even if you're
an attorney which I'm not but I've tried
to explain it to attorneys and have them
tell me what it says and their eyes
glaze over as much as ours do when we
read it there so I think it behooves all
of us to really work towards making that
document more understandable
particularly to mere mortals and and
really trying to simplify the flows and
as Patrick mentioned one of the working
groups is around IP and the flows there
it's when we've been actively involved
in and we were in the creation of the
current JSP a if we spent a lot of
energy on that again trying to balance
you know the rights of the IP owners the
inventors the creators of the
intellectual property and the community
that's going to benefit from the use
both the implementers and ultimately the
users and we continue to really try to
maintain what that right balance is and
I think a lot of the direction that
we're going is clearly steps in the
right direction we're talking about
trying to simplify the flows and not
today everything flows through the spec
lead if you're a member of an expert
group you make grants to the spec Lee
the spec Lee then creates the licenses
to all the other implementers and users
and what we referred to within the
executive committee as a hub-and-spoke
and we think that we can simplify that
and you know as Patrick mentioned the
use of open-source licenses for the RI
is perhaps one path to doing that I'll
also say that
near the goals that Patrick an
enumerated in the middle of his
introduction you know compatibility
simplifying embracing more modern
development techniques methodologies
what have you we're all pretty much
unanimously supported which I was very
pleased about often times in the past
there would be 14 21 votes if you want
NEC sorts of things like that and that
really I don't recall at least at the
high level that being the case here so
to me that's a very encouraging thing of
course as we start delving into this and
looking at licensing models and getting
attorneys and getting business people
involved the Devils in the details I
think we all know that phrase and I'm
sure well we're already dealing with
some of that and it's only going to get
worse there but again I think we're
we're all marching in the same direction
which is a very encouraging here and
it's just a painful tedious process that
again we want to improve it without
breaking what's working today so thank
you thanks Scott okay Bruno so I think
that when he's just interesting things
that when java came out in 1995 he came
out as a technology that with with the
source code available and of course not
on the license that we would talk today
but it was that the fact that we had the
source code available the fact that we
had a specification available at that
time coming out front technology you
know there was a new technology there
was proposing a big change in how he did
development he was he caused a very nice
impact and that impact you know the fact
that we had the source code available at
that time calls it a large community to
be creator on java and i think that the
JCP in sometimes we have to remember
that that was a few years before the
open source definition even existed so i
think that you know what we're
we want to do is continue to encourage
and promote this community that has been
created around Java and of course you
know so many years later there are new
ways of doing things you know the
internet it's way more spread out every
developer in the world has some form of
access to the internet we didn't have
when wen Tao first came out so the
participation of people into the
evolution of Java is much easier today
and sometimes the process of to
participate is not as easy as the
technology allows and I think that what
we're trying to do here is make it it's
you know the participation of everyone
not only technically feasible like it is
but also easy in terms of process in
terms of participation in terms of legal
documents and other things an
interesting thing is that developers
don't care so much for that right and
you know I sit on the board with Mike we
sit on the board of the Open Source
Initiative that's that's also discussed
licenses it it's as hard to discuss
license that is to discuss
specifications with developers many
times you know in so so I think that the
biggest challenge that we all have on
the JCP is is you know is getting people
to understand what we're trying to do
and getting people involved in what
we're trying to do you know even when
that thing is is somewhat divorce it
from technology you know it's it's
separated from the technology in a way
so and in fact it's not separated but
but you know developers don't see them
then going together a lot of times and
so I think that when we simplify things
I think when we're doing things I think
then we're going to talk about adopted
Jess are a little bit in it and so when
we make it easier for people to
participate we make easier for
developers to join and understand like
like will happen when its with
transparency rules and what you know the
things we're doing now allowing
individuals to participate in the JCP
and now the discussions going on and
simply find a JSP a I think all of these
is a
the main goal of all of these is getting
everyone that wants to participate once
you contribute to find an easy path to
come so I think that whenever we get to
the end of this we're going to we're
going to have a a JCP that's simpler and
that's going to be more open and and
that will help out that we keep keep
keep this community together and with
more participation thanks Bruno okay
Mike so classic scenario of most of what
i wanted to say has already been said
the you know this process i wanted one
of the things that scott said if i think
i think i got our right as you know this
this process is tedious and painful and
you know basically the folks that are on
the the JCP executive committee are
trying to do this work so that you don't
have to as developers I remember one of
the truest things I ever heard one time
was that Oskan this woman by the name of
Denise Cooper who's been involved in the
open source community forever said that
you know we started open source so that
we could get rid of all of the lawyers
and instead we've all turned in to
lawyers and that that is that is so
painfully true for the work that's going
on right now in in the executive
committee so it is it is definitely a
slow and painful process and but i think
the goals i think our everybody is in
alignment that you know we really want
to put the community back into the java
community process and make this more
open modernize it so that it's more in
tune with with you know the expectations
that developers have today around you
know working in open source and working
with well-known open-source licenses
wherever possible and you know all that
said you know given the constraints
about the simple fact that you know java
is a an oracle owned asset a lot of this
is really about working the art of the
possible given the set of constraints
that that that is
test and that's that's you know in a
nutshell what we're trying to do thanks
Mike been a great I get to go last and
everyone really has said pretty much
everything that I wanted to say thanks
guys yeah so I mean I going in a minute
I will actually talk a little bit about
adopt which is a sort of concrete
example of how we're trying to bring
developers back into the into the
process into Mike's point to put the
community back into the JCP but also I
wanted to bring out a couple of things
which I think some of the other guys
have touched on a little bit which is
that the java community is vast you know
there are nine or ten million of us and
what that means is that that actually we
have any individual developer or group
of developers only really sees a subset
of it and one of the things that i
personally have learned while being on
the executive committee is just how many
other different pieces of the community
there are and the the goals of the
motivations for four major corporations
who in many cases have invested billions
upon billions of dollars into this
technology space you know we r
represents an investment the the needs
of end users who again who have spent
money and invested in in java technology
which provides us with jobs and provides
us with an ecosystem that you know
that's where some of these concerns that
we have about strong compatibility come
from because ultimately if we did don't
have standardization and we don't have
the ability to enforce strong
compatibility what we're doing is we're
effectively saying okay we're going to
innovate over here but we're going to
shove all the costs and all the
externalities of that innovation out to
the people who are actually footing the
bill for this the people that actually
purchase and spend money on java
technology and that's that doesn't sound
right and it doesn't sound fair to me so
whilst the there's a balance to be
struck between innovation and
standardization standard a
standardization should should happen
after a market has stabilized and after
its it's mature and people are ready to
start making serious investment in the
area and so I think that's one of the
things that I always try to keep in mind
because you know like most developers
I'm impatient for innovation I want
things to change and I want to get my
hands on you know
new and shiny tech but there are other
aspects to this and learning to balance
those and learning to to see the
community and as a larger a bigger thing
than I previously imagined is it's kind
of part of the journey that I've had
since it's being on the committee now to
turn to a dr j sr to talk about the
practical stuff the docs jess r is an
effort that the language java community
and sue java started about i think about
two years ago now and the idea behind
this is developers as we think several
people have now said don't really care
about standards until they get in the
way so you know what that and we've all
seen api's that even ones that have been
standardized which have things on them
which just really shouldn't be there or
which have pretty obvious errors that
anyone who's worked with the technology
stack for more than about five minutes
immediately spots and they're like well
why is this method not there you know my
personal favorite is always the handling
of sequence numbers in jp-a which is
just so obviously bogus and broken that
it's it you like why did anyone come up
with the standard so so as an attempt to
make sure that we don't have any more of
those things that's what we were sort of
the nucleus of the idea for dr. chase
are and the idea is that if individual
developers who mostly care about code
mostly care about technology and not
about going to meetings about
standardization and the sort of meta
level of licensing and IP flow but what
about just getting back to the
technology and getting early builds
early versions of standards into the
hands of the people that are actually
going to be using them day to day in a
few years time and actually getting
feedback and trying to put the people
who are directly going to be consuming
those standards in touch with the people
that are actually making them and the
expert group and that's that's really
what what a doc suggests already is we
also have adopt OpenJDK for people that
are more interested in focusing on on
that side as well okay thank you been
okay that's that's sort of the end of
the formal part of this presentation
discussion so now I'd like to invite
questions or comments from from you guys
we're interested to hear what you think
okay go ahead interesting feedback from
dr who said stomach the father of free
software foundation no yeah song yeah i
sent a lot of males okay i will read it
so just for the record the german says
yeah condition indoors they open
dedicate I and he is with this okay so
he emailed Richard Stallman asking his
opinion and suggesting he might want to
endorse openjdk Mike my original email
was this okay and asking q2 him to write
something good huh about openjdk yeah
right ok so this response and there are
good and bad things about openjdk the
main thing about it is it is useful free
software that is good however there are
some bad things to the package doesn't
talk about free software or endorse
freedom as a go non-free versions are
released also it is under GPL version 2
only which is incompatible with version
3 of the GPL these do not wipe out the
good that the project does but they mean
that I cannot give a glowing endorsement
of it so that seems to me pretty from
Richard Stallman that's wild enthusiasm
p.m. actually it was I mean for those
are serving long time Stallman Watchers
I mean that could basically have come
out from you know an automatic Stallman
generator
that's absolutely vintage yes I decide
to try to help the colonel hood it
exists the links and the hood but the
processes from you you know project is
very complicated I yeah can I can't in
the indie space too comfortable okay so
so I decided because JCP and so Java and
Logan you help helping a lot of people
they make making this more okay you know
well that's good thank you let me
summarize for further recording so he
says that he tried to participate in
Linux or the new project and founded the
process is complicated and as a result
of the initiatives that the so Java and
London java community guys had done
switched to participating in OpenJDK
because he found that easier so that
that's that's good to hear yeah enacted
to the general comment from from
Stallman you know it doesn't surprise me
his primary goal is to you know promote
freedom of software and you know
Oracle's goals are Oracle is a big
commercial organization its goals are
somewhat different but nevertheless they
do include collaboration and community
participation and it's good to see that
Stallman at least recognizes that part
of it also I mean I just follow up tube
to Helios comment I think it's it shows
that we're trying to do the right thing
I mean if this is a clear data point of
okay it's just one date point but it's
at a point of someone being put off by a
process barrier so given that we've got
the drains up with the JSP a let's try
to take out as many of those in our own
backyard as we can in other words as
free as possible under the circumstances
yes yes because one one thing that we
see is that you know contributes to a
project that you know you're usually a
user of technology and then when you
start to contribute back and you start
your participate even if you're being
paid to do that usually you're doing
this because you know you're voluntarily
because you you you care for that to
solve that problem and once you start
doing it and you find out all kinds of
barriers you find out that's hard to do
you know you find out that it's it's it
takes way more time on the process then
on you actually helping then you know
you go do something else right and so I
think I think the best thing we can do
is make that the contribution very easy
because those people that want to
contribute are extremely valuable you
know they any contribution you get from
someone that's doing this on their own
time on their own budget on their own
investments it's an it's amazing for all
of us so the you know we do how to
remove every barrier that we can not
understand Mike's you know as free but
but but under the circumstances but you
know we have to remove all the barriers
as much as possible so we don't lose
those contributions just a comment that
the email with the Richard Stallman
triggered in my mind and it to me it
kind of indicates that the change with
maturity of the industry in the
community because when Sun first
released java SE under the GPL that was
actually a very scary thing if there was
a thoughts you know from you the
corporate side at least that son was
doing that intentionally to prohibit
commercial usage
of the job of technologies and so the
perception was they're responding or
trying to appease this loud open-source
faction of the community but really not
providing any value to the industry as a
whole and I think you know now 78 years
later after that happened I think we all
realize is that you can do a lot with
openjdk under the GPL and its variants
and it's really not the boogie man or
the scary thing that at least industry
thought it was when Sun originally
released this you know to me that again
it's just indicative of how the whole
industry the users the community the
commercial interest of all kind of grown
up and have a better appreciation a
better understanding of really the power
of open source and I think that's really
one of the motivations for some of the
directions we're trying to take this
time around with the revision of the JSP
a just to add to to Scotts Cohen here I
mean is a as I'm fortunately I'm not in
a position to be able to name names and
but there are some very very large
corporations that have substantially
modified openjdk for use in their own
internal platforms to the point where
those changes are now not really able to
be contributed back upstream yeah i just
realized one other thing that he had
said was and he said this was a bad
thing a reason why he couldn't endorse
openjdk was that in addition to the free
software there are also commercial
versions available given the
circumstances given the industry that we
work in given the fact that first son
and now oracle has invested significant
amounts of money and many other large
corporations have to the reality of the
situation is that we need commercial
implementations people who have made
these significant investments need the
opportunity to to monetize those
investments so we're trying to strike
this balance between open free as in
beer or free as in participation and
also return on investment for the big
corporations that
have tens or hundreds or maybe even
thousands of developers working on Java
another question go ahead please
reflects the two communities where every
developer asked me like what supporters
yjz is reporting answer illustrator
because it helps the ecosystem java
become begins pretty much like cannibal
to all of the anticipation to us good
however I see longer if you consider the
size of the java community to my
knowledge to my feeling if you will is
not growing and shrinking and on top of
that you have to take in consideration
that the java you're using today is the
sport problems different from maintain
years go right now in particularly the
bronx realm we talked about BP and we
talked about things beyond job so my
question to you all oh you're not
holding tournament I wonder if we need
GPU sticking it out like in a charger
community
because like let's face again this
always all the nitrogen is all the
technologies out there he's trying to
solve any way inside Jabu not doing very
well I can even make several examples
and complement but also I wonder like to
give those technologies they are we
talking about like let's say meet game
or even the jobs good if you will which
is necessary power reducing p is more
tiring the way how we deal with the job
can I want to that we're going to try
and summarize it first yeah so um if I
can try to summarize your question and
wave if I've if I've misrepresentative
so that the question was was concerned
about the overall size of the java
community and whether it is not in fact
now shrinking and he was also concerned
that the technologies outside of the
scope of what is traditionally seen as
the the remit of the JCP are now
becoming important and what should we do
about the fact that that the technology
world is is changing that there are
these new technologies out there is that
a fair summary okay so first of all let
me let me turn to your first point about
the size of java community it is simply
not true that the java community is
shrinking the the survey that you should
read is by an analyst firm called red
monk the the analysts name is Steven
O'Grady he's been tracking this for a
number of years and I have to tell you
it's very good news look and that the
the important thing to understand about
the dynamics here is that yes there are
other technologies and other platforms
which are growing but the whole size of
the pie is growing our industry is
getting larger and larger and shows no
signs of stopping so you can then ask
yourself about okay so the whole pie is
growing the java community is still
growing but you see these communities
springing up and surely they have got
these amazing rates of growth but when
you actually track the rates of growth
the only one which comes close to having
the same rate of growth and bearing in
mind that we're already pretty much the
largest community out there and we're
still growing faster basically than
everything else even going faster than
JavaScript the only thing which has a
similar rate of growth to our
is scholar and scholars a JVM language
which to this point well well let's look
at the languages we have we have we have
Java we have scholar we have closure of
jruby all of these things are part of
the Java platform a part of you know so
it's it's about us growing up as a
platform and us learning to think of
ourselves as kind of like a mothership
you know that there are these other
technologies and the other things out
there yes they start off in there within
our remit know within our world and as
they become larger and more mature it's
natural that some of them will grow up
and find a home and an identity in their
own right that's part of the evolution
of a successful platform thanks Ben yeah
me too it takes two to tango yeah the
suggestion is that maybe we should try
within the JCP to to standardize some of
the languages such as Rubio Scala that
primarily JVM based languages I'm go
ahead yeah I wasn't say like so the
problem with that and I said you know to
today it takes two to tango is like a
flip remark but the fact of the matter
is a lot of these communities are not
interested in standardization at this
point in their maturation if they are
successful then there echo system will
you know communicate with them about the
fact that standardization is helpful for
further growth but at this point you
know there's probably some pretty fierce
antibodies in those communities around
standardization I think that'll change
with time it's part it's a bit it's part
of the normal flow of the high-tech
fashion industry and that's just the way
it will happen to speak to a specific
example we've been doing some work
within the london java community around
outreach towards the JavaScript
community especially
with mouths on which is coming with jdk
8 which I think has potential to do be a
significant bridge to other communities
within JavaScript there's a session
tomorrow at four thirty in esmtp and see
where we'll be talking about what
happened and our adventures in trying to
communicate with other communities but
as a general point I think that they're
rather than necessarily standardizing
specific language implementations I
think there are potentially more things
we can do so obviously we have things
like JavaScript which is probably well
overdue for a refresh so that's
something we could certainly look at but
but rather you know so do not think of
standardizing specific languages but
rather standardizing technologies which
may be useful to other languages I mean
a tillis is getting Dinah link which is
now in NASA horn which potentially has
has some useful stuff in it so maybe we
should think about that
right so ed was saying just for the
recording that as a spec lead he would
like to be able to make some assertions
about a particular language but unless
it's standardized he cannot do so I
guess my response to this question
putting a different add-on now before I
took over as chair of JCP I used to run
the tck team for java SE so from a
conformance testing perspective I would
say that I'm not sure that it is our
role to to try to standardize a language
such as Ruby when I first started in in
that role we were just beginning to get
into XML and so on and these were
standards that were developed elsewhere
within the w3c and we had to try and
figure out where to draw the dividing
line between what we would test and what
we would expect from somebody else and
at the end of the day the conclusion
that I came to was that the right thing
for us to do would be perhaps to
standardize the interface between us and
these other things the way in which they
might be invoked but to hope or to
expect that the standardization of these
languages or protocols themselves would
be done outside I think I would take the
same attitude today with regard to many
of the languages which do run on top of
the JVM because it's a very long list
and significant amount of work would be
involved if we were to try to take on
the standardization of those languages
well but just as i'm using so it's got
off to you i was just going to say
there's nothing inherent in the JCP or
in our processes that would prevent
someone from trying or starting a
standardization effort around these
things later I mean it you know as Mike
said it takes two to tango but it also
takes one to step up and commits to do
the work and it's very costly to be a
spec lead I you know there's people in
the room that can attest to that you
know because you're signing up to do
it's not just the specification it's the
reference implementation
then the TC case for it so there's a lot
of work to do it but if someone is
willing to do it and has a critical mass
if you will of interest behind it
there's no reason why a JSR couldn't be
approved to do whether it's a new
language for the JVM or whether it's
some higher-level BPM or something along
those lines again if we just there's we
don't we haven't said well I'm sorry
walls or borders as to what can or can't
be but we've tended if anything to err
on the other side of accepting almost
any proposal and that's why there's been
a lot of cruft along the way over the
last ten years or so and we clean that
up periodically but if there's a an
interest and willingness to work behind
it it can be done very um which I needed
the film with the theme of building
blocks I mean one of the things that
I've occasionally wondered about is
whether or not we couldn't do something
I mean it would require a language level
change so it would need to form part of
a platform chain saw but imagine
something like new syntax for the
equivalent of a scarlet pals a
Combinator that is the kind of thing
which if you with with sufficient
bindings from a revised JavaScript you
could talk about a scripting language
which then was generated on top of that
and that that might actually give you
enough context to be able to talk about
that in another spec for example so
those kind of things I think I think are
an option and I think of potentially
something we should we should look to
explore right and I think that we did
have around java a some working you know
change the grade of those languages and
i do hope the whole effort on java 7
evoke dynamic and allowing so many other
language to run easier on the java vm i
think it's it's it's a clear think that
the job that we had to do on our
standards on the java vm that you know
we did a step so they can so they can do
a stab and in a lot of dis cases i think
it's hard to to consider you know
because standardization something that
the players of that that industry have
to see as mike said you know they have
to see as as a need right and you see on
the Ruby community for example that you
have you know
see implementation of Ruby and the jruby
implementation and you know they kind of
chase each other because there's not a
inside the community itself there's not
an effort to standardize in a way that
both are compatible right so if they're
not seeing the need in their community
is very hard for us to say anything
about that right but at to your point
you know if you in your create an ice
pack right now and if you can't include
something that's being done outside of
the JCP that is a problem right because
there's lots of things getting time
outside of JCP right so maybe that's
that something else that we need to do
inside the JCP that will make it easier
for us to interface and and relates to
things are being done outside and i
think that's that's a very good point
that you raise and I think we should we
should we should talk about that and
just see what what the problem is and
now we can we can tackle implementations
against the same mechanism in PHP but
because there are certain restrictions
that prevent us from looking at other
languages to java at the moment they
couldn't make this official particles
back but yes there are certain ways that
they could support at the future right i
think i think right now we're you know
in our rules you know we're not we're
not even discussing implementing the JC
JCP specification and other language
right right yes okay so yeah so so so
there are ways if there's two ways to go
inside the JCP itself should tackle some
of the issues we have time for probably
for one more question yes go ahead
please
okay the question is about the I have
said that under the existing jsb hey we
have a multiplicity of licenses and how
is that likely to change in the future
we are definitely looking at drastically
reducing I'm at the moment basically
what the jsb a says is the spec lead can
choose any license they wish there are
certain high-level constraints but
there's nothing to prevent in theory
every jsr from having a different
licensing model you will hear complaints
about that from consumers particularly
when you think about trying to combine
various java technology sometimes the
licenses may god forbid even be
incompatible with each other so we are
looking to drastically simplify to
reduce to a small number we're thinking
of around three and saying basically you
must choose one of these so we hope that
in the future we can eliminate that kind
of fragmentation of Licensing that's for
the RI yes yeah what he's referring to
there for the spec we more or less have
a standard license today which is
basically modeled on the version
originally created by South Sun and
later Oracle but it's not strictly
speaking mandated in the future we
expect we will settle on a definitive
version of the spec license and all PSRs
will use that same license just one more
comment on that is I was always very
surprised when I want to start on the
committee as to how much freedom aspekte
Lee really gets in terms of running
their project and as we've moved through
this process of transparency move
through JCP up next one of the things I
think we know sort of it has been
subliminal and has been a little bit
beneath the surface is just trying to
tighten that up a little bit trying to
provide a standard framework which
better promotes transparency admittedly
at the cost of slightly reducing the
amount of choices available to aspect
late
you were saying that this is not
something that's going to be done just
quickly it's likely to happen very
quickly a patent or whatever how do you
couple and I see what you're saying yeah
yeah that that's a good point so that
the comment is that since I have pointed
out that we changed the jsb a very and
frequently maybe once every 10 years and
yet licensing models change much more
rapidly we would need to decouple the
list of if you like approved licenses
from the GSB a and you're right we do
recognize that there will be certain
things that we will need to extract from
the jsb a and put into a separate
document which can be revised relatively
simply so rather than hard code into the
jsb a this list of approved licenses we
would reference an external list and
then we could create a new version of
that list through a very lightweight jsr
or maybe even a maintenance release of
358 itself but that's a good point okay
there's like three minutes left if
somebody wants to ask one last quick
question
going once going twice yes I I think you
you are doing a good job because the
developer has more time to work to
understand this this thing so and we
need did the job that you are doing ok
well thank you for that so the comment
was that as a developer he is very glad
that we are taking on this work because
this is not its necessary work but it's
not something that the average developer
wants to spend their time on and that's
just remember there's JCP elections
coming up vote early vote often yes ok
so we're out of time thank you all for
coming and for your comments and your
questions I hope we'll see you at our
party this evening six o'clock way up on
the top floor of the hilton hotel we
look forward to seeing you there we
always throw a good party thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
