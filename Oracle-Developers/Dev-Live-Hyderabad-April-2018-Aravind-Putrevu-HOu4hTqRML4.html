Anzio from Oracle code in Hyderabad for
the last interview of the day which is
good because I'm losing my voice and I'm
here earth Arvind Arvind helping with
your last name it's put to able to carry
yeah yeah very good thank you welcome
welcome to the welcome to the show thank
you and I had a really interesting
conversation last night at dinner yes
and so I wanted to actually you know
speak to you here a little bit of you
know length about it so you're from
elastic exactly right yes and last is
the california-based company yeah London
Mew we have a Mitch came out yeah it's
the live in Mountain View okay so what
do you do an elastic so I work as a
developer advocate I'm part of the
developer relations team yeah I look
after the Indian developer community oh
I do meetups go to conferences and speak
at various avenues like Oracle cold and
all the other conferences I interact
with the developer community and I mean
take their feedback and push into the
engineering team so talk with the
product team yeah most of the time
interacting with the developers and
solving their problems okay and you live
in Bangalore yeah I live in Bangalore so
what brought you up here to Hyderabad
yeah hotel code is an interesting
conference and I've seen people having
interesting conversations about discs on
this conference and I submitted my CFP I
thought I should speak at this event
where I could interact with a lot of
people so yeah that made me bring here
yeah and what do you think of the event
I'd say it's a it's a pretty big event
yeah it's a pretty big and yeah it's an
interesting City as well yeah that's my
first time to hide your bed but I've
been to Bangalore a couple of times yeah
so tell me more about elastic I mean
it's you mean it's an open-source
project it's well the company obviously
is but then you have an open source
you know aspect to it's an application
platform and yeah exactly
oh so I would I would tell you about
that so elastic elastic is a company
behind the open source projects
elasticsearch logstash Kabana and beat
so elasticsearch is a open source JSON
based full-text search engine it has
wide variety of use cases Oh
people call I mean like elastic blocks -
jibon and beats as elastic stack it
works together or locks - is uh you know
it does the transformation of data and
pushes into the elastic search Qabbani
is an excellent visualizer on top of
elastic search you can view the data
every everyone use elastic search and
our different perspectives for some it's
an operation and ll text tool for some
it's a business analytics tools for some
it's a security dashboard security
operation command center so it's
different for each one of them and yeah
it has from for the last year or
something it has more than 150 million
downloads hundred million exactly yes ok
but ok but I as a user I'm not using I'm
not interfacing with the search engine
right ok yeah yeah applications use yeah
exactly so so how should I put it so
it's a big developer platform but
probably if you're consumer if you're a
user
where you interact with various services
day in and day out you might be touching
elasticsearch at various applications
even in India so many startups use
elastic search suppose if you take
startups like uber it gives us elastic
source there are several other companies
where they use elastic search for the
search use cases like the soit search
the internal app search or even they
would use for the security or there are
there are more than couple of companies
even in one Pamela's company we recently
did is like grab you might have heard
the grab grabs or like the car the
company which does the ride hailing
company in base in Jakarta and yeah ok
so you said you were developer advocate
exactly so what you know and this is an
open source price or elastic search is
an open source project
talk to me about the benefits of doing
an open source project interesting
question because sigh I completely
believe in open source because that's
where I started learning many things as
a student so if you take open source on
a hole right it powers and educates many
people without any like interests or
something so if you have to if I have to
tell an example with an open source
project you can reach a student in
Jakarta or you can reach a student in
Hawaii you can teach a student in u.s.
west coast East Coast it's it's there
everywhere and people would learn
contribute back there is a community of
people who would sit and learn your
learn your technology suppose if you
have open social project suppose our
product that our solution that you have
build something and you there would be
some people who would bring up an
interesting feature that you would have
you wouldn't have thought about it even
if you have developed as a closed source
project so open source has such
impacting impact for potential on the
entire world
it's literally eating away yeah exactly
almost all the companies that powers
with open source for example you can
take Tesla one big company they have a
lot of open source you can take Twitter
they have a lot of open source libraries
which help elastic search obviously open
source company how big is the community
so we have around one sort of have to
tell in India numbers it's like one one
and a half lakh or like 150 thousand
community members a lot lot many people
engage with us you know in the meetups
or in the conferences or sometimes maybe
there might be some special events of
webinars that we do yeah people people
there are people who discuss about
elasticsearch and a wide variety of
avenues right so you've been developing
for actually how long have you been
developing so I I have around a seven
plus years of experience right now seven
plus years of experience in the Java
world but as a hobby I
I work on IOT I worked in security or my
previous employer was McAfee so I have
wide variety of interests in data and I
have used elasticsearch at one of my
hobby projects some time back yeah it's
so open source is my age there it's a
real contribute from so long so you
would obviously suggest that you know a
student in college doing you know
engineering or any kind of computer
science should get involved in open
source early definitely I would I would
encourage everybody to because one
important point I think that nowadays
people lack is this my viewpoint that if
you see people lack when they come home
to the corporate company or when they
start the carriers they lack the
understanding to deploy something in an
efficient scalable or an or an
enterprise manner
so with open source with products like
elasticsearch or with products which are
open source elsewhere right any any
other open source project take any
hadoop or any apache here's a product
you get to know how things work in
enterprises big enterprises like if you
take kubernetes right kubernetes is one
big container orchestration platform
right now and you can go on the github
and try and submit a PR or the pull
request you can write code for them and
your code lives in each and every road
it lives in each and every node or each
and every distributed that goes
distribution that goes in your code goes
in and you understand how things work
you know how to write tests you know how
to design systems that are reliable for
enterprise world but as but as a student
I don't say you lack it but there's a
greater opportunity with open source so
every student should well it's very real
I mean if you're in if you're in school
that's sort of an artificial environment
right but if you're contributing to open
source while you're in school you're in
a real environment exactly so you
already yeah what more than that I think
the interaction with community
interaction with people the formal
communication or the verification is
huge especially locally its global
exactly the different nationalities in
languages yes how do you deal with that
so we have contributors we have a
community span across 100 countries or
more 100 countries yeah exactly a
hundred countries are more and we have
people submitting their issues asking
their questions from different different
places we have people from France people
from Japan we have specialized
communities for people in China we have
elasticsearch dot CN so it's completely
there so we have evangelists in each and
every part of the globe and we help the
developers by doing localized content by
providing the localized content even if
you take the blog post that we write
majority of the blog posts or all the
important announcements all the
important blog posts are translated into
five six languages Korean Japanese
everything like French German very good
great okay well thank you very much so
where can developers go to get the code
and contribute so if you are looking to
contribute to elasticsearch I would
recommend to go to github.com slash
elasticsearch or you just type
elasticsearch github you would get a
link in in the google or else you can
definitely come back to the elastic core
and start looking at the product
download we have interesting baby nurse
in the webinar section you can start
looking at the webinars
there's awesome community you can you
can drop in your when you have some
doubts you can come to the discussed or
elastic core where all the discussions
happen with the community yeah there are
so many places well thank you good luck
with the project Thank You Damon coming
bye thank you and that's a wrap here
from oracle code and hyderabad and next
we'll see you in bangalore thanks bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
