today to talk about Robo VM and how it
makes it possible to develop native iOS
apps using Java if you're interested in
this project the website is at Robo VM
org and for product up project updates
make sure you follow Robo VM on Twitter
so the Robo VM projects the goal of this
project is to make it possible to
develop iOS apps using Java and other
jvm languages Scala JRuby maybe Jason I
don't know just about anything that can
output closed files in a separate
compilation step before you actually
yeah run it on the device I started
working on this back in 2010 and I've
been on it on and off since then was
this January that I felt that I had
reached the point where it could be
useful to others so I put it up on
github the compile time ports the things
that you would use to build your app on
your development machine those parts are
GPL licensed while the piece of code
that you link into your final app or
mostly Apache licensed there's some BSD
and MIT and similar licensing licensed
code in there as well but there's no GPL
in the runtime parts since January
there's been four releases now I think
and I was I meant to do a new release
here this week but I've been too busy
here at JavaOne so in a few days there
will be a zero 0.5 release the the state
is at the moment moment is that
with just this Friday we got the first
application accepted on the App Store
and we still call it an alpha but it's
it appears to be quite stable already
there would probably be a beta release
later on this year so if you want to try
it out there's an app on App Store it's
the GTX super jumper that's the name so
search for that it's the first robo VM
based app in App Store and this is
actually one of the samples that comes
with libgdx game development framework
so with Libby Libby and GTX you can use
a single code base and you can build a
game for for desktop Android iOS even
web browser-based so robobee M is an
ahead of time compiler so normally when
you use Oracle's jaebeum for instance
there's a jet that compiles your Java
byte code into machine code at runtime
however on iOS we can't do this because
Apple has put some technical
restrictions in there that makes it
impossible to to write machine code to
memory and then jump to that machine
code and this is what we would need to
have to Jake stuff so instead we have to
add a header sign compile Java bytecode
so this is a process that takes place on
your developer machine and then when we
run the app on the device there is no
byte coding involved there's no
interpreter everything runs on the
target CPU
the wrong time those clauses that you
are used to have in any Java program or
based on androids runtime so java.lang
objects Clause string everything in
those standard packages there's also a
built-in Java to native bridge J&amp;amp;I is
supported of course but using this we
call it Brewer which is the Swedish word
for bridge and using brew you can you
can call into native code without
writing any native code yourself so if
there is a function in a system library
for instance that you want to call you
can use blue and just annotate right of
your annotations and then call that that
function and blue also supports you can
you can Maps c structs and enums and you
can you can also define Java callbacks
that native code can call back into so
on top of blue
we built this cocoa touch binding so
cocoa touch is the native API on iOS so
if you if you ever built
something in Objective C for iOS you've
probably used cocoa touch it contains
access to the hardware and you can draw
you ice and yeah everything so this is
still a work in progress
but once it's finished you will be able
to do just about anything that you would
have been able to do with you've you've
code your app in Objective C
there's a we provide an eclipse plug-in
which I will show later on here
there's also maven plug-in which can
compile applications and you can launch
the iOS simulator you can launch the
device so unfortunately there's also
some limitations so there there's no
support for loading byte code at runtime
so if you if you need to use something
that generates byte code dynamic tries
to load that into the running JVM at
runtime that won't work
also there's no dynamic J&amp;amp;I so normally
when you use j'ni you package your
native code into a dynamic library and
you load that dynamic library at runtime
and the native the function and
functions gets bounding to your native
methods at runtime is that we have to do
this statically so instead of it say
it's still the same j-tube Nate Java
native interface code you write your
code in C or C++ just like you would
have done for for the desktop but
instead you package your native code
into a static library and you link that
in at compile time and we don't do
debugging yet we need to write a
debugger which is a big a big thing I
guess and since we're using the Android
runtime libraries the API is that you
have access to roughly corresponds to
what you had back in Java 6 you can
still use the things that the new
language constructs that were introduced
in in Java 7 like the Fri with resources
and switch on spring and
those things but there's no niño to
package and there's other API is there
are missing so now I'm going to show you
the Eclipse plug-in here and can you see
in the back yeah great
first of all the Eclipse plugin that I'm
using now it's available in the Eclipse
marketplace so I've already installed it
here but just go to eclipse marketplace
search for Robo VM and yeah it will be
installed now it's the it's not I mean
in a couple of days I will put up a new
version so but the thing is I'm using
right now is a snapshot so it's not the
latest release I'm using right now it's
a nightly it's a nightly build alright
so first I'm going to create a new
project here and first I'm going to
create the console project so we don't
we can build executables for not only
for iOS but also for Mac OS and Linux so
right now I'm going to build a Mac OS 10
console application just a hello world
just to show you and this this wizard
here it looks pretty much like the
ordinary Java new Java project wizard
there's a one section here that's added
so eclipse will build stuff
incrementally when you whenever you save
a Java file it will build it and there
will be a closed file so the robobee in
plague in hooks into this and
automatically builds machine code out of
that closed file that Eclipse just
produced so these settings here just
tells the plug-in the architecture and
the OS
that you want to build for when you
build incremental e and the reason why
we want to build incrementally is that
when we launch later on an application
we we want to have done as much work as
possible already so the only thing that
we have to do at launch time is to link
the binary and launch it so but I'm just
going to leave this at default settings
and we'll get Mac OS X 86
that's what will be used so this is the
let me just do it like this
so this is what we get there's it's
pretty much a standard Java project
instead of the Java 7 Java Runtime
environment that around 10 closed lab it
that we would get we get this robo VM
runtime library and as you can see
there's a there's some pieces for
encryption and stuff the bouncy castle
things here but the standard packages
are there Java allowing July or Java net
util Joe makes stuff is also there so we
port it over just about everything from
Android that's not UI related so
everything except for the Android dot
package has been ported over to Robo VM
and then there's two other files there
I'm going to talk more about those in a
short bit here so let's just create a
new clause here with the main method
so something happened down here there's
Robo beam console and you can see here
that Eclipse created this file and
compile it into Java bytecode and the
Robo bean plug-in took it and compile it
for Mac OS 10 x86 so I'm just going to
remove some noise here and
and I'll say then you can see that it
compile again so let's launch this okay
so we launched by now we launched by
just right clicking the close run as
constable application and now you will
see that it will do a bunch of stuff
here this will take a bit should start
to go a bit faster soon so what happens
now is that this is the first time ever
that I'm compiling the runtime class
library so I had this hello world class
with the main method and it used some
stuff in the runtime class library so
Robo VM will analyze the class that has
the main method and then all of those
dependencies like system dot out print
line all of those classes that the main
method needs will be compiled here and
then the dependencies of the
dependencies and so on until we've
compiled everything that this particular
program needs so this is a one time
thing the result here will be cached and
then when we relaunch this later on it
won't have to compile these classes so
you only have to do this probably uh
every time you install a new version of
Robo VM I guess and yeah if you clear
the cache of course you will have to
compile this again so as you can see
there's quite a lot of stuff that needs
to be compiled for a simple hello world
application and I haven't analyzed this
at all there's maybe there is some stuff
some things that you can
some dependencies here that we can break
up to make this smaller the the number
of houses that you would need that's
just I think it will be finished pretty
soon
okay so now you can see that it start
started to link there's three 13:51
classes that it needed and there's the
results so if I just relaunch this now
you should see that it's already done
all the complex so now it just has to
link those classes and takes seconds
alright let's do something more
interesting so I'm creating a new
project a project again and this time
I'm choosing the Robo VMI project and
I'm going to call this iOS hello world
and this time it it's it has selected x
x86 and iOS here for increment
incremental build settings because
that's what we want to compile for by
default because it's quite like likely
that we want to test this in the
simulator and the simulator is runs x86
binaries and this time I'm also have to
specify the name of the main Clause that
I'm going to create later on I need to
give it a name this is what will show up
on the iPhone yeah on the springboard or
whatever it's called and I have to give
it a unique ID as well
like so
okay so this is what we we've got now
it's pretty much similar to what we had
for the console just for the complete
console application this time we also
have this Robo VM cocoa touch library
here so these are the cocoa touch
bindings and if we have a look here
there's a robo vm of C jar that's the
Objective C bind the bindings yeah it's
it's just a code that makes it possible
to call into object you see there's
users developers won't interface with
that I guess but here's what you would
use so these are the cocoa touch
bindings there are there's one pack
package for each framework that we've
mapped so far there's more lots more
frameworks in iOS but so far we were
covering UI kit pretty well and this is
what we will use to draw you eyes
also lever let's have a look at this
first that we skipped before here's the
Robo VM the properties file so those
things that we entered when we created a
new project in the new project wizard
those will be stored here so there's the
main class and the name of the ID and
the name of the app and then there's
this magic file here it's called Robo VM
dot XML and this contains configuration
for the compiler so it tells the
compiler what to do when we launch the
launch the application or if we package
it for distribution or to the App Store
so we can see that this is an iOS app we
want to target the arm thumb instruction
set yeah there's some more stuff in here
that yeah and you can also there's a
lots of lots more stuff that you could
put in here we're going to have a look
at an example later on but as you can
see here there are we use these app dot
main clause for instance here that's
those comes from the properties file so
the idea is that you're not supposed to
have to go into this file and and edit
it you just have to go to the properties
file and change stuff there then there's
this info dot P list dot XML file every
iOS app oops needs is a file called info
dot P lists and it gives information
about the app that iOS needs like what
it's called and its version and what
kind of orientation it supports and
icons stuff like that
and as you see we can also use these
placeholders here so we can put stuff in
in the properties file and we don't have
to change that much in this file
all right let's create that main clause
that we specified before
okay so in iOS any iOS app needs to have
an UI application delegate so that's
that's a an interface it's an
objective-c protocol and a protocol is
basically the same as Java interface and
this protocol defines a couple of life
cycle methods that iOS will call when
the application launches when it goes
into the background when it comes back
again and when it's about to get killed
and stuff like that so I'm going to
import application delegate and
extending the an adapter that exists
inside this application delegate
interface because I don't need all these
lifecycle methods all I'm interested in
the did finish launching this one so
this will be called just after the
application is launched and this is a
good place to create a simple GUI and we
have to just return true with everything
went well okay so the only thing we'd
have to do here in the main method is to
tell you our kids to start the main UI
thread and we need to tell it the class
that implements the UI application
delegate interface and this is how we do
that we just give it our iOS hello world
Claus like that all right so this is
this is the the minimal iOS application
let's see what happens if we launch this
so I'm right-clicking the project run as
iOS simulator app and I will simulate
the night I phone this this time so
let's see what happens
what happened now hey yeah great I'll
tell you when to switch okay so this is
the minimal iOS app it doesn't do very
much just black screen so let's do
something something more interesting I'm
going to create a UI window and a UI
window is a kind of top-level container
on iOS so I'll create a new UI window I
want to I need to give it a position and
size so I'm going to give it the same
size as the main screen so it just
covers the full screen like this and I'm
also going to give it a background color
so it won't get won't be black like
light gray like that and then I have to
tell I was to make this to make this
window the with visible one like this so
let's just relaunch
okay so gray screen so let's I'm going
to add a label here as well
a new loo uilabel and I need to tell it
where where to position and size of that
and I'm also going to set it text on it
so this is going to be left aligned so
what I wanted to be in the center so I'm
going to set the alignment to NS text
alignment Center and then I have to add
this to the window as a child so subview
okay I'm also going to just set the
background color to transparent
they call it clear color in iOS and I
also want the phone to be a bit lawyer
so let's set that to 30
okay yeah I also want to have some kind
of interactivity here so I'm going to do
a button as well
so this is how we create a new button
and I want one of those with rounded
corners and I'm also going to set its
title to click
oh and also need to tell it where to
position itself give it a frame
and find learn is added to the window as
well so it shows up
okay
and would be nice is something happen if
we click the button as well so the last
thing I'm going to do is to just add on
touch up inside listener
and
and I'll change the text of the label to
thank you okay
let's try that
all right
okay very useful thank you
very useful application so how would we
go about if we wanted to submit this to
the App Store well first of all you have
to have all your keys and certificates
and provisioning profiles and all of
those stuff prepared that's something
you have to go to Apple's website to to
get once you have all those things just
right click the project there's a robot
VM tools option here menu and then we'll
just select package for App Store and
here we can we will create what's called
an IPA so that's a package that we can
submit to Apple I'm not going to do this
here but just select a destination
directory all your signing your
identities should come up here if you
want to do a distribution you should
choose probably something called iPhone
distribution and yeah you can you should
be able to use also here and it will
just determine which provisioning
profile to use once this has been done
you will get an IPA package in your
destination directory that you would use
this application loader application it's
something that comes with Xcode so if
you've done any objective-c coding in in
Xcode before you might have used the or
Kev thing the archive option when you
want to submit your app to app store but
there's another there is another way to
get your app onto App Store and that's
using an IPA and the application loader
so inside application loader you would
enter your Apple ID the ones the one
that is associated with your Apple
Developer account and then you can just
upload your IPA and there will be some
automatic validation and hopefully it
will be accepted and then you have to
wait for Apple to review it and approve
it and yeah
yep
from the
yeah yeah
yeah so all the perishing profiles they
are located in a special folder in your
home directory and they are you can
parse those files they are peer lists
plist files yeah so that's what I'm
doing here the Xcode project there is no
Xcode project no there's no
No
yeah the question is how the uikit
bindings actually actually calling to
the cocoa touch side the Objective C
code it's a bit involved you have to you
have to read the there's this Objective
C runtime so everything that you can do
in Objective C you can do from C and in
order to see obviously is just it's just
C with some additions so you can you can
when you create the clause there's a
runtime representation of that clause
and you can actually use the objective-c
runtime to create clauses on the fly at
runtime just like you if you're familiar
with JavaScript you can create classes
at runtime you can add methods to it
prop to the prototype whatever it's
called and call those methods you can do
the same in Objective C so and you can
also query an existing object give me
all the methods of this object
give me the the implementations you can
you can use you can use this to to the
to call to post messages to object to
see objects and that's what I'm I'm
doing here it's a bit it's it's a bit
involved you have to read the
objective-c runtime documentation
carefully but yeah it's it's a bit
complicated
I wouldn't be able to run the simulator
yeah
yeah the question is whether whether you
could use this on Linux and build
basically build iOS apps for on Linux no
you can't it's you would need the
there's a tool chain I mean Xcode comes
with this yeah there's the linker all
the frameworks that you work it and all
of that is needed yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
you need Xcode there is that I've seen
that there are projects that are they
managed to run the Xcode tool chain
under Linux because most of Xcode all
the command line stuff basically all of
them or open-source Apple makes provides
those so they managed to compile this
for Linux and so in theory it's possible
everything up to linking that you saw
here is done without any interaction
with Xcode but the linking is the big
part that would be hard it's possible
but it's hard to do that on Windows or
Linux and then there's when we run on
device or if we build an IPA you also
need to sign your application that's
that's a command that I'm using code
sign and yeah so there are some bits and
pieces but it's doable but not easy
the question is whether the compiler
here outputs objective-c or whether its
outputs machine code directly right yeah
so there's an intermediate step here I'm
using the LLVM project if you're
familiar with that so the compiler here
it will output something called LLVM bit
code and LLVM is this nice framework
that takes this platform almost
platform-independent bit code which is
like byte code but more low-level and it
can output machine code for a large
range of different CPUs and
architectures and this is also what
Apple are using inside Xcode when you
build a big DC so yes the compiler here
outputs machine code directly almost
directly
there's no objective-c involved at least
yes
that's alright
no it is possible but it's not something
that you can do easily right now there's
actually a guy on the on the mailing
list he's he's using this to combine
Java and objective-c stuff so when we
compile here the output will be an
object on an object file for each class
file and he's he's taking all of these
object files and he builds one static
library of that and then he has his his
main clause in his main function in C or
object to C and he just links this
together - yeah so and he's using this
from s from Xcode but it's not a use
case that is supported it's possible but
yes
yeah yeah I've planned to show you some
more demos here I can't really answer
how much of Java 8 of the Java 8 API is
that or in the these Android runtime
closes but maybe I can show you
something more here and then we can take
some more questions
okay so this is this is called a
calculator app it's one of the samples
from the JavaFX ensembl application so
let me just yeah this one I'm going to
launch on my iPhone here so
so while that is building here
JavaFX what's open-sourced I think back
in January so what I'm using right here
is this open source code but since Joe F
open Joe FX is relying quite a lot on
API sin Java 7 and Java 8 and there is
also some uses of lambdas and default
methods and all of those new things that
we will get in Java 8 since we can't use
those here I'm using a back port of the
open GFX project and this is not
something that I'm maintaining it's
others in the open jfx community or
maintaining this so this is a back port
or that III think that you can do pretty
much everything that you can do with a
regional open jfx code but you have to
be careful to not use any Java 8 or Java
7 stuff in your application code so can
we get the iPhone
Oh
it's just for China
oh I'll just do this
okay so this is the the JavaFX
calculator app yeah you can see that
it's someone who's good at counting can
see if it's correct so yeah this is this
is not something I'm I'm working that
much on but I managed to get this
running on iOS and this is a very simple
example of course but it should be
possible to use Robo VM to build job FX
apps as long as you are being careful of
not using the new Java 7 and Java 8
api's so
yep so the question is how do we how
does Java fix draw stuff on iOS right
actually open GFX contains code native
code for iOS so back in January Oracle
has probably done this internally
something with iOS and JavaFX and they
release this to the community and said
that we're not going to I mean we're not
going to support this we will we won't
provide a JVM for this but if the
community is he is interested here's the
code and use it so we can see here in
the in the project that there's quite a
lot of stuff here under the lib folder
no can we switch again okay great
so under the the libraries here there's
this J of X or T dot jar of course and
that comes from the from the back port I
was talking about down here there's also
this special jar that we need for this
to work because the open the effects
stuff they are using a few things under
the Sun dots package and the comb dot
sound package that that aren't available
on Android so there was a need is
compatibility jar file here and then
there's a bunch of static libraries and
these contain the iOS JavaFX
native code so this is all already been
provided by by Oracle and the open GFX
community
and here's an example of how you what
you might may have to do to get stuff
like to have ethics running because when
we did this when we compiled before and
robo VM did this dependency thing that
thing doesn't take reflection into
consideration so if if the code use is
closed dot for name for instance that
Clause will not be compiled in my may
not be compiling so here we need to
specify a few clauses that we force to
link in so even if they are not used at
all by the application they will still
be linked in that's what the force link
clauses here does and I specified a bit
too much here so this results in a in
over 7,000 clauses to be linked in which
gives I would imagine a very big
application just for this simple
calculator calculator app so I would
imagine that maybe half of that would be
needed to actually run this and then we
need to specify a few libs few static
libraries here so this specifies all of
those like we had here on the lib in the
Lib folder this will be linked in at
compile time together with the other
stuff and they contain the dominative
interface functions that are needed by
Java effects and finally the Joe ethics
native stuff they also call into system
frameworks so we need to specify those
so that those are linked in when we
compile
all right so the last thing I'm going to
show you is I worked a bit with a lip
GDX community because they are quite
interested in in getting this porting
libgdx to robo vm so I've been giving
code that's actually it's it's not a toy
it's not a sample or anything it's an
actual game that is in App Store it's a
it's on Play Store and it's a commercial
game which was recently ported to robo
VM to use that libgdx back-end so now it
will should launch the iPad simulator
instead
so libgdx they already had have iOS
support but they are using this thing
called the mono touch which which is
actually Seashore for iOS so this is a
kind of strategy game it's not possible
to get sound no oh so this is pretty
cool game I'm not that into strategy and
but it's it's a pretty neat yeah so this
is this is originally based on mono
touch so libgdx has this transformation
step they can take Java code to a
bytecode and run it through this IQ vm I
think it's called and it gets translated
into dotnet what is it called
il I think like it's the dotnet
equivalent of bytecode so but yeah so
this guy he ported this robo vm and he
he managed to double the frame rate
actually when he did that because the
there's there was a lot of overhead in
the in this mono touch was a bit of a
hack so there's a lot of opportunity for
improving performance here yeah and
finally I just show you this it's it's
another it's another game that's can I
can I have this again
okay so this is a game called deliverer
it's available on Android and on Steam
it's a commercial game and yeah it took
it took this guy 30 minutes to port this
to iOS using libgdx and robo vm so and
it's not it's it's mostly due to libgdx
being very good at this platform
independence so it's a kind of a dungeon
oh you probably don't see
oh yeah sorry but it's not very good
it's not very easy to see I guess well
you have to check it out if you've got
an Android phone you can find it on
Google Play Store it's a pretty fun game
so anyway so can I switch again please
so what's in the future there's a few
things that we still need to do
documentation debugging we need to
complete these cocoa touch bindings it
would be cool to have some kind of
interface builder integration maybe not
very important but could be useful when
building UIs and also it would be cool
to be able to build applications on
Windows and Linux not having to have
this Mac you can use of course you can
if if you you can you could use codename
one of course because they have this
platform independence you can build they
they have this build server that would
that helps you if you don't have a Mac
you can build on their build server and
you will get yeah yep alright so that's
it
any questions yes
the naming if if the naming is
consistent with Koko yeah yes the the
idea is that you should be if you you
should be able to read the cocoa touch
documentation there is some stuff we
don't like to see that's really weird if
you looked at how they for instance a
message on in object you see a method
name that would roughly correspond to a
method name in in Java it can be I don't
know 50 characters or so so I try to
what I've done so far is I tried to Java
Java Phi the the naming of methods but
yeah porn yeah I think there will be
yeah
yes how do how does it handle memory you
mean specifically for the Objective C
breeding in Java generally oh okay no
we're using a garbage collector so it's
the it's a bomb
GC it's a very popular GC used in a lot
of places it's not as sophisticated as
you you have in the Noriko's JVM of
course but it's it works and that's what
we're using yes you in the back in blue
yeah how is this being funded yeah it's
right now I have my own company there's
two of us working on this right now it's
everything is open-source that you've
seen today we would like to be able to
fund this somehow right now we're
funding this without their project but
we would like this to be self-funded at
least maybe be able to hire some more
people to work on this so we're still
considering how to do this but maybe
some kind of support contracts or
add-ons things that would add value to
this yes
all right
okay thank you thank you yes what Apple
thinks of these sort of things yeah well
there's as I said we already have one
app published in the App Store so there
there's there's no problem with the
binaries that we produce there are other
similar tools so codename one for
instance they are doing something
slightly similar and then there's a mano
touch of course that I mentioned they do
this is very similar to mano touch but
they are doing this for dotnet and they
have I yeah imagine there's lots of apps
in App Store already that have been
built on mobile touch yes
yeah so the first question was what was
the first question
J - a Bob see ya if I'm using J -
obviously that's a Google project no I'm
not using that so J - op C is text Java
and it outputs object you see and it
uses there's no GC it uses the automatic
reference counting and all that so no
I'm not using that this takes byte code
and you get machine code and the second
question was yeah oh okay since there's
no JIT will this be slow
no if in theory it could I mean it could
be as fast as C or whatever so yeah
we're ahead of time copepod yeah
no I'm not doing anything with webkit I
mean if there's the UI webview
there's bindings for UI webview but
there's nothing else for WebKit is that
also is your question I haven't tested
so I can't promise anything it should
work yep well Java C does quite a lot of
static in learning I think for constant
and stuff like that right but fine oh
okay
no I don't know not yet at least
if you there's problems with that if I
mean if you want to have consistent
stack traces and unwinding and stuff
like that you need to know where you
were
so this loss release i turned on i
implemented release builds optimized
release builds so i've turned on most of
the stuff that you can do automatic
optimizations that you get from LLVM so
for instance there's a there's a there's
a tail call optimization in in LLVM that
i could have used
there's inlining LLVM will do that if we
want to but it can mess things up
especially the tail calling but also the
inlining of other things so but maybe I
mean we could add that as an option in
the future maybe you can annotate this
master method and tell the compiler that
it's okay to do a tail call here but I
didn't I don't want to do that without
the user actually I mean telling me to
do that explicitly yeah
No yeah so what are the use cases
because if you have your Android app you
have to yeah you can't just take that
because the you guy parts are not there
yeah III think that Android developers
would use this but you have to structure
app accordingly so that you separate non
UI stuff out and you can reuse that it's
not for reusing 100% of your code but if
you stretch you or your app correctly or
in a good way you can share a lot of
code between the two platforms and then
there's also the like that DDX there's
play and there's Jane monkey energy
maybe they could use this and probably
use 100% of their code because it's just
Java and it's OpenGL and it's everything
will be available on both platforms
if it can take advantage of Cindy like
SS e on on intellect CPUs and there's a
yeah I can LLVM does that so there's
like I think there are a couple of loop
vectors built into alarm though so
turned on I haven't I don't know if they
are actually doing anything if you have
I haven't seen it's actually paralyzing
anything but it should I mean if in
theory it should should be possible
yeah so so what the main motivation
behind this yeah it's a good question I
would imagine that the leveraging all
those third-party stuff everything that
all those open-source projects and all
that it's one thing of course there's a
huge it's a large number of things that
you can get for free in the java world
also you don't have to I mean if you're
a Java developer you develop for Android
you would be able to reuse your skills
on iOS you don't have to learn object to
see you have to learn your new Mac
probably and you have to learn you have
to learn the api's but it takes away the
object a seaport at least
right yeah we're going after it really
hurried up one basic base
yep
there's no interpreter oh but the first
question was what oh yeah we can take
the lighter okay yeah sure the first one
later no but okay but you have to repeat
the question
just one question I'd time that because
I forgot forget the first question
really yes yeah why don't we use the why
don't we well I haven't reported the
Android UI stuff yeah right I guess it
it could be done in in theory I don't
know what that would yeah No
yes oh and there's also other stuff in
the Android packages that wouldn't make
sense on iOS like all these providers
and stuff that it would be hard to map
that onto iOS this is only for iOS yeah
I mean you in theory you could probably
do this on Android as well but it would
wouldn't make as much sense yep okay
thanks
