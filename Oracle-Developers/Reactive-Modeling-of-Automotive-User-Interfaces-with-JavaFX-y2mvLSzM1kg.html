interfaces I think since the early days
of Java when my java was the answer to
animated gifs in the web I guess I've
been waiting for Java it's a long time
but I'm happy to have it now ready for
production I'm working today at focused
on group research I am responsible in
our research projects for the user
interface software architecture Simon
my name is Simon gala
I'm working for the pre-development
Department of Works wagon my job is to
bridge the gap between the richer
research guys and a serious development
and I'm in the infotainment domain and
therefore I'm glad that peter reuter has
chosen a connected core example in his
keynote on sunday since the connected
car poses a lot of challenges to us how
to implement that and how that deliver
the whole set of new functions that are
possible by the connected car to the
customer in by a easy-to-use interface
we have high customer expectation driven
by consumer electronics and all these
functions and all these expectations
need to be met in a way that it is safe
to use all these new functions by
driving so peter has shown what might be
possible in the future with Java but
some of today's cars already run job and
we want to take a closer look at what's
going on with Java in infotainment
systems and cars we brought several
demos that we will show over the course
of this talk and let me say one more
thing before going over the agenda this
is an interactive session so feel free
to ask whenever you like
first of all we will start with give you
a little bit of background what's going
on in user interface software
development in the work swaggin group
what's going on in the research
department they do a lot of prototyping
and the user interface domain wanna
introduce you to the user interface
framework called tapas that is used by
Volkswagen group research and of course
then we want to introduce you to
reactive your eye modeling which we
think is a good answer to structure
large-scale user interfaces and of
course we want to show you how this can
be implemented with java ethics and last
but not least we want to close with
showing you what we've done on top of
the motive target hardware with java
effects okay good just to give you a
little bit of background here
what's brain goo consists of twelve
independent brands each of which has
several car models and most of them are
sold worldwide and yeah that leads to
the fact that we have more than more I
think we have actually 140 different car
models and each of these car models
needs a somewhat adapted infotainment
system and user interface for example if
you park your car and you see the
parking assistance systems you see a
bird's-eye view of your car and you want
to see the exact same car that you're
sitting in right this is just a simple
example of why we need adapted user
interface software for each of these
cars we have adaptations to two
different for example have different
navigation systems in the States and in
Asia compared to the one in Europe there
are different satellite radio systems
around the world available and all that
leads to a vast variety of difference of
the
variance that we have to build which is
a major challenge to us and of course
each of these software variants have to
be built in the highest quality wouldn't
be acceptable for you as a driver that
you have to go to the workshop to pitch
your cars software right so yeah this is
a major challenge just to do that all
that in time what you see here on the
right is it's a picture taken in a golf
mug 7 2013 not yet available in the
States but soon available in the iPad it
will soon be introduced here and we want
to keep that picture in mind since we
want to see your demo in the end which
is about that infotainment system here
and when I'm talking about infotainment
system I mean the software that actually
runs that central display here in the
center console you so some interesting
stats around infotainment systems here
in the working group so that extra
system here consists of more than 2
million lines of Java code and this is
just only the HMI software portion it is
there is more than a hundred different
variants of this software because of the
reason I mentioned before that we have
to adapt there two different two
different models different different
brands different regions and this leads
to the vast number of variants that we
have to build all this software is
actually a large portion of it is it's
generated code and this code is
generated based on state chart models
which are used to describe the screen
flow for example and over the course of
this talk we will see that they are
actually eternities to that that allow
for that have some advantages over state
chart models the code that we generate
is Java 1.4 code and it uses a
proprietary graphics tag that is based
on OpenGL ES which enables for platform
independent
but from independencies or that we can
run this user interface software on
different hardware that you buy from
different vendors all right in group
research we also build hm ice but with a
different focus we built these HMIS
to try out new user interface concepts
and yeah what you see here for example
is a user interface concept that is
shown on the seabed fair last year the
what is necessary in order to build
these user interfaces and research is
that you have a very flexible
environment that allows you for fast
prototyping and the guys in research in
the past they've used flash but today
they've found a better alternative and
maybe yes you can talk a little bit more
about what you've done there when I
started focus on the main technology
being used for these prototypes were
flash I never was a friend of flash and
frankly but of course when I jumped in
that was standard for the agencies and
companies which supplied us with
prototypes and what we somehow also
developed in-house but this was a quasi
standard for prototyping and I think two
years ago at the Jackson in Germany I
heard about second run for Java fix and
immediately tried it out and since then
we think this is the best choice the
best technology for us to meet our
requirements and since two years we
built our prototypes now in Java X so
what you see here is a demonstration of
an autonomous environment which has been
shown this year at sea with a
the ferony NOFA and it's a written Java
fix already so since these two years yes
yes that's a very good question because
I mean I have no robot right now but
it's a good question because I think if
you look only at prototype being hm eyes
I won't say that flash is so bad yeah I
mean we did fairly good jobs and
bringing fresh user interfaces to our
managers to get an idea but integration
of this was our service landscape yeah
and we don't take everything I mean was
flesh it was common to shake everything
and nothing worked at all and when I
started I mean management always want to
make real phone calls in in our in our
demonstrators yeah they want to to have
a real navigation system somehow hooked
in and and the s why we chose Java based
service landscape was or CI and in
middlewares and so on and to add that
flash on top of that well I mean it's a
burden and to make this all one smoothly
yeah so I think the perfect way to work
now is to have an integration and
seamless usage of all these services
middlewares
together was a very good user interface
experience which can be done in Java now
I think this is exactly why we why we
chose it so why this is a kind of single
product we decided two years ago to go
for framework which yes
no I mean this is very important to
mention at this point what what Simon
showed you before and this isn't me why
we emphasize it we use Java and current
service production it's based on Java
1.4 it's based on State Route modeling
yeah it's a great job they make great
products and we are thinking ahead of
how to improve development speed
development robustness testing I mean
that's a lot of work behind and we have
the pressure from electronics from
consumer electronics to make much more
happen to have a even better user
experience and so on so we need to have
an answer how to how to yeah meet all
these requirements and I think with Java
X now we can get even better and also
for the modeling process as we will have
a closer look soon we have a half an
alternative which we which we show here
but the current CV systems don't use
Java fix not that all dtt I mean it is a
wonderful product and a great experience
but this is done I mean maybe you know
that it has its it's as I said before
it's a proper tarry software stack Java
based but not yet Java fix based and we
are investigating suitability of Java
fix for these kind of products so two
years ago we started to build a
framework around our to better it
different versions of applications for
our our demonstrations with it which is
Java a big space as I said before we use
OSGi as our middleware to have a kind of
easy way to use services to use apps and
to update software I mean it's it's a
great tool to go onwards dynamic and
modular requirements now based on all CI
we offer the ability to choose between
different main of
occasions so the main application would
be like the container or the host of the
relapse
I mean it's similar to the app concept
as we know it from from consumer
electronics on smartphones or tablets so
the interesting point here is that the
main application can be very different
each from one other so we have different
Hardware settings different operating
system I mean different operating
concepts like a single small screen for
instance with hardware buttons around or
we have a big screen without any
hardware buttons anymore and we have
even applications which use several
screens with a display without any
interaction and the second display as a
touch display for instance if there was
time enough people have a look at all
these different applications so it's not
a framework which ones in single ready
container but it's a framework to build
different containers and then in these
containers different apps of your choice
can run apps in terms of a certain
function like like a tuner Media Player
or navigation and for the navigation we
also build a map based on Java FX 3d we
will have a look at that as well so you
can combine a certain main applications
with different apps and these apps they
run at the different main applications
of course and what we do in terms of
modeling and implementing the screen
changes the flow of the overall logic is
to model the behavior in terms of a
reactive model and this is a focus in
the session as well so we will look
closer at how we do this without HR
bottling I think it's time for first
demos if there is no question at this
time this is a few screenshots already
we will look at all these variants
can switch here I think so what you see
what you see here is a a kind of pre
priests out I mean the the it's
a pretty sis or the latest infotainment
yeah that's what you can buy in the
states now it's not the latest one it
was the one before which we saw the
other picture so it's a similar concept
in terms of he had the Hardwicke's at
the side you have a display in the
center and the artwork is local
different I guess now in this frame we
start our applications they should run
on such an operating environment with
these buttons and so on but of course
what we see now is not the serious
software but our framework so this has
been developed like two years ago
it's a reimplementation of a framework
which we built in flash already so the
design might look a little bit
old-fashioned we will change that okay
but just to introduce a concept at the
first main application which we offered
so you can access the different apps
with a heart where buttons of course but
since we have other apps we needed a
kind of main menu which we see here and
there's nothing special you have maybe a
media player you have some kind of lists
here and here can play the music of
course now what is a nice feature
already in the in this version is that
you can have several apps side by side I
mean in this case you can have two yeah
so let's say you have two media player
and you can open your contacts and start
a phone call and still operating the the
media player yeah I mean it's a kind of
basic we don't have many animations here
that as I said the design is not really
compelling now this was two years ago
one year ago yeah I think I have to set
up a little bit to switch the display so
yeah let me give you some background so
from two years ago to now the screen
technology has rapidly evolved in
screens are getting larger and larger in
cars
the resolution is is increased and we
want to make use of that and the tapas
renfe allow us to do so since we can run
the same apps in a different
presentation container right and this
new presentation container that you will
see now makes use of the larger display
space it also introduces new concepts
like we want to get we want to get rid
of the hard keys that you've seen before
and introduce soft keys allowing for a
lot more degrees of freedom we can add
all kind of new features like history of
apps that you've opened favorites and
another cool thing that you see here is
that little camera this is not to record
your driving skills it is it is for
sensing you approximating the screen and
then the screen can adapt accordingly
actually this camera is it for gesture
recognition because the sensor for
proximity we have an current service
system is a very thin black line you
won't recognize this can even do more so
we have this as a basic for many
different research projects they make
gesture recognition and speech
recognition new ideas so it's kind of a
playground for research projects
yeah I mean this is not about just in
particular and you just can imagine if
you look at the window management here
yeah this can be done by simply swiping
in the air or something like that and
like like a manual switch on/off but
this is nothing very special yeah and I
mean I think the more interesting
projects I don't have the approval to
talk about so let's keep on the other
user interface as we show it here ok but
but I just wanted to mention the camera
would be for even more research subjects
in this case yeah so you see the design
is a little bit more a little bit more
modern I guess but it's the same as if I
open the media app it's the same app as
we saw before you know definitely a
little bit different design but again
the same thing what is nice that we can
have now since the display is so wide
even more space so the apps must offer
this functionality to the app to adapt
to different sizes and yeah we can we
can switch them we can move them to the
other side and so on
so I mean if you if you like the other
design of course yeah we can we can
switch back to it yeah I mean that's not
the point
in terms of CSS skinning it's very easy
to search between the sides so there we
go it's the old one yeah and if you like
it and like this kind of pattern Styles
yeah you can go with it and this by the
way is an important feature I mean you
want skinning you want personalization
by the user in the car this currently is
not really supported too much by us yeah
okay salmon is calling me I think I
don't want to talk with you right now so
let's stop it can you do it again please
I mean if I want to talk with him okay
I can let's say accept and I even can
make it now a real app in my
container yeah so maybe it's interesting
to see this because the main application
may decide how to how to work with
alerts you know every application has
its own way to present such an alert and
- I mean integrate it in the window
management yeah did you stop the call
okay yeah let's switch back to the other
design I don't really don't like this
one okay I really need to find this
button this is English here I guess and
one more thing a nice thing about Java
is that we can seamlessly scale and this
is even a good point if you look at the
display variety coming up in the cars I
mean you've all seen these Tesla huge
windows I mean huge screens and so on so
and we have waiting and everything I
mean this is all Java fix I mean it's
easy when I speak as Java X when Simon
speaks what was it Java 1.4 yes
something like I'm just kidding excuse
me okay now this is a this is a
Microsoft Surface pro 3 and we had to
exchange this last night because the
other one was broken the LED was was
broken and we really at the end have a
showcase of a software which one's very
nicely honor I mix 6 and this Simon were
present at the end now because this
would be the next steps regarding
bringing this to serious development I
mean this is a progress and we are
fighting hard for it ok ok I was talking
about the display resolution so I would
simply use the the seamless scaling of
Java if X in terms of I think I must
switch this on
I put this to center
is also Cruiser I did my glasses
actually does anybody read the birth
center here Center that's a problem now
we are Center and now I can scale it
because if I don't send her prior to
scaling I can't operate it anymore
so now it's better to read I guess for
you and I like the seamless scaling of
course I also want to bring this
background now away it doesn't makes any
sense anymore
it was simply a background of course it
was not part of the application now what
is more to show here shortly I have a
look at multi client scenarios I mean
this is the center console application
but of course if you're in the rear seat
you might want to use your tablet or
your smartphone to operate the system as
well so we have here integrated of
observer which we can access in in terms
of of a little web browser this is all
engineer who is here but we can show the
idea can you can you can you scream when
I hit the edge of an i-5 Fortuna is it
this one
thank you so we have the Kuna here we
have the Kuna there and of course it's
synchronized so this could be a nicer
GUI not an engineering GUI in your
smartphone or on your tablet and the
rear seat for instance so that they are
synchronized and this is not I mean this
is not safe certainly this is not
obvious yeah in current count cards I
mean you see this it these days in the
market but in terms of the software the
api's and so on it's it's not obvious
that this is working the map yeah good
good part I want to show the map
actually at the very end because it it I
can show the man now now the map ISM is
a 3d map the data is taken in time from
a database and in time
the triangular meshes are built so on
different zoom levels you see different
details now so I mean as you expect from
such a mat that's not nothing new but
the new thing is I guess that is not
bitmap based now I think that the demo
and the keynote with a map this is like
a bitmap based roster as it is of course
the the the usual way what we want to do
here we want to add research features
and we need more access on skinning on
being flexible on every detail so that
why we use this triangle ization here
and yeah being able to more customize
the maps we can have a look like this we
can have a look at at the measures in
terms of showing the wires here so you
see that this is really triangular lay
put triangulated yeah I mean this is a
database from I think it's a coming
serious database as well it's a it's a
profit help format or some vendors but
now what's really nice something more
about the tuner maybe there's a question
oh yes
this is I think an offered
tranquilization of areas and the
tranquilization of the areas is already
done by the database and we already
complained about the bed algorithm yeah
because you can see it's it's not really
optimized number of triangles what we do
on ourselves is the the routes the
streets and I think they are pretty nice
yeah you see the round corners but
there's no extra is it yeah you can see
it yeah so it's really for two colors
the the necessary amount of triangles
you need so that it's smooth but the
areas are already given in terms of
triangles and this must be improved I
guess
definitely and to be honest I wanted to
show it this year at this moment we have
yeah it's postponed yeah so I think in
the real car demos we have next year in
our plan we could have a 3d model with
Ryutaro and with a weather how to say so
we have out a lot of the earth so that
at the horizon it would get a little bit
Wow nothing like that yeah this is
planned definitely because this is not
really 3d it's 3d 2d at and a half yeah
so the real benefit of 3d will be when
we have it with a terran definite should
we have a look at the at the service
model in terms of functional services
apps as a service the dynamics in terms
of starting and stopping should we have
a look at that so this is an expert app
the usual use I wouldn't see it I see
all that was the I services here I can
filter them for this example for tuna
tuna services so we see two services
here one is the tuna functional service
headless service in a way and we see the
app as a service and if I stop the
service the functional service I click
twice sorry
so if I click it only once it will not
be available anymore and the app must
show well there was no tuna here you
know and if we close the app you will
see it's disabled you know it can't
offer any service to you I also can stop
the app of course and in that case the
app will disappear from the menu I can
start it again it will appear in the
menu and I can start the service and
there was everything again this is nice
because you can buy this way simply by
your fancy app from a I don't know what
store maybe a folk song store in the
future and then you can install a new
new feature
on your in-car device on the fly you can
yeah very good fashion wrong person and
I I would love to do everything to make
this happen but this is difficult to
answer in terms of what do we want what
does the community want
what does customers want do you really
want to have a choice of thousand EPS in
such a store for your car do you want
that I'm not sure I mean this has been
discussed and I definitely won't give
any answer here I want to make that
possible and if you decide to to open it
to a certain set of trusted partners I
mean you can't allow developers to bring
in every app in a running car of course
so there must be kind of gateway
certification and this is verse and
Apple would ever do because I mean it's
about rubber saving lives or not so this
is a really delicate question right are
we I'm running out of time um so this
was the the service maybe something
about a point where we definitely come
back later if you see the tuna here yeah
there was a list but the list wouldn't
fit nicely into the half mode view so if
I make this window smaller we jump back
to the to the main preset view I don't
like that too much
well well no this is I think this is
fine but you're right when we go back
now to broader view the list comes back
here and this is good to keep in mind
because when we make a transition here
and go back there was a kind of history
it shows you the list again yeah and
this is something people might like or
might not like yeah and we will have a
look how we how we handle this on our
models yeah okay
the one last thing I think what I like
about this concept of right and left
side is in this app we can make the
content different on the different
sighs of course for the drive of the
co-driver yeah so this is this is really
nice because in this case definitely we
want to change the colors or even the
temperature for the for the co-driver
and if it's on the other side it's for
the tribal and if we have room enough
for both we show both of them and we can
switch between them
just a little bit playing around yes
this is what the framework would provide
and an app might react on this most EPS
formed they don't care over that their
right or left but that's why I want to
show you this because it cares about now
I think that's it on this app right on
this this application let's go back to
the boring part back to the slides
yeah I mean if there was time at the end
we can have a look at the most recent
main application which is so at the
bottom line and there we would have a
simulated navigation routing and so on
but let's continue with the serious
parts which is about reactive modelling
so what you saw here is all being
modeled not with state charts which is
definitely a nice and nice approach but
we introduced a new paradigm here and
actually it's kind of related to
reactive programming what many I may ask
you who is a aware of reactive
programming okay
well it's it's actually I guess most of
you too because if you work with
bindings and so on it's already the
first step into reactive programming I
guess so there are some links yeah if
you want to read about layout of
programming but the the primary concepts
I think we get also from this talk so we
will discuss the reactive modeling on
the example of modeling the screen
changes with an NSF NAB so it's related
to a certain app and how it manages its
screen transition screen changes
okay so first reactive model is driven
by data we have like data which is
defined by - no there's a tuner service
available or not as we saw on the OCI
example yes it was there or it was not
there so that's a property which we
express in our model another kind of
properties which would be more user to
riffin in terms of what the user would
like to see in this case the user wants
to see the list of stations interesting
point here is this if this value would
be true it doesn't mean that the station
list is really shown it's just a wish
it's an expressed wish and these
properties would be influenced by events
also we still have events here that's
out of discussion so for instance if the
tuner service from our interfaces from
the service layer sends some events that
it's not available anymore in our model
the property will be set of all and if
the user on a certain button if he
clicks on a button like a list button
this property he wishes to see the list
would be set to true and the second step
and the model process would be to map
these properties to a screen and this is
a simple simple flowchart it's a simple
examination of the different property in
a properties in a certain priority order
to determine the result in view so even
if I mean we see it here even if the
property station this wanted is true if
there was no service you would not be
able to see the list of course so he
sees this morning aurora screen and also
the half you are fooled you
as you remember influences the screen
because in a small half mode screen the
list is not be able to be presented so
we still have the preset view to be
shown is that so far clear yeah it's
easy and it's a good news it's easy it's
easy to understand it's easy to build
it's robust and you can't always say
this of statecharts yeah so that's why
we probably introduced it
the good news also is that the time does
not matter here it's always a snapshot
in time it's a frozen moment and the
order of property changes prior to the
snapshot or the frequency of property
changes all this doesn't matter you
simply can expect from time management
which is also the basics for reactive
programming you can expect from time
management now this is a different
perspective yeah we have this formula
and we have the properties on which this
formula and the resulting screen depend
on we can have this flow very simple and
very concise and everything which is the
behavior within a scream this can be
described absolutely in a separate
document yeah to simply make things
decoupled from each other we can shortly
go through this behavior in terms of how
it relates to the properties of course
if you click here on the list button
this property lists water reset but to
be true you would end up in this view in
this screen and where the Return button
you will set this again to false now we
have other controls which affect the
service directly like next station
previous station this would have an
indirect influence on our model property
station the current station and of
course this is reflected again again in
the screen in terms of the current
station have a logo or whatever but this
is independent from the from the flow in
a way yeah this is described somewhere
else now it's an interesting point we
have the time for this okay
you remember this ListView which came
back after the window was resized back
so inherently we have a deep history if
you do stay chart modeling you know
about history and keep history
this must be actually explicitly set in
a state chart model here by us we have
by default a history because of all
these properties they won't change on
their own so if some thing happens and
is available again you will see all the
properties coming through again so if
you do not want history we need experts
it needs to set the history to clean it
up in a way so if you want to have the
list not to be appear again we have to
switch it off at a certain point yeah
but by that way it's easy to be
configurable even even yeah you can
build the variants very easily in making
this this cleanup or not
sorry we have it so we have this in the
demo I mean it's easy you can have a
setting and then it would appear over
part of here
maybe we can skip that hmm there are
many advantages of this reactive model
we have at the right side an example of
a navigation screen changing model and
you can imagine they scare very easy
they are also easy to debug and test
there's also a snapshot in time where
you can inspect all these properties you
can make a damper out of it and will
easily understand what's going on there
there are no race conditions in terms of
time there are no events which are gone
if you don't catch them everything is
persistent and can be inspected it's
easy to handle variance you can divide
everything in modules sim since it's a
simple function you can parameterize
them you can reuse them you can yeah I
mean as a programmer knows it's very
easy to structure bring structure under
these concepts also in terms of mighty
mighty model user interfaces
you could have speech or gestures
influences user wanted properties it's
not only a button press you simply say I
want the list and the property will be
set to true as well
where every gesture and it will be set
to a half mode for instance now it's
very very flexible and very rich in
terms of expressiveness and and ease of
use this is just another view on how to
handle variants you could have a common
set of properties a common set of
screens for all systems the same let's
say that way and then for a different
market or a different brand he would
have only to exchange the formula the
mapping formula so you can have a brand
a and a brand B and the behave really
different in terms of which screens
appear so on what time and what kind of
logic you have here and the rest is it's
the same now and the variant problem is
is a major problem for us a challenge
that say that way and this is very easy
to learn to be hand with you I even go
further that it's not only that's why we
talk about models it's not only an
implementation aid but it should be used
for precise using the face specification
as well as a precise because if you
would start to sketch and use interface
you would definitely start with a kind
of wireframe and so on but if it comes
to a precise education to be handed over
to the to the development team you must
be precise and I think this can be a
very good tool to to make a precise
specification and not a kind of pseudo
pseudo stage of a model which can't be
reused at all we could imagine a nice
tool so you can make the flowchart with
a graphical tool and you can simulate
the screen changes and everything and
even generate some kind of code but this
is not really necessary it would be nice
to have but you
and simply cold this coat is little
mapping formulas and the flow charts and
the properties manually it's a few lines
of code so there was no need for it an
expensive tool here a last word on the
implementation of course performance
matters and robustness method matters
and as I said before frequent property
changes or the order of property changes
both may have not an impact on the
result and the solution of course is a
bindings framework yeah you need a nice
bindings framework which supports
invalidation listeners and AZ evaluation
as Java ethics stars so the screen you
have guested it's a binding it's simply
a binding which is formula
anti-dependence
and it's very similar to the layout
mechanism yeah it's it's it's a copy of
that concept yeah
so you postpone all evaluation to the
next piles you request the piles and
prior to a CSS and the layout paths you
would simply switch to your new screen
and with the next rendering frame your
new screen is their layout it and CSS
done and everything yeah and by this the
notifications and the overhead the
affirmation of this formula so it used
to have minimum yeah I mean do we have
the time for the other demo if you keep
it short yep how much time do we have I
think we can have a very salt switch to
it but I need some time to set up things
here so maybe you can start with the
serious ideas of how to bring this to
serious and I try to set all this wanna
give you I want to give you a little bit
of a background here so as you might
know from Audi cars for example you can
either place the screen that showers
that's used for the infotainment system
and your ideal line
site which then makes it impossible to
reach it by your hands or you can use
touch screens but but you need to place
touch screens within reach and within
reach their own of hard to reach
since they are not any longer in the EDL
ideal line of sight the idea of the
concept that Ian's will show you shortly
is to find the sweet spot between these
two concepts which is done by having
actually two screens one screen in the
ideal line of sight that you don't
operate which is not a touch screen and
the second screen which is a touch
screen that is within reach
takes a little note it takes some time
to set this up man avocation I can I
don't see with I have to started with
the mouse mouse this is the navigation
now is there a mouse yes okay it's
running switch between s okay thank you
now now you see here what the driver
would see if he does not look too much
into the center console there's always a
there's always a conflict between
operating a touchscreen and looking at a
touchscreen so that's why many men and
manufacturers introduced indirect
operation like BMW or Audi in contrast
to Volkswagen which has a touchscreen a
single touchscreen now what we see here
is how can I get rid of this arrow there
that's not part of our array it's mine
good question again we we like both
therefore we do both yes yes right I
mean I'm from group first on group
research which is has all brands so I
like everything
Forest Arden somehow has a has a it has
to do with the size of your car yeah
should drive a large car it is very hard
to find a suitable spot for a
touchscreen since the car is larger and
the screen would be far away
so it would be hard to reach the imagine
a a door an a6 would be hard to place a
screen there so that it is still in red
it's always a compromise and therefore
our strategy is in luxury cars use a
dedicated hard keys and control us as
Audi does in a separate screen and in in
smaller cars use touchscreens okay
now the interesting point here is you
see that they are the content but you
don't see any buttons the buttons are on
a second display which I have here and
those also kind of touchpad integrated
into the touch screen where you can
manipulate yeah so it's the same app
again but the buttons are at another
place yeah so I can go to the list and
operate the list not directly but
indirectly by the way it's simply
another skin of the list of the tree
list it was some kind of hard work to
make it endless now that's not so easy
it stops here and then you have to go
over it and then you go at the beginning
again but it works now this is yeah I
think it could play there's a question
there is there is not a lot of show that
unfortunately will show it next year
I'll let you know ok I was a proof to
show this to you it's simple it's really
simple it's City you can imagine some
buttons and there was a touchpad yeah
it's believe me there were some buttons
in there no no there's no mouse yeah but
it's indirect and you saw the endless
list it's need a kind of focus where you
can go through and then say it this one
yeah why don't you call me now I know at
the end sorry sorry I'm confused maybe
we should go back to the slides
otherwise we won't be able to
this is a volume here it's a different
concept and just for the navigation just
just for the navigation you see you it's
a different concept of showing our load
yeah yeah the Fryeburg is is so rich
that you can have totally different
operating concepts of the same apps yeah
that that's the purpose of it and let's
let's make us a small navigation yeah I
think we want to try to you so there
should be three routes now appearing it
takes a little bit this navigation is
kind of up working it has started we're
too far away from routes which I guess
but so it's true
we don't have the time I mean this is
again the map you know and I would have
loved to show you the paths where we
would follow but it's a mock-up and
somehow it's not working right now yes
so that's the demos and we now look
again back to serious work to the
transfer this or some of those concepts
to the serious development ok please we
have one final demo for you if there's
time left so in the beginning we told
you that there is research going on and
all kind of HMI concepts and you've seen
several of them now and these research
guys use java ethics and use the
reactive modeling approach and we in
serious development we have our own java
software and use state short modeling in
order to describe in him and pace our
cogeneration pond though it makes sense
to check whether the approach of the
research is suitable also for serious
development
therefore we investigated that we
believe that because Java fix supports
hardware acceleration it can meets our
requirements for rendering performance
also it can meet requirements for simple
styling by means of CSS skin classes is
a powerful concept to exchange control
variants and Java fix of course supports
animations dynamic layouts and all other
kind of cool stuff that we implemented
an allowance so far what we did was we
we used the tapas framework that you
that you've seen here and reimplemented
parts of our existing infotainment
system from the Gulf seven that you've
seen in the picture and the beginning of
this talk and we let this run on an imx6
board using the Java 8's e embedded with
a compact 12 I - and use the minimal
OSGi implementation Felix and
unfortunately we didn't bring the board
here but we can show you guys the
another demo running on this surface
portable that shows you the current
progress of this evaluation yeah
all right so so this is the HMI as it
looks like in the 2013 golf or polo the
model of the car that will be introduced
to the states anytime soon this year and
so here the apps arranged in a different
way to what we've seen in the previous
examples and I want to show you the
media player here this system also uses
approximation sensing that is not done
by a camera as you've seen in the
research prototype but it has
this little bar here and it uses
infrared sensors and if you approximate
the display
the knobs the buttons will enlarge so
that you can use it if you D approximate
the display the buttons will shrink
again and all this could be implemented
easily by means of Java fix data binding
and so on of course we also have color
flow here and we have different kind of
cool animations and all this is exactly
it looks exactly the same way as in the
Sirius system so yeah our next step in
this evaluation will be to have this
demo running on UNIX operating system
since this is what we use in series
development and Oracle's engineering
team is helping us to provide for the VM
on this operating system and yeah this
is the last demo that we've brought and
we are at the end of our talk feel free
to ask any question that are left sure
it is a matter for serious development
you're you're right but for the research
prototype is not that important yet
something it's a kind of question where
you want to make the boundary I mean in
terms of having different VMs and so on
it's not such easy
we wrote a Tarot app I didn't want to
show it here I'm not sure how reaction
would be at the customs and so on but
there was a paragraph which tries to
behave as nasty as possible so that's
the application does it still works
again yeah so but I mean they're
different levels of measurements and
different levels of how you trust your
your
yes and ogi gives you some means to
decouple this software parts right sure
yeah no in terms of security you can
separate the commands easy of a social
life I think this I have shown but this
is not about security yeah no so this is
out of our scope actually yeah there's
another question yeah we do use this F
XML which is unfortunately the reason
why we have to use compact profile to on
our embedded hardware so yeah we would
love to see a tool in the near future
that actually generates code from these
F XML files so that we can run compact
profile 1 on our target okay
extend that offline that's that's good
news to us it's a point about using XML
most user interfaces which are kind of
static XML is a perfect choice to make
everything they fix somehow the
declaration yeah and then having the the
behavior written in Java now as you saw
we have many user interface powers which
are kind of very dynamic and it's still
a challenge how to use XML in an
environment where there's so much
dynamics in terms of laying out and so
on so we have F XML on micro paths which
are static but the more dynamic it gets
the mods coded
question
not take it yeah I hope you enjoyed it
