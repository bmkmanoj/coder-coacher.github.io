New York City I'm Bob Rupert with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
one more interview with the session
presenter from today's event and that
session presenter is Morris naphthalene
Morris tell the folks at home what you
do and where you do it well I'm a
freelance developer and trainer and
author and I do developing training and
writing books where I do it I do it from
where I live mostly and then I travel
all over the world to do it in other
places so tell me a bit about your
session today today I was talking about
a side project that I've had I mean
mostly what mostly what I do is I write
about I write and I think about Java SE
that's that's that's mostly where I work
I've written a couple of books about the
about the big releases in Java a book on
Java generics and collections and a book
about streams and lambdas from Java 8
but as a side project after Oracle
kindly gave me a Raspberry Pi at JavaOne
2015 I thought I'd just use it to
control something and I the the thing I
decided to control was the was the front
door of the tenement I live in and and
that was just I was like an amusement
coz I wanted to let people into the
delivery people into the stairwell when
there was nobody at home and I thought
well they could do that by telephoning
the Raspberry Pi and that turns out to
be quite interesting and also quite
difficult to do you have to install the
private branch exchange on the Raspberry
Pi and find a way of getting making the
telephone call arrive at it and then
getting that to control the door
actually controlling the door is easy
part we're receiving the telephone call
and using it is quite interestingly
difficult and then that got me thinking
some more about more recently I've been
thinking about well what other things
could you control in this way and what
you know but everybody's very interested
in conversational api's at the moment
and and chat box and I thought well I
think this would be a good subject for
that I've talked a bit about that and it
also got me thinking about home IOT and
the all the devices that we're getting
into our homes and how they're all
controlled by other people
and how dangerous that is in a variety
of ways model the alternative Idol
across the television right that's not
dangerous that might be kinda irritating
but it's not dangerous dangerous is when
your home IRT devices are being
recruited as zombie devices for a giant
botnet which is bringing down big
Internet servers with a huge huge denial
of service attacks that's that that's
that's definitely a possibility your
refrigerator and your CCTV camera and
your digital video recorder they are
zombies acting on somebody else's botnet
too astonishingly to bring it to bring
to bring down targets that people don't
like and the other possibility the other
thing to worry about is the fact that
something like Amazon echo which is so
attractive in terms of being able to
manage all of your home Aiki
requirements it's also listening to
everything you say and potentially the
leakage of information there is really
it is really really great so the
possibilities are really great but the
dangers are really great as well I may
need tranquilizers after I'm done
talking to you if people who attended
your session today walk away with one
idea that you've presented to them what
do you want that idea to be I laid out
situations that's it and I'm still
thinking about it a lot I mean what I
think would be really great would be if
there was some way in which we could
have a home hub but would that would
centralize control of all these devices
that we're going to have either dozens
or hundreds of devices in our home that
they connect you to the Internet in the
near future and this is commonly agreed
if they're all talking to the outside
world that's a very uncontrolled
situation it's liable to all these
dangers out talking about what would be
really nice would be if we could find
some way of having some sort of home
control of them and have a home hub
which we could which we can monitor and
control to ensure that it did the
talking to the outside world instead of
all these devices which have based which
are not working our interest will in
interest of the vendors
of those devices so there are projects
around that are working on this but
they're still very technical and I think
moving towards that goal would be would
be the thing that I would really like
people to bear in mind do you have any
other interesting Raspberry Pi projects
in mind no no it's not this is a side
project for me really I mean normally
what I think about is Java SE and job se
performance and how to program in it and
and and and what the performance of the
same of different data structures and so
on are so so this thing was with the
Raspberry Pi was just a kind of interest
that ghoul eggs do you do you write
about this on a blog is there any place
people saying I'm really bad about I'm
really I'm really bad about that I know
I should do okay well work out well
maybe yeah actually it's kind of growing
interesting enough to begin with I was
kind of embarrassed about it because you
know I'm a serious software guy and this
hardware stuff looks like looks like a
game really like no literally like a
hobby and then you realize that in fact
it's quite serious but I'm something to
take it more seriously I think I should
write about it I've written about I
write about the rest of the work that I
do but I'm written about this what if
your calendar looked like what speaking
engagements do you have in the near
future well I'm very pleased to have
been invited to give the this talk as a
serious IOT conference which is this is
the first time that's happened to me I
proposed it and people have accepted it
as a bit of fun but but it was kind of
quite it was quite gratifying to have it
taken seriously by people who know
really know about Internet of Things so
I'm going to talk it attract about it in
about four weeks I think and before that
I've got a talk which I really need to
do some work on as ever about efficiency
of collections in modern process and
modern systems so everyone knows about
the complexity of standard collections
about the big o-notation
and I've written everything about that
comparing the the collections in the
Java collections framework according to
the different operations they do and how
expensive those are in terms of
processor time but what I had what I
didn't realize 10 years ago and I wrote
about that
and what am increasingly conscious of is
the fact that the conventional ways of
measuring efficiency in terms using the
number of processor operations as a
proxy just completely out of date the
modern hardware behaves completely
differently and the cost of getting data
and instructions from memory to the
processor completely outweigh the cost
of actually doing executing the
operations when you get it there when
one processors are so fast that their
time they take it's almost it's really
mind you compared to the length of time
it takes to move data around within the
machine and that really influences what
you want to do in terms of data
structures and and and and processing of
data I forgot to say it I am talking
about I'm talking about on that subject
which I just said at Jack's finance in
London in there in two weeks time okay
so so you're busy if you're not busy
maybe you'd like to attend an Oracle
code event coming to your neighborhood
you'll find a complete list of the 17
remaining Oracle code events in this
series on developer oracle.com slash
code along with information on how you
can submit a session proposal for an
upcoming Oracle code event also you'll
find some great content for developers
thanks for watching stay tuned
I'm Barbara Bart with the Oracle
