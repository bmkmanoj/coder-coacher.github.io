the slide I'm a developer at Oracle I
work on the Oracle Enterprise pack for
Eclipse which is a set of free tools
that Oracle produces on top of the basic
Eclipse platform we also bundle for for
you a number of other things like pi dev
tools spring tools things like that and
then on top of that we also produce our
own proprietary support for things like
ADF which is a development framework for
for web and mobile I work primarily in
the web tier area I've done everything
from JavaServer faces in the past to
yeah this sort of thing that sort of
lightweight JavaScript thing so
obviously I'm going to talk a little bit
about why the ID is still important you
can already tell her my bias is counting
for him I think it's you know one of the
reason I think it's important is I work
on Eclipse and I think Eclipse is a good
tool so this is just a quick little
boilerplate I'm not going to talk about
anything in this talk that is in the
future so you know Oracle is a little
sensitive right now when we talked about
anything we're doing just in terms of
financial reporting and that so anything
that I talk about is stuff that's
already released at this point it's not
coming in the future
so just so there's no confusion there
all right and that there's a weird
little bug in this there we go all right
so quick program agenda I think I've
sort of covered this already but first
just very very quick I don't like to
talk too long in these these sort of
things the run hour-long I tend to want
to see people actually do real things
with a tool but I want to do do you want
to make too you know a couple quick
plugs for you know what the ID really is
what the sort of old-fashioned concept
of ID is and why why it's hopefully
still important to a lot of people and
then we're just going to jump right into
a couple of simple apps I've just tried
to keep things very simple and so really
we're going to have a rest back end
that's Java and we're gonna have a
couple of very quick
Jerry query based JavaScript
applications that are going to talk to
those things I'm gonna show a couple of
different ways from eclipse that you can
just do the development cycle on a jetty
server deploying out to a public cloud
and
you know accessing some external stuff
as well assuming my network connection
holds up to do that you always get a
little bit nervous depending on having
internet actually working even though
you know it's normally quite reliable so
yes let's just let's move on then so
there is this you know we're hearing
this more and more probably many of you
either already hold this opinion or have
heard this opinion from a lot of people
RIT is still really important the one
icid I'm talking about you know eclipse
netbeans JDeveloper IntelliJ the big
desktop based applications things that
you know consume a gigabyte or more of
RAM on your system when you run them
have all these integrated tools you know
a lot of people that do particularly do
the the they sort of the new whether you
want to call it html5 cloud-based these
types of applications now you know they
just say all I really need is text
editor and a browser and that's that's
you know VI or whatever my favorite text
editor is and the browser to run and
debug and that's good enough for a lot
of things and I think there are a
certain there's a certain segment of
development where that is actually true
but depending on what you want to do how
big organization is and how many
different technologies and integrate
obviously you're gonna have to go beyond
that more significant in terms of IDs
and longer and I think is this rise of
cloud-based IDs cloud-based development
Eclipse has something called Orion which
is basically a framework to do this sort
of thing so even the clips Foundation
has recognized the fact that you know
this is coming as a major important
thing to tool for you know obviously if
you don't need to pull your get
repository or sqn repository down you
know to your PC that might be faster you
know if everything is just on somebody's
up managing the cloud you know all usual
cloud arguments you know still stand for
these kind of IDs and you know in a lot
of cases again it is a useful you know
it is useful approach particularly if
you're in a very managed environment
like you're building on top of the
Salesforce application or you know
building on top of somebody else's
existing stack and Oracle public cloud
application and so to a lot of people I
think I ADIZ seem kind of big and heavy
and
whoa you know they don't always do what
they wanted to do they take a long time
to do it sometimes and that's that is
true even in Eclipse there are some sets
of tools that are better than others and
you know sometimes you know there's this
argument that just find the best to
breed a very light tools so having said
that I just sort of want to sort of
enumerate just remind those of you who
already know and sort of hope to
convince those of you who who aren't yet
but you know what I went ID is and why
it's useful so you know integrated
development environment I for integrated
so you get a set of team providers you
get integration through tools like mile
in and Eclipse mtoui and Eclipse to
integrate with maven so any of these you
know so-called Best of Breed software
lifecycle tools that you want to use you
can all even integrate for all those
same lessly at one place in your ID same
with being able to launch and run you
know your code run test or your code run
JUnit test or whatever it is that you
want to do you know launchers for
everything from a jetty server to
deploying to a cloud to all these things
they're all available integrated in one
place D is for development of course and
you know there's certain things which
I'll show very simple examples for
javits rest services here you know up to
much more complicated things whether
you're using jab that you know Java to
do this on the back end Ruby groovy
whatever you're you know the flavor of
the month is you still need to do
certain things on a back-end server you
can't put all the code in somebody's
browser all the time you know for
security reasons for for any number of
reasons you need control of some of what
the processing data integrity even is
still very important we sometimes forget
about that one you know maven can
replace some of the automation that you
get an IDE you can run an archetype and
generate a whole project or just a page
but for some types of users and even for
all users in certain situations
sometimes is nice just to have a wizard
that guides you through doing a
complicated set of configurations and
lastly you know search and refactoring
there are you know again there are maven
or there are command-line tools to help
you do this goes back to even in the sea
days we had sea
hag's to help us search through our C
code but again you don't need to set
anything up typically an IDE it just
works out of the box for you so again
another good reason the last thing B is
for environment so you know if you're in
a larger medium-sized larger
organization anyone who has to do you
know support a large number of people
quite a few people from Oracle actually
years ago went to Google to set up a
whole department that just runs all the
development tools deployment and eclipse
is still a fairly big part of that why
because it has things like a p2 package
manager so you can you know very quickly
bundle together set of features you
don't know not all developers need all
functionality a ruby developer probably
doesn't need necessarily a C development
tool or a Java development tool just
narrow it down to what you need push it
to a desktop as needed and you know some
of these problems are solved by
cloud-based solutions you know obviously
if whoever is running your cloud-based
service knows what they're doing and has
everything set up the way you want it
you don't have to worry about it but you
know there's still two big reasons why
you still may want a desktop ID the
first most obvious one is you know in
the accessibility to the internet
accessibility the cloud is getting
better and better and hopefully someday
we will get to a point where you're
always online you're never offline for
anything that you want to do but you
know what if you're on a train if you're
on vacation and you need to get into
something you may not just have you may
have enough access to access email you
may have enough access to get to basic
browser but some of these big heavy you
know you eyes that are living your
browser to do your ide or any other
cloud application may not just just may
not be practical and the last point is
you know there's a lot of these services
and they will scale to a large number of
CPUs really fast so there's no
engineering there's no technical reason
why say like a really big java compiler
a big C compiler something that like
that couldn't happen the cloud but if
you ever look at one of these cloud
services like you know the Google App
Cloud and you look at how carefully
they're monitoring how much CPU access
is being used how much you have you got
to wonder past a point once it scales
beyond a certain point is it actually in
their interest is it gonna pay them
enough
to give you a 999 subscription or
however their model is based to give you
a flat amount of CPU are you you know
how fast you're gonna use that up if
your your requirements are large so you
know there's still going to be cases I
believe we're having a certain amount of
your hardware local is for certain kinds
of development tasks is going to be
important so let's try to move quickly
on then to the the two demos that I've
got we're just going to do sort of an
end and what I always try to show when I
do these demos is end end things now for
sure part of that is because you know I
can always make you know small mistakes
in the demo I need to keep things fairly
small and controllable so that I can
explain it walk it through it so that
the actual applications themselves will
be fairly simple but basically this is
the set of technologies that we're
dealing with just to make the JavaScript
little easier I'm using jQuery
you know a number of the things you know
that I'm doing a jQuery like rolling my
own rest clients that calls there are
tools to do this around what you know
data binding tools like Boost that'll
help you do more of these things but
again in the interest of key things
simple so that I can show you what's
actually going on I want to keep that
you know the number of technologies on
the runtime side a little simpler on the
design time side you're going to see
what you're going to see it's not always
going to be easy to tell what parts of
the Eclipse platform or what parts of
other platforms are in use I'm just a
numerating the big ones that you're
going to see here web tools platform is
still the sort of the main place and
Eclipse where most of these kind of
technologies live I also quite like sort
of a non-standard tool called run jetty
run when I'm actually deploying to a
very simple web container there isn't
there are alternative ways to do this in
Eclipse through the wtp tools I just
find the run Jenny run one actually runs
a lot more smoothly you can just you
know kill jetty and restart it really
really fast if you're doing a fast sort
of code running tests kind of cycle the
other thing klipse has another sort of
argument for IDs one of the original
argument for IDs is you know in
environment debug support so I'm going
to show I'm going to try to walk through
weather is very simple apps from
both ends from both the browser end and
the the Java rest and in the debugger
all in the same debugger you know again
Chrome Firefox do have their own in
browser debugging useful for some tasks
but if you want to have everything one
place you want to have one sort of set
of tools that you're used to using you
know this can be a useful thing to have
all in place lastly there's a couple of
little rest features I'm going to show
that come from this Oracle Enterprise
pack that come that you know that you
can that's freely available from OTN and
that's just to speed up some of the
generation to some rest clients now
point out specifically where that part
is so basically everything that you see
here is either free as in beer or free
as in intellectual property or both and
so you should be able to do this at home
if you want if you do want to try and
follow along or if you want to look at
it later I have set up a little github
repository that you can sync to this has
the first application I'm going to do
the really simple hello world one
already there and by the end it'll have
what you see committed to it I've just
got kind of a pre canned part of the
second one which is just going to be
kind of like a little mark Twitter app
kind of thing I've got part of it in
there already just so that I've got a
starting point so that I can finish with
them within the hour all right so let's
just switch it over to eclipse here and
so the first thing we're just going to
do is create what's called a dynamic web
project there's there's a little bit of
naming that that is a little bit
historical with some of the stuff but in
the web tools project this is sort of
the standard way to do a web based
application so we just need to provide a
name I'm going to set this target
runtime here so we can try out a quick
deployment a lot of you probably seen I
thought about trying to deploy to like
the Google cloud that can be a little
time consuming because I mean it's it's
a good system I'm not say anything is
but you do have to wait for a cross
compile to compile and that kind of
thing this will hopefully around a
little
and then the last thing is we have this
concept of facets so basically you pick
what technologies you want and this sort
of helps you make sure that you've got
your runtime set up and so on so for
this one we've got a couple of things
set by default this one normally you
know the WebLogic server one I think
just gets put on there by default when
you want to deploy to the Oracle cloud
but you wouldn't normally need this if
you're not going to go to the Oracle
cloud and so I'm just going to add
JavaScript and rest Web Services and
then so having done that what that's
gonna do is make sure that I've got some
kind of runtime available on classpath I
can override that if I want if I just
want to say I'll set up later but I
already happen to have this guy set up
you can also download it that's actually
what I've done here previously just to
keep the demo moving smoothly
it'll just present you with a license
agreement and then you can just pull it
down and then it's available on your
class path
so the basic so you know this is you
know similar to what you might see with
a maven archetype it's just created a
skeletal application you know with just
the basics of what you've asked it to
configure and so let's just start by
creating a quick HTML page which will
just be the you know the basics of our
UI and then another you know nice
feature that we have in here that plays
well particularly you've got a large
organization where you're trying to or
even a small team but you want to you
know maintain consistency is you you
there's a lot of things you can template
based on either you know page creation
snippets I'll show a few you know and so
I've just you know pre created this
little page that has a couple extra
little things in it on top of the
typical h2 html5 page so you can see we
opens in there in our web page editor
here and so I've just added in in my
template a couple of script things here
so I've just got to copy the jQuery one
in here so it's available you can see
I've got this is the the one that's
already checked in to to github so I'm
just grabbing a couple things here too
you know so you don't have to so that we
can just speed this up so let's create a
scripts directory
okay and then the second thing is to
create a little hello JavaScript
function so that we can so that we can
do our actual little hello world thing
here so let's
do that and then we'll just write a
quick little say hello function so this
is the thing that will actually call our
back end when we click a button in the
HTML and actually I'm just going to
leave that there for a second
not in the background okay and so next
all we want to do is have you know a a
span here with an ID on it because
really you know with most of this
development whether using jQuery or
something based on it everything just
comes down to can you find something by
ID or by CSS class so this will be our
actual message and then we'll want an
input which is our scholar input and
last thing is a button say hello
and then here we just want to call our
say hello which you should hopefully
have on content assist here yeah so I
just hit control space and it's so
there's there's a there's a certain
amount of intelligence going on here in
terms of knowing what's available in
your JavaScript namespace so it you know
it sees it I've created this say hello
and then we'll just split this out here
because we don't you remember the IDs
and then we'll just ask jQuery to give
us the message from this span
and then the last thing is so again just
to speed things up but also to
demonstrate what I think is kind of an
overlooked feature in the web tools this
sort of snippets bar so I've pre-canned
a few things just so you don't have to
sit and sit and watch me type things
over and over again and this is just a
little Ajax call which is basically what
you know the the bare metal if you will
in jQuery for for making these calls and
so we know we're going to set the text
once we get success on this call we're
going to set it into this thing called
input and this is the last thing we need
is a URL so where's our website for web
service is going to live so again we'll
just go over to our set tools so this is
one feature that is this is I said I'd
flag the couple of ones that come out of
the the O a PE and this is one of them
this is to generate just a simple rest
service so we have a few options here
I'll show one based on entities in a
minute for now I just need one of these
what's called a single root resource so
basically it's just going to be like one
endpoint with a get in the put generated
on it so I'll put that in service we'll
call it hello service now you can see
you know gives you some options here in
terms of we're just going to use the the
get and add a parameter but it gives you
some options in terms of what what
content types you want to generate and
so on and then just this application can
fix that's Jerzy app to know that this
what this class is for
I don't know why that's not about over
here alright so this just you know gives
you an idea of what we're up to here and
then here I just need to add a path
because what I want to do is just take a
parameter off the path and pass it in
and then I've got the syntax for that
alright and then we have this jax-rs
annotation that just basically
effectively saying map this path this
URL path to this to this parameter to
the method so basically it's
automatically binding it for you at
runtime here and we'll just have it
return hello plus that message okay so
let me just know and I think I need to
add a I've just got to match this name
to this one here all right let's just
double check that because sometimes
these little syntax things are caused
things to blow up so yeah so that's this
is basically the one similar one that's
already checked in
Oh is there oh thank you spent some time
so much time in jQuery that you
everything is a dollar sign now okay so
we have an error where do we ever there
so demonstrating a little unintended
syntax checking here maybe it's going to
be too good
for me
oh thank you
okay
so then the last thing to do here is to
actually tell what URL we're gonna get
on so Jeff one rest and what this
actually did when I ran the brand The
Wizard of where it hopefully did was
updated my web.xml to initialize this
jax-rs servlet so this is the thing
that's going to handle these calls that
we're sending from jQuery and basically
all we're saying here is use this
servlet use this URL pattern on top of
the context root in order to know what
things to intercept and then away we go
so if we go back the the jada plane that
I'm going to do will automatically just
make the context root the same name as
the project and then we called the path
here hello service should be at the top
oh no is it yeah hello service
and then because we mapped the path
Bramley we did we'll just add message
it likes to add extra ones and then I
end up pleading tonight here we go
re +
so you can see it's saving me for myself
a little bit here yeah alright so the
next thing I want to do is I just want
to watch this when I run this I want to
watch it run from both ends so I'm going
to set a breakpoint here and hopefully
it's already defaulted to my chrome v8
brought breakpoints and I also want to
set one in the service to intercept the
call and then we'll just run this on
jetty actually let's just check the
configuration first chair so it's going
to launch this project as I said it's
going to use the name of the project as
a context root standard port standard
web app so you can see it's just sort of
figured all this out and that's you know
it in most cases it should just work for
you and we'll see all right we have an
error because we don't have any root
classes and so the way to solve that is
just to tell it to look in some packages
here for the actual hello service I
think I've got this guy yeah so this is
just telling Jersey you know because
basically what Jersey is doing when it
starts up is its it needs to know where
in the class path it's going to scan for
things that have these annotations so
that it can set up the service for us so
let's just kill that try it again
all right so betters this time we can
see here its founder hello service
resource so if everything is going okay
the next thing we need to do is just get
an extra tab localhost:8080 and it's
jebel one rest and our webpage was OHT
ml okay now with that open we'll ask the
chrome side of the thing to start so
we'll create a new debug profile here
and we'll just give it the name of the
folder where this is the sort of the one
configuration step you need to do for
project just to tell it where the script
files are that it's gonna gonna be
looking at and so it's detected a number
of open tabs you can see here and so
this is the one we want the one with our
hello HTML in it and sometimes it
doesn't cooperate on the first try here
alright maybe it has usually you get a
some console output here so let's just
try this I'm gonna try it again
okay so we can slow we can see here is
it has actually broken in our hello
script and we get all of the things that
we're used to if you're used to say Java
debugging in in Eclipse or if you you
know are just used to a debugger like
this and it gives us all the context
information it has on the running
JavaScript app you can see the message
the thing that we want isn't yet defined
because we haven't asked for the value
from the religion and if we step here
hopefully well so now we'll see that
it's empty it's actually empty
permeate that should be a good point
see now this is this is exactly why I
haven't debugger is helpful so
unfortunately unlike a java application
where i might be able to drop the frame
here and start over
i've just got it the quickest thing to
do is just to kill it and go again here
so let's just rerun the server-side
let's see if this guy's still so there's
our hello again okay
let's try Bob this time alright so again
broken you can see now here we've now
that we've corrected the mistake we
actually have the message and this Ajax
call will hopefully fire the other so if
I hit go now you can see that this is
actually on the Java side now so if you
look just just so that it's a little
more clear we've got these two separate
things running in the debugger so we've
just let this fly so that it'll send the
rest call and now we're on the other
side and we've broken in the the Java
part of it and it looks like it's
successfully pulled Bob off the the
parameter path and so now it's just
going to return the concatenation of
that what what's the difference I mean
the the the the they're both supported
by the same set of chrome dev tools so
the features are relatively similar the
main difference is you know if you want
to stay if you want to leave everything
you know in one environment if you don't
want to be flipping back and forth you
know I've found it quite useful
debugging these sort of situations to be
able to just jump back and forth between
you know code and the different editors
because your rather than flipping back
to Chrome and looking at what's going on
there or in the Firefox debugger similar
situation you know everything stays in
one place so to some degree it'll be you
know question of your own your own taste
your own preferences some people may
just prefer to jump to chrome yeah so
this is the latest June release so this
should be Kepler I don't believe that
says r1 yet so it's just if you look for
Kepler I think sr1 if it's either
shipping soon or it's shipped already
this is a that in capillaries just the
public eclipse foundation version and so
yeah so you should be able to pull this
down right now if you just go to eclipse
org and and grab the latest distribution
or you'll get the service release one if
that's if that shipped by now
okay so last step of this one is just to
see if we can push it out to to a cloud
service so I have already set up on my
servers tab here a configuration for
basically I just opened a trial account
on the Oracle public cloud so if you
want to do this you can just set up a
trial account you know the the same
would be true you know we are there are
if you want to instead launch to say the
Google App Cloud there's a similar set
of functionality that does something
very similar to this so let's just see
if we can do that so I'll say run on
server
we've got this one as the configured one
should hit finish so that'll take
depending on how good my connection is
here it'll take a few seconds you can
see the other thing the other sort of
key piece of support here which I'm not
even sure I haven't I haven't used the
latest version of the Google tools for
this but any of these any of these cloud
services want to constrain what you can
actually run within their job instance
so very often they won't let you open a
socket for example and so what they
actually do is scan the code that you're
uploading to see like does this have eye
net socket address calls in or does this
have you know whatever it is they're
looking for and then it just simply
won't let you deploy or won't let you
run if you have applications with those
things and there's you know if you need
to do those things there's typically a
well-controlled SDK way to do it but
what this is basically just doing is
providing you that scanning before you
even try to deploy so you can see
there's a couple little warnings here I
think it normally wants the login config
or just probably why it's doing this
here so let's just see if once I do that
that's the same okay so that's fine
because we want that and so you can see
we're we're somewhere out in cloud apps
and let's see if that goes so that went
so you can see there you know that took
a little while to round-trip up to the
cloud and so you again this is feeds
into my argument behind you know IDs
versus cloud development there are
situations where if you're already sort
of in the cloud so to speak doing your
development the code is already there
you may not have to worry about this
round-trip time but for certain
applications like this it may simply
just be faster to sit here and just keep
banging away with your debugger trying
to figure out what's wrong once you get
something that works you've got this
server deployment so that is the first
really simple app and the second one is
one that I've just sort of pre-canned a
part of basically all the JavaScript
part of because as we've seen I'm fairly
prone to make mistakes
although luckily the tool
helps with some of that and so that this
this one is basically to sort of
demonstrate some of the database
features so we'll have an end end up
here where basically the idea is you
you're you know some of you may have
used the tool like tweet snack or
something that manages tweets for you so
it is basically we're going to store
some messages in the database we can
delete them so we can do this the
typical crud up cred operations on them
and then when we're happy with the tweet
we press the button and it pushes it up
to Twitter for us so you know again a
little bit of a contrived example but
there are applications that you know out
there that do this sort of thing albeit
in in a more elaborate way so let's just
quickly walk through the UI side of it
so we're gonna have a refresh button
that just does a poll from the database
through rest service we've got an add
button that does the typical create and
then what you can't see here because
it's being created dynamically in
JavaScript when it runs is the actual
boxes containing the message and the
input box that lets you edit those
message and save them that's all done
through this script I'll go if I have
time towards the end or if people want
to pull this down and look at themselves
from github I'll walk through what's
going on in the different JavaScript
files but the main part that I want to
show is with that in place actually
let's just quickly look at the rest part
of it because that's the part we're
gonna we're gonna add so basically we've
just got a set of you know rest calls
similar the ones you've already seen but
using this the typical you know HTTP
methods to do the correct things so
you're doing a you know a read you're
doing typically a get an add as a post
an edit as a put and a remove as of
delete so you know just the standard way
that rest lays it and this last one is
the one that will actually try to push
it out to Twitter I've added I've
cheated a little bit in terms of the
Twitter push I'm using the standard Java
API for that which is called Twitter for
Jay and the reason for that is in
addition to just doing the rest logic
there's this something off which is what
you used to actually authorize modifying
an account on Twitter and that's kind of
a pain to
it's just much easier to to use a
preexisting library for that okay so and
so I've just pre-canned this and you can
see that's basically what's going on
here we've got a couple of classes we
haven't created yet which is why we're
seeing errors but that's basically what
this logic will do so we have a little
Derby database setup
so in here we've just got a table let's
see if there's any messages in it
currently there's just you know quick
demo of some of the database stuff
little bonus so you can see I've got
this basically just runs a quick little
Select on the table you can see I've got
a couple of messages that - just to test
it you can see it's got an actual tweet
ID here already which means you know and
you'll see it when I flip to the browser
it's already been pushed up to two real
Twitter and you know so that's that's
that so from there the first thing we
want to do is use the JPA tooling so
this is available in you know that wtp
download to actually first the first
thing I need to do is add a couple more
facets to this guy so in order to enable
some of this tooling to keep it out of
your way if we don't think you're using
it you know you need to add some of
these facets in order to get things
going
so I've just added the same rest web
service that we had before plus the JPA
one and so that will give me the option
here to configure the required libraries
so for JP I'm using eclipse link which
again is the freely available on Eclipse
version it used to be called top link
now it's called Eclipse link its
standard JPA and then again you can
download these you can decide to
configure them later if you want but
we've just got this set up to keep
things going here and with that done we
should now on the project when we
right-click here JPA tools will give us
some options to either to go either way
because you know JP a ORM you're going
either from a database to a Java object
or vice versa
we're going from a database to cement
--'tis so we're going to say generate
from entities we're gonna use that exact
we would use that existing connection
but
let's try it again
so generate entities from tables use
existing connection
oops and then it's the app schema so you
can see it sees the two tables we just
care about this message is one and then
you know this is an example of where you
know with something like a maven
archetype you could figure out all the
command line options for this or a
script to do this but very often you've
got these situations like with JPA where
there are literally hundreds of
different things and that you may want
to set in order to do everything and so
one of the you know most common ones is
how is your primary key being generated
if it's being generated and so the way
I've created this database in Derby it's
just auto incrementing an IDE to keep
things simple but you can go into all
kinds of elaborate key generators with
JPA it'll do it for you it'll do it
automatically so there's all these sort
of things which sometimes is just much
easier to sort of have things in a nice
UI to see how they work or to configure
them so what that's done is put this
message class here in the model package
and so if you're not familiar with JPA
you know it's basically created an
object mirror of you know each column in
that table is now a field and the one
additional thing that I do here is add
an XML root element so this is going to
tell Jersey this is gonna tell our rest
layer that this guy is actually gonna be
rendered as an XML it doesn't like that
they get the right one
yeah that's around so that's just going
to tell the you know that this is
mapable not only to a database but also
to some xml okay and so the the second
thing to do now we've got the database
we've got a table to find the database
we've got our ORM mapping defined from
database from the database schema to
java and JPA will take care of the rest
for us in terms of the reads and writes
and so forth last thing to do is now we
want to hook that up to a rest service
so again we're going to go back to that
rest web service wizard we're gonna say
entity access this time you can see it's
it just sort of scanned the project
figured out we've got this one JPA
entity that is available so we're going
to map that we're gonna put just
generate the stuff to the service
package and again you've got the option
of what you're gonna create so in this
case by default that's giving us Walt
XML and JSON I'm just gonna use the XML
one and last this application
configuration so it'll update that if it
exists or to create it and so the last
thing here is so this this is actually
intended to normally to work in an EJB
environment so in an EJB environment
when you use the stateless option it'll
inject your persistence manager for you
because i want to keep things fast
development why isn't also simple for
demonstration we're just using jetty we
don't have those options and what what
it means is we've gotta just a little
extra work in here as well so we're just
going to take the you know previous the
prior to this sort of Candice snippet
for this but basically what I've done is
just taken what's generated and what
you'll see is I've just just going to
delete what's here I'm just gonna pull
this guy in and so what this has done is
soon as it finds all of the options or
all of the imports there we go what this
is done is just take those same
pre-canned methods that were generated
and
just doing the transaction boundary for
us manually you can see that again
there's you know when we talk about
things that still need to be done the
back end you know we don't necessarily
want a hackable piece of JavaScript
living in a browser to be doing things
like setting the last time something was
saved for example so we control that we
leave that on the server side and it
looks like an extra those guys okay so
now we should have on the server side
and then to end thing that answers a set
of requests rest requests hits the JPA
layer hits the database and back again
we have a piece of UI which creates you
know these two buttons and then creates
this sort of little kiss little
container which our jQuery code is going
to populate with the actual messages if
there are anything so let's try and run
that and these things almost never work
on the first try let's but let's try
that again on jetty so we've got a
separate launch configuration for this
one again just targets the project
everything is populated for us here
again we can see that it's sort of
scanned and it's found these two rest
services so that's positive sign excuse
me
and then the last thing here is to just
see if it'll actually it'll actually go
and of course something is wrong so we
can diagnose that really quickly like in
the JavaScript console and you can see
here that our JPL area is not happy with
us because I've forgotten to set the the
derby connection in here and I this is
one that I wish it would just generate
by default but so we just need to find
the persistence XML so this is the
standard configuration file the JPA uses
and we just need to tell it to populate
this
that same connection that we already
have let's try and run that again
okay so you can see the two that we
already have in here we can we can do an
ad we can do a delete and if we get one
that we decide we like okay actually
there's one more step here well let's
just edit it and say hello Java one
September 24th it's just giving us a
little check mark here to tell us as
I'll walk through at the very end if I
have time or if you're interested you
can look at the code that's that's doing
all this behind the scenes so the last
step is and it may actually need to grab
the why don't ya why don't I take any
questions while I find my my properties
file because the last thing I need to do
the one file that you won't find up on
github is the actual properties file
that contains my OAuth tokens obviously
I'm not I can't give those out but and I
think I've had a project here set up
with it but I think I've removed it from
the workspace so while I find that are
there any general questions about this
or anything anybody wants to know yeah
heyyou time was the second part of it
indigo okay so so just two cases people
didn't hear the question was how do you
get a Clips link included in clips and
he's more interested in the indigo
version as far as I know all of the same
features in the eye are the same between
indigo and Kepler the current one and so
you've got us you've got several
different ways to do that and part of it
depends on the type of application
you're running so if you're running just
a java application you can so you're not
deploying to a web container or any
other kind of container you can just put
it on your build path you know which you
would do on any java project by saying
properties Java build path and then
adding it here as an external jar or as
a shareable system library that you can
if you have a multi-user environment
that you can share around if you're
deploying to a container something like
jetty will work the same that's sorry
run jetty run if you're using that one
it'll just find it on your class path if
you're using say like you're deploying
to I get your have EE container like
GlassFish then you will you'll be using
a slightly different way to run your
application basically the same method
that I showed for the cloud deployment
which is this run on server and instead
of selecting this Oracle cloud you know
it'll be say GlassFish 4.1 and when you
when you do that you'll have there's a
couple of ways to do it you can go in
through the the server server runtime
page I think for this guy targeted
runtimes and you can add I don't have
one here but you'd bet you'd be able to
do is add to that class path of things
that you want to deploy and why that is
in some cases that's true in other cases
like for example if the container
happens to be WebLogic server as an
example the the launch configuration
that's built into eclipse already knows
where to look for most of those things
so anything that's a standard Java EE
thing WebLogic server as an example has
put those into a shared library and so
the tool will know that they're there
and it'll just put it on a class path
for you once you tell it I want to run
this on my blog server
I don't remember what the GlassFish
closed one of that is but again you can
just put on your clasp at
to actually get Eclipse link itself you
could either go to the website and
download it when you install the facet
this step that I showed where a my hair
object facets when you install the JPA
facet you have it's not giving me the
option I think is already configured if
I do this on a project that doesn't
already have it right and I say JPA for
and so here you can actually see I've
selected the type of Eclipse link that I
want you just hit this download button
and it'll just go out and find it for
you copy it to a local location that
shows you here where it's going to put
it on my disk and then puts it right
under class pad so that that is
generally the easiest way to do it if
you just want to you know you you just
want to get it put it somewhere and have
it available that's the easiest thing to
do okay anymore oh yeah
oh I'm sorry i sorry the guy behind
first and I'll get to you the Eclipse
plugins for so I can show you the I can
show you the let's see the about Eclipse
so you know these are the ones that
actually show up as icons we can go in
the installation details it's quite an
extensive list you know everything a lot
of these come bundled just in the
standard wtp and then there's some
additional ones we like weary bundle a
couple of these they this is really just
spring tools even though it says oracle
spring tools it's just rebuttal din this
case of logic server tools spring IDE
there's the run jetty run that I was
talking about so really what this is is
if you download if you want the rest
stuff you download the Oh a PE if you
don't care as much about those Wizards
you can just get the standard Java
developer edition they just want to get
run jetty run and the chrome dev tools
and I'll give you basically all that you
saw okay yes sir
yeah it's it is even for myself I get a
little bit confused sometimes because
there are overlapping sets of features
so the the JPA stuff all of the web
service stuff except for those wizards
that i showed that generated it all of
the editors that you've seen so the web
page editor javascript editors all of
that stuff comes with the Java EE
developers of eclipse that you pull down
from just from eclipse.org the those
Wizards that I mentioned do come in from
the Oracle stack that's built on top of
that when I was doing this this stuff
here with the this the blue with the red
thing in the middle there that's an
extension called run jetty run which is
just a launcher for the jetty container
it also comes with copies of jetty and
then I think the last thing was oh yeah
and when I showed the debugging on the
chrome side that's a chrome dev tool so
that's a project I believe the chrome
dev team still supports fast it's part
of it comes with the basic Java EE so
the the framework for that kind of the
Java EE and then it's like a lot of this
stuff is extendable like that's you know
one of the original missions of Eclipse
was to make it extensible so for example
you may not get some of these WebLogic
ones those might be specific to some
oracle things that i've installed and
but everything else here on the spring
like this is again you could download
spring separately but for example if you
just pull the Java EE down without these
extensions you would see you know access
dynamic web you'd see the Java
JavaScript Java server faces all of
these guys you probably wouldn't see
these Oracle guys the spring and that's
about it
ok yeah
to minified I haven't tried it I don't
think it's nor I mean you it'll getting
the breakpoint context I think is going
to be the hardest thing in those things
because they're so squished so but I
actually I haven't tried it so I
couldn't tell you sorry yeah I'm not
totally familiar with what the minifying
algorithm does but my sense is it may
not be you may only bail him like it's
almost like a hash function it may only
map easily in one direction for all
cases so yeah
are you talking about on the runtime
side around the design time side
here no here all I'm using is Jersey
which is like the reference
implementation you'd find it at java.net
so it's just the the jax-rs Java
reference implementation then this is
the one this is the verb there's
actually a version two which is a little
fresher the this this one I find a
little bit more stable for what I was
doing is just the 1:17 one version yeah
on the on which side on the Java side
yeah so I actually had I I was actually
hoping to show the so the these services
here I had I had some problems with
getting the Jersey run time to give me
the specific Jason I wanted so I just
had to kind of abandon it and fall back
on XML but what you can see here is when
you use this at produces or at consumes
depending on which end of then whether
it's a get or like a put kind of thing
you just tell it what media types you
want to support and as long as what you
send so as long as what the client sends
is compliant Jason and if I have this
here it'll just remar shil that into a
Java object but the one caveat to that
is that at least with Jersey and with
the Jackson library that it uses it gets
a little bit tricky sometimes because
it's it's sort of it seems to be using
almost xml concepts underneath to do the
mapping so sometimes you have to write
your own depending on what the object is
and like what the special cases are
sends you have to write your own marshal
or marshal logic but you know jersey is
pretty extensible that way in terms of
you know adding those things so yeah
note you can I mean it'll the I believe
the default said of Marshall and on
Marshall logic supports you know XML
Jason when you have Jackson available
and then you know plain text obviously
there's there's a there's a list of it
was it that wizard showed most of the
ones that I think are there out of the
box with the specifically with Jersey it
seems like XML is still the easiest one
to do Jason obviously is a benefit if
your client is is JavaScript because you
know Jason is basically just a
JavaScript object once it's due
serialized so a lot of people prefer
that one but you know yeah you can use
either one yeah
yeah I had I had B jet installed and I
have to be honest I had trouble finding
any I tried hard to find something to
show it does have its own options for
editing and debugging but I just kept
going back to the jst T ones because
that was what I was familiar with and
that's what the chrome debugger bridge
uses in order to do its stuff so yeah
unfortunately there isn't much in terms
of specific V jet nice nice catch but
yeah yeah
part of me
yeah so the these two so these two that
you see the these little orange brackets
around master those two are in getting
up and I'll push these changes that we
just saw up there right now so what
what's in there this instant was just
what I started with so that I had a
starting point and I'll push these up Cu
Bella pull them down take a look at what
we actually ran okay anymore all right
well thank you very much thanks you
