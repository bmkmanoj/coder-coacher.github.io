your employee from Oracle technology
Network and my guess is markers Marc
Accetta
yep Kat Kat so Marcus you you wanted to
show us like a new plugin of for
NetBeans so for Rapids
what is it rapid Eclipse uh uh it's
rapid Eclipse a rapid place uh
unfortunate for Eclipse that means but
doesn't matter also it's free also yeah
yeah and available for all developers so
so what is the tool for I mean how how
is it for useful for developers it's
built for developers who want to start
the actives from the scratch without
installing plugins and configuration of
plugins and and so on so it's it's
already pre-configured and all plot all
necessary plugins are pre-installed so
the users can download it and yeah can
use it in five minutes okay so do you
want to show it to us
sure yeah if that's the best way to do
see what it is yeah so we can first at
all stop is a new project so first of
all so how did you install it you just
like where do you yeah and actually the
the users can download it from the
project side rabbit clips calm or from
the eclipse marketplace and it's a it's
an installer and it takes it only 20
seconds to install it and run it and
then they can start with a new project
first off is a new rapid scripts project
I call it for example right cool code
and here in this dialogue I can choose a
database we have here an example
database
based on h2 it's a Java free Java
database engine and we use north in the
example database and here I can decide
if I want to develop a mobile
application or desktop application and
so on or a cloud application but of our
first demo
you only need a database connection and
then you're all needed libraries are
downloaded automatically from maven so
developers do not care about what they
have to include so it's everything they
need is downloaded automatically so
first time it takes some seconds and you
need internet connection is required but
after the first time I can work offline
also so and here it's a improved hybrid
import so I can choose tables I want to
import and then the metadata of my
database are imported automatically and
behind the scenes all needed JPA classes
are generated automatically so I don't
don't need to care about datatype
mapping so this is a huge problem for
for API developers who want to have
access on databases is the datatype
mapping because post we asked well for
example has different data types than
Java has so and rabbit clips does the
data type mapping automatically and
correctly so that it's no problem to
work from the scratch with any database
so and yeah as we can see here are the
the entity classes are generated
automatically and I can switch to editor
where I can edit my entity
classes and here's the generated code
and everything works fine so I don't
have to do anything and I can start
building a database application from the
scratch and we also have here the data
access objects generated automatically
so rapid clips provides a nice
application layer free to application
layers so I don't have to cover
architecture it's everything is provided
by the IDE
yeah and now the ID starts the GUI
designer and the PAF here is a great
designer based on on Rawdon so I can
take your components and drag and drop
it on the screen and this abuse and see
this is HTML so it's in the IDE its we
can see a webview and this is a real
valid application running inside the
they Eclipse IDE and now I can create my
user interface with drag-and-drop and I
like to show a very simple demo for
example with a menu the menu bar and
with a split pane for example in it and
where we can use a table component and
we also can generate forms from the from
from all entities now for example I take
the the the order details I I can
drag-and-drop the order detail entity to
my GUI builder and then the wizard
generates the form automatically so with
all functions
already working the corrupt actions and
so on and so if I wanted to edit this
this form for example so how would you
do that I mean like for example changing
like the the order ID for example and so
how would you okay yeah this is very
easy so I can select all controls and I
can yeah I can change text over
properties for example and I can drag
and drop all fields and sorting and so
on Wow this is very easy and yeah it
based on a grid layout so I can organize
the generated form individual okay and
so could you go also so this is the
visual interface can you go back and
forth with the code or if you from yeah
right all right do you want to show
something else yeah while while
designing a code is generated behind a
sign okay and I can switch to the Java
code and there is also a XML code
generated and so I can I can change the
user interface with changing the XML
code also so it depends on the on the
developer likes working with
drag-and-drop can use the GUI builder
but I can also write code for it yeah
for sometimes it's easier to find also
if there is like a bug or something then
you go to the code and yeah sure yeah
yeah sure
or if you want to write extensions or or
beans your own your own UI beans and so
on this is very easy to to do this your
own bra clips yeah and now I can connect
my my entities directly with the user
interface and this is a here are my JPA
entities and I can
for example drag and drop again they're
all a detail entity on on a table
component doesn't work now within
selected it's always the same with live
demos yeah I can usually I can I can
correct your entities with a with all
components which can show data for
exempt maybe I use another table
component try it again or a detail no
does it work
so unfortunately okay we don't we get
the idea so you could really customize
your table yes I can customize it I can
select the properties and then the
columns are automatically generated and
by the framework and I can start the
preview and then the browser starts and
behind the scenes the URI starts an
application server you use Chetty for
example or you can use Tomcat also or
any other application server and then
the wall interpret is started and and
renders the user interface in the
browser cool so and I also can start the
application as a desktop application is
a native desktop application and also as
a mobile application from the from the
same from the same source the for the
desktop application we use an SWT window
and with with
if you're inside and the browser inside
the SWT window renders the user
interface provided by the the Baden
framework and so the the developer can
concentrate on designing you is
developing database applications and and
needing care for the complicated stuff
behind the scenes for example
transferring data from from the server
to the client and doing all the the
JavaScript and stuff and all Dom
manipulations and so on it's everything
is stunned by the by the volume
framework and so developers can
concentrate on the developing on the
application development or right yeah
yep yeah no this is really good and so
anything else you want to show us now so
my life's question was like if they also
like documentation so or like videos
that people can watch to any online
resources that some yeah here's the is
the website and we have here a nice
documentation everything what is
necessary in in rapid clips here's is a
description for that and what is new in
in a in a version 3 is the JPA SQL this
is a new new free language for JPA
and this allows me to write them all my
crease in in SQL but it's it generates
Java code based on the JPA criteria API
and this is this is awesome because
normally it's very difficult for for
developers who are not so experienced
with this JPA to write a JK query so
it's a little bit complicated
but but now every SQL developer can
write JP acre is from from the scratch
because it is it looks like SQL and the
JPA criteria code is generated
automatically so this is a makes the
database development very easy now on
yeah right yeah well thank you for the
demo the cubes greatly appreciated your
time to to do this this great demo and
we'll see you and makes them Oracle code
probably hopefully thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
