control of your JavaFX mission my name
is Oleg nazarov and i'll be sharing the
microphone with my colleague marcus hurt
this is their plan of our talk so
basically the whole idea is as the title
suggests it to discuss two technologies
how they work together javafx on one
side and Java Mission Control on the
other side first before we get to the
Jamison control of part I will describe
what are we going to see using that tool
and basically this is JavaFX thread in
architecture then I'll touch the count
very simple way to get information about
our FX runtime then we'll discuss a Java
Mission Control along with Java flight
recorder and finally I'll dive a bit
into implementation so job of extracting
architecture are four javafx
applications the high level model is
whatever you want to be on your screen
you represent as a scene graph as we go
of nodes ranging from simple neural
nodes like region or shape and all the
way up to a very complex notes like
media view or web view representing the
entire web browser for example so you
organize your nodes in the graph for you
pride specified properties for those
notes you start them with CSS you will
specify layout and then you let JavaFX
runtime handle all that for you to
simplify the life of javafx application
developer any user code that touches the
scene graph is supposed to be invoked
only on one thread so you don't need to
worry about synchronization need to use
Accord nor any other
platform code will touch the scene graph
on any other thread if you need to make
an update for the scene graph or from
data that originates somewhere else on
another thread the platform provides you
needs to specify your task so that that
task we excute it's still on the effects
thread so the effects thread the very
first thread is responsible for handling
input events for processing any
animation that you specify E and that
you have a new application executing
user tasks now to do actual rendering it
would be not very efficient to implement
that on the same thread so all that work
for actual rendering is offloaded to
another threat and we call it the render
thread so basically we have in the
threading model only two major threats
the one that executes processes input
advanced houses that i will describe on
the next slide user tasks and the render
thread that implements or actually
execute render commands create processes
them and presents the results to the
screen ok javafx pulse the idea for the
pulse is such we want to try to combine
multiple updates to the scene graph and
process them only once so for that
purpose javafx pulse kind of linux and
animation our timer m sorry and it was
that frequency 16 milliseconds so that
gives you the upper limit for your
frames per second just about 60 frames
per second and as I said it combines how
updates from I using our user tasks
input events and has one
processing through all these stages that
again would be discussed later so the
condition for the past that's taken from
their child Cody's that was the time of
fires if there is any animation writing
a new application the boss will be
scheduled if there are any dirty scenes
dirty scenes meaning that some duty
notes in your sim graph and that might
have happened due to user input events
or user tasks specified otherwise if the
policy is explicitly requested but if
the previous pass has not yet finished
the new paths will not be scheduled and
you will wait another 16 milliseconds
until you have an opportunity for the
for you pause here is a simple diagram
for the for the pulse I have three
threads a timer that fires at 16
milliseconds per second up at 16
milliseconds per the effects thread that
does all the scene graph updates and the
render thread that does actual rendering
so I borrowed method names from the
actual code and they represent different
phrases in the past processing so first
we run all animation handlers that are
specified for the syndrome then we apply
CSS do layout I actually could show you
after that all bounds of water updated
this is another face in the scene graph
processing we wait for rendering of the
previous pulse to complete if that
happens if you are running at 60fps
presumably you won't see that phase at
all new program whilst that rendering of
the previous frame is complete we
synchronize the scene graph with the
data structure that represents all the
information from the scene graph that is
updated by the renderer and after that
we schedule a new render job for the
rent a threat to pick up the task and
starts doing actual rendering and render
I present only two phrases actual
printing and presenting the result of
the screen okay a very simple way to get
information about runtime javafx runtime
behavior is a polymer you specify one or
two jvm system properties in order to
start using the pasta and we'll see an
example of what it provides on the next
slide so here you say that you want the
boss logger to be enabled and the second
property defines a threshold so
basically saying that the threshold is
seventeen you say use you tell the
runtime that for any pulse that belongs
less than 17 milliseconds you don't want
to see any details so you want to see
details only about houses that took
longer than that and the output of pasta
will consist of Palace based Interpol's
they are interposed data time intervals
messages counters and an example of that
is on this next slide so here's the
comment that I used so I just specify
that I want the path focus to be enabled
and on every parts I start getting in my
terminal window information about all
the phases messages counters I'll
explain a little bit about what that
means first we have a box number right
here and they just bumped up by one for
each new pulse that will have two
intervals the first interval says how
much time are a lapsed from the
beginning of the previous boss until the
beginning of this coin toss the next
interval says how long this particular
pulse has taken then you have individual
messages about phases and each such
message starts with a threat
ID and we can see that we have two
different thread IDs so half of the
messages come from the FX thread and
half of the messages come from the
render thread then we have timing
information in milliseconds when
relatively to the start of the pulse
well this phase starts how long it takes
and the name of the phrase here's an
example of a message that javafx runtime
specifies and here's an example of
counters that have been counted during
these past processing so we see that the
amount of time is what we long for GUI
application but the reason for that was
that I ran my program with 18,000 nodes
so on every pulse 18th other nodes are
processed in the positive and here's a
diagram that represents that shows all
those intervals together so as I said
the first number with the pulse was time
interval between the start of the
current path and the previous paos than
the length of the current pulse and you
could you could see in the output
another time another interval for two
hundred twenty milliseconds so that's
basically the information that tells you
a lot about the JavaFX runtime behavior
how it processes your application and in
many cases when you complain say about
the performance problem on a javafx
mailing list developers may ask you to
run the pulse logger so that you could
provide information about in inner
runnings or javafx run time so that the
developers could analyze it and see
what's going on not necessarily to find
details but at least to get some initial
understanding of that and now that is
that it would be nice to have that
information presented
well in similar form not just plain text
output of the logger simple to exchange
but not very simple to visualize and
this is where the Java Mission Control
comes into the picture and I'm passing
yep the microphone to you want to take
the microphone I hope
open okay I'm going to eat you up here
oh so you're right okay so my name is
Marcus search and i'm working with a
java / through at oracle and i'm
involved with the flight recorder and
Mission Control so Java Mission Control
is a tool that was introduced in 1740 so
I spin around for lipitor year it's a
tool for doing profiling and diagnostics
of running system and that the faithful
javafx you know it's not immediately
obvious because we usually use right
recorder for huge systems you know
production time profiling and the
overhead of using flight recorder is
really really small which kind of makes
it interesting from a javafx perspective
as well because you wouldn't want to
introduce a lot of extra hook and
latency cetera by using a profiling tool
when you're trying to find out why your
javafx application is slow and another
and another feature is that and another
feature is that when you have done your
profiling recording when you recorded
the data you can actually send that
recording off to somebody else you don't
need to like cut and paste stuff etc you
you have it in one well once the
recording and you will also be able to
see not only what was going on in javafx
but the factor quarter captures
information about oh it's level details
about other things happening in the in
the Java Virtual Machine and I'm going
to show you some examples of how it can
look when you have javafx information
together with java information ok so the
support for this is since a 220 it was
well the javafx events for introducing a
220 and now there is even a a little
plugin and if we have time
at the end I'm going to show you how
ridiculously easy it is to build this
plugin yourselves I mean it took like 15
minutes well I spent some time trying to
draw icons that took some time but but
the black so use your interface building
that it's very easy because there is a
building rebuild their insight on which
control itself so it doesn't it take one
line of code for you to build a user
interface for custom events ok so
currently you need two different options
and to be able to use the flight
recorder together which I've FX these
are two things you want to remember from
this session if you don't remember
anything else this is the thing we want
to remember so unlock commercial
features and flight recorder and
remember that the flight recorder and
and Mission Control is totally free for
development so if you use it for
development just go ahead and I guess
most javafx cases will probably be
development right so you either specify
these on the command line to the Java
Virtual Machine or you can set your job
options environment variable or you know
whatever mechanism you used to set the
vm properties so um how to start Mission
Control you just started using the JMC
launcher in your JDK it's included in
the JDK so you already have it you start
up the tee-am browser well the GOM
browser will be there for you on the
left side you select the JVM and we
should want to do the recording and and
then you select start flight recording
you will end up in a wizard where you
can configure what to record so the
normal javafx use probably to use the
profile template
and do we need to remember to the next
step of the wizard to enable the JavaFX
events those event types are not in the
default profiling template that is
included with a j2se JDK so you will
want to check those so starting
recorders recordings there are some
other ways you can start recordings as
well you can add these that kvm options
to to tell the recorder to do recording
either to start a continuous recording
that just keeps running until you dump
the recording information or or you can
make it dump the recording information
when you exit the JVM there are even
tools if you if you manage to crash your
jvm there even tools to extract the
fight recording information from the
crash down so it's really it really is
like a black box of an aircraft you know
you can really get through the
information no matter what this settings
option there is important that is the
template that you use so the settings
you use that is the exact same thing you
specify the wizard if you want to store
this template that included the settings
for javafx you can do that using the
template manager so open the template
manager select the settings for the last
recording started and just export it
then you put that file in the GRE lib j4
folder of the JDK and then it will be
there available for you even if you
remotely connect to JVM running started
from from that particular JDK you will
it will be there available for you right
so the pictures are not come across very
well what it takes and everything so I'm
going to go over and do the demo instead
on my machine yeah that's
yeah I give that doc oops so all the
text looks quite nice in the actual
slice so if you will be downloading them
later from the side that will be fine
but unfortunately not this screen small
test doesn't show right yeah okay so
this is what flight recorder looks like
when you just downloaded recording
you're presented in ovid overview we did
have that much cpu load here i'm just
going to go over to the events view
making sure that I've been able to see
the javafx events hope you see this is a
little bit small tics possibly but
anyways so here you can see what all it
was talking about we have the JavaFX
application thread running along half a
player not too happy right here because
well there was a big resize event here
but you can also see what's happening in
the other thread which is the rendering
thread and I've just selected to see
only the JavaFX events right now so
that's the only two threats we see here
a if we want to see other events from
from the recording we can princess look
at Park events and then we can see that
the javafx thread is you know parking
here waiting for their render reading to
become complete before it starts
continuing of course uhlig knows much
more about the actual mechanics of how
probiotics works so he will have to
correct me if I'm saying something
really stupid here okay so another good
example would be seen how javafx runtime
behavior is aligned with the same
garbage collector became this particular
case didn't provide much work for the
garbage collector but in general volume
never know and that would be one way to
figure it out you enable garbage
collector events in separate hierarchy
and you see how they are correlated with
you'll be able maybe a hiccup in your UI
is you too long long GC yes else here
you can enable just Shoji see here you
will get stripes from dropping down from
that upper at GC level and you will see
that as a background to the other tracks
so I didn't have a GC happening here I
think no well not not gonna do something
well actually one over here so but this
were very small one so anyways so you
can see see the GCS as well okay um so
this is all fine and well but of course
we could do a prettier visualization
from one to two and I literally did the
15 minute facebook Oh histograms yeah
well so have you can build very general
histograms using java shuffle as well so
let's take the pulse face and let's look
at all the different phases by name and
you will be able to get the total
average counts for the different events
it's very dynamic you can do other
interesting stuff as well i'm going to
show that if we have time at the end I i
will maybe 12 a little bit deeper into
this but we built a javafx specific
initialization so very there is a
plug-in it's very easy to download I'm
going to show you how in a bit and it
shows you the Pops basis it says pulses
here it should say Paul spaces sorry for
that and you can click on a false and
see exactly the different phases that
that particular pulse consisted of and
you can also look at input events and
you can see the different resize events
for instance happening so this is some a
neat example of how easy it is to have
your own custom MN events being recorded
into the flight recorder and build your
own custom you use the user interfaces
if you want to and be able to correlate
the information that is captured you
know the contextual information by of
these events and have them shown with
everything else that is going on
the jail okay oops I wanted to say there
you go yeah so installing the plug-in if
you're running Mission Control as a
stand alone as a standalone tool the one
that is included in the Teddy K there
will be a menu option help install your
software when you go there you will see
all the different plugins that are
available so there are plugins for for
doing heap dump analysis for instance we
have plugins for for weblogic server and
other other software and in this case
you probably want the javafx tab pack
and if you don't like how the Java fixed
a packed looks and show you how you can
just change it so you do like how it
looks if we have time at the end ok and
a little bit now FX is open source
download the source you can be yourself
and this sound formation about how to
find traces of the pasta in the sauce
you are familiar with that otherwise
just for reference only goes to
so there are two sources and the reason
for that is Joe FISA Court itself is a
proprietary so 404 achill and so ja
flight record itself is not available as
open source but whatever relates to the
Java fight record in javafx is as open
source but if you build Java effects
with an open JDK compiler for example
there are no traces hotel flight
recorder and thus you won't be able to
build the sources so and we decided to
divide it in two parts and it's
automatically build it with OpenJDK if J
photo jar is not there the other part
will not be compiled and you will not
have Java flight recorder related code
in Java effects that you build the
package name is the same and these are
about it's quite simple the
implementation and these are the classes
that constitutes the boss logger so the
post for itself is just a set of static
methods accessible from the runtime it
delegates every call to corresponding
call in any available logger and you can
use the ax well now I will coat the
print loggers wanted print 80
information to the output and Java
flight recorder logger so those two are
instances that implement the logger
interface are internally but they
themselves are not public okay this is
how powerful the probes look what would
they look like in javafx runtime you
import that package name power Slugger
from the with the package name
you may also for brevity import the
static property of that class and that
property is dynamically enabled when you
attach for example for your jaw attached
with the Java Mission Control to your
application and start flight according
when you did not when you stop flight
according that that very will be set to
false and front and we'll stop calling
all those methods and this is basically
the entire API of the past foger new
face and you specify the name of you of
a new phase in the pulse new input and
you specify the name for that input add
message increment counter and some
specific events of start pulse and
renders our trend event that's basically
the entire API here are the files in
javafx source repository that absolutely
include all those props and there is no
point to talk more about that again this
is just for reference now here is
another diagram for the pulse loader
invocation so every single call to box
logo is presented here and it's the same
diagram for post-processing with the
animation CSS past layout past bound
updates waiting for the previous posts
to finish synchronization and finally
and providing a render job so again
should be similar now now an interesting
thing is that the pulse order itself is
a public class so runtime can invoke it
but so can you in your application and
this is a kind of a trick that you could
use in order to easily get information
that you produce in all those displays
all those fancy displays of Java Mission
Control and here's why
very simple example you need to
differentiate between two different
calls from that API new phase you can
call when you know that you are part of
a mouse processing and that is true for
animation handlers for example but that
is not true for input events but the
input new input API you can invoke just
from anywhere else with only candidate
that you say that you have a new input
event and you specify anything you want
and then you need to say when that input
event finishes and you just specify an
out as an argument here's another
example when which I actually used and I
specified a user task and I said
platform run later and I have some user
test code that takes some time to
execute and I called the past over the
same way runtime caused it but this is
actually user code this is my
application and here is an example what
it looks like now I see those events
representing my user task well it
actually says users ask right here but
you cannot see what I cannot see and
this is a way to time all the activity
that is due to your application behavior
as such not some activity that javafx
runtime provides for you so this is
basically it here are the resources and
well you can read more about mission
control from official documentation on
oracle side or from marcus blog where
you get a lot of additional information
that not always easily found in our
official documentation i guess a lot of
advisors a lot of hints a lot of things
i shouldn't be sharing even that okay
so that concludes the official part of
the presentation and Marcus wanted to
show us a way to do even more with jela
Mission Control and actually maybe tell
about how he created that plugin and
that it's not something right since we
have ended up having a lot more time
than we thought and I get free rains to
show you lots of stuff and I'm going to
use that time so here's the first of
lots of stuff so should you want to
integrate with the fight recorded
directly writing your own events from
whatever java code you want to this is
typically how you would do it it's an
unsupported API there will be a
supported API it's going to be very
similar but if you want to have the
ability to to you know come back with us
just with suggestions of features you
would like in a supported API this would
be a very good time to try it out also
if you know how this works once there is
a supported API you will have a bit of a
head start also if you have a really
hard problem this could be so I'm going
to explain and there's pretty small text
there so I try to go through it so you
need a producer a producer is just a
namespace for all your events that you
are producing so you have some metadata
that you can can use to define your
producer it has a name it is a
description does URI which is the
namespace then you need an event class
so you can in this case I have a timed
event there are several different types
of events you can have in the flight
recorder instantaneous events we call
them instant events just a data point in
time nothing nothing special we have
duration events the well of course you
know they have two times start and stop
then we have timed events which are
duration events only that you the user
is allowed to set a threshold that it
could be
like the way the pulse lager it's also
has a threshold but you can do this on
an event basis so you can for your event
type let the user specify that I only
want outliers that have them took longer
time than X and then we have something
called request supplements that I'm not
going to go into in this case we have
said that we have extended timed event
for this so we have an event that that
the user can configure a threshold for
but that has to start in a stop time and
then we have a little method called do
stuff now there which creates the event
caused the event begin takes time stamp
calculates something which is very
important that we want to record sets
the text sets that on the event the
field text in this case in the event
class and has has a name in the
description it's tagged to be value
definition so it will be recorded by the
recording engine and then we do end
which captures that and timestamp and
commits it to the recorder the flight
recorder is built into the JVM runtime
and we do a lot of interesting things to
make sure that this is efficient so if
we are running on a cpu that has time
stamp counter support in my ntsc for
instance we're going to use that time
stamp our events because that is much
cheaper than using system can't i'm
nervous or jealous or anything similar
so so this is actually fairly efficient
and we can also save can also skip out
on the object creation if you want to
buy by reusing the same object if we're
in position to do that and just call
reset then we're good to go according to
the same pattern okay
so for the built-in GUI designer stuff
if you have produced your events you
know I'm quite a different for from from
many comparable frameworks the flight
recorder produces data that is
self-describing in self-contained so
everything that is needed inside of the
fight recording every is there I mean
you don't need anything extra you don't
need extra files you don't need extra
information this is crucial because yeah
if you have crashed your jvm and you're
trying to get out the data you'd better
hope that the you know the metadata
required to be able to interpret the
recording is there or if you produce
data and do you have something like
maybe a constant pool you will want the
chunk the last chunk of the according to
contains through whatever's needed to
resolve the constants right otherwise
you would need to to be able to look
something up maybe from eight years ago
so you need a lot of to retain a lot of
data in this case the flight recordings
are partitioned into chunks and
everything you need to resolve a chunk
is in the chunk everything so this makes
it very easy for for the user interface
because the metadata the typing the
descriptions everything you need is in
the recording itself so we know what
types it is we can explain for the user
but the values actually mean we can we
can use we know if there's an numeric
data type that we can do to aggregation
all that is no it's not text we don't
need to evolve the processor in parallel
with the data they're producing which we
might need to do if we were using a
simple login framework okay so I'm gonna
use a little bit of time just to show
you how easy it is to build the user
interface you saw for the plugin yep
ok
ok ok so here we have the original and
pretty visualization I am NOT going to
build something quite as pretty because
that's going to take 15 min minutes and
submit you that but we will do something
simpler just going to need a Mission
Control somewhere from may be here jdk
we have a mission control going to start
that one ok so we've started Mission
Control I'm going to need the recording
which contains the metadata because it's
self-describing right so I need a
recording that contains the events that
i wanted to design for otherwise i don't
know how they look I don't know what
types there there are etc so I'm going
to need a fright recording from Java
ethics so using that long opening that
up and as you can see we have no javafx
tab group we have nothing very specific
for javafx here does it matter I mean we
can still use the data and so we can
still clock the data etc because again
self-describing so if I just want to
show my render thread like this simply
you know that's still possible i can see
work with the data I don't need anything
else but if you want to make a pretty
visualization that is dedicated for our
our job epic cements in this this case
we show the designer view so we're going
to want a new tab I'm just going to I'm
not going to make a new tab group that's
easy you just sell it new group but I'm
not going to do that I'm just going to
put a new tab here ok so and I let's
have a placement path because we wanted
to at the end call it something i don't
know em java f
Epic's pulse okay that's fine so here we
go we now have a new tab I'm going to
open the recording that we had here and
i put the tab on your system so i'm
going to go to system and look at my
very empty new tab and now i want to
have a container just going to do
something very simple so 100 by 100 s
usually good one oh not that end so yeah
not there that one I want hundred five
hundred goodbye hundred like that I want
to have this range navigator that you
see most most user interfaces emission
control that allows you to select a
range in time and which shows you where
there are events in your recording and
then I'm just going to put this some
some pretty graph there so let's add a
chart call it something data series we
want to have the javafx pulse I guess
duration and like that we won't have the
event types just from just from the
javafx pulse so like that so here we go
and sound pretty I don't feel the bar
chart kind of thing with some nice I
don't know from pink to something and we
want to show it in the legend i guess
like that and we run our little user
interface and mala we have a pretty user
interface with your arson you know yeah
so if you want to explore is what this
as a plug-in that other users can just
install in there Mission Control we just
yep do like this so export you I to plug
in take the ones that you are interested
in exporting
in their kind of state so the FX pulse
and you know put in a version if you
want the the newer version that will
over all right the older you increase
the number of course and then you just
select where you want to save it the
resulting jar and you can just put in
Mission Control in in that droppings
folder in Mission Control and it's ready
to go and since everything is built on
Eclipse Aussie I if you build an update
site for this you can have that as well
in this case I'm running the standalone
version of Mission Control there is
another version running which control
which is inside of the clips IDE if you
are running inside of the Eclipse IDE
and you of course can jump to source and
there are some other capabilities that
you can use but it's very similar to
what you see in the sandal version so
the idea probably is not that after this
presentation you'll be able to easily
view tio plug-in but just to know that
it is possible like because when you
really need that functionality it's good
to know where to go yeah okay so once
again all that functionality is
available starting job 8 Update 20 which
was out in August Natalie this year and
we'll get about go after that and that's
basically it so if you have any
questions
everything should crystal clear one
question if you think to it are taken
easily visit X which movie part 1
well with Wow shake a fist with odd two
threads ha ha ha the other for a band of
strategy ok so let's bring up the slide
where you had the reddit thread of the
ethics thread I think the question is
not quite children I think it's about
know why are there two of them I did
this one right now it was the fruit of
the earth ok
hours
we make me pop rocks what animation we
always are
okay Geor is the first time in this
reticence of facebook on top so that's
that one of purposely this is why we
this world when friend is Lord g alert
please their master and we don't see the
animation place right here oh no special
occasion apostle decided not to commit
but again enjoy it from the very first
message CSS us says that it starts 21
and 7 after the off start both anyone
within his work
slowing the partition and serve with
these data
that was very top communities that was
the demo we were recording that's not
with 18,000 now it's only 3000 that's a
million which is that hope okay any
other questions yes please so the end of
the question I do get the yeah okay
right so the question was it seems to be
an RCP application can I write my own
case plugins that do really goes up
hooking into the fight recorder and yes
of course in different various weights
because first of all Mission Control
itself has a bunch of extension points
so you can extend your things into the
fight decor if you want to have your own
your own gooey components that you can
lay out using the GUI builder you can do
that if we have internal plugins that
that's do that for for for metadata
visualization and other things which we
probably will you know get it give to
people later on if there is a demand and
people seem to to like them so maybe we
welcome yes and also if you just want to
use the standard Java API for for
parsing for instance parsing fight
recordings and doing something totally
different like bringing up a web page
etc there there are ways to do that as
well and so we have Java 8 the eyes to
parsers one included in the TDK one
included emission control you can think
of them as one being a sort of sex kinda
parser you get one event get a new canoe
and the mystical parts are being
something a little more along the lines
of it don't parser you get a Java model
you can that is very rich you can do
education there's a lot of toolkits for
doing different kind of statistical
operations so depending on your needs
might want to use one of these now none
of them are really supportive so I go to
my blog where I write about things that
aren't really supported but very useful
so and you can find out how to do that
so there are different ways you can do
this also there is a there is the next
major version of Mission Control
contains rules engine that allows you to
do automated analysis of fight
recordings so before you run away and
write this HTML render of reporting from
flight recorder that everybody seems to
be doing and that we become really easy
and actually be included in the next
major version emission control so you
know a little bit of patience then again
if you need it now you need it now and I
know but yeah there are different levels
of integration that you can do if you
want to any other questions it was aight
