open source thank you for coming my name
is secured reis and this is and a lot of
activities afterwards so enjoy it a
little bit about us we are from Mexico
but we live in Switzerland we yes and
the cheese of course we work at canoe
it's a Swiss company with Java and we
love the Java we actually love the
groovy and we also participate in many
open-source projects and the one of the
reasons why we here in front of you
talking about this topic is that we have
learned a few things about doing open
schools and we know there are some
challenges as such a regular individual
when someone wants to contribute to open
source or as a member of our
organization that is used to doing all
sorts in the old way or the commercial
way so how do you can get into open
source so those are the things that we
want to share today how we did it and
what challenges you my face are how to
overcome them and some tools that will
help you because some people don't know
about license that they can get tools
that they can use for free because they
have an open source project or they are
contributed to an open source project so
that's always a good thing to know right
so perhaps you heard this in the Java in
the keynote yesterday and you might have
seen these machines outside of the rooms
they're called the boring machines this
is how we as speakers can have a quick
measurement if we did something good if
we did it wrong so that's how we can
make things better for the next time so
please don't forget to vote every kind
of boat is fun
and if anybody here is interested in
desktop development well these things
are written using Java effects and we
also use the cloud on the and the set
aside in order to gather all the
information and calculate those
statistics if you want to know more
about these statistics there we will see
the the leaderboards in the hacker
garden space in the Java ha back in the
exhibition floor and they will be a talk
later in thursday if you want to know
more how these things are actually set
up because it's not just the software
which also the hardware a few more
interesting things right so we live in a
highly connected world Willie so we're
here because of Java right and Java is
open source so that's that's easy but
you probably book your flight using
standard website and so happens that
many of those websites are powered by
open source the tools that people use to
validate and do quality gate stuff they
are also open sourcing by way of another
the operating system these things are
running is most likely to be open source
Linux or something else so there is no
way that we can escape from open source
now and I believe there is a good thing
yes but we still have challenges to we
are facing challenges in open source as
in any project that we work on there
will be always be obstacles how do we
get into open source we don't know how
to do things once we do how do we make
sure that what we share is doesn't get
doesn't harm somebody or if something
bad happens how to make sure that we can
get into a safe place how do we make
sure that the quality of the code is
okay how to make sure that we are
communicating enough information to the
other party so that i can safely use the
software and enhance the software so
these are many things that we have to
face but what we actually want is of
course which ago but
the the road to success is an arduous
one it's not an easy one but that's
that's okay because there are many
lessons that are you going to learn and
most likely the path to success is paid
with community no mine is an island we
need to reach out to others in order to
be able to go to reach our goals every
time that we talk to somebody else we
will gain new knowledge we will gain a
new perspective on a problem at hand
right okay oh by the way I will fail to
mention but if you have any questions at
any time please let us know sometimes
when we get very very excited about a
topic we start to speak faster and
faster as faster you might notice it in
a moment because we really love the open
source so please let us know at any time
you have any question so before we have
to know exactly what we're dealing with
so this is a standard definition of open
source that you can find on Wikipedia
another website that happens to be
running on open source surprise surprise
and so basically it's like a beer so
where where the source code is made
available to someone under a licensure
this is very important the license of
open source is very important their
meaning out there but the important
thing is that a copyright holder remains
the retains the copyright but it's
giving you the consumer the option to
modify to change to a study that code
and their different licenses will give
you additional benefits or some
restraints either you will be able to
publish your contributions your
modifications actually you will be
encouraged or forced to do so another
will say that's fine you can read the
code but you make animal ification now
that thing is yours just keep sure that
you still mention the original copyright
under the original author but now that
thing is it's yours you own it so now
it's up to you to decide how things go
down the chain
you're trying to make a point here about
license because many people that are in
open source don't think about that they
don't choose the right license and that
sometimes prevent other users or other
developers of using the software because
they can get into trouble so for us it's
fundamental that you keep in mind to to
learn about different licenses choose
the right one you can choose two
licenses if that's what you want if
later on you want to pro feed person of
your open source projects and all the
work that you're putting it it's doable
we can discuss that if that topics
tracks your attention and as a matter of
fact so open source give you action
actually kind of look like four freedoms
up can you tell us more about that yes
as he as Andrus said the copyright owner
grants us some rights with the software
and this so work but some of the
freedoms that allow us in that regard is
to study the software so for that we
have to have access to talk to the open
source code we can distribute it again
if either either in the same license
that it was given to us or we can change
it and do whatever we want without that
is the week copyleft and yeah yeah
basically nice okay perfect so a little
bit of history on on open source but
before we get into them as anybody here
already perform or work in some
particular open source project a few
hands anybody here is actually
interested in doing open source projects
okay also if you can so you are at the
right place perfect yeah so at the
beginning you thank you yes at the
beginning them we're talking about this
is a like 30 years ago everybody did a
broad broad code pretty much in the same
way which is hidden behind an office and
a cubic
just click the clickety click you
produce we produce a release there is
out somebody consumes the server it
breaks down you call to support and then
you wait for the next release so if it
so what happens that this guy came up
Richard Stallman he had a problem with a
printer he needed to print out something
but he couldn't because the server did
not allow him there was some problem
with the driver and he said well what if
I was able to fix the problem because I
know exactly what I needs to happen but
I don't have access to the source so I
cannot fix it i bought this machine and
it's completely useless to me I now need
to talk to the other company in order to
fix the problem I might take some time
but I need a solution today so this is
what started the whole revolution and in
his way through the free up and I sorry
the free software so what he wants is
the ability for anybody to cap access to
the source code any particular source
code so that in case that you need to
fix something to address a new
capability that is not currently
provided by the soviet itself and if you
have the means to make it happen then
you are the most the most indicated
person to make it happen so he started
this foundation the free server
foundation and he created a new project
so that many other people could do what
he wanted to do and for a while it was
pretty good actually started in the mid
80s if I no mistakin and it got traction
until point when we can go a few more J
years later and then we find this guy do
you guys know who this guess this person
is this is Lena's linen store as a
creator of the Linux kernel so while the
genome project had plenty of commands
and applications and utilities that will
replicate the whole UNIX operating
systems you might remember that unique
is copyrighted and it's not free they
were lacking a very specific key
component which is the caramel the
of the operating system and this is
where Lina's appears so he created
something and instead of just saying I'm
just keep it he published it on a user
group and say guys here is it's my first
tried as my first time doing this so
what do you think and that started a
revolution because more and more people
got involved into this project and it so
it's good but why did you change this so
that now instead of supporting this
particular processor you can also
support this other one oh I have another
problem with this screen or this driver
or this printer and this is where he
started the whole thing now instead of
choosing the most free or viral license
he went with another one and that
encourage people to talk to each other
and provide patches and it is because of
that how big this thing how this thing
exploded in a positive way that we got
into this other gentleman do you guys
know who this person is this is Friday
today this is eric raymond and after
some years of the linux development he
started to see some interesting shifts
in the industry a paradigm shift so he
created well he wrote a paper is called
the cathedral on the bossa and the idea
behind this paper is that he he found
out how the different communities work
he studied the linux kernel how these
people mean they were working in their
basements and i don't know probably
somebody was listed living with the
parents or they were working in at so
many late hours in the night just
because they want to do this versus the
other way how the usual gee new
applications were developed at the time
where there was one person that said
this is how we're going to do things
right and yes you all can collaborate
but you must share my vision and
everybody must do the same way whereas
in the linux kernel that does this is
the cafe
about this is our plan this is the
structure this is the building we're
going to build done you like it or you
don't like it whereas in the bazaar
which is the Linux way everybody just
came together and this share ideas and
we almost get almost like emergent
behavior because so many different ideas
floating around that new things appear
this paper was so important that it
convinced this company you guys remember
this company right back from there from
the browser bars this company was one of
the first that said okay we're going to
a bet on open source and we're going to
put most of our business behind open
source license because we think this is
the future and history is now behind
nesconset yes you were right you were so
right they started creating the Mozilla
Foundation and then we got Firefox and
then we got a much better internet story
because well at the time in rexburg
wasn't so good now I think it's much
better than we got Chrome Safari so many
other things this is thanks to open
source the key concept of open source
why it was able to make it happen is
because of the licensing as we said
before you have to keep that in mind I
can tell you what that we have three
different types of copyleft copy left's
were was is a term coined by the open
source foundation or open source
community to specify how are we going to
distribute the code if we make a
modification to it as I said we hope for
there is a weak one that's the VSD type
of license where you don't have to
redistribute the tube there is no
restrictions at all there is the weak
one that you could you should mention
who developed the original code and you
are
asked to share all the modifications and
the last one which is a strong one or
viral in this case it's interesting the
concept because in Europe it's difficult
to implement the viral the first version
of the viral or strong copy left but
since I believe five years ago there is
a new ppl licence for Europe and this is
supported by 28 countries so if you are
thinking about licensing your code in
Europe I strongly suggest you to take a
look about that is a license that has
been translated to 22 languages one here
has many languages where at least 22 of
the most well known languages in the
continent and so we have plenty of
licenses the first ones was the G new
the GPL the general public license which
gives you the benefit of a student
occurred but if you make any
modifications then you are forced to
publish those modifications again into
the public why because the idea is that
everybody benefits this also means that
if you're writing commercial code and
you consume a library that is GPL these
transforms your whole code base into GPO
so that's a little bit of bad when when
you want to keep just a few things to
yourself right but you also want to be
open to the community at some point then
the free server foundation address this
issue and creating a new license called
the lesser Genie GPL you might know it
as lgpl this library allows you to also
study and modify the code if you modify
the code you must publish but if you
link your codebase to that library then
your codebase can remain in any license
you want it doesn't force you to use the
GPL or Algeria to your code base so this
is friendly to our commercial interest
in
some way just before they're the GPL
version 3 was published at that time in
2006 GPL to was the most use license in
the world yes there are now three
versions of the GPL and there is one
additional version of GPL is called the
affero GPL 3 this is the most barreled
version of license that exists and this
is very important for you guys to know
because the affero GPL license is not
only affects the code base that you link
but it can also affect the code way that
is linked through the network so in the
times of cloud services it's somebody's
offering you a cloud service that is
licensed under air the Afro GPL and
guess what your clients your client code
will become a GPL as well if this is
something that we want that's okay so
the important thing is to make sure to
put forward that information to make
sure that everybody is clear on the
different kind of licenses that you are
able to to reach or that your code base
is using but again sometimes we have
problem and forcing these licenses in
different countries so that's why you
have to look into it if you are
targeting europe i suggest to look at
the stronger version of people and they
are still some discussions but it's out
there and it's published you can use it
and it will protect you right and there
are other licenses for example the
apache license or the eclipse license or
the MIT bsd I'm learn more than 20
licenses open-source ones and most of
them have been bettered by this
organization the OSI and there are so
then they are compatible with one
another so then gives you more freedom
so in a sense that yes you can produce
open source project you can produce
commercial software some at some point
if a all the authors agree that a
version can be closed down
and continues a close source then you
can do it and there are some other
licenses that said it doesn't matter if
you get the agreement of everybody this
thing stays up and I will continue to be
open so it's thanks to these these
licenses that now we get foundations
that allowed to foster the development
of open source projects one of the most
well-known is Apache and is anybody here
a user of NetBeans may have your hands
then you put you definitely know of the
proposal is not yet a done deal but the
proposal to move NetBeans to the Apache
foundation and this is great because
even though app NetBeans is an open
source project it only had one sponsor
son and now Oracle if the sponsor
decided that it's no longer okay for
them to support the project and the
probably most likely wither and die but
if the promote the move to Apache is
successful and everything agrees on then
it's now the community as going to own
the software is going to own the
copyrights and it's now up to the
community to decide how much further
they want to do development is not just
in the hands of one company this is
great but Apache foundation is not the
only one that exists out there we also
got the Eclipse Foundation where you
find not only the popular IDE but many
other projects well Oracle decided to
donate Hudson some years ago and now you
get a build system on that or CI
continuous integration and there is
another one is called the freedom
Conservancy Foundation and this is where
the Linux kernel is there are different
levels of support in these foundations
but the Apache foundation and the clicks
foundation gives you a legal framework
on which all the contributors all the
contributors and all the contributions
can be protected there have been some
times where a company it does not follow
a particular license and then the
contributor said hey what are you going
on
not fair as I continued to what can I do
well you go to the to the foundation if
your house your project there and then
can help you resolve the situation they
also give you access to servers and
infrastructure so it's easy for you to
develop the sober you don't have to come
up with a new server in order to make
sure that you can write your code same
thing goes with eclipse foundation and
well we're in a java conference right so
we need to talk a little bit about Java
you guys know what happened is what i
hear doing java since the beginning 95
okay so we had access to job at the time
right we were able to look at the jse of
the java a standard library we were able
to look at the code right but it was a
kind of look but don't touch this code
is ours that's what sunset but and you
can look at it but you cannot copy it
because we have the copyright if you
need to implement a new
inputstreamreader and guess what you
have to come up with your own solution
and if we by any chance we have access
to your column we look at it and looks
very similar to ours your good again in
trouble but in 2006 we got the news that
java was open source on there GPL and
classified extension GPL to do you guys
know what that means so GPL to is the
second version of the GPO and a
classified extension is what allows you
to write any kind of application using
any kind of license you want because
even though GPL to is a valid license
the clasp at extension exception says
that if even if you're linking to this
thing you will you would assume you will
not force the GPL to to your code base
and this is great so that's why now we
are able to write any kind of things
using Java and we can still study code
and we can also contribute back to Java
and the way that we do this is to the
JCP the JCP is a standards body and
through J SARS and jabs is how any
and I actually mean this anybody can be
a member of the JCP whether it's an
organization or is an individual and
then give feedback into how things are
done the the most popular example in the
recent years is the London Java user
group they got very much involved in 2
j's are three thin which is java time
api that was added back in in jdk 8 they
really wanted to have a very good api
because if you have worked with java
date java.util.date in the past you know
it has issues jola time is trying to fix
that and gelatin was the inspiration for
java time and this is exactly how the
London Java user group got involved we
want something better than Java util
time there is this package ok let's look
at that let's propose it and when its
proposed let's go through several
iterations of usages so that we as
consumers of epi give quick feedback and
now we got that I would say it is
definitely a much better API it's
perfectible we can make things better
and that's how you as members of the
overall java community can provide quick
feedback and if you really want to we
will encourage you to join the gcp as
either your organization or San the Bill
of members and continue giving that
feedback ok look now let's pass a little
bit for now so we saw a bit of history
we got into Java but for those of you
decide you want to get into open source
and for those of you that already do
open source well looks like life on
developing open source is kinda like
pink observe Rosie left right most
people think that when we say open
source everybody's happy everybody
shares ideas and we have plenty of
budget and we can drink here or any kind
of beer or drinks and have pizza life is
perfect right well the actual true is
this
it's only a few guys a few persons in
the wee hours of the night hacking on
something because they are very
passionate many of the people that jump
into open source they jump because into
it because they have a problem and they
need to find a way to fix it and they
he'll look around and they don't find
that solution they say well I had the
means I think I had the skills so I'm
going to hack something and I believe
that what I just did is useful enough so
somebody could consume it because I
brought me and not the only one that has
faced this problem okay the problem that
happens with this view is that well that
passion is burning the developer will
continue to to write the software but
eventually we will reach a point when
this happens we burn out right what we
want is for you to avoid to reach this
state what we want is for everybody to
have a good time to be able to fix the
problems and to be able to share the
knowledge and also learn in the process
we support several different activities
to meet with different developers and
really share either knowledge time later
on we can talk about the hacker garden
that is also happening on the exhibition
floor and that's the idea to connect
people we know so many open-source
project leaders that are looking for
feedback people that are willing and
want to join different open source
projects and learn a little bit about it
or help right so what we can do is
change the situation everybody can help
in one way of another the easiest way
for you to contribute back to open
source is to say I really like this
project is sold my problem yeah it might
have some issues but that's okay or I
totally don't did not understand the
documentation on how this work is
supposed to be set up
can you change your examples yes do you
have a real life example this just as
easy as telling that person thank you
for that that's pretty much enough but
if we can do more that would be perfect
what kales can we do well we can reach
out these people in many ways I said we
are highly connected now we find so
we're all over the place so these people
can be reached via Twitter Facebook
email memoryless message boards there
are many outlets out there anywhere you
have a terrific opportunity right now
the content will be online but they are
built the chance to really go into the
hallways and meet and greet the speakers
or the project leaders it's an amazing
one and they are super open so please do
so you keep yourself the chance to talk
to them on our first experience here at
JA 110 years ago when we saw the
schedule oh yes I want to go with that
one and that one that one so by the
third day by the time a job one used to
run for five days from monday to went to
friday from eight in the morning to 11
in the evening sans parties we were
completely wasted by wednesday and
wasted in a good sense of we saw so many
things that the brain couldn't hold up
enough information but we lose one thing
we just went to the top to the sessions
we consume all the information we didn't
talk to people for those that said this
is my first conference by all means
certainly consume this information but
ask questions the best track in this
conference is called the whole way track
where you simply talk to somebody
outside or go to an exhibition floor
where you will meet of course the
exhibitors would also project needs and
many other kind of interesting people go
to the taylor street cafe and engage in
a conversation sometimes a five-minute
conversation will be much more worth
than one hour of sitting here consuming
information at least this is what the
experience that we have gathered after
10 years of attending
so definitely try to do that kind of
face to face meetings or participating
webinars but try to have something that
is much more so on the JCP feedback give
back shape java solve the problems that
you have make them permanent ok ah if
you think you want to do more then
definitely by all means create a patch
hack some code fix an issue provide a
test case most of the times what the
project leads need is a reproducible way
to take out a particular bug when you
look at the issues that people have
filed this they say I encounter a
problem and I was doing this and then it
broke and then the next step is the the
project leader somebody from the project
says okay perfect can you give me more
details so what's your environment which
operating system were you running or is
the number the version number for that
particular software that you were using
because we need more information because
it could be the same you think that well
it works on my machine right I couldn't
replicate it so we know these on a
regular projects it's exactly the same
in open source and the next step it
would be to give to write a simple test
case just many open-source projects have
guidelines on how they want to format
the code or what kind of libraries they
use for testing or dependencies do you
can always find this information one way
or another I'll just ask the main list I
encountered this problem I want to give
you a test case please give me more
information here is there we go and then
just continue discussion and and the
last step will be that you found the
problem you were able to reproduce it
but you also have the skills to fix it
right a patch I will guarantee you it's
not going to be perfect the first time
and most likely the team members say
thank you but can you make these changes
don't feel bad about that because they
are looking into the problem in a
different way and it's okay to start
engaging in these
the change of ideas and to eventually
reach out into consensus so don't feel
bad if they reject your first batch that
can happen just try it again and we can
now talk about a little bit of all the
tools that we recommend you to use we
don't work for this company but
apparently looks like this is the
company that most people know from of a
place where you can share code there are
more than this one of course what is
there in the most well-known so it's in
the first step yes that's my ugly mug
and the interest interesting about the
github is that you can see like a
scoreboard how many times you have
contributed so you can play a game of
how many dark green dots can you have on
a week on a given month my contributions
are a little bit sparse lately and the
interesting thing about jihad is that
gave us that social interaction because
before give up there were many places
out there where you can just drop code I
have a simple issue tracker and that was
it right but this allows you to look at
the personal aspect now you can you can
reach out to that other person to engage
in a conversation to see how active that
person is or how inactive in my case and
to have much more than just say here's
the code usually you want it right and
because that social aspect grew so big
you will find other services that latch
on to github almost by default for
example do you guys do you use Kanban
board or scrum soma working on these
techniques at work would it be great to
do something like that where open source
but the challenge in open source is that
the team might be distributed around the
world and different time zones well
there is this service called waffle ayah
which is free for open source so you
have an open source project your host on
github boom now you got a planning board
and it's very very easy and this
integrates with the
issue tracker of github so whatever you
do in this website will be also mirrored
back into gear so give her remains or at
least they're the source repository
that's important thing remains the
single source of through that yes that
they answer something I give up universe
right that's because many people want to
do this right exactly thank you we also
have a code reviews there are many tools
other two doing code reviews what's
interesting about this one reviewable io
is that there are different views that
you can have and everything turns out to
be a set of comments that go back again
into the issues page of your source
repository and I've been using this for
a couple of months now and what I really
like is that once you have finished with
our discussion and you are reviewing a
pull request you click on a button and
that sends the message to the the surf
repository but I also can trigger an
automatic match or the branch of the
pull request into whatever branch you
want to so you don't have to go back and
forth you know to go you can do the one
place with you it's pretty cool the next
one continuous integration there are
many tools out there suggest you have a
look at travis travis has perfect and
excellent integration with github as a
matter of fact you don't have to
configure much of it if you are a
standard java project then the confusion
is just like two or three lines of code
and it just works and regardless of use
and maven or Grail or something else
just understand its words boom done if
you're producing your bills in Travis
you might be interested in code coverage
well there are a couple of services out
there this one is called Cobra rules I
oh yeah like the clothing and with this
you have a historical record of code
coverage as a matter of fact this
project I know I know that the report is
actually close to seventy percent for
some reason this service is now saying
that is thirty two percent
but I can see how the cobra the code
Corrections going up a little bit done
then slowly I I did something wrong with
the bill there so no coverage at all and
then we regain that number and you can
drill down into the specific file and
whatnot again you have all the
historical data but if this one is not
good enough for you there's another one
called code club I oh we loaded any
there's no much data right then actually
this bill fail we can tell by that and
this service also says that we got low
coverage on this project I guess I have
to fix that now a different view and you
can also drill down so the important
thing is that you have access to these
tools and this is free and ultimately
hosted if you are doing things with
github the next one is that perfect you
have produced some code and you have
given users the access to your code base
but how do you give users access to your
binaries where did you distribute the
bynars where do you put the binaries if
it's just a matter of a single set of
jars then most people know l can go to
maven central there is a way for you to
supply information to make the center
the guidelines are a little bit draconic
to be honest it's not easy to publish
something from start into maven central
where I can tell you that is very simple
to do it with this web cycle of entry
and that's a superset vinter is a
superset of mavin center so every
artifact a binary that you find the
central you'll find it here plus
everything else and you can pretty much
say bin trey is like get 44 binaries we
also have a social aspect you sign in
with your gif I can't and then you start
publishing binders and now it's up to
you to decide how you want these buyers
to go and there's also a way yes this
button called maven central if you have
a sonatype account then you set up your
public key and whenever you publish tube
entry it will mirror the binary into
maven central so that's the easy way for
you to
polish to maven cetera that's another
one communication yes we have many lists
yes we have an issue tracker but
sometimes the issues page is not the
best way for us to engage in real-time
conversation what you can have is well
you can use twittered if you want to or
you can use this thing called gita get
there for those that remember the old
days of using IRC well that's pretty
much it is kind of like IRC over Twitter
that's hence the name Keita you can
attach any channel to a particular
source repository so all team members
for that repository can't participate
immediately in the conversation you can
have private rooms you can have public
rooms it's up to you to decide how you
want to engage your the consumers of
your AP eyes or your libraries for your
projects do we have another one oh no no
yes you can get jireh license for open
source project of jireh and also you can
get a license for IntelliJ and yes
windows NetBeans open source and free
but if you happen to be using IntelliJ
and if you develop open source project
you can get a free license to continue
developing that software and the same
thing goes with JIRA if you use JIRA as
a issue tracker on your company and you
want to use it for an open source
project you just have to contact them
and they will give you a license so
actually there are few other commercial
entities that are friendly to open
source when they know that you want to
just make things better for everybody
else then here you go use our tools for
free because we trust you and because we
know everybody wants to make things
better for the rest of the community and
the last website i can show of course is
the JCP please look at it sign up it's
much much easier now to become a member
in the past they used to charge you a
fee to become a member especially for an
organization good news no fees anymore
anybody can become a member and it's
very easy this
23 done they were they used to be also a
lot of paperwork in the past I had to go
through that one but now if you do it
electronic and its really yes I know
when I'm in papers actual paperwork a
sinus and every now it's much easier now
you sign electronically but there is
still a process yes exactly and this is
the way that you can directly influence
the future of Java all right so oh so
that's a small set of tools that we have
used in the past and we continue to use
and we have found very useful but these
are not the only ones there are
definitely other places where you can
host your code there are other different
tools for code coverage or for health
checking and so many other things of CI
environments and so don't take our word
for this explore other tools we have
found this to be good for our needs but
there are others that would fulfill
other different kind of needs and it's
important that you keep in mind that
your github account maybe you're leaving
cv so sometimes people are really
interested in when you go into the
interview you say do you have a github
account what do you do what are your
interests do you like testing and then
you can show that you're really do
testing you have good practices you
follow pattern so it's a win-win it's a
win for you you will learn new tools you
because we have feel we have found we
have encountered many people that say
I'm working for a back and then so we're
still using svn so I don't know about
Kate and we said okay do you want to
learn yes then an open source project is
the clear answer to that question you
can do whatever you want you can explore
new tools you can change your present
and do a better future for yourself
in the process you help the community so
it's a win-win so how are we doing you
guys have any questions so far
everything good okay okay well so I hope
that when we should have more time but I
hope for those that say that they will
be interested in jumping into open
source we can give you a couple of hints
don't be discouraged again if whenever
you first try something and somebody out
there will say no that's not good
probably that person is looking at
something else that the sober they just
wrote does not address everything that
he wants to see but it does address what
you need at the time an interesting
interaction happens in open source is
that you are looking at a particular
project a particular problem in in in in
a small sphere with a small perspective
and that's fine but then you will
encounter somebody from the other side
of the world is India China Japan I'm
hungry and they will look at you can say
nice but can you do that can you do this
other thing because I'm facing this
problem and you look back your codec I
didn't think about that I didn't know
you could use that in that way how can
you want to do this and then you start
to think back I want able to fix this
problem can I do this and that gives you
a much better perspective and at the end
when we think about in the call numbers
what it seemed for me if I do open
source what do I gain do I get more
money not necessarily not directly what
you gain is a much better set of skills
you know it's not just the hardware
skills d they're hardwired skills on how
you can do better code and you can get
better quality it's also those soft
skills that at least we as someone
engineers sometimes we say we lack a
little bit how we can properly
communicate an idea to somebody else how
do we make sure our selves understood to
a person that has a different view of
the world that we did not even conceived
so these are the things that actually
make you a much better developer and
much better person at your
and your job and you can apply these
learn lessons to your regular job you
see if it's not happens to be based on
open source so basically open source is
a bunch of questions and what we want is
to ship fuck use so that you can can
regain a little bit more control on how
you actually write software and
sometimes you will see that you have to
change their direction I was very luck
to encounter these this image because it
it really summarize everything of course
you can jump and enter directly into it
so what we say is keep calm and open
source open source is here to stay
there's no way this thing is going to go
away and another news that was shared
last few couple of days and this is very
very surprising and a very very positive
way do you know which is the company
that has the most commits at github
right now the evil one Microsoft
Microsoft has fully embraced open source
in such a way that nobody else have done
it in this and it's incredible and this
is spearheading and it's allowing other
companies say this is the way to go yes
we can do commercials over what we also
would do open source because what we
want is to be better what we want is to
make communities better
this is the our jail at Duke a canoe we
have well actually if you search for us
we or look for us later we have stickers
with these things and a few others there
are some spoilers coming up in while you
will be able to see in the community
knock in thursday and we will be at the
exhibition floor we don't have a booth
but will be at the Java ha and you can
find other people were in this shirt and
you have can help much more stickers so
now I guess we open the floor for any
questions that you may have and feedback
that is because of how we do handle
dependencies so the comment is that in
the JavaScript wall is very easy to
share code you do basically with with no
NPM publish your package and now is
readily available for everybody in the
case of jazz of Java we have jars as the
the basic unit of distribution and
somehow you have to define the
appendices with an one and jar and
another project such as maven define it
a format or how these dependencies can
be expressed and that's what we have for
now and once jigsaw gets released will
have a different set of mechanism to
define how the penises will be done
would that make things sharing binders
easier perhaps and if it does not the
case then companies like j frog and with
the website called ben tre can do things
a lil bit better and if they can't no
worries is very likely that somebody
else will jump into the challenge
anybody else will would like to share
something
yes
so the question is has a curator for the
process how do you build a community
around on opposites project a healthy
one oh boy let's start with the
community yes I think that the the
easiest was it sounds easy but it's
actually hard is to have an open mind to
a perspective from the other person so
what the other person is bringing to the
table again you may be to fuck use in
trying to solve one particular project
problem and then somebody else comes in
with an orthogonal view and says I think
you're sober can help me but I want to
use it in this other way can you help me
happen make this thing happen and
sometimes we are so focusing one thing I
said no this is not how we do things and
and you turn this person down and you
say well it's not exactly that there's a
door but actually there's the door so we
had to be careful about this i would say
bring this person so talk to this person
and say thank you thank you for this
contribution thank you for this question
I was not aware of this it's kind of
difficult right now to fix it perhaps or
the the way that we decided they find
the code will not allow for this to be
easily done but what about if we do this
or not try to find a workaround right
try to include this person into the
countess's other other techniques like
your Ruby community they prepare some
long hanging fruit some patch or think
that the community can help and so
that's how they encourage for newcomers
to solve the easy stuff actually that's
another website called up for grabs net
that somehow attaches to issue trackers
we want them be in the issue the github
issue tracker so you put attack on an
issue saying up for grabs and these will
automatically be displayed on the opcode
grabs net web site so somebody looking
ok I want to know some pics a problem in
PHP or java ok here are the different
projects and here's an issue ok let's go
into that one and the team members
determine what is the level of
difficulty or complexity for a
particular issue
finding a needle in the haystack yes
that's exactly what we say please use
the budget show coverage show that your
products is still alive because that's
the other problem we have a lot of
zombie projects publish and people say
ok I publish my project and then I'm
gone and that's it and sometimes you
have to look into it first if the
license is correct I can use it second
it is still maintained who is
maintaining it etc etc so that's why we
encourage the open source projects to
use different tools to show that there
is still alive and healthy and also do
write articles I know for a fact that
many java magazines the java magazines
are always looking for people to submit
new articles also go to joke meetings
speak about it yeah that's a good one so
if you have a local Java user group a
good way to promote your open source
projects to tell the people around about
this and another way is if you create a
twitter account and i start sending
information retweeted if you publish
binaries these websites will
periodically retweet or send information
so that's how you can make things grow
it if you're open source project is
solving a problem that is solved by
another one I don't exactly recommend
you to hijack a mainly list and say hey
I have a new thing that is related to
red hair jboss and on your posting this
on the spring sauce thingy right not
exactly but somehow you had to find it
was just search the mainland Lisa said
okay this person is talking about this
topic and I know him from another
channel so i'm going to engage that
person on that other channel so that
these other guys do not feel bad because
i'm discussing that something that is
not exactly their software and for that
well the mainly google user groups or
some other boards will be very useful
okay so any other questions yeah almost
done all right well if not well thank
you very much we hope we can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
