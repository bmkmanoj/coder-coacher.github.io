Oracle code London and I don't know how
about the weather's like outside how
would you describe it Gary cold cold
okay
on a cold but not rainy day in the city
and I have a your host Javed Mohammed
and I have as my guest today Gary
mortally Maudsley I hope I probably ray
and who's the chief technical officer at
Amgen that's right okay so Gary welcome
Thank You Janet so Gary just I guess
there's so much to talk about you're a
customer of particle you yes go gone the
whole journey actually let's even start
up before that so I checked you by all
ya graduate of mansion University of
Manchester that's right yeah well when I
used to have hair and they were black I
actually attended Manchester University
Wow Wow yeah yeah maybe there's yeah
yeah I did my undergraduate over there
and then in Computer Engineering
yeah wait way back but I see you got an
undergrad and then a graduate degree
mathematics and yeah so I was right a
few sighs OH oh wow okay yeah so yes
small world it is but very good memories
so tell us a little bit about what do
you do attendant I mean I because a
technical of a visionary and yeah
tell us a little bit of water well I go
to the gents their journeys yeah the
answer journey started about seven years
ago
and we actually wanted to store data
inside the classroom we were fairly
early adopters this is pre Anthon but as
a group my partner that I wanted to
adopt the cloud to deploy solutions
application servers and databases and
the like but we couldn't easily deploy
out inside the EU we had to deploy
outside of the legal territory it was
illegal for us to deploy there but yet
we wanted to do that so we needed to
find a way we could do that legally we
consulted Reed Smith privacy lawyers
we understood where the restrictions lay
and consequently we came up with a
solution of how we could restructure
data in order for us to be able to store
that data anywhere in the world and take
advantage of commodity cloud compute the
consequence great so the idea was born
seven years ago we file for patent
protection in the u.s. in the UK and we
gain petah protection just over a year
ago fifteen months ago congratulations
and at that point we decided that we
would incorporate into ads and data and
pursue our first of all a prototype and
then an MVP so the prototype
demonstrated the principle of how we
achieve the levels of data data
separation required and now we're on to
a full MVP where we can apply the
technology across any day to domain and
the beginning difference whether the
data is structured unstructured it you
don't care so we tend to we assume for
the moment the data will come from a
legacy relational database ok please no
plans and data front of database the
anthem databases are no sequel or more
to the point of schema last database we
leverage existing technologies in those
arenas and layer the ants and products
over the top great so I understand you
also had some experience but from a
cloud standpoint with the Amazon Web
Services AWS and then you can a Moodle
are moved on to Oracle cloud can you
share a little bit about that we don't
have badmouthing but we just think we
just kind of curious like in a compare
and contrast so we still room today on
AWS um you didn't hear that so it with
Amazon that started the journey 4 or 7
years ago it was the Amazon Cloud we
wanted to to run on at that time we from
autumn of last year we had the
opportunity to use the new bare metal
cloud and in terms of what we need to
achieve because of the nature of the
product we're heavily dependent on on
the network and
and the response times and latency times
on the network so bare-metal cloud has
already met started to make sense for us
but we found since starting to use it
it's actually made sense in lots of
other ways because of the architecture a
bare-metal cloud their mental cloud is
essentially incredibly simple highly
performant in terms of the network in
terms of the machinery and it's
incredibly easy to configure from a
console UX and CLI point of view okay
and you could argue it's lacking in a
lot of the services at AWS have but I
think that's to its advantage because
it's very very easy to negotiate this
powerful beast so what a good
encapsulation or what you said and maybe
I didn't get it all is that it's the
article that bare-metal service
basically gives you something which is
simple easy to use but on top of that
the the kind of service ISM that that
are available so there is a lot more
it's inherently powerful uh-huh and it
has the capability to build out services
using container technology and build
them out in an elastic way using using
things like Cuban ETS okay so you've got
to think of it in a different way so
it's not you can still get the
horizontal scale of functionality but
you can do that essentially on bare
metal cloud by leveraging container
technology to give you that functional
scale but functional scale based on the
same sets of tools so you can
essentially meta program your
environment I mean that all the cloud
vendors will claim you can do that but
because while you go from every program
you give you okay sorry I'm just a
little little logo basically because
machines are essentially data now huh
you can you can manipulate machines in
code - so okay so better programming is
writing code that generates code or okay
okay okay
manipulate code okay but in turn you can
manipulate your whole environment
through code so instead of building out
horizontal rafts of functionality on a
cloud go that you can create a very
tight powerful cloud and then use the
very simple building blocks of that
cloud to actually replicate and roll out
more and more functionality by
leveraging functionality that's offered
through say open source programs okay
but you've got a standard way of
replicating that functionality and not
sure I'm making myself into I think it's
very clear you know so we know we've got
we have a conference here mainly
targeted for developers what you know if
we just kind of and I'm sure we yeah I'm
get into this I hide the whole level
that I I can't come in but watch it
what's your message to the developers
who are coming to a conference like this
well like that the core message is
there's in terms of bare metal cloud
there's a great facility there in terms
of its its compute power in terms of
networking speeds and a great
environment on which to build open
source software instances so to leverage
open source from various communities and
mash them together and create solutions
and a conference like this is a great
place to explain those concepts of how
this infrastructure allows you to take
open source from all over the world and
build out yeah I think I remember
reading one of your comments sort of us
maybe a part of your description was you
know leverage open source and then you
then you create your secrets or yeah so
I mean I love that
so maybe the metaphor or analogy brings
it to life if I explain what hands-on
data does sure um
so essentially hands and data creates a
new type of database okay and databases
haven't changed for 3540 years
Austan they're built on the relational
model you need a fix schema if you want
to change the schema there's lots of
application codes needs needs to change
people have tried to make that easier
with migrations we think like Ruby on
Rails and so on and so forth but Amazon
is about leveraging open source to
create a database where there's a
completely different emphasis placed on
the structure of the data and the
emphasis is around the database having
an understanding of the contents it's
storing so an anthem database will
understand the natural clusters of
information that occurs in the database
okay and it will in addition to
understanding the clusters it will fit
the documents and records in that
database to the closest cluster and it
will also understand how each document
and record usually relating to a person
differs from the average inside the
cluster this is important because that
difference represents the essence of an
individual and by us separating out the
cluster information from the essence and
we separate that out inside the database
and push it down to disk and persist in
different geographies and by doing that
we make the data incredibly safe
because you need the two elements of
data to come together to understand the
data itself looking at either element in
isolation would be meaningless and so
anzan has used this this this incredibly
powerful cloud that lets us script an
elastic environment which forms our
database and we've used this technology
to distribute data to different
geographies for the sole purpose of
protecting the privacy of the
information so we believe that you can
nobody's got a solution in the industry
which nobody's got a solution in the
industry around security and protection
of data that is significantly different
to what has been practiced over the last
ten to fifteen years everybody tells us
we just need to do what is there better
build bigger walls mm-hmm
stronger encryption better protocols in
terms of human interaction machines and
dated lenses but ultimately all of those
things fail introducing a technology
like this into addition in addition to
those things means that data has yet
another line of defense but a very
significant line of defense great well
it's a very fascinating subject Gary
thank you so much for coming and sharing
with us just that kind of curious I have
on a lighter note do you ever go back to
Manchester yes yes I'll be there we have
two necks actually I heard they got some
great food is called the curry mile
where the University of Lyon that's been
done so sometimes sometimes there yeah I
think it goes out a lot more since the
time I left but yeah yeah perhaps we can
meet up sometime next editor yeah enjoy
a curry a week today perhaps thank you
so much for coming Gary and thanks so
much for joining us here that article
day of life and stay tuned for some more
sessions because we're not done so thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
