here at Oracle code Los Angeles when a
beautiful day here I have a my smiling
colleague right behind the camera out of
frame Laura and we have as our guest
today Venkatasubramanian was a kind of
close close enough Venkat welcome thank
you for giving an annex really exciting
keynote you covered a lot of ground and
I still I was just researching you up a
little bit I think you shared something
which I released struck me I mean there
was just so many principles you shared
about quality of code simplicity but one
of the things that I just thought was a
very profound of the things that you
shared was the quality of code is
inversely proportional to the effort it
takes to understand it I thought that
was quite a phenomenal kind of thing so
maybe just kind of just start off with
that or maybe if we just just let's just
back up a little bit the concepts of a
sounds common sense but and as you
alluded to in your presentation it's so
hard to do why is why is doing things
unfortunately though when when we want
there to you know kind of phase us to
how we solve problems one is to come up
with these bright ideas and these bright
ideas
linearly he not be thinking step by step
that's not how we come up with ideas we
throw random things together and out
comes the idea we are in that mode a lot
of times but unfortunately though when
it comes to solving problems after we
innovated when we come it comes to
implementing it we have to switch gears
and start thinking about things a little
bit more thoroughly sequentially
linearly I don't know what phrases to
use for that but the idea really is you
have to approach things a bit more
logically at that point because we are
so smart as humans because we think like
that we miss out on a lot of details
sorry so you were saying people do not
think linearly there's I guess the human
mind isn't something that just goes even
though I guess we we kind of think we're
logical people but we're not is that
kind of the case as well we want to find
answers very quickly we want to be able
to get things you know out of our mind
and find solutions and sometimes for
making things we have to step back and
ask the question what are we going to
solve and why can't we approach this in
a slightly different way to solve this
problem so we need to really work in
these two different modes we cannot just
have one and not the other we have to
quickly but we also have to step back
and say hey let's remove all this
unnecessary complexity we are brought in
by methodically approaching the problem
and removing stuff that is irrelevant
that has to happen as well so we got to
work in two different modes and and
that's not always easy for us to
consciously switch from one mode
see you're a consultant and you talked
about some of your experiences of going
and looking at code and everything can
you is that it's some kind of like a
universal standard about quality of code
or are there some kind of standards out
there because again I'm not a coder but
it can you allude and think to that as
an example there are cyclomatic
complexity of code where the cyclomatic
complexity is looking at a piece of code
you look at the number of decision
points in the code and the more the
number of decision points the more the
number of nesting is a sign of more
complexity in a piece of code there's
also tools to look at the you know
effectiveness of variables and there are
tools to verify if a particular variable
potentially is defined in a way it goes
through uncontrolled durability that can
result in bugs and errors so there are
quite a number of tools available to
look for these things while these tools
are definitely we have to know that
there is a limit to how much we can rely
upon exclusively these tools alone we
also have the human element to really
look at the code and say do I understand
this code so to me a lot of times if I
look at a piece of code is the code
drawing me in or is it pushing me away
as an example the way we structure a
piece of code you know cyclomatic
complexity will not tell you much about
how the code is structured at a certain
level when you have enough spaces in the
code when you have grouped the code into
cohesive parts it becomes easy for a
human to understand so they can get an
idea about how the code is organized and
then they can begin to separate in their
mind and focus on different areas so
there are several aspects to quality
some of them
do a fairly good job some of them
there's still a human element attached
to it do see if this makes actually good
I mean there were a lot of funny moments
in your presentation and I think one of
them was when you shared a piece of code
which said god help me I have no idea
what this means
you want to allude on that one we were
just brought up a screen as I was just
watching and he had brought up file he
didn't mean to at the time he switched
over immediately and I said could you
please go back to that file for a minute
and it did this was code checked in in
production and the check in date has
been a few years ago and when I looked
at that code it had a bunch of variables
which are completely you know non
sensible with a little comment below and
saying God helped me and have no clue
what this means you know you know
honesty this is a code maintained by
very educated people these are people
who hold very high degrees in their
profession one license for this product
can be as close to a million dollars
Wow it's a very very intense engineering
application if you make a mistake in
some of these things the result could be
a problem in the in the world because of
the things that they simulate and and
you know monitor and when I saw this I
said do you mind if I take a photo and
they said yeah I take a photo but don't
ever tell whom you got this from and I
was pretty shocked that somebody had
left a message saying I don't have a
clue all I'm looking at and these are
people who should maintain the code
every day not that that doesn't happen
but for somebody to take the time to
actually leave that comment in there to
express their opinion a lot of times we
just don't say it so aloud or put it in
the code saying I'm sorry I'm completely
lost in this code you strike me as
someone who's obviously I think you're a
PhD in very scientific we also sound
like a very spiritual
person and I'm just kind of curious do
you ever think about just like people
talk about world peace is there a world
where all code is but free is where a
code behaves different from what we
intended humans to express in an
unambiguous way whatever intentions ours
we speak languages like English we are
not very precise in what we say we try
to be precise but it's very difficult to
be precise in what we say the
interpretation of what we say has
consequences that's why we have an
entire body of government which deals
with how the law is interpreted for
example so so when it comes to writing
code it's very similar to that our frame
of thinking may be in a certain you know
circle of reference but a codes behavior
may be a little different when that
frame of reference changes I don't
believe we can ever write code that is
bug free we can only try to make sure
that those bugs we identify don't repeat
themselves
well blanket on that note thank you so
much for coming and sharing and here's
to world peace pleasure pleasure done to
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
