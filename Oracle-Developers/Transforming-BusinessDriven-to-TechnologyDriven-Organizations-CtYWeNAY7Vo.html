business driven to technology of an
organization hoping you're having fun so
far it's been a great event I'm davinder
Kohli I'm the manager of application
development and I lead the cloud
practice at st a group in Chicago I
spent about 20 years in the industry and
I've worn many hats I've been very
fortunate to be part of many business
transformations and led a lot of solar
projects usually very large integration
projects and I've also had the privilege
of being as having served as an advisor
to ctoc iOS and been part of multiple EA
teams so there are two motivations for
me today for presenting this topic the
first one is I want to bring awareness
of the practices that we have within our
organization and often unknowingly and
sometimes that's the way things are done
in their organization we have accepted
them but they don't have to be that way
secondly the technical landscape has
changed with greater adoption of iot
cloud mobile and big data so now
organization can start thinking of
providing value add to the customers by
leveraging these technologies so we need
to start thinking when you start
elevating over thought process transform
overthinking and influence others and
then make a change in the organization
so we're not going to unveil anything
earth-shattering today but we certainly
hope to induce a new thought process
here invigorate your thinking and so you
can take it back to the organization and
make a change and reap the rewards so
before I go further I would like to
introduce my colleague and friend
whatever I did you go ahead hi I'm Dave
Greenfield i'm a senior architect for
the STA group i work with the vendor I
too have 20 years + years experience
with software development I've been
through several architectural
transformations so it's great to be here
thanks for coming all right thank you
David so with that I would also like to
present a disclaimer this presentation
is subjective it's based on over
combined 40 years of experience in the
industry across
multiple organizations so the transform
the title is again transform a business
driven to technology driven are there
any business people in the audience oh
okay all right but if you didn't raise
your hand or if there were I was going
to assure them this is not about
eliminating their role alright alright
so this the way that we've structured
this presentation is that we are i'm
going to talk about organization
transformation since we're on the agile
track and my friend David is going to
talk about how to manage transition of
your company's technical platform so
this is our agenda for the day will
define characteristics of business and
technology driven organization we'll
talk about what it takes to transform to
transition from business driven to
technology driven we've got two case
studies based on our experiences and
lastly but most importantly how do we
leverage new technologies and the new
technical landscape so before I get
start getting into these topics I like
to narrate to your story how many people
are from San Francisco area okay have
you seen the winchester house so in case
all right yes so i want to talk i take a
minute and talk about the winchester
house story so back in the 1800's Sarah
Winchester was married to a affluent
person was really famous after his the
guns that he sold or he manufactured by
name Billy Manchester Sarah lost her
husband and her daughter to some kind of
a disease and needless to say she was
grease truck so she sought help rom
spiritualists she was made to believe
that she and her her fortune were
haunted by these ghosts and would even
caused the death of her husband and her
daughter she was and it is going it was
going to be her turn next so she was
advised by the Spiritualist to move to
the west coast and construct this house
to confuse these spirits she was also
told that as long as she would keep the
construction going
the spirits are not going to haunt her
so as a result of this all of this she
moved here the house is a seven-story
mention it's got staircase staircases
which lead up to the ceiling their
staircases which descend 11 steps and
then rise seven steps their windows in
the house which do not open to anywhere
and there are back to back doors there
are Libyrinth of hallways and rooms
designed to confuse the ghosts so I
think you get the picture ID so I think
we we think this sort of thing happens
in our organizations as well we often
build a platform of have services or
processes that service no purpose and
have existed for many years so when you
ask the technology or business teams on
their approach and certain things we
often get the response this is the way
we always done it and my response to
them is well just because you've done it
certain way doesn't mean it's the right
way right so we need to be willing to
open to ideas and make changes for the
better
alright so so what do we mean by
business driven organizations these are
organizations where technology takes the
backseat such organization organizations
will build product and services based on
proven demand their approach is very
reactionary nature for example when
there's an increase in user volume the
organization will increase the capacity
by moving to the cloud or purchasing new
hardware the organization will only
react you know sometimes only react when
its competitor is providing a particular
feature so an example would be if they
were wanted to enter in a new market
segment they'll go and buy or customize
the product or they'll engage a
consulting company to build the new
feature set and we certainly hope that
we are one of them we're confronting
company also in Chicago and if nothing
else they'll go out and merge with the
with the competitor so based on the
situation those might be good options
the business team defines the goals and
the roadmap of delivery after their
technology counterparts are not involved
in independent strategy business will
inform the technology division of their
goals and ask them to deliver and since
technology is not involved the in the
decision-making the platform may not be
ready to support the new requirements
and they often will fail to meet the
requirements so at that point and
business will start looking at other
alternatives for making the delivery so
in this type of organization the the
process is more waterfall like the
business will team will gather all the
requirements still define all the
requirements spend enormous time up in
doing so and then hand it over to the
architecture team the architecture team
will then define the complete
architecture handed over to the
development team the development team is
going to do their job and then give it
to the testing team right and who knows
when they're going to be done and then
suddenly business is going to come along
and say well did you acquire has changed
and the whole cycle repeats again
so I don't know if this sounds familiar
to any one of you guys the organizations
are very siloed the overall business
goals are decomposed as represented in
the diagram there are decomposed into
multiple other silos which is fine and
those sub goals are then decomposed into
further decomposed across multiple or
scatter you know across the technology
division one part of the technology
division tries to fill fill a goal of
the safe financial department the other
one is trying to fulfill the goal of the
HR department and there's no
communication between the technology
team or the business teams and what will
happen is they'll result in producing
products which are using disparate
technologies or they'll produce
duplicate functionality or the end
they'll have complete different
architectures so we often find the
technology team will wait for business
decisions before they can take any
action this is because the organization
is working in a reactionary mode so when
ya if say for example if business is
trying to improve the you know trying to
improve the customer experience the
technology team was not will sit back
because they don't know what what the
goals are and since they are not on the
forefront they'll they're not going to
export opportunities tricks you know see
what tools are available in the market
to explore improve the customer
experience and none of this is
intentional right so this is because the
tick is not because the technology is
not interested or the business would not
like to leverage latest technologies
that's the way the things are done
alright so let's talk about technology
driven business partnership so this is
not technology driven it's a
technology-driven business partnership
it's it's a partnership so in this case
the partnership will define the goals
the partnership will define i will put
the technology in the front seat and
they'll work on a integrated roadmap not
a road map but an integrated roadmap so
roadmap is something or they'll say here
the business features that we are going
to release every so often it and you
know but in a integrated roadmap you
will you'll have proper alignment
between the feature set they're
delivering and the technical components
which have to be delivered to support
those platform the process is very agile
like the delivery is done in increments
so not all requirements are going to be
defined up front and we have seen that
you know in a partnership mode their
strengths weaknesses vulnerabilities and
you know priorities are well understood
and next thing is that there are also
will try to get client feedback so
before they go out and buy a new piece
of hardware or as technology deliver you
know a complete web application the
organization is going to start building
prototypes and they'll build just you I
pages using HTML something without the
backend system because you want to know
what the client feedback is because
everyone is integrated with the roadmap
you know everyone is plugged into the
business goals they know what the
integrated road map looks like the
mindset of such an organization is to be
is very innovative the lookout for
opportunities for improvement wooden and
outside the organization so the start
looking at technology not only to
improve customer experience but they'll
work with business to come up with ways
to maybe improve the speed of the
application right opera has move
time-consuming and number crunching
application to the cloud
so everyone's goals are reflected on
that integrated road map and there's
complete visibility into what the
organization as a whole is doing there's
no one division of technology serving it
goes off business there is always a
communication there they want to build
common functionality or the look odd for
this opportunities so we call this the
Holy Greenfield quadrant this is where
we think the organizations need to be I
think we we think if using technical
innovation you can be in that in that
quadrant you can exceed customer
expectations how many of you have used
the phrase that we have exceeded
customer expectations all right so one
thing I've noted is that when the
requirements are well defined the
quality is in place and we deliver on
time what is really there to exceed I
think I think we're cheating a result so
you know when we don't put out you know
because we don't put things out on
quality stuff out there or deliver on
time and sell them when we do we just
simply pat ourselves on the back and say
we exceeded customer expectations so I
think you we need to use more technical
innovation to exceed customer
expectations so for example a customer
is trying to build a web application
will deliver it in increments and will
you know and and the customer will come
around and say you know what we also
need a mobile channel as the technology
because the technology team was in the
forefront or was in the front seat with
the business they were proactively
looking at what the market trend is
where the word the customer is going
they can predict so they'll start you
know designing their tag libraries which
are portable to those do you know which
can adopt to those needs and they'll
start you know building aa dress
ap is to expose those data points you
know that can be that can be used by the
mobile application so we need to balance
a technical innovation and market
expectation not always can we be very
innovative but we should strive for
doing that next is that we need to
foster bolder and out-of-the-box
thinking for those who do that we should
reward them we shouldn't be killing
innovation by keeping the technology in
the back seat so let's take an example
of the auto industry if you want to let
the user know and which is commonly done
and on it on the dashboard that you
would show them the oil level in the car
and business can come back come back and
say you know we want to fancier way of
doing things they'll they might make an
announcement that hey you know what or
send you an email instead of doing that
if technology is in the front seat using
cloud technologies and IOT you can put
put put in predictive analytics and say
you know what we've been monitoring your
oil level and we see it steadily coming
down so let's let's you know they can
advise the customer up front saying you
know eventually you're all signal is
going to come down or it will come up so
why don't you take this car to the
dealership so this is what we call as
being innovative and out-of-the-box
thinking up next is we need to have
early client we need to keep our clients
engaged throughout the delivery process
provide them complete transparency get
their feedback this way we'll keep it
client happy and we're not going to
waste millions of dollars you know in
developing some piece of work which is
going to collect dust later so based on
on the graph here we often see it I can
see from this angle but I see the dots
here not often we are in that third
quadrant where we are low on technical
innovations and we certainly not meeting
customer expectations so we need to
drive ourselves using technical
innovation to
you know exceed the gut market
expectations so dave and i both work
chicago downtown and we are surrounded
by skyscrapers so from the organization
and process transformation perspective
while preparing for this presentation we
were thinking of an analogy which will
drive the point home so what if we were
building a city a brand new city what
would be some of the considerations so
we came up with services governance as
FedEx quality and timeline and there
could be more things so think about if
each building in the city had its own
water supplier cable provider
electricity provider or what do you
think there should be shared services
and now think about your organization
are you leveraging common services or
are you building heterogeneous
environments think about if each
building has its own inspection process
war would be the state of that city and
now think about your organization does
yours you know organization have gates
in place to achieve consistency think
about the aesthetics it you know having
different look and feel on each building
makes the city very attractive but not
software applications right so having
clear goals integrated roadmap and a
partnership between business and
technology will help you understand you
know that the products that need to be
delivered in the market and you'll start
making building out common frameworks
and share information so think about if
you're if each building had its own way
of setting a quality standards all right
and now what is what is your
organization doing is it D and how are
enforcing those quality standards so
we're not certainly not going to exceed
market expectations you know if we don't
put on quality stuff that's a
foundational thing and David's going to
talk a little bit more about that now
last you think about the timeline we've
got multiple suppliers were supplying
different things to the to the buildings
and what if there was not proper
coordination and
between the suppliers so work and so
from our experience we've seen working
on large sewer projects that there is we
have the best project glance we have you
know really talented project managers
but we've seen only misalignment of
silos it's because you know silos are
not communicating one sellers is not
ready with their visible or another silo
is delivering for another release and
because not everyone is polarized
towards a common goal so certainly
they're not communicating to an
integrated roadmap all right so now that
we have you know we are transitioning to
a technology-driven business or
partnership let's define the goals of
that organization so goal number one is
improving customer experience not that
when you were business driven you are
not customer centric you were but we
were certainly not thinking out of the
box right we were being reactionaries
not visionaries because technology took
the backseat so there was we just
technology him completely took you know
directions from the business team and
then they provided solutions based on
those needs then also focus on quality
as we said before and provide everyone
within the organization and outside of
your organization complete transparency
there's there should not be anything to
hide and this is how are you going to
earn the cursed trust with your within
the organization and outside of your
organization also second goal is to
simplify simplify your internal
processes don't have processes that were
you know on your employees feel that you
yet they have to work through companies
rigmarole right keep keep them simple
simplify the layers off software we
talked about that when two business
teams are asking to technology teams to
communicate there is no you know that
sorry they're delivering projects for
two different business silos there's no
communication and it results in
duplication so keep it keep your
software simple also
so and now that we are in the
partnership mode eliminate redundant
tears all right so when they should
comes up we all know who to go to don't
get up get caught up and having the
director the problem happens somebody
reaches out to director the director
reaches out to the manager and then
manager reaches out to the developer you
know we all and we are all have to work
as an atomic unit I mean include your
product owners in that also next is
collaboration hopefully they didn't
require much explanation when we've seen
that you know an organization where
there are common goals and we have set
expectations from each other everyone
has got visibility into the roadmap you
know I think we work with as a
well-oiled machine sorry next one is
measure so the proof is in the pudding
right so when you get into partnership
mode you need to measure the deviations
from your goals put in retrospect is
where you have business technology and
clients participating in those
retrospectives just like how technology
teams have to put out quality dashboards
sonar dashboards and David's going to
talk about more about that business
needs to put out same dashboards with
client feedback so technology team knows
what will house the client using this
thing right so if they need to make a
change of the architecture they can do
that because now there's incremental
delivery so now that we have an idea of
the characteristics of a technology
driven organization the business
partnership the motivation and the goals
we need to build a foundation so we've
seen great ideas fail due to the lack of
leadership and stakeholder buy-in and
this is your first step pair up your
technology and business teams literally
have been an organization where these
two entities exist and
buildings so when you start building
core teams of business and technology
architects form a team of key players
from from both both sides who can guide
through the transformation and can
define the roadmap the integrated
roadmap alright so when goals are clear
processes are simple to follow quick
client feedback feedback is received and
we're an organization where
out-of-the-box thinking is encouraged
everyone is automatically plugged in at
all times there is no confusion all
right so when you go through the
transformation you will need to change
the way that you solve problems change
the organization's way of thinking and
doing things so you need to change
existing processes and we've talked
about how problems are solved in a
partnership mode now let's talk about
what a transformed organization and
process looks like so we just talked
about having a core team of business and
technical architects they also must need
to have a representation in your
steering committee or your leadership
committee the organization must have a
must articulate this vision in a very
clear manner which is a great upon by
all stakeholders and it can be measured
next we need to have a lean organization
as we said you know there should
eliminate all the layers of management
business or technical who have redundant
roles I'm sure you've been in situations
where you have been asked for the same
status by multiple project managers or
political managers and as is that we
think is very counterproductive everyone
must have clear set of responsibilities
and above all eliminate the bearers of
information sharing everyone in the
organization is Intel the information
except for non-public information you
don't to share that but we talked about
transparency keep it open keep it clear
let your client know that what the
progress and and and tell them what the
decision-making is don't keep anybody in
in the back seat so hopefully by now you
have embraced the concept of business
technology partnership now let's see how
a transform process looks like so the
partnership will create strategy goals
and build solutions no one works in a
vacuum the partnership will monitor its
course of direction and will find
opportunities for self-improvement and
above all the communicate and just on
communication more effective
communication so here's the case study
of a organization where I worked this
organization was delivering a very large
scale integration project the delivery
was done in four phases and I joined
them at the end of the first phase so
some of the goals of this organization
was were to change the business process
to add new customers leader ma well you
know a few among many so they want to
change the business process to our new
customers they wanted to add a new
online features and they were they
wanted to reduce system downtime because
of lot of used when there was increase
in the user volume so let's see what the
organization did when they did not have
the partnership with technology so since
a new business process was being
introduced the business performed impact
analysis without involving technology
there was no they did the impact
analysis on the existing business
processes but no attention was paid to
the impact to the technical platform
there was no exacerbate of the existing
assets can they even can they even the
business class the technology platform
even support new business processes
there was no understanding of the
technical lancet landscape and the
organization was a Java shop and the
business team went and bought a dotnet
application which would support a new
features and as you can imagine there
what a lot of integration challenges the
delivery cycle was long and they had a
big release to with the large number of
features and also they bought additional
hardware maybe I didn't put that over
here but the body additional hardware to
meet the chain at the support large
number of you know user group users and
to reduce the downtime now let's look at
what things were done in a partnership
mode there was collaborative impact
analysis so both the technology team and
the business team perform impact
analysis on the business process that
are going to change and the technical
platform which is going to change also
so and instead of buying new application
we went and modified it should say not
web pages but web application we enhance
the web application to provide a new
feature set we even went ahead and added
a mobile channel because we were in the
front seat the delivery cycle was short
we are we added features incrementally
and we got client feedback after every
delivery and to support new features and
to reduce reduce downtime we leveraged
virtualization and we start
decommissioning or older services so as
you can see there was a significant
difference in the two approaches here so
messages that we want organizations to
be more entrepreneurial and innovative
it's about having the right attitude and
with that you can make a change so now
I'm going to add it over to David who is
going to talk about stating technology
through transition and how to leverage
the new technical landscape so how's
your organization going to provide the
innovation that you're selling to your
partner we've sold our capabilities as
innovators now we kind of have to create
that transformation to back it up so
when going through transition there's a
few things that you have to make sure
you have to take care of we can't really
draw the roadmap for you
we don't know where you're starting and
where your goals are but here's a few
things to just make sure that you take
care of understand your vulnerabilities
as they align with your business
priorities what that really means is
just understand the bread and butter of
your organization if you're going
through a transition you don't want your
your business to go down right so
understand during that transition what
needs to be shored up to make sure that
your high priorities continue so
continuity we don't want any of those
under construction signs that we saw in
the 90s on websites so make sure you do
that also analyze your your
vulnerabilities it's a good time to take
stock you know if you stretch a piece of
rubber out and it snaps that point where
it snaps that's the weak point
understand that and make sure that
that's going to survive the transition
as you transition your technology so
usually that costs money and what I have
to tell you is that it's going to cost
money there's no way basically you have
to invest in redundancy you either have
to cut initiatives you have to budget
for it somehow but during a transition
don't just invest in the target state
invest in the transition itself so
adoption choose your platform choose
your technology wisely so this requires
an understanding of your staff the
market and the business objectives I
assume you've laid out your business
plans with your partners and you know
your technical requirements so what I'm
talking about is a platform that's going
to be used by an army of developers
developers here okay awesome me too it
might sound a little bit like the tail
wagging the dog but don't ignore the
point how many people have worked in an
organization where they don't feel like
they're using the right
we'll set maybe they're using a tool set
that wasn't widely adopted in the
marketplace and it's hard to get
information on it or documentation I'm
one of those people so when choosing
technology keep in mind that it has to
be rolled out to an organization so I've
seen products chosen for very specific
reasons and you know not not bad you
know analysis necessarily but they you
know they they support a very specific
goal but certain other things get
ignored so I guess just the short of it
is make sure that you understand it has
to get rolled out to masses of
developers I've also seen a gap between
the technology platform and the staffs
capabilities understand that when you
roll technology out there's a potential
for misuse either because of lack of
technical skills or different technical
skills or because there's just different
approaches to common problems so this is
where as you roll technology out you
want to make customizations enhancements
you want to try to provide standard
solutions to common problems usually
companies have in-house customizations
as an example security and entitlements
a lot of companies have that they want
everyone doing it the same way and it
makes sense it's supportable build
technology communication channels bill
good wiki's for technology for
architecture message boards document
stores if you can have tech writers
write your wiki oftentimes you have
developers write the wiki and it doesn't
quite translate to everyone else so I'm
one of those people so I understand also
organized for communication so this
probably doesn't really mean much to you
so I'm going to explain a little bit
about what I mean so what I'm talking
about mostly is making sure the
developers and the IT
professionals know how to use the
platform and understand its goals you
may have a core group of Architects
they've built out customizations they've
architected and designed the
architecture the technology that
everyone's going to use and then you
have an entire army of developers down
there and as good as that Ricky is
there's going to be gaps so you can
organizationally prepare for that by
doing something like maybe having a
triage group or decentralising some of
your architects have filled architects
these are the people who can guide the
design and development of systems using
the architecture they can help govern
you can have them also fix small
problems do triage and as well the
communication goes backwards too so you
can suggest you can suggest improvements
to the to the platform you don't want
your your core architecture team to be
like an ivory tower and you certainly
don't want them to be a call center
either so usually the first step is
everyone starts contacting core and
asking them how to use things that they
hadn't actually thought about and the
next step is they publish rules and how
to engage core the real solution is
figuring out how to get the information
to everyone so this kind of blends in
with the next bullet point change
management I'd first like to clear if
i'm not talking about deploying
applications i'm talking about
architectural change management so as
you make changes to your architecture
review re-review iteratively make sure
you include the right people to the
party shouldn't be in an auditorium like
this but it shouldn't be two guys
sitting at their cube thinking hey it'd
be cool if we got this technology in
here and they just so happen to be on
the core architecture team so it happens
lastly capacity so there's a little
overlap with something I've talked about
before and that's investing in Tran
zishan so use you know use proven
scientific projection techniques to
project your usage and volume that's you
know a lot of well known techniques for
doing that you can for the foreseeable
future have the hardware necessary for
that but also analyze your human
resources there's capacity there so if
you're in an organization where people
are at a hundred percent capacity or a
hundred and ten percent capacity you
start adding a transition there and
suddenly you're faced with the prospect
of communicating to everyone that
they're now going to be at one hundred
and forty percent capacity usually they
don't use those words now but so I to
have want Mia I to have a little case
study it's an aggregation of my my
experiences so this is not one company
but several experiences basically it's
an enterprise that wanted to reduce
system complexity reduced their tech
portfolio and address emerging business
concerns so before they had a
heterogeneous tech portfolio all sorts
of technologies java.net etc all sorts
of vendors all sorts of adapters they
had data duplication they had disparate
data stores they tight coupling of
disparate systems if you held up a
diagram of their data flows and looked
like a bowl of spaghetti it was a really
not understandable additionally they had
long development cycles with big bang
releases which they were concerned about
as far as a causing risk to their
business as usual so let's look at the
right side which is the after so they
created a unified platform so that that
helped reduce the heterogeneous
portfolio however one of the things they
did was that they created a platform it
was proprietary
so they created the need to to educate
everyone and they needed training for
that and people couldn't go out on the
internet and start looking for answers
to some of the problems so they made
that need for a strong wiki and that
whole organizational structure to
support communication it became critical
so not impossible but they did overcome
it by having a top-notch wiki it could
have been smoother one thing they did
which was interesting was that they all
the source code in the organization was
open to search so anyone could search
for common solutions to the problems
that they're facing so then people can
reach out to each other and collaborate
so that was kind of a good thing that
they did they adopted a distributed data
store so a low latency no sequel
database with low latency replication I
should say so different systems could
access nodes on the datastore and they
won't interpet impact each other it was
an object oriented database so they can
extend it and again not impact anyone
the cons were that it was an object
oriented database and the entire
organization was based on was used to
using relational databases so you can
provide all the how to's in terms of
using the object oriented database but
what everyone needed really was to learn
how to design based on an object
oriented database and that design starts
not only from the database design and
your modeling but it goes through your
application designed to no sequel isn't
a peg that fits every hole by the way so
the last thing they tried to do is adopt
a jold development cycle this one really
didn't work well they actually want to
empower their developers to make
production changes they were following
along am
signs a statistic of you know making a
change to project to production every
eleven point six seconds so that didn't
work well you know you really can't have
your developers doing that and the
company had gating procedures in place
those didn't go away the architecture
team didn't have the authority to
override those so basically they had to
really scale back on that and that's
okay you know things don't work the
problem was that they never really
introduced an alternative so you know
what my thought what to contribute to
that is you know start adopting the
DevOps procedures continuous integration
automated integration tests involve your
third-party testers in that stage and
then of course automated dabaa deploy as
well as rollback scripts make sure that
that's done exercise during the
development life cycle you can reduce a
lot of the overhead of a release okay so
next I want to talk a little bit about
some of the good things that we've done
as a here can you
we've learned to use clickers anyway
some of the good things that we've done
as a technology organization and as you
as I go through this think about the
technology business partnership okay so
think about how some of these things can
actually benefit them so one of the
things that our industry all of us in
this room are good at is introspection
and self-improvement so we can we can
monitor the situation we can monitor
ourselves we can take an honest look at
what we're doing and improve it so the
analogy is if the tin man from the
wizard of oz noticed that it was cloudy
out he could have grabbed his oil can
oiled himself were gone to find shelter
as opposed to getting rusted so we're
good at avoiding those situations we
have automatic project generation we're
really big on avoiding boilerplate code
so let someone else either do it for us
so so we don't have to you know be it
archetypes or templating and we enforce
standardization we have plugins that
will fail our builds if we don't meet
coding standards we have IDEs that do
some automated formatting as well as
provide tools and we have tools that
have test coverage checking so that we
have opportunities for streamlining as
well as the next topic quality control
we can also enforce our code coverage we
police our own functionality we have
continuous integration testing we have
quality dashboards right everyone have
that moving toward that No okay we've
adopted agile and the scrum process or
at least some flavor of that we
continuously measure velocity and
quality we retrospect frequently and we
improve ourselves we also instrument and
monitor our systems
so what I'd also like to do then is to
start mentioning some of the
technologies that have been introduced
in the last decade or so so these
technologies are transformative these
aren't technologies that are just making
things better so again I want you to
think about your organization and think
about that technology architecture and
business partnership and think as these
technologies emerged if your
organization was aligned like that how
you may have strategized and how you may
have may be introduced procedures and
changed the way your business worked
based on this so as we know the news out
this year is that the mobile usage has
surpassed desktop usage leading
companies like google amazon and twitter
as well as yahoo have been have made
mobile their central future their
central strategy to their future so if
you imagine your your technology
business partnership when mobile came
along if you imagine what that would
have been like perhaps you would have
seized the opportunity to innovate as
opposed to maybe waiting and seeing what
else happened in the marketplace thanks
big data so what ninety percent of the
data today is has been generated in two
years or something like that there's
various statistics on that one of the
most revolutionary by products of
technology innovation this one in
particular speaks directly toward your
strategies as an organization this is
providing new answers to new questions
better answers to existing questions
this should feed directly into the
strategy of how your company is working
with all the management decision support
that can be provided with it
so I OT I think the best thing that can
happen after javaone when everyone goes
back to their organization the best
thing that can happen is that they take
what they've heard about IOT and there's
been a lot and they introduce that into
the strategy sessions they introduce it
into the central architecture and they
help try to influence the strategists
that the company the people in the
leading in the lead seat they're making
decisions about the direction help them
understand that this is going on so
that'd be one of the best things I think
that can happen after Java Juan and of
course the glue that holds it all
together is the cloud I don't have much
to add about that other than all of this
runs on the cloud so it's almost
necessary the only other thing I'll add
is that the crowd is really am also a
real good efficiency it's an example of
efficiency this is where this is where
you compare the way you used to do it
where you request a server to be built
involving project management involving
procurement all sorts of capacity
measurements are done as opposed to
clicking a button and spinning up a
server so what's next so we've gone
through some of the some of the
technologies what else is out there
here's just an example of any I don't
know if anyone's picked anything up new
this week that they thought might be
something that you know will be
introduced into their companies but
everything as a service you can have
human resources as a service these are
just a few of the things energy
management managing big data data like I
said ninety percent of its been
collected in the last two years I can
can't imagine what's going to happen in
the next two years so a lot of these
things are things that should be
considered again at the strategic level
okay so in summary then here are the
things that we really want you to take
away here are the important messages
that we feel we needed to come across we
want the partnership between technology
to result in innovation that's really
the goal of it let's be the innovators
let's not react to what everyone else is
doing let's be the innovators but we
want you to wear a helmet we want you to
do it safely we want you to go through
the process properly and make sure
you're taking care of the important
things so manage the transition well we
want you to succeed and last and
certainly not least we want you to have
an attitude that the partnership between
tuk and business is equal they both
contribute they're both accountable but
they also have an entrepreneurial spirit
as we said earlier think like a start-up
and that really concludes our
presentation first I'd like to thank you
and I think we have an opportunity to
answer questions and so if anyone has
any
that's what the organization
test
yeah so you I think what you're asking
is so finally set up these dashboards
with our quality and they just end up
being nobody looks at them right
architecture should be looking at those
first of all business should be looking
at those first of all and the goal of
the partnership again is that business
and technology own that they're all
responsible for that yeah that that's a
great question and it's really all of
that I mean that I do consider
architecture to be process organization
technology all of that
so the first thing okay okay I don't
want to hog the mic the first thing is
it's critical to get buy-in I've seen it
work really well when you get buy-in
I've seen it not work as well when you
don't have buy-in that that is a
critical part so if you have someone
that can I guess display you you want to
make a case right so you want to you
want to present a plan or paths that can
be taken to transform an organization
you want and make them specific thank
you yes and you want to make them
specific so down here you have
stakeholder buy-in you want to let them
know that there's it's going to be
measurable it's really about making the
case you have to have buy-in though
right so the key things are that first
of all your technology division has to
have you internally by an into this
thing that they want to be in the
forefront they want to be in taking the
front seat there's so much which has
happened in the last so many years they
have to be sold first that they that
that's the right way to go and then it's
all about education the partnership is
not going to happen without education
your CTOs or CIOs they have to be
presented with all this thought
processes hey this is this is actually
is what is happening in the industry and
those are the leaders of the
organization they have to start you know
interacting with their counterpart this
is not going to happen unless those
higher level you know sea levels
interact and endeavor transcend this
throughout the organization so the other
thing is to that oftentimes the sea
level people they aren't really aware of
some of the issues so haven't getting
time with them presenting the issues
that you've seen presenting the
solutions that you've been given how to
get a front door and your how to get
into the door in your organization it's
going to be different for all of you but
you're right that that's the key that's
the challenge that's the bottom part
here that's that's the really like the
that's why it's there I understand it's
not easy but you have to think about how
you can make a case what are the
problems you're running into what are
the costs I know one of the
organization's I once worked for any
time you want it to influence anything
there had to be a dollar value
associated with it so it's different
with with different organizations some
organizations hey we're losing employees
this is happening or we're losing money
because we have downtime this
is happening you know so it'll be
different for everyone I you know what
first of all I would like to kind of
rephrase that more like straightening
the ship or steering the course and
that's ongoing so depending on the size
of the transition you feel you need to
make it's going to take time I mean it
really well I don't know how many
transitions especially with the large
organization you can make in a short
period of time but again it's also about
steering it's about putting your
organization of in a position where this
becomes an iterative process as opposed
to a big project so the case study that
I had presented earlier we delivered
this in four phases and that was done
and across over a period of two years we
turn we start steering the boat or
turning the boat in the second phase and
it all stand for from having showing the
the CTU's and the cios what the cost was
and what sort of problem that we as to
David's point what sort of problems we
end up being when we didn't have the
partnership and you can see from that
case study there were sort of things
that the business had done that if
technology was had been in the forefront
they would never have done that and they
paid a price for that so it's it's you
need to put in those retrospectives and
put in this lessons learned all the time
an organization is well aware that
they're losing you know they're losing
to their competitors and you know those
are that those are the times where you
really need to stop up in you know offer
technology as as part of the solution
well thanks everyone
