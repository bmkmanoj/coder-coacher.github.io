DevOps cloud native microservices with
my sequel workshop lab 100 or will show
you how to work with and create an agile
project management framework for your
new sprint to begin we're going to go
out to cloud.oracle.com and click on the
sign-in button from there we'll select
our data center that we're going to
connect to and this may be either
provided by your instructor or the data
center assigned to you in your work or
trial account we're going to enter
identity domain and we're going to start
by logging in as cloud that admin now
once we're inside the page we're going
to pretend like we're assuming the
persona of Lisa Jones a project manager
and the first things you want to do is
show both the developer cloud service
and the application container cloud
service on her main dashboard next we're
going to get drill into the developer
cloud service click on the over open
service console button and create a new
project there's particular
we'll be to expand the alfalfa's product
catalog
so that it includes social media data
we're gonna leave our project empty to
start with choose markdown for our
markup language and click finish to
create our project it'll take a minute
or two for the project to spawn all the
necessary components but once it's up
and running you'll see a screen like
this we're on the left hand menu you can
begin creating the issues that you need
to accomplish in this particular project
we're gonna begin by creating several
issues that'll be later be routed to
Roland Bala and John Dunbar our first
issue will be to create initial git
repository for the Twitter feed service
we're gonna select the type of issue as
a task and so we don't have to log in
and out a bunch of times we're going to
set our owner to cloud that admin
we'll assign the number of story points
for this task and will create the issue
second issue on this particular project
this issue will be to create a filter on
the Twitter feed data and this time it's
not going to be a task but it's going to
be a new feature set our owner and
assign our story points
a third issue
our third issue will be to create a
micro service to allow the opening
expose the product cable catalog data
this will once again be a new feature
set our owner in our story points
you
our final issue of the day will be to
build the new user interface that
combines the social media data along
with our existing legacy product catalog
this will be a feature
assign to the cloud admin get our story
points and create the issue with our
court issues created we can now go out
and see all of them holistically that we
need to accomplish for this particular
project but more importantly we can
begin creating our new agile board on
the left-hand side of the screen we're
actually going to go into the agile tab
click on new board and this will be the
board to create our micro-services
and now we're going to begin by creating
a new sprint inside this agile board
we're gonna give it the total
story points we want to assign and then
begin dragging and dropping of the
backlog over the features we need to
accomplish inside of this sprint
you
with everything in place we can then
initialize or start or sprint
you
you
and now we're ready to begin development
a few things that Lisa will want to know
as she goes along is the ability to see
and monitor the features and tasks as
they move through the development
process which she can do on this screen
she'll also want to take a look at
various reports such as a burn down
chart
it'll showcase that number how long it
takes to accomplish each task as well as
a sprint report over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
