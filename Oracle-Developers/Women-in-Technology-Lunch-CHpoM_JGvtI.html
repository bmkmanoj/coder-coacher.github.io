to WI T women and technology I like to
thank you for the opportunity to take
the gear time in code day to come and
visit with us as we share about women
and technology I like to take a minute
to introduce myself as well as my
esteemed colleague I am Susan Jiang I'm
with Oracle University
and I'm a cloud team lead so I've been
working in the IT well for me it's and
I'm very honored and pleasure to also
share this panel with my friends so a
moment to introduce everybody hi
everybody so my name is Hayley helloooo
everybody knows me divine by the name
Hayley from Finland I'm a CEO for
miracle Finland which is the consulting
company in Finland of course I'm also an
ace director and I'm a PhD student and I
teach at the University of Helsinki so
had plenty of different jobs and and
positions hi my name is Mercedes B's I
am from Guatemala I am actually CTO in a
startup called productivity based in
Guatemala in addition I am Oracle
developer champion community leader of a
Jade which is chapter in Guatemala and I
Google community called EPS +50 - hello
my name is Karina I'm a serial
entrepreneur from Sweden I live in Palo
Alto right now I'm CEO of a company
called speed mint it's a tool for
speeding up database applications we
have a talk today after this session in
ballroom a and we have another talk
right after in ballroom via thank you so
an opportunity as not only workers and
people in the IT industry we all face
our challenges as as well as our
successes but there are times as women
in the technology we have some extra
challenges that others may not
we want to share with all of you what we
have encounter so I've always been asked
what drew me into the IT technology and
what kept me in it and for myself for me
it's a toy I know that sounds really say
but that's how I started so when I was
in school computer was a hot thing and I
thought it was a great thing that I have
the opportunity to make this computer do
something and it's called programming
which is perfect in this cold day and
three years as I work more with the
development and so I've been the
developer or the administrator or the
manager the lead of various projects I
found with each opportunity especially
with the IT industry it's always a
bleeding and the leading technology and
being in that leading technology has
always been fascinating to me so that's
what drew me into the IT well and what
kept me there so let's share with our
friends what kept what made them start
in the IT world and what kept them in
the IT world so they say curiosity
killed the cat
I hope it's not true because I'm here
out of curiosity I wanted to study
economics that sounded nice because I
always enjoyed math but then I ended up
being a math student and somebody told
me you should take computer science
because it's a good skill to have
because everybody should know computers
and I took computer science course I was
always the best in class I was thinking
this is gonna be so easy I took the
class I didn't understand anything in
the class I was just sitting there and
looking around and thinking do they
understand what the teacher is saying
because I have no idea what he's talking
about so I took the next course because
I was thinking it must be the teacher it
was a different teacher same experience
again sitting there like what on earth
is he talking about I had no idea I took
all the curse that courses that you can
take as a minor student and then I
decided okay I'm changing my major I
will be a computer science student
because there must be something I'm just
not getting I went to see the professor
said I want to change to computer
science and he was like you gotta be
kidding I said why you have very good in
math but you are no good in computer
science so why would you like to change
I said because of challenges I want to
have challenges and being honest
after the maybe two courses after that I
kind of got it I realized why I'm there
I really learned to love computer
science and as I said I'm doing my PhD
currently so I guess I love it a lot so
that's my story I never planned to be an
IT I'm just here and I love it
well when I was a kid I went to be two
things when I grow up the first one I
want to be a guitar is like Brian me I
don't know if you watch you know the Big
Bang Theory when Sheldon is small and
say that musicians are in drugs and
those things might not be isn't that she
said this is not an option but the
second thing is that I want to build
robots in NASA this was my dream in my
family for example or woman's or
secretaries or teachers and I say no I
will not be secretary I will not be
teacher I will be software engineer
because it's the most closest career in
Guatemala for build robots this is why I
choose study software engineering okay
for me in high school I was the only
girl among 150 students that choose to
be an engineer and I got a quest in half
a year ago why and I started to think I
always loved mathematics but I never
thought about dedication to be an
engineer and actually I realized it was
due to my father he encouraged me and
told me to do this and I trusted him at
that time and after I realized this I
actually had to call him and said thank
you for being that progressive
during the 80s and telling me to do this
because I never regretted it Thank You
excellent as we look at ourselves in
what we've done in the industry one of
the questions we've always asked is what
challenges and what risks have you taken
and and why so again I'll start with
myself when I look at this industry and
I look at the change in the technology
and that's what drew me to this there's
always something new there's always
something different and what's cool
about it now especially I'm working a
lot with the cloud services so think of
when I think back when I just started
with just programming in NC and
programming in Java it's so much more
now and but it's always what how would I
do it and most of the time because
you're in that new technology there's
always that for me that the reservation
should I pursued you know would I be
successful and I realize I won't know
until I take that step and take that
challenge that risk and never be afraid
I don't always succeed in what I do I'm
not happy when things don't work out but
never ever be afraid to take that step
and take that take that risk because you
will and can be one of those that will
develop and create something phenomenal
in this industry so I'm curious to know
what my friends went through so yeah I
agree it's learning about new things all
the time I enjoyed a lot this is the
first time I answer is this the biggest
risk I took was taking the position as a
CEO because that position made me kind
of other people think that means I'm not
a technical person anymore
so as a CEO you're not allowed to be
technical you're only sales person this
is only I'm don't mean anything bad
about this your sales person you are HR
person you are looking after the company
and the people but you're no longer
technical so I think that was the risk I
took because I still wanted to be a
technical and I've been doing that since
2000 and I still keep telling people I'm
technical person and I want to work in a
project so even though I am managing
things I also want to be very technical
and really do IT things because I
enjoyed so much so that was the biggest
risk I think about challenges one thing
that sometimes is a challenge to state
the right choose that happened to me I
was having a good career so I do job and
those things but one day I was receiving
a class that I came and said you know
why sometimes as more people or so
talent people never had successful is
that I don't know we do meet someone
that you say this is a waste of talking
what when he is not having successful
and he say is because these people can
do many things and they are trying to
make all those things at the same time
so I will put you in context I studied
to a music I am pianist I stood seven
years in the National Conservatory and I
was studying a bachelor degree in fine
arts with music a specialization in that
time I mean in that time is only six
hours for studying my piano program in
addition to that I had my other classes
for my bachelor degree and I was working
you know development so I need to make
my office hours you know the state don't
with my tasks and I was a in a Java
community group routing meetups and
things and I don't have time sometimes
is that for it sleep and when I listen
in that I'd say this is my sorry
why I am not having successful in
anything is because I am trying to make
everything at the same time so I set
myself
and I say I need to choose between one
of the both things in that when I liked
a lot play piano or it made everything
and I say in the track that I can have
more a projection not only in terms of
how many money I weigh weeks you know
what things I can do for my country I am
for active work country so this part of
crap social projection is really
important i say i will take technology
and i will say that this year i finally
i can attain java one and I meet really
good people at JavaOne and that bring me
to me by international speaker and now
our Oracle developer champion but that
was a really really hard to see so
instead now I take sometimes time for
sitting from front to the piano and play
something but not in the level that I
was making in that time so I just play
one or two hours but no need six hours
for take money so if just sometimes are
in one of these things that you need to
choose that about sit and analyze that
indeed when DISA you know that break my
heart you know I need this part of art
the next team challenge that I have is
that I was in a community and sometimes
that happened to us as we made is that
our work don't we serve their respect or
that I don't know how to say that but we
are not receiving that feedback that we
need so in that case this community I
was working really hard for the
community but my work never was
recognized recognition and other guy was
stalling this job this work for his own
benefit and in what moment I say I am
making good things here but this is not
enough if I am NOT receiving that's
recognition so for me take me six months
to decide that leave that community and
I will say that that was other point
when I my career personal career start
growing
because I was stopped - working hard for
others for me other good things so you
need instead if you are doing doing good
things you need to think in yourself and
say what I need and my work is important
- and I need receive this recognition so
this part of this card the decisions are
conducted our challenges and we really
need to take seriously that so don't
feel bad if someone said you are so
selfish for leaving us and don't make
that job because you are important so
how many of you are working for startups
here we have one I think that the
largest risk I took was when I left IBM
and decided to start a startup together
with my husband actually we had a
company during our masters when we went
to the university but after that we
thought you need to have a real work in
a real you need to have a family and a
real job but I realized that it's hard
especially for a woman to do a carrier
within a big company to take the risk
and start your own company and be able
to get everything you want back to
yourself that was important for me and
of course it was a risk I was home with
my second child and in Sweden we have
the benefit of being able to be home for
one year with full salary so it actually
after one month we started to discuss a
new company a new innovation and decided
to start this company and it was a huge
risk because we
it was both me and my husband and two
kids but I'm never regretted I have no
idea today what my carrier would have
been if I continued within a large
company but I guess that I would have I
have had a lot of fun during the time
that I wouldn't much access to your
startup okay and to all of yours
thank you one of the things that has
I've always been asked in the role I am
and I went through many roles with
Oracle Corporation started as a
developer went into consulting went into
as an instructor managing a team of
instructor and now a team lead one of
the things that's always been asked of
me and I wonder myself how did I grow in
this industry how did I seek to be
mentored and who do I look to to help
others and mentor others and I think
that's important not only in women in
technology that really colleagues in
technology how do we help each other
grow and one of the things that I've
been very fortunate and blessed is to
work with people very similar to my
colleagues here you know people who's
willing to take the risk
willing to take that challenge and say
how do I not only improve myself and my
career and in this industry but how can
i benefit others so I've always been
very fortunate that I've had manager
said he's very caring and very nurturing
and I always there's always that point
of a confirmation anything we do in life
we always want to have that not only
appreciation but that confirmation yes
you did well you know that a girl but I
remember one particular director and his
comment to me is always striving for
more you did well sue
thattagirl but you can
always do better and that always
encourages me to take that next step
that risk and that challenge and to
embrace it and to know that I will do my
best
sometimes I succeed and it came I turned
out to be very well and Sally other
times it didn't I'm sad with my not
success I don't want to say failure but
not success but I learn from that what
can I do better the next time and that's
what I've always looked to to help
others as well so now as a team lead one
of my charter and my mission is to help
my colleagues to help them grow not only
technically but professionally in this
industry so I'm curious to know what my
friends have done in terms of how they
were mentored and how they now pay
forward and mentor others if I had to
nominate one mentor in my career it
would be my father as Karina said I have
similar experience my father has been
always very supportive and I don't
remember one single time so I have a
brother as well I have I don't remember
one single time my father saying you
can't do it because you're a girl never
he always said of course you can do it
why wouldn't you do it when I started my
company is that of course you will start
it I've been waiting four years you do
that because I have similar story like
Karina said we started a company with my
husband and so on and now actually my
elder son I have two sons the elder son
is completely going to be 22 this year
and I think he is one of my biggest
mentors at the moment he has great new
ideas and he's kind of giving me ideas
and then putting me down when I have
stupid ideas so he's he's very good
mentor at the moment so it's not about
age or experience or anything it's about
willing to be a mentor to somebody else
I have been mentoring my University two
years ago we started at the computer
science the first time having a
mentorship program and students were
allowed to elect to mentors for those
people to be mentored and I was one of
those lucky to I have wonderful team
that I was mentoring and I'm so proud
and happy what happened with them so I
really believe in mentorship it's it's
an important factor in life in every
aspect of life because you need to be
encouraged and you need to be pushed
there was one of my group that didn't
want to find a job because he found
University such a nice place
uncomfortable I pushed him I said I push
you will fall down if you don't do
anything and he did and now he's working
in a wonderful company is enjoying so
much he said I didn't know you can do
this and get money for it he's a
programmer back-end programmer I was
like yeah I tried to explain you but you
wasn't listening because you were too
afraid so mentorship is very important
okay
my story is a little bit different and I
think that it's good because we not
always will have mentors in our life so
I am a rebel by the way so I always say
no I will not be secretary teacher or I
will study done or they say what you
will study a Bachelor degree or things
like that or you know the first time
that I travel outside to Guatemala do
one you will travel or things like that
so sometimes we will not found a mentor
we need to found our strongest inside us
for fight with the world and be this
first person making somethings in our
you know it's more cycle or people
around so I always there the rules I
made things so right now I don't have a
mentor that could we bring me but since
I start to be international speaker I
find a lot of people that support me
and I would say that I found out
people inside Oracle that is helping in
this new journey and this is one of the
reasons that I for example in sai hua
Ramallah like to go speaking
universities or I had started I tell us
chapter because I say if we don't have
these mentors in our culture we need to
be one or at less if we all know that
mentor we can have the capacity to
inspire others and say that it's
possible may the things in that if you
don't have someone there next to you
supporting you
so my story is a little bit different
about mentors but I am trying to make a
change in that so if you don't have
someone supporting you if they decide
your family is not the end of the world
you just need to found this strong
inside you that is there waiting for get
out when you have to start up you don't
have a manager and that sometimes good
and sometimes bad because you don't have
someone that can mentor you and then
it's even more important to find people
around you and you can find them like
you said doesn't need to be someone
older younger you need to work more
actively to find the mentors and I can
feel when you do when you will see you
for stuff that you're working so much
all the time that I would love to be a
mentor but sometimes you don't find the
time I think it's a good initiative but
Oracle now if we could gather a group of
women and try to take the time and see
if you we can
hello better excellent and agreed thank
you for the lead-in because we are and
we had this conversation amongst
ourselves as we grow up grow in this
industry look to you know your local
organization the conference's the the
places that you go to and and really
work in collaborating with each other
and we also as from Oracle we are
providing an opportunity not just at
these conferences but what others are at
others we have within our own
organization a women's leadership when
we want to grow that beyond our internal
corporation so as the phrase goes you
know watch out for things coming because
we want to really help grow not just the
IT industry but the women within the IT
industry so at this point you heard from
many of us from we're curious if anybody
would wish to share their success in the
IT world as well as what are the
challenges that you may have experienced
so if you wish to share - Linda has mic
that if you wish to share with everybody
any success how you what have you
experienced in your career in the IT
world that you've been very successful
and very similar to the the things that
we've gone through and share with us
what you've done
to be successful that I can learn from
okay and if you encounter any challenges
we'd like to hear the challenges so that
we can always come up with hey that's
something how would one go about to
address it and resolve it we have a shy
group okay so
I would when trying to hire someone most
of the applicants are men not women so
is there a way to know what you're
talking about I'm trying to hire people
too and it's very difficult to to find
women in a position so I think you have
question or answer to this question we
would love to have the answer I think we
should be there when they are in high
school or maybe even earlier to
encourage them to take this career
because what I have heard is that this
never happened to me so this is just
what I've heard is that girls are told
that they are not good in math and
science in general so stem is not for
girls that's I've been told but not to
me personally when I was in school I was
always told that stem is for everybody
but it must be because I'm from Finland
which is the different country for many
countries and I think Sweden is about
the same in my culture is really
different in that it is this case the
fact that you receive these little women
is that in the real world you have this
one of percent that just a little
woman's are studying a careers in
technology and it's because that so many
of them this is not for you it's like
that happen in my family right we miss
our teachers and secretaries
what the you one piece of
engineering is now
because I am the rebel of this public
body yeah for example in Guatemala I
started a community and we were trying
to change that and have cells say we
will don't found that in that woman's
tooth actuality but we need to change
this in the mentality of that future
woman's so we need to go to elementary
schools and high school for saying this
is a career for everyone this is so cool
and you can study that in Guatemala that
happens that sometimes in the schools
they have a we have limited resource and
they have limited spaces of computers
and sometimes we found to the teacher
made to the boys made an exercise in the
computer and the ladies are back
watching how they use the computers so
this mental it exists and is something
that we need to change in this case is
an invitation to all the women that are
here but we need to be role models and
we need to inspire the future
generations I don't know I will mention
again the big band theory because it is
got really good good examples for that
but one day she'll come with the boy
straight to went to a school for inspire
the ladies and they fail of course and I
try and they say something interesting
we discover something is that we cannot
aspire the future ladies and they call
the your friends and say we need that do
I speak with the ladies because you are
the one that can inspire their they can
show your example and this is something
but we need to do so it's possible that
you will cannot have a lot of women
since your company but take the ones
that came to you will be really positive
but we need to change the future
generation for these studies and make
different work I think that someone when
they speak here yeah you know I tell him
yes also be helpful to have an answer I
guess that when you have an ad for a new
position sometimes women they don't
reply to they believe that they need to
know everything for that position while
a man can think that he can learn
something from that position he thinks
that this is something that I don't know
today but I can learn so I think it's
important to understand how you ask for
that person to see this is we want this
personality that could learn this so you
don't meet the women afraid and the
aware of that when you have an interview
that they might answer the questions in
another way than a man in the same by
the same skill will do hi this is Stuart
analytics consulting company and we're
40 percent of our consultants are women
and
we actively go out looked and things
like LinkedIn we don't really take
applicants I guess you say right so I
think we act we actively sort of target
our hires I think most of our applicants
are also male but but you know maybe we
start there but we actually actively go
out and try to find our consultants
instead of you know waiting for them to
to post to a job thank you
give up
computer science because in the u.s. I
mean I guess you're not gonna find a ton
of them in the computer science degree
but a lot of them that are interested so
sort of like to your point like
recognizing that women will answer
questions differently but equally
okay
hi my name is Beverly and I thought she
wasn't a software engineer for 27 years
now and when I was
go into accounting and my biology
teachers that you're so good at math and
science is why not try computers back
then it was basic programming and I took
the chance and went into computer
engineering there's only three women and
the ottoman that were there and went on
to get my master's in computer science
thank you
I love you to share this and and I've
learned so much from my friends and my
colleagues I think one at a point that
was made is so important
I've been blessed with opportunities and
I look at my life not because I'm in the
IT role or I'm the female I am blessed
with opportunities that I had an
opportunity to work with people who
looked at me as a person and gave me
that a chance an opportunity and now as
a team lead and what I hope to share
with others when I have an opportunity
to pick a person on the projects that
I'm working on I I echo what my friends
have said I can't always teach you the
technology you think about it I can
teach you programming I can teach your
design or what I cannot teach you is
your enthusiasm this your innovation
it's your creativeness and that's what I
look for in a person so thank you for
your excellent question and when you're
looking at people it's the same thing I
see a person and I see a talented person
with an enormous amount of potential the
person who is eager to learn who's
willing to take risks not well of the
building but let's take some risk this
innovative and is willing to take that
next step because I can teach you the
syntax of the code but I cannot teach
you to be creative and that's what I
hope we all take away from the our time
together when we look at ourselves in
the IT industry not just women in the IT
world but in the IT industry
never ever
be afraid to take that next step never
ever be afraid to start a company and be
the next big thing
I hope our opportunities in our quest in
our pastoral cross where we see each
other in other conferences in other
gatherings where we can share with each
other not only how to grow in the IT
industry as women but as colleagues in
the IT world I want to thank you for
your time and it's ending this session I
hope you enjoy code day thank you for
your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
