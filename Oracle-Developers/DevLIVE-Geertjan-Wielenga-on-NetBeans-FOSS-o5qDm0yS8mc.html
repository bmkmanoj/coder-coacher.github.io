from the from the Oracle developer
community
and we are live in San Francisco at
Oracle OpenWorld and my guest here today
is an old friend that Girton willing go
hi
actually we actually met like 15 years
ago at you know Sun Microsystems it's
it's strange how long ago it was and how
short ago it feels I know I would just
you know flew by and I wanted to have a
conversation with you here today about
NetBeans right because NetBeans was the
very first open-source community I got
involved with that Sun right I guess it
was like 2000 2001 sure you know we got
some purchased NetBeans right yeah I
think that means you were there before I
was there oh really I started working
with NetBeans in 2004 for oh yeah
so your evo before I was up we should be
having so all these years later Oracle
obviously recently has announced that
your nipples will be moving over to
Apache right right and so you've been
working on NetBeans for all these years
and one capacity or another right and I
wanted to check in with you to see what
the status is has the project go right
how's the move over to Apache growing
well it's it this is a long version a
very long version and a very long
version ok well we have about 10 minutes
the short version is you know the
history of NetBeans is James Gosling and
Sun in general found this project being
demonstrated at the conference in about
around 97 98 when there were no IDE
Wow and there was no there was there was
no editor just before any other tool out
there and they acquired that group of
people in Prague who were creating this
and it was open source pretty much
immediately as this predated all other
network well this tool predated all the
other IDE definitely definitely
and so they acquired this group and from
the beginning the aim was to provide it
for free and open source to provide a
low threshold pathway into the jar
the ecosystem and that's how it
functioned in Sun and then there was the
and in the meantime we built up a
community around it because it was open
source enabling us to build an active
community of enthusiastic people
worldwide and the community of testers
of the netcat program that means
community acceptance testing program
around an amazing guy in Prague Yoshi
kovarsky from the Nippon steam and we
set up this NetBeans dream team so these
are independent people outside of Sun
outside of Oracle who are very
passionate about NetBeans and they go to
conferences and they talk about it and
things like that and I write articles
and so on and then he wants to take over
and the you know everyone's concerned
what does this mean from that means
oracle took over Sun and the NetBeans
was part of that acquisition right and
there was concerned you know what does
this mean and clearly NetBeans became an
important part of the Oracle ecosystem
now it is underneath JDeveloper so when
you started a developer you starting up
the NetBeans module system and the
window system and JDeveloper is from
NetBeans and and all these different
tools and NetBeans are part of
JDeveloper and there are other
organizations in Oracle that are
leveraging NetBeans in different ways
like Oracle labs and also the
organization that I'm a part of I'm a
product manager in Oracle Jets which is
Oracle's Java Script platform and the
official tooling for Oracle jet is its
NetBeans so but it's pervasive in our
products it's it's all over Eriko it's
really all over Korea and but then at
the same time as we were building up
this community the community wanted to
have more and more say in the direction
and in the roadmap that didn't simply
want to correct bug reports and feature
requests and have oracle decide which
ones were important enough to fix the
natural progression exactly exactly yeah
exactly exactly so that also there was
this pressure to be more involved and to
be more like an Apache project so then
when this decision came out of Erick oh
hey you know we want to share the cost
of ownership and and bring it out to let
it be what it what it clearly wants to
be right there was a general sound of
this is the right direction and James
Gosling
has been so in favor of this at JavaOne
last year as we always have a NetBeans
day during Java 1 and we have a NetBeans
day every month somewhere in the world
but the main one is here in San
Francisco last year he did the opening
keynote of NetBeans day and he basically
said look this is a fantastic direction
it's a pity we didn't do it earlier so
now so then we started this process and
it's a very slow and thorough process
there's the Oracle side of actually
donating the code to Apache it's not
simply become simply say oh here you go
Apache here's a whole repository of
stuff we don't know what's in their
processes by design yeah well yeah
exactly
I mean it's there's there's no way that
that from the Oracle side you can say oh
here's a repository has a git repository
good luck whatever is in there we don't
really know it's 20 years of code and
most of it come from some we don't know
what same day we're going to give it to
Apache that's not how it can work for
example there's a toolbar in NetBeans
for open and there's a button in there
for opening the Google Chrome browser
and there's a trademark Google icon in
there so can oracle donates a google
trademark to apache the answer is no so
if that answer is no it means that we
need to look at every single file in a
20-year repository and how many lines of
code is that well so far so the first
donation that we've done it's complete
we've in the github repository of apache
so github.com slash Apache slash
incubator - NetBeans contains four
million lines of code for Marion forty
five thousand files which is only the
first of a donation so there's actually
three separate parts you broke it into
smaller parts Wow and the second one
will be at least as large the first one
is focused on the Java is a parts so
this is actually it's almost like a
reopen source Nina because you have to
do the donation you have to go through
the code and do right now right right
but it's it's I mean it was always open
source but the difference now in Apache
is it's open governance so that's the
key difference it means that the code is
as open source as it always was except
that it realizes - about what I mean is
like you had to do the donation so that
Oracle has to go through that whole
process right you know but basically
essentially - you
- - you donate it yeah so now we're
gonna move from strictly from simply
open source to open development and
right right right
so this presumably would mean you know
you know more developers would be able
to contribute exactly not not only I
mean developers have always been able to
contribute to NetBeans in Oracle but you
had to sign your Oracle contributor
agreement which was a blocker and Apache
is a much stronger independent branch
people are much more likely to take time
and commit to an Apache project than
there are to a project that is
proprietary to a particular Enterprise I
think a lot of people had the feeling
well if I'm contributing to NetBeans I'm
essentially contributing to Oracle
whereas you know contributing to Apache
is one like a we're contributing to
everybody and not to a particular
Enterprise Apache isn't an enterprise as
such it's just a neutral ground where
projects can develop themselves and
their community so it's a perfect fit
for for what we doing so the first code
drop is done and there's several more to
come yeah how much more in terms of time
approximate time will this process be
its I have been wrong every single time
I have given any kind of the estimates
okay so it just it starts and whenever
it finishes exactly yeah I think we
should look at it like that but we
started to press like we announced this
from Oracle Oracle side at JavaOne last
year and we are it's been a year so it
so in that time we've actually got the
first donation done and and it's it's on
github at Apaches which means that you
can do a git clone and you have all of
that code you have the 45,000 files then
you can run ant in the root directory
and then that client will be built and
you will have NetBeans built because
that means just a tool like any it's a
piece of software some once you have the
source files and you run the the build
command you build the product and you
have a tool but you can use to build
your own to build your own tools so even
if we mean we're obviously going to
release our NetBeans through Apache fist
through the incubator and gradually move
to a top-level project but even now
today you can you can build it yourself
start
you can do JDK 9 development with
NetBeans you can do jigsaw you can do J
shell you can do J link all the tools
that are in Java 9 ok so a developer has
access to all that but in terms of the
development methodology in the
contribution process right is it is it
basically intact now or is there still
more work that has to be done for that
well there has to be so right now we are
in the process of relicensing everything
to Apache and there is a wiki page on
the Apache Napa's wiki described which
has a list of all the one row in a table
for each of the modules in NetBeans and
there's a tool called Apache ret which
you can run which detects whether the
licensing of all the files within a
particular module or for the whole tree
is incorrect or not and then you get a
sort so in the beginning there was like
45 thousand files were wrong because
they were not licensed to Apache and so
then gradually so we obviously want to
automate as much as possible so for
example all the files that were licensed
to Oracle of the Sun we had this we had
a net B's project that was corrected to
go through all of those files and
automatically replace them with a but
with the Apache License but many files
in NetBeans don't have a license or
there are small test files or there are
these dot form files from the matisse
GUI builder which were never licensed we
never had a license in Oracle or in Sun
so the something question becomes do we
have to manually license each of them or
can we create a tool so we've extended
this tool to detect different patterns
so if there is a Java source file in a
folder and it has a matching form file
so it must have the same name and
therefore we will inject via this tool
the apache license into that but there
are many other specific cases so the
first thing we need to do is get that
ret report down to a minimum where we
have as few exceptions and strange files
that are not licensed as possible and
then we can see well maybe we can
already release that and in Apache what
the whatever Apache releases is it's not
a binary you don't release a binary
release source code the source code
release so that I think the minimum
requirement is we need
have everything on the licensing level
correct but also we have some GPL
libraries in there and this is a big
problem in the Apache context but not
GPIO in the source code we've removed
that before the donation and in the but
GPL in the libraries that we are using
and that are going to be part of the
binary so when you have an it means
installed you will have some jars in
there right now that have for example
the Java compiler Oracle hasn't donated
the Java compiler to Apache but NetBeans
and the Java compiler is built into the
into the into NetBeans but it is GPL
license so this is a legal issue and a
Java help is another one
Java help hasn't been donated it's GPL
license it belongs to Oracle so how do
we go how do we handle that in the
Apache context so all of these things
have to be so you know but the process
is active it's all yes it's ongoing the
community is involved and also what I
really like is that people are popping
up on the Apache nib is mailing lists
who we have never heard or really
they're from other Apache projects
typically there's somebody's will pop up
on the minions to say hello you've never
heard of me see that's very exciting I
know and I've been involved some of
since I've been involved with some
open-source projects and you know you
put all this code out there you pull
this infrastructure out there and you
yes you wait a little bit yeah yeah it's
a heartwarming experience exactly and
once it starts you know sometimes it
starts very slowly but it does build up
steam over time yeah and it has this
unforeseen consequences yes show up from
you wouldn't necessarily exactly and
there's so many interesting things like
for example a lot of the NetBeans
community have built applications on top
of the NetBeans platform of the on top
of the infrastructure so they know the
nicknames api's so they're there they've
had like 20 years of training in how to
improve NetBeans itself based on the
fact that they've created applications
on top of it so those are going to be
the most active and the most relevant
contributors to the project so we've
been training up
attaching appease committers over the
past 20 years in many ways well it
sounds very exciting and if this sounds
like the you know the project is gonna
grow and the community is gonna grow and
diversify and there's be more
opportunities for more developers around
the world exactly our people talking
about it here I mean what's your sense
well on the show floor so we've had a
NetBeans day yesterday yesterday and we
had a session meet Apache NetBeans
incubating and we had a whole panel like
what 10 people on the stage from you
know people from from the community in
the UK from from Germany from Burkina
Faso
yeah really constant and Robbo is
amazing from Burkina Faso and Shawn
Phillips who works for a NASA contractor
so basically that means in space you
know so we had people from Naples and
Germany Nicholson UK and it means in
u.s. that means in Africa and that means
in space it's it's so broad and so I was
kind of like how many people will show
up to a session called meet at patchy
NetBeans you know would it be a very
exclusive number of people who literally
want to contribute to it but it turned
out we had like half two-thirds of the
room full so there were about 70 80
people there which is pretty good and
then we had sessions after that the
whole day with the next session was on
jigsaw and swin rhymers and Martin Klein
from Airbus we have a massive
application for satellites management on
top of NetBeans did a session about Java
9 and Chickasaw where the session on
Java e8 where we had people from payara
and and frm start from the JCP and david
half a finger from the NetBeans dream
team and all three on ineptness dream
team talking about Java EE eight code
generation tools in NetBeans it was a
session about nodejs and NetBeans and
there was a session like glue on the
NetBeans you haven't fallen and the
whole separate over there and we had all
kinds of different sessions the whole
day long and each session typically
started with me saying hello this is the
next session in the NetBeans day and by
the way we are moving to attach to
NetBeans and by the way here's the get
every repository and we need you to be
involved so we've been concentrating
people
and getting them and making them aware
of this project and getting them
involved and what's funny at the end of
one of the sessions one of the people he
was there who had never seen before
either came up to me and said hey why
you were talking I've done to get clone
of the Philippians repo and here there
was a built well that's because of this
and that and and he you know it was
amazing during the session he didn't a
clone on the repository and it it's a
it's a large repository but within a
couple of seconds you ever checked out
and within five minutes you you have it
built which is as long as it takes to
install NetBeans so that there's no real
difference between downloading and
installing the binary from Leytonstone
org and cloning and building Apache or
NetBeans from the github repository and
then you're able to interact with it as
an application as a source bundle rather
than a binary and you have complete
control over everything in there so it's
it's really really nice well your
enthusiasm is addictive all right it's
very exciting
all right so so there's basically two
spaces where people can go right now to
get more information they can go to
Apache yeah what's the URL for that
github.com slash Apache slash incubator
NetBeans is the github repository
there's an Apache wiki page with how to
participate and there's a blog that
we've set up there there's all kinds of
resources of blogs dot Apache dot orab
slash NetBeans is the new NetBeans
community blog on the on the battery and
also instead of nipping storag we're
going to have NetBeans start apache dot
org and that patch already exists it's a
temporary page but it's the patch is
already there so all these resources are
there and we're going to move the
tutorials there we're gonna move the
mailing lists there we're gonna move all
the things that are part of the NetBeans
ecosystem into the Apache context it's
gonna take time and an eric was very
patient and it's giving us lots of time
i'm not saying well if it's not there
next week then forget it it's but it's
like really just yeah so it seems like
you have support from the apache side
yeah from the oracle yeah yeah and the
community exactly it basically will take
as long as it takes exactly yeah
just a sign of hell exactly well thank
you very much for coming by for you
thank you yeah so I mean I'm sure you'll
be thank you thank you I'll see you
around yeah actually you know as the
show progresses and for all of you Java
developers out there please go visit the
the Apache the Apache NetBeans site and
start contributing and we will be back
here very soon thank you and see you
guys soon bye
great now we're still alive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
