okay so hello everyone welcome back this
is Jim doors Anzio
from the from the Oracle developer
community and we are live in San
Francisco at Oracle OpenWorld and my
guest here today is an old friend that
curtain will linger hi
actually we actually met like 15 years
ago at you know Sun Microsystems it's
it's strange how long ago it was and how
short ago it feels I know we just you
know flew by and I wanted to have a
conversation with you here today about
NetBeans right because NetBeans was the
very first open-source community I got
involved with that Sun right I guess it
was like 2000 2001 sure you know we got
to purchase NetBeans right yeah I think
that means you were there before I was
there oh really I started working with
NetBeans from 2004 for oh yeah so your
Evo before I well we should know so all
these years later Oracle obviously
recently has announced that the nipples
will be moving over to Apache right
right and so you've been working on
NetBeans for all these years in one
capacity or another right and I wanted
to check in with you to see what the
status is has the project alright
how's the move over to Apache growing
well it's is this a long version a very
long version and a very long version
okay well we have about 10 minutes the
short version is you know the history of
NetBeans is James Gosling and Sun in
general found this project being
demonstrated at the conference in about
around 97 98 when there were no IDE s
Wow and there was no there was there was
no editor before any other tool out
there and they acquired that group of
people in Prague who were creating this
and it was open sourced pretty much
immediately as it is predated all other
net
this tool predated all the other IDE
definitely Wow definitely
and so they acquired this group and from
the beginning the aim was to provide it
for free and open source to provide a
low threshold pathway into the Java
ecosystem and that's how it functioned
in Sun and then there was the B and in
the meantime we built up a community
around it because it was open source
enabling us to build an active community
of enthusiastic people worldwide and the
community of testers of the netcat
program that means community acceptance
testing program around an amazing guy in
prague usually kovarsky from the nipping
steam and we set up this NetBeans dream
team so these are independent people
outside of Sun outside of Oracle who are
very passionate about NetBeans and they
go to conferences on the talk about it
and things like that and I write
articles and so on and then it was to
take over and the you know everyone's
concerned what does this mean from that
means Oracle took over Sun and the
NetBeans was part of that acquisition
right and there was concern you know
what does this mean and clearly NetBeans
became an important part of the Oracle
ecosystem now it is underneath
JDeveloper so when you started a
developer you're starting up the
NetBeans module system and the window
system and Gi developer is from NetBeans
and and all these different tools and
NetBeans are part of JDeveloper and
there are other organizations in Oracle
that are leveraging NetBeans in
different ways like Oracle labs and also
the organization that I'm a part of I'm
a product manager in Oracle Jets which
is Oracle's Java Script platform and the
official tooling for Oracle jet is
NetBeans so but it's pervasive in our
products it's it's all over Eriko it's
really all over curl and but then at the
same time as we were building up this
community the community wanted to have
more and more say in the direction and
in the roadmap that didn't simply want
to correct bug reports and feature
requests and have oracle decide which
ones were important enough to fix this
is the natural progression exactly
exactly yeah for a mature open-source
exactly exactly so that also there was
this pressure to be more involved and to
be more like an Apache project so then
when this
decision came out of Eric oh hey you
know we want to share the cost of
ownership and and bring it out to let it
be what it what it clearly wants to be
right there was a general sound of this
is the right direction
and James Gosling has been so in favor
of this at JavaOne last year as we
always have a netbeans day during Java 1
and we have a NetBeans day every month
somewhere in the world but the main one
is here in San Francisco last year he
that the opening keynote of NetBeans day
and he basically said look this is a
fantastic direction it's a pity we
didn't do it earlier so now I think we
started this process and it's a very
slow and thorough process there's the
oracle site of actually donating the
code to apache it's not simply become
simply say oh here you go apache here is
a whole repository of stuff we don't
know what's in there when it processes
by design yeah well yeah exactly
I mean it's there's there's no way that
that from the Oracle side you can say oh
here's a repository here's a git
repository good luck whatever is in
there we don't really know it's 20 years
of code and it must have it come from
some we don't know what same day we're
going to give it to Apache that's not
how it can work for example there's a
toolbar in NetBeans for open and there's
a button in there for opening the Google
Chrome browser and there's a trademark
Google icon in there
so can Oracle donates a Google trademark
to Apache the answer is no so if that
answer is no it means that we need to
look at every single file in a 20-year
repository and how many lines of code is
that well so far so the first donation
that we've done is complete with in the
github repository of Apache so
github.com slash Apache slash incubator
- NetBeans contains 4 million lines of
code for Marion 45,000 files which is
only the first of a donation so there's
actually three separate parts you're
broken into smaller parts Wow and the
second one will be at least as large the
first one is focused on the Java SE
parts so this is actually it's almost
like a reopen source Nia because you
have to do the donation you have to go
through the code and do right now right
right but it's it's I mean it was always
open source but the difference now in
Apache is it's open governance
so that's the key difference it meant
that the code is as open source as it
always was except that it's real license
to about what I mean is like you had to
do the donation so the Oracle has to go
through that whole process right you
know we're basically essentially - you
know - - you donate it yeah so now we're
gonna move from strictly from simply
open source to open development and
right right right
so this presumably would mean you know
you know more developers would be able
to contribute exactly not not only I
mean developers have always been able to
contribute to NetBeans in Oracle but you
had to sign your Oracle contributor
agreement which was a blocker and Apache
is a much stronger independent branch
people are much more likely to take time
and commit to an Apache project than
they are to a project that is
proprietary to a particular enterprise I
think a lot of people had the feeling
well if I'm contributing to NetBeans I'm
essentially contributing to Oracle
whereas you know contributing to Apache
is one like hey we're contributing to
everybody and not to a particular
Enterprise Apache isn't an enterprise as
such it's just a neutral ground where
projects can develop themselves and
their community so it's a perfect fit
for what we're doing
so the first code drop is done and
there's several more to come yeah how
much more in terms of time approximate
time will this process be it's I have
been wrong every single time I have
given any kind of estimates okay so it
just it starts and whenever it finishes
exactly yeah I think we should look at
it like that but we started to press
like we announced this from Oracle from
the Oracle side at JavaOne last year and
we are it's been a year so it's so in
that time we've actually got the first
donation done and and it's it's on
github at Apaches which means that you
can do a git clone and you have all of
that code you have the 45,000 files that
you can run ant in the root directory
and then that client will be built and
you will have NetBeans built because
that means it's just a tool like any
it's a piece of software some once you
have the source files and you run the
the build command you build the product
and you have a tool but you can use to
build your own
build your own tools so even if we die
mean we're obviously going to release a
NetBeans through Apache fist through the
incubator and gradually move to a
top-level project but even now today you
can you can build it yourself
start it up you can do jedicon 9
development with NetBeans you can do
jigsaw you can do J shell you can do J
link all the tools that are in Java 9
okay so developer has access to all that
but in terms of the development
methodology in the contribution process
right
is it is it basically intact now or is
there still more work that has to be
done for that
well there has to be so right now we are
in the process of relicensing everything
to Apache and there is a wiki page on
the Apache nephews wiki
described it as a list of all the one
right in the table for each of the
modules in NetBeans and there's a tool
could attach here at which you can run
which detects whether the licensing of
all the files within a particular module
or for the whole tree is incorrect or
not and then you get a sort so in the
beginning there was like 45 thousand
files who were wrong because they were
not licensed to Apache and so then
gradually so we obviously want to
automate as much as possible so for
example all the files that were licensed
to Oracle office son we had this we had
a NetBeans project that was created to
go through all of those files and
automatically replace them with a but
with the apache license but many files
in NetBeans don't have a license or
there are small test files or there are
these dot form files from the Mateus GUI
builder which were never licensed we
never had a license in Oracle or in son
so the Sunday question becomes do we
have to manually license each of them or
can we create a tool so we've extended
this tool to detect different patterns
so if there is a Java source file in a
folder and it has a matching form file
so it must have the same name and
therefore we will inject via this tool
the apache license into that but there
are many other specific cases so the
first thing we need to do is get that
ret report down to a minimum
where we have as few exceptions and
strange files that are not licensed as
possible and then we can see what
we can already release that and in
Apache what the whatever Apache releases
is it's not a binary you don't release a
binary release source code the source
code release so that I think the minimum
requirement is we need to have
everything on the licensing level
correct but also we have some GPL
libraries in there and this is a big
problem in the Apache context but not
GPL in the source code we've removed
that before the donation and in the but
GPL in the libraries that we are using
and that are going to be part of the
binary so when you have an ippon
installed you will have some jars in
there right now that have for example
the Java compiler Oracle hasn't donated
the Java compiler to Apache but NetBeans
and the Java compiler is built into the
into that into NetBeans but it is GPL
licensed so this is a legal issue and a
Java help is another one Java help
hasn't been donated it's GPL license it
belongs to Oracle so how do we go how do
we handle that in the Apache context so
all of these things have to be so you
know but the process is active it's on
yes it's ongoing the community is
involved and also what I really like is
that people are popping up on the Apache
nib is mailing lists who we have never
heard of really they're from other
Apache projects typically there's be
somebody's will pop up on the menus to
say hello you've never heard of me see
that's very exciting I know and I've
been involved some of since I've been
involved with some open-source projects
and you know you put all this code out
there you pull this infrastructure out
there and yes you wait a little bit you
say there's a guy yeah yeah it's a
heartwarming experience exactly and once
it starts you know sometimes it starts
very slowly but it does build up steam
over time yeah and it has this
unforeseen consequences yes show up from
yes you wouldn't necessarily exactly and
there's so many interesting things like
for example a lot of the NetBeans
community have built applications on top
of the NetBeans platform of the top of
the infrastructure so they know the
Nipponese api's so they're there they've
had like 20 years of training in how to
improve NetBeans itself based on the
fact that there
created applications on top of it so
those are going to be the most active
and the most relevant contributors to
the project so we've been trading up
Apache Nettie's committers over the past
20 years in many ways well it sounds
very exciting and it's a this sounds
like the you know the project is gonna
grow and the community is gonna grow and
diversify and there's be more
opportunities for more developers around
the world exactly
are people talking about it here I mean
what's your sense well in the show floor
so we've had a netbeans day yesterday
and we had a session meet Apache
NetBeans incubating and we had a whole
panel like what 10 people on the stage
from you know people from from the
community in the UK from from Germany
from Burkina Faso
yeah really constant and Robbo is
amazing from Burkina Faso and Shawn
Phillips who works for a NASA contractor
so basically that means in space you
know so we had people from Naples and
Germany Dickinson UK NetBeans in us
ladies in Africa and Epis in space it's
it's so broad and so I was kind of like
how many people would show up to a
session called meet at patchy NetBeans
you know would it be a very exclusive
number of people who literally want to
contribute to it but it turned out we
had like half two-thirds of the room
full so there were about 70 80 people
there which is pretty good and then we
had sessions after that the whole day
with the next session was on jigsaw and
swin rhymers and Martin Klein from
Airbus we have a massive application for
satellites management on top of NetBeans
did a session about Java 9 and chicks'll
where the session of Java e8 where we
had people from payara and and Ivar
great start from the JCP and david half
a finger from the NetBeans dream team
and all three on on that dream team
talking about Java EE eight code
generation tools in NetBeans it was a
session about nodejs and NetBeans there
was a session like glue on and that
means you're enforcing and Jose Pirela
were there and we had all kinds of
different sessions the whole day long
and each session typically started with
me saying hello this is the next session
in the
penis day and by the way we are moving
to attach to NetBeans and by the way
here's the github repository and we need
you to be involved so we've been
constant icing people and getting them
and making them aware of this project
and getting them involved and what's
funny at the end of one of the sessions
one of the people he was there who had
never seen before either came up to me
and said hey why you were talking I've
done the get clone of the Philippians
repo and here there was a build program
and that's because of this and that and
and you know it was amazing during the
session he didn't a clone on the
repository and it it's a it's a large
repository but was in a couple of
seconds you ever checked out and within
five minutes you have it built which is
as long as it takes to install NetBeans
so that there's no real difference
between downloading and installing the
binary for NetBeans dot org and cloning
and building Apache NetBeans from the
github repository and then you're able
to interact with it as an application as
a source bundle rather than a binary and
you have complete control over
everything in there so it's it's really
really nice
well your enthusiasm is addictive all
right it's very exciting
alright so so there's basically two
spaces where people can go right now to
get more information they can go to
Apache yeah but what's the URL for that
github.com slash Apache slash incubator
NetBeans is the github repository
there's an Apache wiki page with how to
participate there's a blog that we've
set up there there's all kinds of
resources of blogs dot Apache dot org
slash NetBeans is the new NetBeans
community blog on the battery and also
instead of NetBeans doric we're going to
have NetBeans dot Apache org and that
patch already exists it's a temporary
page but it's the page is already there
so all these resources are there and
we're going to move tutorials there
we're gonna move the mailing lists there
we're gonna move all the things that are
part of the NetBeans ecosystem into the
Apache context it's gonna take time and
an Oracle is very patient and it's
giving us lots of time I'm not saying
well if it's not there next week then
forget it it's but it's like really just
yeah so it seems like you have support
from the Apaches
yeah from the oracles yeah and the
community exactly exactly it basically
will take as long as it take exactly
yeah just a sign of hell exactly yeah
well thank you very much for coming by
for you yeah thank you
yeah so I mean I'm sure you'll be thank
you thank you I'll see you around yeah
actually you know as the show progresses
and for all of you Java developers out
there please go visit the the Apache the
Apache NetBeans site and start
contributing and we will be back here
very soon thank you and see you guys
soon
great now we're still alive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
