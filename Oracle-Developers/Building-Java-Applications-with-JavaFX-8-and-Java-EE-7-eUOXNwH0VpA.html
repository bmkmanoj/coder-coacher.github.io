applications with Java fax it's sexual
jump effects on chart effects 8 just
jump effects in Java 7
now that's really Java 7 how many of you
work with Java effects already cool how
many of you work with Java EE in the
backend same better so I don't have to
go explain stuff awesome for those that
are not involved with young effects or
Java at all hopefully you have Wi-Fi and
you can google so I don't have to teach
you all right so my name is Bruno Borges
I am a principal product manager slash
Java vendor list in at Oracle Latin
America I deal with mostly B's or Java
me live Oracle so its outbound like kind
of be in touch with customers and users
and partners and developers but I don't
want to spend my whole time with that so
I become also an adjunct Vangelis I
became one and since I join a company
and that's why I'm here talking to you
about Java FX and Java EE not WebLogic
in Oracle database and all that stuff
feel free to follow me on twitter feel
free to email me if you have any
questions after this session these
sessions about an experiment so please
don't I hope I want to study our
expectations it's about some ideas I did
something similar last year it's called
it's a project called web FX by stearic
I came here and talked about a project
called web facts it which is a way to
run java fax applications that are
hosted on a remote server the UI the
controllers are the the the code that
you write for desktop applications are
actually being loaded from a remote
server so we can it's pretty much like a
web browser so instead of writing HTML
and JavaScript in CSS on the server you
write F XML you write the CSS and
instead of writing Java you write
JavaScript so that's the web effects
project you can Google
it's really cool and there's a browser
implemented for demonstrate it now this
one here is about more about building
Java facts applications using the Java
EE api's so instead of going through
frameworks for job for Java facts which
are great not seen or not they're really
good but there are already API is in the
Java EE platform that you can use on a
client side and how to take advantage of
that
instead of going learn a new framework
so hopefully let's see five years stayin
I know maybe we have Java EE client
profile where we can bring the Java EE
API to the client side to the desktop
side or embedded side to judge actually
have one single dependency nor project
and again then we can just drop in an
implementation say a job of effects
framework that implements those Java EE
client api's so most of the Java API is
that has a client API they are mostly
standalone so you have the Jersey jaques
RS API that has a client API you have
what sockets there are some API that you
can use on client side as well doesn't
matter if it's on several client so
you're gonna walk through a little bit
of some of those API s-- and then now i
really want to show you the code that i
have that the it's really a project that
just demonstrates it a little bit so
hopefully you understand get the idea so
actually change a little bit the agenda
so it just walk you through so Java
facts applications the usual desktop
architectural it's pretty much three
layer architecture as any anything
anywhere else this is from Wikipedia you
go to the three-tier architectural
article you get this image you have the
presentation layer you have the large
code logic tier and it has a data tier
when you look at your facts applications
you have the UI and you have the
controllers
which they can host a little bit of
logic and then you have the server side
where you host data or it can have some
logic there as well so it's not
different from any anything that you
have seen before now for Java facts
frameworks most people today are using
one of these two who of you know data
facts and who of you though open dolphin
all right cool so take a time to feel
free to visit their web sites there are
pretty cool frameworks so we can have
some of them have custom controllers but
most of the concepts of that project
those projects is to bind the JavaFX
applications to stuff on the server side
and write your applications that way
much easier than having a bunch of code
calling web servers web services rest
services or doing listeners to get the
new data from the database and Sarah
you just plug with these frameworks and
they will be listening to everything
that happens on the client-side sense to
the server side
if something happens the server side
sends back to the client API to the
client desktop application so it's
really there are really cool projects
open dolphine dot-org I believe and data
fact org yeah I'm sorry I forgot to put
the URL in there but they're really cool
frameworks to to look into you open
dolphin is it's supported and being
developed by canoe
they have a pretty cool some demo in
Java fax 3G demo that you can I think I
can show you it's so open dolphin yes
open - dolphin dot org and you got a
link to their page so it's a really cool
project to bind
whatever you want from server and client
so let's see if I get the Wi-Fi here or
just wired
yeah much better
so here's one of the the the kuda most
of my canoe it's an application to
monitor the harbour and you have visual
data coming from the server and you see
the map of containers all that is being
hosted in server side and they map with
open dolphin all the data that is there
and you have the visual visualization of
everything that is in at the harbour
so each container here is an object at
the server side they have they have
attributes like location position etc
and it's pretty much Java 3d effects 3d
lots of code you know that for sure but
it's a pretty cool demo they have
anybody has seen these before no ok
awesome so glad you had the opportunity
to see it you can charge really
expensive to build these kind of
projects for your customers you know
then there's a bunch of other projects
you can you can look they're now data
facts I think it's the effects of org no
it's not
so it's Java fax data JavaFX data dot
org it's the their website so it's not a
framework to plug your server-side
information with your java fax desktop
application so feel free to take a look
at that so I think that was there was
some sessions at JavaOne from the guys
that run these projects for sure there
were at least one session of each then
there is one last framework that I
really don't think they are pushing
forward that much there are templates
just this one but it's a it's a it's
managed by lot John a lot large gone and
I know they got the people from from
there they are really connected to Java
FX just the website is they I'm gonna
ping the guy to make an update to dy of
their website but it's the third
framework that is really we can you can
it's not I don't know if it's really
good I haven't played with it that data
facts and opened off and I know they are
really good rather flat effects need
some research to come to any conclusion
but it's another framework to look in
now we have all these frameworks and how
do we I mean we can use them but how do
we take advantage of the already
knowledge that we have in the java ee
world instead of going Lauren learning a
new framework in the Java EE world
you have the specifications and you have
the implementation behind in the java
facts world
you basically have only the
implementation the specification is in
the jdk already gives in the api's of
john effects the implementations
basically john effects itself now when
it comes to connecting to stuff in the
client side we can use api's from the
java ee road and then you can plug
whatever implementation you want so when
you look when we look at the Java is
seven api's we have CDI we have been
validation interceptors concurrency
and we have the web stuff JSP jst l EO
servlet WebSocket yourself etc now of
course not all of these api's can be
used in a client desktop application
they don't make sense
for example JTA with JC a can you use it
yes it's possible but you were probably
going to end up with a desktop
application that implements a an
application server somehow so I really
don't want to do that what you want to
do is just use the the the stuff that
makes sense so from the server side
perspective the first thing that we look
at is how do you expose data now it
makes total sense that you expose data
these days we want to use basically HTTP
for that we gonna we can use web socket
and jax-rs
and then we have either rest rest
services or it can have bi-directional
connection with WebSocket or am i you
can use our mind but that's that's not
it there's no exactly part of the java
ee landscape it's part of the java
technology on platform but you can do
that of course you can you run your RMI
server and then expose remote objects
yes Oh DJ B is correct but I mean nobody
wants to do that they want to they don't
want to ask for the firewall guide to
open some crazy port number to provide
binary data transmission right they want
to give you only the port number 80 and
that's it which is good for WebSockets
for example because it works on port 80
and they don't have that that probably
the network administrator and I mean RMI
can be used it should be considered for
any new project my personal opinion but
mostly for Internet
maybe applications that should be fine I
wouldn't I wouldn't even try for
open open allow the applications yes how
internal definitely now just just to
have an idea how many here build
applications for Internet's only for
Internet's only and for open web
applications that require open web
connection okay all right now there are
few API is here that you can definitely
use on the client side I mean JMS ejp
you can use you have of course in remote
ejbs connection you can do that you can
do depending on the application server
you have you can it may be can use the
over HTTP calls of EMI online but I
wouldn't I wouldn't try to solve the
problem that way I would stick to the
basic HTTP protocols and work on that so
just a few so if you see there are three
that are like blue one is JSF and the
other two are jax-ws and roxb so
basically the jax-ws and Roxby it's
perfectly reasonable your web services
but using soap and XML and then you have
Jaques or else which is restful api
those if you put in and if you if you
think about these options they're really
cool you're really great you can
integrate the client api of jax-ws and
roxb with existing web services on the
web so why why why actually going use
some other framework when you can just
use the thing that is already there and
in part of this pack jax-rs is it's the
same thing we have the client api now
the reason it's in blue it's because
these days everyone is doing rest
no not web services anymore soap stuff
right Twitter that has not provided a
soap API just a REST API that's a signal
and JSF so why JSF is in blue I didn't
have much time to add I slide on to
expose that but I hope hopefully you
guys get the idea you see those
applications desktop application that
has a section at the bottle or somewhere
that actually just runs a remote page
web page so we have these if you have
played any game World of Warcraft or
whatever desktop application that has a
bunch of banners most of those banners
are our remote web applications that
keep switching the banner to show you
ads we hate that but okay so basically
you can use JSF to build on a server
side that part you have the the banner
of your desktop application or you have
any any section of your application that
will be showing the user something from
our remote server from a remote web
application and that is of course being
exposed on a web view inside the
application you have your embedded
browser part of your application is the
embedded browser and you can plug stuff
between the web browser and the actual
application outside and that's something
that I want to show you in this
presentation
now hopefully you seen some code on how
to write WebSocket servers this one here
is a server that just echoes whatever
message it gets from all the users
connected so this is a very simple Java
EE 7 API jsr 3 5 2 3 5 6 in I don't know
how many of you have any and time
implemented a shared server means it's
painful right and in the old days cgi
beans and etcetera in iframes and keep
refreshing the page that was like
painful now you can just write this and
you have maybe five JavaScript lines on
the HTML page and you have a chat room
implemented now of course WebSocket not
going through web sockets but WebSocket
is a protocol and not related to Java EE
Java EE just in standard AR is an API to
define both server-side and client-side
actors to play through with the the
WebSocket protocol so it's definitely
one of the ways to
they have bi-directional communication
between your JavaFX desktop application
and your server side don't don't you
shouldn't think about anything else if
you want bi-directional communication
just go with WebSockets if it's in the
open web or Internet is even better just
it runs over the port HTTP even though
it's a different protocol but it works
fine the second one is jaques RS you can
easily define our rest server don't care
about the name of the class it shouldn't
be a shared server but in this example
here I have just actually it's
completely wrong
I think I'd switch there is lights
so this is a red service server it will
just echo whatever it got from the the
path they were oh now you can easily
implement that in Java 7 since Java is
six actually we have these kind of code
so again I think if you want to plug
database to desktop application on the
open web you don't want to give access
on the open web to our database you want
to expose that as a reservation rest
service so you really should consider
Jaques rs200 in Java EE 7 to do that and
again bi-directional WebSockets
uni-directional rest and in stateless
connection actually so it's pretty easy
to write that kind of code so JavaServer
faces so yeah forgot screenshot so again
it's part of your desktop application
can be a web page coming from our remote
server
you can even run in embedded server if
you want but you wouldn't make sense so
how do like how do I have a desktop
application that has part of its UI
being dynamic in a way that I can change
that part without having to reduce you
build a new version of my binary of my
desktop application so you should really
consider anything that you can run on
the server side but if you are in a Java
you world JSF is a good exact way to
implement that so part of your
application is a web page coming from
the server inside a web view component
now for the client side most of the API
is that we can definitely use the API
side you can definitely use and make
sense to use in the client side our CDI
being fat of course jax-rs two web
sockets one and JSONP because you don't
know Jason paid means JSON processing so
it's basically an API to convert in a
Java object into ice rink JSON
representation and vice versa
it's inverse from one we plan to have in
Java EE eight the jocks the J's on B
which is JSON binding pretty much like
the jocks B Java for XML binding so you
have your Java code your Java structure
being and you can put annotations and
say hey this is how I want to represent
this structure in JSON instead of
programmatically doing the conversion so
JSONP does the process you have to
actually implement the conversion and
with the JSON be for Java EE eight we
want to have those annotations and then
just whatever framework or ever is being
running at the back and behind that will
convert your Java object to
representation string Java male yes
definitely you can definitely be used
for client-side everyone is using
already for swing applications so
nothing new here and then comes bean
validation a CDI 1.1 now B validation is
interesting you can just put annotations
in fields on your Java class and then
you can get that object and call B
validation validate this and if some for
example integer attribute on your class
has a minimum value annotation mean ten
if that value is nine the bean
validation framework will give you an
exception and you can easily convert
that into a Java facts pop up and show
the user that something is wrong again
data facts and opened off and they have
solutions for that but they are not
using standards and we hopefully we are
looking for some some of those
frameworks to implement some of these
API is in the client side in CDI they
context dependency injection CDI has a
one of the issues with CDI I mean it's
great you can just inject stuff instead
of doing neo my class you just do inject
any jects up being pretty much like you
do in the java ee
scope the problem with CDR in Java fax
applications it's pretty much designed
the API has been designed for the web
world not for desktop site applications
so most of these scopes don't make sense
or don't have any clear definition in
that specification on how to how they
should behave in a desktop application
for example request scope the request
scope of CDI requested scope is related
to HTTP request and in desktop
application don't have that you may have
a pop pop scope and enjoy pop pop but
you don't have a request that scope you
can have us it could you have a session
scope from again the web application in
a desktop application may be it may be
you can think of something but it makes
more sense to have the conversation
scope for example I have this wizard
that the user pops up a wizard and it
has to go through some UIs and then
finish then a conversation is called
from Cydia makes sense in that but
definitely the application scope the
application scope from CDI makes a lot
of sense everything actually should be
by the phone on a desktop application
application scoped because it's the
instance of the application running in
the desktop right but most of these
annotations I wouldn't say all of them
but most of them don't work on the
desktop on desktop applications we have
we have to I think there are two
implementations one is weld and the
altar the other one is open open Cydia I
think but well is definitely the most
used one and it's the one that I have
here to show you again for all the api's
are you going to use you can you should
be able to plug whatever implementation
you want should I use Tyra's the
implementation of web socket I go get
the tires binary my code is plugged to
the web socket API but the
implementation starts if I want to
change to Undertown then I just replace
the jar and use Undertown when I'm using
a Java effects framework I cannot do
that
I have to fix the bug or I have to go to
those guys and go to that project and
see what's going on and cannot I cannot
just replace I'm tied to that framework
so look I'm the idea here is really to
have in genefex scope that ability the
same ability that we have a Java EE Road
to just move our application from this
application server to that application
server in the JavaFX world I really
really looking forward to have hey
here's my Java flex application and it's
plugged to this client-side Java API is
but I want to replace this
implementation to this implementation
instead of being plugged to their
effects or or rad effects or any other
utility now what api's you can use but
you likely want now because why do I
pick what you you want to use these
api's well first first you can use of
course expression language API is pretty
cool you could it could have some
templates in your application to just
plug the the the variables and then
convert this huge string template into
something and have the Y being rendered
on on runtime and dynamically that'll be
cool say for example an F XML and a
dynamic effects ml with dynamic
variables and then replace them with
expression language that's something
that can be achieved but needs some
research research on that batch API you
can lots of people are using probably
spring batch already on desktop
applications to run stuff and then you
have this menu that will pop up when the
batch is the job is done so let's say
hey run a backup on all the files in
this desktop application and then you
put to a batch job in the application
and then it runs and you get it but
maybe it would be nice to use the batch
API not a specific framework
let's abstract that and use the API JPA
if you are using a database to get
together embedded with the API with the
I'm sorry if you are using JP a database
embedded
desktop application JPA is a very good
API to use to connect to that database
instead of using JDBC so just download
whatever implementation you want to use
say Eclipse in ink or or hibernate and
instead of writing code specifically to
that implementation make sure you use
the JPA implement interfaces and then
you are free to change the
implementation as you like JCA is pre
advanced not even about that
JMS you can definitely write JMS client
it makes sense but it the configuration
of for that depends pretty much on the
implementation area you are using say
for example JMS client needs to play
with the jndi context of the application
server you don't wish i mean for an
infinite applications that should be
fine for internet applications that's
difficult you don't want to expose the
gmvi context over the internet and and
if you want to plug through over HTTP
for example you really need to go to the
implementation configuration features of
for that library and see if that works
but I wouldn't use it for most of the
applications EJB in NJ ta now ejp
doesn't make sense without JTA at all I
think they should be plugged so I can
have so for example this wizard I have
this reason in my desktop application
the user goes through each part of the
application and I open a transaction I
have my EJB stateful object locally in a
in my EJB container and i go through
that and that's at the end i finish and
then goes to the database and i plug
that to JPA that's quite difficult to
implement I wouldn't look into that so I
mean this API can be used but it will
require so much work that you shouldn't
be wasting our time with that just stick
with the exposing data from WebSocket
jax-rs using json peach process maybe
part of that in a webview with
jsf web services in jocks B and Java
Mayo and connecting all that with CDI
and doing some bean validation now
what's what's a good this is something I
came up after playing with this project
in order stuff I call it hybrid Java fax
desktop application architecture now you
have Oracle JRE you have the jump
effects platform and you have your
application so you can definitely use
stuff to plug to native hardware access
you have the native Java FX UI controls
and you have your embedded browser all
of those technologies in one single
application now think about the the old
days when people used to do a web page
plus an applet that was terrible
right I mean at that time it was great
today is terrible and that time was
great because the web world didn't have
the features that applets could bring to
get those applications so everybody
wanted to have a web cam connected so
they would implement that with an applet
they wanted to run calculations
locally instead of sending to the server
and bringing it back they were just run
an applet or doing one of the good
examples is uploading a big file or
downloading a big file from the server
it was better to use applets to do that
because you could then resume if there
was any issue with download so how do we
how do what's what's the idea behind a
hybrid drive access top application part
of the application is html5 it can be
running remote or local then you have
the native controls in Java effects you
can style that in CSS and teams and then
you have the Java libraries for hardware
integration basic Ram is saying here is
hey you have this cool web application
that requires an applet convert that
your desktop application and instead of
converting the for web application to a
visual desktop application embed that
website inside your the
JavaFX application and all those applets
that you had before you just connect
them doing some Java code and passing
that those objects into the webview
component of Java effects instead of an
applet but it could easily migrate that
and then you have your unified that top
application and you can push builds to
Windows Linux and Mac I mean I find this
architecture really interesting for
anyone that still runs web applications
plus applets if you do have that
consider migrating for a java fax
desktop application but instead of
migrating all the HTML files that you
have in our web application just
embedded it inside the webview of your
just of your desktop application then
you don't have to go through 500,000
HTML files and change that into F XML
JavaFX page interfaces and then whatever
you have in applet just put the applet
as part of the library the class path in
the desktop application and then you
write the wires that integrates that so
this the idea of a java fax hybrid
application from web apps and applets to
a migrate less start application you
have a web browser you have the the web
page that requires applets and you have
the apples there you convert to a Java
desktop application in better browser
which is the JavaFX webview and you just
move all those libraries that you have
as applets as part of the - desktop
application so you're migrating a frico
application from getting rid of the
browser plus applet - just a full
desktop application the reason to do
that is definitely why am I going to so
my page requires users to have Java
installed and it has problems with
browsers so let me get rid of at least
one dependency and I got rid of the
problem with the browsers and I still
run Java and then you bundle the
application even you even if the user
even if you don't require user to
install Java you just send them the
install
of your application and you just
installed application they will even
they don't even know that there is job
inside right you can borrow everything
together so let me just show you some
code on some of the things that I've
have I've come up with so I have on the
server side here I have a rest server
and I have WebSocket I call it payment
monitor so the WebSocket will just be
pushing out whatever is being received
as payments from the rest service so I'm
sure the roster is flush first so rest I
have the do payment which takes a put
and there's a payment of a big decimal
that adds to a list of payments it
calculates the total amount and then
fires an event on CDI to anybody
observing big decimals and then that
will come up to WebSocket now what's the
WebSocket endpoint is observing me
this is amount code so the observer so
here's the rest code fire an event in
CDI in the server side and here I have
the WebSocket server endpoint observing
the updated amount when I get that I
just go through all the sessions
connected to the server endpoint and for
each of one I get their sync remote and
send up text with the updated amount of
all the payments now let's take a look
at the Java fax application that is
connected to these two servers services
mean in a Java EE manner so I have here
my bill payment controller
I have some code here
let me run the application before
so I have here the idea here is how to
have a WebSocket client in the in the
client side desktop application so I
have my auto connect server endpoint I
have the the page for dad I don't think
I don't think 100% of the demo will work
but so here I have the amount I'm gonna
type a hundred and press pay and what
these does is I'm sorry
so here I have in in the JavaFX
application
I got a payment handler that got a
payment on Credit Valley a hundred now
this is being issued in the payment
application the payment handler is
called because it's observing a payment
event when I got the payment event
I just inject the rest clients the rat
jocks are as quiet object and then I go
to I get a target for my wrestlers path
payment and I put the value that I got
so if I go to the GlassFish server
I got an updated amount from observing
the big decimal from the JavaFX
application into the server-side
application so this is an interesting
way to plug Java API into Java FEX most
of the things will be done through
observing the CDI events so let me show
you where I got these even here so I got
a new payment from the controller that
came from here so first thing I do here
in this snippet is I go to the bean
validation API and I validate I call the
bean validator and validate the object
the payment is it is it is it the
payment without the right data inside if
it's all good if there is no validations
there's no issues and then a fire our
CDI event inside
JavaFX desktop application and that is
automatically plugged to the payment
hangar by observing the events I don't
even know who's observing that I just
work with CDI events so basically my
controller here in Java fax doesn't know
who is who who is taking care of that
event if something is wrong and then I
just print all the validations just to
give you an idea of how those bean
validation works so I have a payment
here this annotation data is from a
project from a project called on bouquet
that just generates all the getters and
setters but the bean validation API is
this one so I want the payment type to
not be not blank this is actually
specific to hibernate validator so I
shouldn't I shouldn't even be using this
but anyway just an example so I want the
big decimal to be digits
it must be an integer it may have a
fraction of two if there's anything
wrong I can just type invalid value for
payment amount so that would be the
message that should be displayed it
should not be it must be not know and
the minimum value it must be one so then
I run the bean validation API before
calling any be any anything to the
server side and the date time must not
be no now that's that's what I'm doing
here basically plugging all the api's
now the cool stuff with this project
that will be on github 3 soon ish is how
all these thing works if you look at the
main application so this is the view
payment application that's towards the
application it is the app the Java FAQs
that application is this is not aware
doesn't have to configure anything about
Java EE on the client side all that has
been done on the libraries that I
already wrote for you you just go you go
to github and get
but basically you write your class
application here just as a simple POJO
and you can inject the F XML loader and
you have you can have a start method
that observes the stage object which is
the main object to write down inside
Europe to publish your application on
Java FX so what I do here is I load the
F XML file I turn it I got I get the
part of it I do a new scene I put it on
stage and then I show it everything from
now on will be CDI enabled everything
from now on you can just inject stuff
you can work with CDI beings you can
work with the bean validator
you can inject their jocks RS client you
can inject the WebSocket client or you
can write your own client and it will be
automatically connected to the server
side so this pretty interesting stuff
and the only thing that happens is here
the Java EE bootstrapped effects so how
do I bootstrap the application with CDI
enabled now you see that in this case
this project is tied to weld because
there is not actually a CDI API to
bootstrap it at this moment
I think that's been taken care of on J
on CDI 2.0 for w8 I think that's part of
the plan to have a bootstrap method but
anyway in the init method I just call
weld I initialize the CDI implementation
and then I have from now on I can just
use the CDI API so the CDI here is from
the CDI API standard not world anymore
so I get the current context I get the B
manager and a fire an event to the beans
registered in this context so I'm just
going to send the stage of Java facts
and that my application can get a
reference to that in a an abstract way
not being actually
tied to that when the application is
goes off when the user closes the
application it calls stop and shutdown
swelled and then I have my CDI being
shut down in a nice way instead of just
killing it so it is pretty much a here
is the glue of that so now how do I
provide objects for a the way that I did
I injected the jocks are as client how
did I do that one of the modules here is
the Java Java EE for effects web and
here we have their best jax-rs client
provider it's really just a CDI provider
that produces a client wherever you want
you just say inject client from jax-rs
and this producer here will be called in
your desktop application giving you an
object to now be able to deal with rest
services now finally to finish the demo
the idea of my gradient of FX + applets
to a full Java desktop application
without having to migrate the web
application so this is an application
that has an applet you may not see it
but it seems it's here it's not a visual
this so this this concept here of my
grading is only for non visual applets
and I'm still thinking about how to do
the visual rapids but you're gonna see
here that there is an applet on this
HTML file so this happen here can
encrypt data locally now of course in
exact examples just a base64
encryption so I'm just gonna put like
Java 1 2014 and when I click encrypt it
will call the applet that will call the
base64 class in Java and encrypt that
and send that back to the applicant the
web interface injecting
in the JavaScript Dom tree and then I
have it converted of course there are
JavaScript libraries that do that I
wouldn't need an applet or two to do
that but this is just to show you how to
do these now sometimes I need to just
call a Java method in the applet and I
need the applet to get information from
food from the stuff that the browser
does not allow you to for example
information from the machine and the
user Trust is your applet and then you
get access to that so I need I call a
method and the applet needs to write
stuff back to the HTML page and then I
have here calling the applet and I get
data from there now where is this coming
from
if I go to so let me close all these
stuff here if I go to the live connect
sample I have data summary here I think
you got a console oh yeah this Java
console is here from the applet so I got
data summary in it evoked start invoked
get data summary involved etc and then I
have here the methods for example GAC
data summary so this method is the one
that is called from the page I was
JavaScript in the page to call method in
Java in the java applet object okay now
I want to I want to get rid of the
problem with applets and browsers and
all that stuff I really just want to
have my java facts desktop application
but I have this hundreds of pages that
are dependent on applets how do I do
that how do I have this fine Java facts
application and and but doesn't not good
not having to go through migrating 500
or HTML interfaces what I can do is I
just go to I just go to Java fax and
build an application so let me show you
the live effects connect example here
so this application here are you gonna
see it's a 100% Java code to be the
application so what I do here is I have
an arcview
I load the same page that I loved that I
launched on Firefox it's the same page
you can see localhost blue no applet
launch is the same one as this one and I
say hey let me wrap the objects that I
know because it's my project it's my
website I know there's an applet inside
I'm gonna register jas object wrapper
which is of class data summary provider
and I'm gonna in it
the applets that are inside that page
what this code will do is it will go
inside that page in the webview that was
loaded in the webview find out the
applets that world inside and if the
class match instead of working as a
browser it will just create an object in
the same VM of course and in reference
that object in the JavaScript scope of
the webview page and then I have my
application migrated without much hassle
so this is the webview and and if I type
Java 1 2014 so the same value as in
Firefox I should get the same value of
the encryption yes I'm sorry yeah it
would need some tuning on that but it's
it's ok I think it's possible you can
parse the HTML file and find those
parameters and then when you create your
object in the Java side you pass those
parameters along and then you inject in
the JavaScript Dom tree of web view but
that's possible yes crazy stuff crazy
ideas I know any question so far except
this one
I mean how many of you are facing
projects that still use applets you of
course one they're okay if you want more
okay what do you think this is
interesting
that's a feedback there like to have
with this help you go get rid of applets
and start migrating stuff to food JavaFX
that's not applications okay that's how
many applets there are lots of outfits
still out there trust me yeah so yes so
yes so let me just that's a very good
question
it wasn't the focus of this talk but I
can definitely talk to you about that
pretty quick I can show you these slides
they will be in Portuguese though so of
course I can translate for you so when
you talk about Internet applications we
talked about the distribution model of
those application engine Internet right
there are basically so this means mod
distribution models of Java applications
I hope that seems similar in Portuguese
in English okay so one of the the models
is definitely Java Web Start ok that's a
good way to get started at publishing
your desktop applications you use Java
Web Start for that it is too tired a
little bit with the Java plug-in the
Java browser plug-in but not that much
for example instead of writing our HTML
application
that has an applet and the communication
has to go through life connect which is
a gray area in terms of what may change
our mate may not in the future when you
change for a full desktop application
you don't have life connect anymore
right and instead of migrating the pages
you just run your own browser with the
applets as part of the desktop
application and then that's something
cool you can have as a minimum migration
model and you distribute them as a Java
Web Start application instead of a link
on click here to login when the user
clicks in instead of opening a new
browser page it will open your Java
desktop application so that's one model
to distribute your your application on
the open web the other model of course
is just a simple download you're right
you create the bundles that comes with
the JRE already inside and you provide
them with the XE or the MSI the the dmg
for Mac and they get those files and
just they just install and the user even
they even don't know that there is a job
inside right Java will be will come
bundled with your application now
something that most people don't know is
there are app stores for PCs people
forget about that and interesting stuff
is people users are used with app stores
but on the mobile or tablets but they
know about app stores on PCs as well
most mostly Mac users of course but if
you go for in Balto you have the Ubuntu
Software Center where you can publish
your applications so that's a place to
go
Microsoft is come with your own store
Windows Store now I mean I don't know if
it's possible to publish full binaries
in there I believe it is but I haven't
checked I know that for App Store it's
perfectly fine and Ubuntu Software
Center is perfectly fine how to
distribute their Windows Store I'm still
not sure I think they have their own
model on how to write in publish
applications
but maybe possible and then you have the
30 party
these spammy ads app stores when you buy
a laptop and copy the other craft where
right but they are there
there are stores for there as well so
this is an interesting thing this is a
table that I came up with so basically
it tells the advantages of it's
important keys but if making it we may
get an idea what's how would you say no
in in Portuguese in yes so it is the
application independent from a previous
installation of Java in applet no you
have to have this Java installed or of
course you can have that script that
checks but the user will have to stop
job and then you have the second line is
independent from the Java browser
plug-in well applets are definitely not
Java Web Start it's partially there is
no life connect for example the binding
from javascript in Java it doesn't exist
in the the the java web start because
it's a full job FX application it's not
bounded to the browser is hitting the
payment from Java updates that's a
toughie question when Java updates in
your applets not wasn't updated before
the job update and you have to go run
and fix it so when you have to download
the link or App Store you bundle the GRE
so you define which version of the jar
of Java will be with your application
and the download link works perfect fine
you bother it you first realize it isn't
independent or might connect web start
it is so that's a good thing
independent from browser web
restrictions no and no well web start
may work the user would download if jnlp
file and then you just start java web
start with that file it may work but not
exactly for sure hundred percent
he hasn't that so we say just say no
for example Firefox is blocking applets
you have to say tell Firefox hey I want
to run this app
or Chrome who is about to drop any pay
api support on that so stuff that we
want to make sure our applications
continue to work but don't rely on
browsers can the application be
automatically updated out-of-the-box
this is important out-of-the-box in
Apple IDs you just push a new version of
the applet and the browser plugin will
check for you the new version and
download the new version automatically
so don't have to worry about that Java
Web Start is the same thing in App Store
yes
you push the new version it's pretty
much like in the mobile world and the
user will see hey there is a new update
on this application do you want to
update it and the App Store and the
operational system will manage it
it will uninstall the application
installed anyone if the user of course
agrees the three last one can can the
customer define which version of Java
will be running for applets in the
website is I would it's not a high
percent no but it's pretty much no in
the open web because we are always
pushing users to be using the latest
version and when there is an update we
strongly advise everyone to update the
latest version so you cannot define but
for download link in App Store it's yes
you can control which version of Java
will be with your application can you
control the runtime environment in App
Engine Java Web Start know because it
starts from the Java plugin it starts
from the browser it's pretty much no but
it download link in App Store yes
because you can simply say hey this is
my bundle I'm gonna have my folder I'm
gonna install this application as a
standalone desktop application so you
are in control of the installation
environment and finally is it feasible
to have support from Oracle for if you
are going through the Oracle JRE and JDK
right for applet in Java Web Start for
open web application right I'm talking
about open web applications not internet
for internet you can have support it's
feasible to have that support
but for open web it's quite difficult
for example there's a there's a customer
in Brasilia has say five million users
that have to login to their website and
open an applet and how would the
customer get support from Oracle to
support those computers that are
inconsistent so it's not feasible it's
not practically possible to come to a
point where yeah we can support that
it's really difficult but for download
link an app store yes you can come up
with an agreement for support because
you are in charge of which JRE is being
bother with your application and which
operational systems are being used by
your users in etc so it's more feasible
to control the environment in the Indus
help support so it's pretty much like an
N idea of how to build and what you get
what you don't get from from these and
to flowise
so if you if you'd like to see something
like these Java EE api's as aligned with
the Java fax applications how do we have
these api's more consistent working
together in a Java desktop environment
please join the adopter jsr program and
share give your feedback hey I need CDI
to work on Java fax applications I need
jax-rs client API to work on there as
well and I need them to integrate
without any problem so we need those
feedbacks from you guys and the way to
do it is through the doc to jsr and
maybe someday we can come up with a Java
EE client profile we have the full
profile have the web profile but what
about putting those api's together on a
client side that's top application
that's an idea right so please share
your feedback through it up to jsr
hopefully at some party have the Java
platform SCE and EE you working together
really nicely thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
