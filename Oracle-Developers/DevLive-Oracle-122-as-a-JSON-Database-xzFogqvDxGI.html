New York City I'm Bob Rupert with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
yet another live interview from this
event my next guest is Christos ler tell
the folks at home what you do for Oracle
yeah so I'm architect in the integration
cloud group so we build an integration
service that allows you to do enterprise
application equation of systems
integration general using cloud
technology so you can run your
enterprise application in the cloud
on-premise and each combination you want
and use our technology in order to
integrate your systems in order to make
them consistent with each other what was
your Oracle cloud session focused on my
session actually was focused on lower
layers of the whole architecture it was
focused on the order database itself I
was describing or 212 seen the latest
release as a JSON database actually so
order to implement it the Chasen data
type for quite a while now but in
release two of the orga 12c a lot more
functionality came into the picture like
in-memory analytics support as well as
database sharding so now with this
additional functionality in place you
can actually take the audio database and
not use it really as a relational system
but it's a JSON database and so the
whole attention was focused to explain
how the Chasen functionality is
implemented across the stack across the
functional and non functional parts of
the architecture what sort of questions
did you get during your session yeah so
I got a lot of clarification as a
question since people didn't really know
yet that already has a full stack
implementation of the cheese and data
type so there were a lot of questions
around what is J's in the first place
and those people who know Jason what
they talked about is understanding how
this is embedded in the relational
system and how if there's any Adela's
difference to the performance and the
characteristics of the database what's
the one key takeaway you want people to
remember from your session but if you go
chase me if you have to use J's news
organs don't go anywhere
it doesn't get any plainer than that
thanks so much for taking time to talk
to me if you'd like to attend a Nora
code event there are 17 left in this
series around the world visit developer
oracle.com slash code for a complete
list of events upcoming and you'll also
find information on how you can submit a
session proposal for a future Oracle
code event I'm Bob Rubert for the Oracle
technology Network thanks for watching
and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
