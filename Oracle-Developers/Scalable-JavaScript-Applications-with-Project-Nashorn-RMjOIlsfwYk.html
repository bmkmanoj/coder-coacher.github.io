to you install so more event and we'll
talk about scalable JavaScript
applications in project nas horn I am
the owner of the speakers my name is
Laurence Oliver I'm Brazilian 25 years
old I have been working with Java and
soft wrecked a tree for a few years I
work at three or sistemas that we
develop with Java II enjoy desktop
applications in the point two thousand
of customers it's a pharmacy software
vendor and there is my twitter handle
and and github people start hello
everyone good afternoon my name is
Michelle Grayson I'm a software
architect in Brazil and been working
with software for almost 12 years and
today we're going to talk about a little
bit about a why to use JavaScript and
the server side and why to use
JavaScript on top of the JVM and of
course how to to bind this with the
NASCAR echo system and show two projects
that can leverage this kind of
technology that is vertex and avatar
project and if if you have time we open
for questions in the end so we can start
I want to ask you anybody here is
working with javascript in the server
maybe with no Jas or something like that
okay one one person well why we can work
with javascript in the server we can ask
ourselves well javascript has an a
synchronous is a synchronous by nature
it has native JSON support so if you
think about that it fits the it's
basically fits with the requirements of
our modern applications when we have a
lot of restful endpoints and you need to
be responsive so a synchronous be racing
a synchronous and
have JSON support is mandatory nowadays
so another aspect is the language we use
and it the easier developer transition
so we have a lot of good javascript
developers in the client side so how can
use this workforce in the server as
architects we need to to be productive
in our project so how can we deliver a
more softer and less time so we can use
this workforce as JavaScript developers
and since they already have chosen hit
the their language why not used these in
the server we know it's a successful
approach we have been we have seen no
Jas applications and the server side
we've successful so why not not just the
language the JavaScript but why not
leverage another that give another kind
of platform for the developers so why
not use javascript on top JVM why'd you
use the JVM in the first place well it's
a moot language platform so we can run
Java of course JavaScript we can have
groovy Scala in town and hundreds of
another language so we have really good
APM tools when he can monitor our
applications in our environments and the
production and other environment so some
nodejs has some APM tools but not not as
much as the JVM has and with not in the
same equality we end but i think we
think are the most important aspects of
that is that we have access to all the
java ecosystem if you think java has 20
years and we have a lot of libraries in
the market so not just third-party
libraries but the core java libraries so
imagine you have a JavaScript
application and you have issues to to
date and time so using the JVM
you can for example make use of the new
date and time in guy in the Java 8 or if
you have issues with arithmetic
arithmetic of floats pointing you can
use bigdecimal for some calculations and
of course if you already have your
domain models already written in Java
you can use it directly in the
JavaScript so it can mix both words and
yet used our JavaScript developers so
it's the point to why use the JVM so you
ask how to make use of the JavaScript
and the JVM with a good performance what
we have now is a new platform called
NASCAR which is Reno in German if i'm
not wrong so it's the to make the same
name but in a different language and it
was delivered in the Java 8 we have it's
a compact 21 profile with some
extensions in the JDK 8 if has some
restrictions of course we are running
the server side we do not have browsers
api's we do not have dom manipulation
api's which is not necessary there is no
common jes implementation for the nice
one and it's compatible compatible with
a mac five dot one and we know so if you
have the Reno no Reno application Reno
is the the old JavaScript platform since
the Java 5 which was replaced by reno in
job by Nash horn in Java 8 so it's
compatible with some restrictions there
is a cup of documents that mapping this
restriction when we are rewriting the
application to the new platform in my
opinion we have a really interesting
feature in nash horrid f that is the jjs
here the jjs comment line now as Java we
can do Java minnows jar for run some
java java jar file we can now run
javascript files
in the command line and not just that it
has support to be scripting so our
JavaScript developers can now for
example right bash bash in scripts to
running Linux directly in JavaScript
it's now possible so you can have some
scripting in the crontab written in
javascript is really interesting feature
we have I will show some examples here
how you can leverage the jjs comment to
hear is that simple we just run jjs in
the comment line so it opens a a
terminal in javascript and just print
some code hello javelin 2014 here i'm
running a javascript file so just jjs
and the name of the JS file it has the
same the same script that I show in the
previous slide and it just prints the
hello and finish the execution so we can
now work a scripts like I can start my J
balls with JavaScript scripting so it's
really interesting we have new options
in this world and now for example I open
again the terminal I will do some
arithmetic floating-point arithmetic
calculation I'm adding 0 dot one with 0
dot 2 and I have a really strange number
I I think most of you'll notice that we
have an issue not issue but it's a a
detail of the i.e 754 specification that
flood pointing a calculation has this
issue but you can fix it or do not have
this if a collateral effect if use
bigdecimal so how can i use bigdecimal
inside a javascript application using s1
I can open my terminal I declare a
variable that is a pointer to a Java
type a Java type through java dot math
dot bigdecimal and I just make the
calculation as every java developer does
with bigdecimal and the result is the
correct value we are expecting so we can
leverage the Java API inside our
JavaScript applications without any
other dependency we don't need to add
any other dependencies since you are
working just to the core java libraries
but we can use extra libraries if I have
some Apache API that I need my
JavaScript application I can make use of
that without any problem but we can
think now we are talking about nice wine
but nice one in the Java 8 so why not
make use of new really interesting ap is
like a string API so what I'm showing
here I just parse the JSON file it's a
basically java 7 API I opening a JSON in
my file system and transform it to a
Java mucho list so I have people a lot
of people in my gmail collection and now
i will just use the string api to get
the to filter the the people i need for
example here people that string so I'm
maxing accessing the string API filter
here i'm passing a function so in the
java and probably we are going to use
lambdas here i can pass anonymous
function to return I want just a person
that is and that has IH bigger than 18
and is a female I can map the person to
my email and just data for each imprint
it so we can use even the new API is in
the Java so I can make use of the string
API collectors API a Java date and time
API that are api's we
war really needing in Java and even
JavaScript hasn't anything like that but
we need to add that nice one is new and
have been updated every Java 8 Update
has improvements in the nest farm so the
last update 20 we have a couple of
updates about performance in the you
played 40 we're going to have more
performance improvements here we have
security improvement that filters
classes you can access from your
JavaScript application so you you will
not allow the script to use any class
there will be as there will be a future
a future and we have support for the in
maxscript 6 they start to support the
maxixe in the update 40 and there is a
the other other gep that is about
performance with lace compilation for
javascript but now how can we make use
out that together and scale which to use
our ow our JavaScript developers how to
get all these in scale for our
production code not just talking about
performance not just performance but how
to make our JavaScript making use of
JavaScript files and make disorganized
and use in production how we can use
that well we can we can we have sorry we
have some technologies to leverage as
well we have three new architectures
that can you that we can make use to
achieve that well before we start
talking about those technologies we must
understand some concepts behind it and
the first one is a vein driving
architettura it's not much different and
event writing program model which we use
in desktop and mobile apps is the same
thing but II a scarab Arteta use a
concept khaled
event loops event loops are single
threads that handles requests and and
also use synchronous threads synchronous
threads to process long-running jobs so
there's a bitch loops also are as
synchronous and non-blocking i/o like
the the new firm accel y are become more
popular every day no GS and edge
framework and other character is of this
architecture as they are rigid they are
reactive seasonings the rack chief
sustain is assistance that is responsive
resilient l asked and message driving
responsive means that the Sistine have
consistent response times and have the
usability and user experience the
resilient means that the season remains
responsive even after failure so the
system failure and in connect over after
it and the last also the system code
improving grow in its skin servers with
great scalability maintaining the the
responsiveness and final the message
driving its kind of system nice to have
the communication in a synchronous way
using the mechanism life like the event
bus which I mechanism can read which
runs on turn ons kind of seasoning to
communication to send the message
between nodes in the cluster so here's
how even driving act atra looks like and
you see the clients requests goes da
Vinci loops we and our proceeds process
and after if the day job is a
long-running job most workers which are
you separated threads so they'd come
back to the main loop to finally answer
and to the client it's kind of act a
true is used by no GS rights everyone
here I think have heard about nodejs
nodejs use this kind of protector so I
Jesus becoming more popular
use it by avatar in vertex and we'll
talk about that soon I button like no GS
avatar in vertex works well in cluster
and can have multiple events loops I
actually own vente loops which is as
possible to have multiple vintage loops
to handle requests another concept I
must explain is Microsoft rack tater
this is a new buzzword of the saw
everyone do that no so are familiar with
the concept this concept but San award
and there are not precise definition
because it's on your term but it really
means that the service must be focused
only specific business logic the cyrusi
egg could be writing by separate
development teased by his model of
mentees also this kind of system is well
defined in its distributed which means
that can it can be independent for other
services and have stricter contracts to
and cow another service and also this
kind of serves a needs to be locally
because of these independence so as well
you can is writing this kind of service
again language you can use any
persistence provider you wet you can
write on subs in Java water serves
another service in JavaScript use mobile
gpu-z a rational database and so on also
Microsoft rack tater could be testable
put a it's kind of hard to together you
need you to the individual analysis is
scalable this kind of smoky architetto
can be scalable wink emoji hardware as
you found it in infrastructure
infrastructure fishes and putter for
massage providers so here's how
Microsoft shock theater looks like
it's a picture from mark fowler article
about about zark chatter so in the left
side you see the Monell each character
that attack tighter is well known
everyone use this verb for so many years
insect that we have all the functional
food chain algae and in one server you
want in block of code so to hit twist
scale this kind of server you'll need
hip lacage those servers across hundreds
of machines it's a really hard to scale
and the other hand we have separated
each services independently separated in
blocks so to scale a single serves
you'll need to replicate this serves at
the microsoft wrecked etter use is use
it by big players like amazon netflix
any babe so and now it's time to talk
about technologies to be able to use
kind of directed octet rose i talk
previous and how many here have heard
about vertex would and then a chip
framework no one okay so i'll give you a
little introduction about vertex and
what's Varitek's vertex a lightweight
reactive application platform on JVM it
runs on top of an edge framer key which
is a synchronous avenge driving
application framework to provide a
high-performance really high for
pharmacy assistants it's really fast so
vertex was created and is being
maintained it by t fox from head hat
it's also a sabotage project is under I
eclipse Malaysia umbrella and use up
wash license cheesier a vertex wins the
jacks innovation awards for the most
innovative technology and chief Fox his
creator has a session inches you
events Thursday October to telemeter JM
right so I highlight some of the
benefits of vertex and besides besides
an oj s similarity there are different
vertex have unique features and the
others many issues of Nadia's it's
really true pull God so you can write
applications in many languages like Java
JavaScript groovy Payton even PHP so
many so many languages and you also can
mixing those language in the same
application so you can write a small
part of the application in JavaScript
another part in Java and so on and twist
playing better up the vegetables I oh I
the final term that is where to go
vertical at the time from the vertex
framework average code is a small amount
of code by that Dutchman's in average
case vertex instance average cook can be
a synchronous or synchronous the
synchronize worker vehicles at home runs
in in separate threads really long
running jobs jdbc axis and song and they
run on top of the vegetables which they
makin is my pocket previous that do the
communication between the dis components
and a leaving a cluster so vector with
vertex you can create reactive
applications using some extensions like
the RX x RX framework for java from
netflix off switch micros microsoft's
really because of the nature of the
rating applications vertex to write
application vertex really need you to
separate the functionalities anyhow i
also i strong community involvement it
has a google group which you can ask
questions and get it
answers from the community it's really
good so it's the mediator of vertex it
shows a a very tax instance right on the
left you see the Venge loop running and
some radicals in the right you see the
background workers that they are as our
synchrony a synchronous verticals and
you see in the middle icon a model
running as synchronous es ink yet in a
worker vertical so you can have in the
same model in the same application some
serves that you are synchronous and some
types that are synchronous and they run
on top of the winch bus and of course
inside the JVM as there are other
benefits to highlight i thinkI it's
really powerful so i must highlight
highlights these benefits it is very to
deploy it has comment line api it has a
his own model system it's his office
d'Epinay such at the runtime don't
download these dependences and has very
good to support also sports maven Gradle
to develop and to also to deploy
applications and has two features that I
must I must say and the first one is fat
fetch are they create archive file with
all the penises inside and including
vertex itself and am a method so you can
deploy the jar it's a big drive file i
right with ya bum in a jar so you get a
application running in a single piece of
only a single file in Reverse every weds
you just need a JVM on the on the server
of course so it's a really powerful
feature and out we deploy and we can
change the code without restarting the
instance of course so
I must highlight my preferred a feature
that is native cluster and high
availability hu has a cast internally so
you get these two features for for free
of course you can configure the cluster
by your XML from heather cast but we
found a parameter you can start cluster
vertex my application with high up
hilchos so it's really easy together I
you show you example after and I'll
start up are tons of extensions
available it's really true right
extension because it has its own model
system and the community have many
models available such as Momiji B+
sikkim icicle RX Java Reggie's and even
JC adapter which ends you have a connect
directly to the adapter and that I use
it in the demo so but every technology
has its challenges and protects becoming
more popular every day but you like so
me and enterprise filters or have some
some challenges I must I'm say HTH
pleaded commendation a end examples
which is a i think is a common problem
of the deep open source projects or all
the produce and the monitoring is to
pour it is jmx enable but have only few
attributes that you can monitor so it's
not production really had two monitors
in turn we really need to do some work
in that feature and she doesn't have
distributed a char data so you in the
classic you can't we had no don't have
built-in and cluster data so when I
choose another filter search has a cast
and G has doesn't have the distributed
transactions which are a common
a common feature from Java EE
architettura it babe transactions are
not rebooted yet and doesn't have nested
transactions too and finally the nest
horn ninjacore range where so is not
official sport but will be and to give
to the debugging you need you i DJ pro
request he had to be married in the
hippo story because it did you didn't
work so but i must say that new new
version we will be released soon i think
they are adults and there are so many
improvements and features that you
improve a lot the vertex experience the
first one right x3 even only jdk 8 and
above which means that it will not work
in java 6 and r 7 and each each you
leverage the fullness horn and lambda
support and the model system that a
coronation have was rapid so it hu has
of the deputies at the build time as a
normal job applications but the room
time dependence resolution also be
possible through extension so they would
you be possible to extinction you
reference moving or node modules the
penises The Closer char data finally
gets reading that version so will be
possible to three boot maps and sets and
achieve Lee and the vegetables has a lot
of vaping improvements I will say about
you job then proxies that a day you
generate interfaces so you be possible
to communicate to another applications
on other modules with a static interface
currently it use JSON so to communicate
with another
model you you'll need you Jason so in
the next version we put possible to do
it in a dramatic way yeah beautifully
and another feature is codex the current
ratio use and mainly jus transport layer
in the transverse layer in the next
version will be possible to write from
your own codec just like an edge from
Iquitos and also that they immerse t
they will support officially some extra
features besides a car and such as mamu
gb sake has which are ab web sockets &amp;amp;
Roach major web server and Iraq's
extensions and some others so it was a
lot information the best minutes about
this boat vertex I think's enough I run
a demo to demonstrate yeah we urge whose
case we had and the motivation was we
had a legacy Java yep prior to Java 7 so
we can't see creature our web sockets
don't WebSocket because the job is 61
sport and they also can't do
non-blocking i/o so we created a vertex
application which can be scalable it's
more is to to get to scale and in choose
the javascript to other language to
create this application because you have
a script how Michelle said is a
synchronous by nature so it's easier to
get a synchronous programming model with
JavaScript so i will show the
application also the application have
some constraints each must be much
tennis which you have with 10 support
and delivery time of the message must be
Larten second to a hundred thousand
points and
you need to run in low cost I'm a salsa
to instance we suck witch a witch is a
collage harder so i right
so I started our voyage for application
server and got vm server but since case
I use it whitefly and this server well
in this eyebrows apology and the Java
yep I creative a app and a deployed you
also i started to fight x instance in a
cluster so you see see here i started to
very taxing instance and gets this
instance gets in the cluster you see
here the cluster has 33 members so I run
the instance these applications have to
front chance one for the server you want
in one for the client of course the
server you do send a message to do the
clients sake but each client's has its
own identifier so in the left I you see
I I've seen a mystery from the server to
the right clients i selected the read
write a message and send i think noni
received because no need II was
registered so I registered the first
client in red sad food is second one in
green satisficing a message now the
right one will receive a message and the
green no essential green now the green
received and the right now and goat
known receive right the demo see is a
simple use case but very challenged to
writing a Java 5m example I think a
really great the grid point here in this
demo is that we have a java ee 6
application which do not support web
socket so we can leverage this kind of
application so you have a legacy
application how
you use new technology and still keep
your legacy application in a acceptable
cost so we have to use new technologies
you have to support new developers so
how to use that that's the point we
choose to to connect different
technologies even JavaScript so we can
use our JavaScript developers to
implement new services that connect to a
legacy application I think that's the
grid point we want to show here right
and I great parties i created the java
app of course and the vertex app in the
java yep i show the code we have an
unknown I AJ be a major is driving being
so the message arrived be registers in a
channel notification service so how java
ee communicates with a vertex
application in job using javascript so
vertex has a model called JC adapter
which use Java connector etc its
architecture to communicate and Java
with the external world and I will show
the vertex vertex code vertex has some a
mangy as 58 x is full writing with with
javascript using as Hornets engine and
the deploys an app this app I'll show is
a very except right it's use vertex
required vertex see how to use Java some
java types EG has its own web server
just to serve web page HTML page and
each has some methods to register
declines and final it has a web socket
handler i create a web socket vertex / /
tags to the web page front I page
communicates
and there let me see and here i have an
outsider to communicate with web server
out da cunha communication with i did
other communication with using the job
connector architektur so I i get a
channel in the the java cut notification
service and use this channel to to do
the communication above sites and write
these mr. drive beams on receives
messages and new answers to send a
message to the client to the vertex
application i need to write a GI with an
itch you use jndi right I i get a very
text connection factor do they look up
in the agenda ang I and of course in the
master soul vertex application we
receive and hip apply this message to
the client to get is I use it simple web
sockets I will show you the decline was
web sockets as the technology to receive
the message in real time in so very text
application in sta moi was epoxy as a
box to scale money servers a month i
graduate i said a we need you to support
up to 100,000 clients so i can start up
to a hundred nodes and the legacy app
doesn't saw a suffer from performance
issues because of geez this new feature
that i need to write so I you back to
the presentation
let's hope it work yeah so our moments
so this demo has rooted and in a
scalable applications because it doesn't
impact on the legacy app also this demo
achieved the constraints are moved mrs
much damage has message she delivers to
solder asia up at one hundred percent
with less than second and it's stable so
this is important they like acceptance
suffer the impact off of the new feature
integrated in the code so it's only
proof of concept they called the obits
polymer in github are you sure later
virtue which could be probably a lot its
own to show you what i was talking about
that vertex can can use it to create
really interesting solutions instant is
too tight too I clatters avenged Ryback
tattered in Microsoft Azure that's it
okay let's see it's working okay we are
back not just vertex but we have another
technology that we can use to leverage
javascript to the server it's a but this
technology was to project both our name
it avatar so we have avatar jes that has
as mango to run the node modules
unmodified or we've really feel
modifications on the JVM so the the
target here is to get all the npm
modules and run on top of the JVM
without modifications or with few
modifications when it's not when it's
impossible and that's a basic avatar jes
architecture so we have the Avatar
server that is written in Java running
on top of the JVM we have the JavaScript
context we're running an asshole of
course in an old app running inside that
so we have the no jab letting brun node
modules in that that the app is running
on the on a JavaScript loop but that
that app can start different event loops
so we can have multiple events tradus in
Java running and responding for a single
note app so we do not stop the
JavaScript event loop when you can have
developed responsible applications and
not just that but we can have more than
one node application running inside a
JavaScript context so we can have
multiple multiple nodes applications on
top a JVM in each application which with
multiple java threads so we can have
multiple responsible applications using
and sharing node modes running on top
nawet rjs but avatar jes and can be used
with the Avatar project then
it's another project that is sponsored
by Oracle and basically focus on to
serve the fin server architecture so
nowadays we have a lot of single page
applications running on angularjs
backbone and other JavaScript frameworks
and basically we served that
applications with wrathful with
WebSockets and server sent events so how
can we develop that in JavaScript in our
servers well we have no Jas but we can
use the JVM with avatar a litter has
support for thing several architectures
in this built on top avatar jes so it
uses avatar GS to have access to node
modules so which project has his goals
will well define it and avatar has a an
architecture that leverage how he can
access Java EE so the basic avatar
architecture is this both in green where
we have application views so not just
the services responding answering rest
web sockets ossc events we also have a
template HTML engine that can answers 8
email so we can answers a page or we can
answers services and these services can
leverage and use Java EE applications
how it is done it's basically the avatar
runtime avatar runtime can well the
first implementation of avatar in time
was written to access java ee api's so
we have avatar services that are called
in its documentation as data providers
so we can have a jpa data provider so
from the JavaScript you can access the
JPA domain model so we can have access
to other rest
a jax-rs API so we can can have access
to any java ee application ap is so
basically in the JavaScript code we can
access Java EE ap is it like in it it
two runs inside the glass fish nowadays
it's just super class fish but in the
future it will support weblogic too it's
an article project so it's basically
covering the Oracle application servers
and here we have a little sample so
basically we declare the Avatar
requirement so it's the dependency I'm
saying at depends on org slash glassfish
is elijah avatar where it's the when I
saying okay I have an avatar application
and I can register a rest service so we
have a lot of registers here in this epi
in this case I'm showing how to respond
to a request on the REST API I'm saying
okay I have an application and the URL
Fibonacci I will respond for a
calculation on the Fibonacci so here I
have just a helper function calculating
the Fibonacci for 30 and respond a HTTP
code 200 and sent that it was calculated
this sample Fibonacci helper application
is like this so it's simple is just for
the presentation to show that the
concept so basically it's a JavaScript
and as I said it's Hester for the red
service this function has this own get
another function that respond Donna in
enhanced two parameters a request and a
response and I can write in the response
and receive any request parameters it
has been sent for the client so it's
simple to to develop and it does not
have really good tools yet
but we can for example make a deploying
the GlassFish so you can use the
GlassFish comment line yes admin make a
deploy in a folder so we just put out
the JS files in a folder with very
specific dot project or projects file
and you can run the application running
server just asking a accessing app
folder it's the same as the folder we
made the deploy okay it's simple but
it's does not have really professional
tools yet for the development avatar
heard some key benefits for the further
for us the developers so basically the
avatar services are was developed and
based on the actor like concurrence
model so they are they were created to
be scalable we have full support for
most of the npn modules because of the
Avatar GS so most of the the modules are
supported and for the job environment
the Java ecosystem we have a strong java
ee integration so for our people that
need to use javascript and in a
javascript in a java ee application it's
a good option should be tested in
debugging so we know that javascript
does not have really good tools for our
debugging there are some just warning we
know that net means has a good support
for some of JavaScript applications but
when you are saying to run the server we
do not have really good tools yet but
avatar and with the Leonardo's patch we
have the support for the vertex two and
what we have really tricky challenges to
work with avatar the most important my
rainbow pinner is the weak community
involvement so we are not sure but this
project has really low activity from the
articles I
so the commits a really spark is parts
we have one or two commits each month
and but we know that Oracle has been
talking about avatar a lot so probably
they have some plans for the future and
we hope you hope so because it's really
interesting project the if you do not
use glassfish horrible logic probably
it's not an option but if it's your
application server of choice it's a good
option to be really evaluated and the
support for no sicko is just for the
article no sequel so if you need a
skinless database you need to go for our
ikonos eco now maybe more adapters will
be developed but it's not public oh well
that's for about avatar and what we did
some benchmarks on top of all these
experimentation we have some time I
think we can show something we did we
did four scenarios using node using
avatar using avatar jes using vertex and
test it is tressa to eat a little bit
and we have posting including a database
it's 11 scenario we have the second one
returning a simple JSON response the
third one just doing some string
concatenation and the 450 night
calculation as i showed you before so we
use the node j nodejs Oh 10 avatar JSON
vertex avatar ngek 885 for these
benchmarks so they'll show the results
just for the Fibonacci because of the
time but in the end we have the links
for the full results we haven't they
already published in the github so for
the Fibonacci calculating the Fibonacci
430 we have here the transaction rate so
higher is better with the back the bests
our vertex before inst
see running on Java so here we can see
that steel vertex or even avatar running
on JavaScript has worse performance than
running on Java so the best was Java and
here we have the yellow it in green its
vertex with one instance running to on
Java so on JavaScript we have poor
performance in the transaction rate we
have the response time so here lower is
better so we have the avatar we have
again vertex with Java in better
performance here in the bottom and the
javascript has worse response time the
difference is not hire really high but
we have a better it's to a better
performance on when running on Java not
in JavaScript here we have the memory
consumption here we again lower is
better so the best were again running on
Java but we have vertex with java jdk SE
really high so not just for java but
some scenarios it was really high and
here the highlight is for node nodejs
has a really good memory footprint so
it's to a choice but you can use it in
java with nashville and we've really
good response and performance what these
graphs show us is that which to ha has
room for improvement swiftness one we
have tested a lot of common scenarios we
have that is just rest mostly so when
you're using this kind of technology we
see that we have really room for
improvements in s1 but that that improv
improvements I've been doing we have top
with some are
good stuff this work are are still
happening and as we said the opiate 40
we have some improvements we have run at
this benchmark on with each Farry that
you are in early access and we have some
better scenarios but some scenarios are
worse so we are going to send these
results probably in the future and see
if we can have better results in the the
photo Java HUP dates well I think we
have five minutes if someone have some
questions to ask if you can answer we
are open for questions thank you if you
in the end here we have the the links
for the all the source code we did so
feel free to
it just came up on Desmond performance
there's a session going on right now
yeah window we wanted to be there and we
talked to like lancer right I don't know
how to pronounce his name he talked to
us he wanted to be here so which was
impossible in terms of use that we like
to see a lot of that is going into a
feel for ya right so all of that there
again but with the testing that we've
done well I guess I should switch things
a little bit so what we're doing with
avatar in weave a session on wednesday
at three o'clock right we're going to
the avatars burgers we're changing our
approach a little bit so if you look you
mentioned the advert rjs which is the no
compatibility yeah then we have the
Avatar project which is all about
writing higher-level services and it has
a kind of Mormon prescribed model for
defining services and
side and like you mentioned the ER
operability so what we're going to
probably do they are going to do is make
em think investigo right so we're to
take what we have napped rjs and making
a note compatibility we're going to take
what we have with the Avatar service or
the sum of the enter key field like the
job in the ER operability were the
multiple event loops and so on I'm going
to fixing to build them into a single
semillon Genia okay yeah so you won't
have the for example good naps over you
that right and we've also done some
prototyping and work around you know I'm
not going with Mission Control and all
that kind of stuff so it's more of a the
kind of environment but no developer
writes back or expect or if I'm a job
developer that one to investigate no
it's still more of a natural no
experience it's over to talk a lot about
that
oh yeah we've got a testing and we found
it things to be pretty sensitive to when
the jit fix it Yeah right and so you
know some of those numbers I think we
should talk off performance product
manager I don't write as much good as I
used to write so we're getting really
good performance now once the gym pizza
and which once you start eating two
cones but also to know we actually do
you know pretty well we haven't
published a number to get because we're
still doing all the analysis and the
work behind it but it's frightfully good
day is it's better than what those
graphs show a lot better from the memory
footprint perspective yeah it's tough
right it's a jvm versus write a generic
one time versus a very specific run time
getting that JavaScript at so I don't
know if I'll ever get in
per se if you look at it from the
perspective of running one eventually
this is one event yeah both avatar you
can actually the same jvm run one copy
of the application for four as we have
multiple instances of the entering the
same kvm it changed the equation so
depends how you know that that's okay as
you can see in the in the graphs far let
me see ya that's the memory but most of
the Avatar memory consumption is because
it's running inside of the the server
and the GlassFish in this sample so when
you run vertex that we are running more
more stuff here in the in the Avatar
sample then we are running in the node
or running in the vertex so it's not
fair to compare but it that's the point
we need to see what it happen so if you
are already running a java application
why not use java tar right it's the
footprint is all right there you are
ready paid paid that price so that's the
point I think that that's the point
because that's that's the point to two
storey this kind of thing make these
tests and show that for the people i
think we have these scenarios and we
need to as act that we need we need to
twist stir in and try the this kind of
approach i think that that's the the
point thank you thank everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
