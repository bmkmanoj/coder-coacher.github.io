through a secure development community
and I am surely answerin and I work in
Oracle's global product security group
and just a quick show of hands when I
was putting this presentation together
the emphasis is on building software so
it's a secure development community so
I'm going to be talking mainly about
that not so much about the deployment or
the IT and that side of it so I just
want to make sure that that's if you are
development people or okay and I
certainly I will be touching on the IT
thing and I can i can certainly you know
address those questions after the
presentation as well okay so starting
the agenda there is basically five parts
to it there's kind of the intersection
on builders breakers and defenders I'll
talk a little bit about the fact that it
yes we actually do have a software
security assurance life cycle but the
heart of the whole presentation is
around actually building the community
that we've built up within Oracle and
how that's been changing actually and
expanding as well as where it's going in
the future so why builders breakers and
defenders and I'm sure most of you are
aware that that's an OS vision for what
they see in their community actually
Oracle is a supporter of a lost one of
their corporate sponsors and the reason
I like the slide is and help and why i
use it is essentially like back in 2012
when i first went to RSA i actually went
to building security and workshop and
they talked a lot about tools techniques
methods processes you know the how of
getting things done in fact 99% of it
was that and it was kind of like okay
but you need people to do something you
know you just can't have those things
that are standalone so and I went
through the entire conference of that
until about thursday when Jeremiah
Grossman got up and he started talking
about builders breakers and defenders
it's like oh thank you know somebody is
going to address the people side of this
and he gave this definition I thought it
was a very good one to keep in mind to
what i was doing within Oracle in effect
if you look at the Oracles definitions
we do have builders breakers and
defenders essentially what i'm going to
be talking about as my development
community and they're definitely
builders we have breakers we have our
own ethical hacking team as well as and
i will be talking a little bit more
about this near the end of the
presentation about our product QA
testers and how they're getting involved
in doing a lot more towards not just
making sure the application works but
how to break it and finally defenders
okay Oracle's actually one we're
actually one of our biggest customers if
not our biggest customer we use all of
our own products and they actually build
other systems around our core products
so we get a lot of information for those
and there is an is M community
information security managers community
that I work very closely with towards
getting information out and you know in
taking information that they find around
the potential vulnerabilities and
weaknesses within our products okay
second part of the agenda I'm going to
before I talk about the life cycle I
want to address a little bit about what
our corporate structure looks like
because it's slightly different than
what a lot of people may be interested
in or experience within their own
company one of the things that is of
note is the fact that all of our
security organizations are grouped
together global product security global
information security physical security
as well as our corporate security
architecture board they're all grouped
together you know usually physical
security has a tendency to be under real
estate and facilities information
security a lot of times is under IT not
within Oracle we're all group together
and we all report into the chief
corporate architect to Edwards grubbin
it reports directly to Larry and that
gets down to actually the last part
there they let third bullet it makes
from the product security side of things
it makes a
easier to build security in if you're in
the architecture the corporate
architecture office our life cycle it's
a you know pretty straightforward we
have product definition and design we
have product development actually a
little bit different here we have what
we call ongoing assurance because our
deployment is actually to customers and
as well as to ourselves so we're looking
at for example critical patch updates
and any potential things that may arise
the remediation of security
vulnerabilities so it's slightly
different we also do include though in
that ongoing assurance information
around secure configuration for example
so that you can deploy deploy things
much more securely so what is OS sa okay
it must be designed securely and as I
mentioned we build security in at the
sub component the component level and
will again I will address it a little
later on with the community aspect we
make sure that adequate security
controls are in place that particularly
core modules are used you don't go out
and Vince your own crypto for example
things like that that's a no-no it must
be developed security securely secure
design and crew and encoding principles
must be followed and again I'll talk a
little bit more about that later and it
should be developed in a secure
environment you know where security is
taken into consideration all along the
way and then it must also as I mentioned
with secure configuration upon
deployment you want software it must
provide a reasonably secure state by
default when deploy and we've done a lot
with in the last several years towards
with our development groups about
producing secure configuration guides
and they're widely available to all of
our customers so what kinds of things
happen in these phases well definition
that's where are you you know
traditional requirements gathering you
have some design reviews we actually
have a customer advisory council that we
take stuff in front of her some
validation
that these actually it's actually going
to work and then it is secure
development when we do an awful lot of
code reviews us a lot of some we use a
lot of standard tools we have quite an
interesting security checklist process
in place and I will talk again about
that a little bit later and then as I
mentioned augering assurance the secure
configuration we do security evaluations
you know for our government customers in
particular that's very important we do a
lot of ongoing security training as well
as the remediation of anything that
maybe we didn't catch up front in terms
of security weaknesses so if we look at
this this is like a lower-level look at
the same thing when you have product
definition we make sure that security
requirements must be documented in the
design and functional specs and that is
done down to a component level you as I
mentioned you don't go off and roll your
own basic core modules you have to use
both the stuff that is Oracle approved
the third party if you're using anything
third party software that must be
approved and that you know basically
it's vetted for security the third point
their architecture architectural risk
analysis and I have there some bugs can
never be catch and that's actually from
one of my ethical hackers who wrote both
an interesting article and presented on
one of my Spock summits on that that
basically gave several examples where it
didn't look obvious but it did introduce
a weakness in in at the design stage and
you might wind up if you don't catch it
there you can wind up living it with
that for a very very long time and it
can be very very expensive to fix so
product development as i mentioned
security checklist will talk a lot about
that later we make very extensive use of
a lot of types of tools static and
dynamic analyzers we have a corporate
license for fortified by the way we also
some groups use Coverity depending on
what they are developing we have our own
in-house parfait tool we use web inspect
we use various buzzers we actually um
build our own pleasures one very popular
workshop at at a my summit training that
I had was on basically writing your own
pleasures is a hands-on workshop and as
well as I mentioned the ongoing code
reviews we do those ad nauseum quite
frankly and they always root out a lot
of good problems ongoing assurance is
mainly around the secure configuration
guide that's what most of our customers
would see internally we do a lot of
ethical hacking product assessments so
that going forward with additional
releases what wasn't caught and design
and stuff and what our teams catch you
know we can address our own IT people do
a lot of penetration testing and they
use cuales for example and hand us back
a lot of information regarding that
thick could be helpful then as well as I
mentioned along with the critical patch
updates and and the that customers see
internally we do an awful lot we're
doing much more with a lot of metrics
reports we look at vulnerability a nap
analysis we look at for example we have
quarterly reports that go out to all of
our development groups that point out
gee here's your backlog and why haven't
you fixed this and oh by the way you
better they are ranked according to
severity you know and really doing a lot
in that arena to clean up stuff as well
as keep stuff from happening again there
you know there's lessons learned in all
this okay secure development standards
really the heart of the matter this is
something that we have that's our
they're quite large actually and then
concentrate not only the coding which we
started out with a lot more now on
design and testing guidelines and
there's examples of what to do what not
to do it talks about what what the
Oracle approved methods are etc gives
you a lot of very practical advice as
well and we've also recently
incorporated industries
Android's like from certs for c and java
so you know it's not just a lot of stuff
that we learned but a lot of stuff that
within the industry so the other
interesting thing about why these are
development standards as we're starting
to incorporate a lot more around process
and roll definitions so for example when
I talk about my community and what those
roles are those are written up and they
are part of the development standards
okay we're finally getting down to the
really great part of the hip
presentation and my estimation and
that's a secure development community
and basically it's really key as I
mentioned I'm you can have a lot of
methods and tools and all this other
kinds of things but you really need
somebody to do it you know you see all
these activities here on this screen
which you know I've been talking about
it gets down to well guess what somebody
still has to do it so it's really the
the people side of things and getting
things done and we have what is called
the spot community and we can have a lot
of fun with that term you know
especially if you're an old Trekkie in a
Star Trek fan and we've we've had fun
with that in the past but Spock stands
for security points of contact so and we
shorten that to the Spock community
currently I have 916 Spock's okay going
down now we do have quite a range of
products but these also range down from
the component level of products to take
a look at security and that number has
grown I think the it's been about well I
just have my fifth slot summit so I
think the the community has really been
around and growing over the last six
years so it's been kind of interesting
and we've learned a lot so currently as
I say there are 911 of these 916 of
these people it grew why i say 911 i was
another project i had loaded 911 and
then had six more pop up so or a few
more pop up so it isn't a 916 and as I
you can see there the doers now it's
interesting because it's really a
centralized virtual community they're
spread out over several different
development groups we do obviously we do
things like applications we do industry
applications we do you know core
applications like eat this is sweet we
do a database enterprise manager we do
package systems that these days we do
hardware so you know we have quite a
quite a selection of development groups
in this community and one of the points
about this is meant to be flexible so
that you can adapt things and again I'll
talk a little bit more about this later
about what but when when we get to the
thing about what's Fox actually do so
each of these groups though has a main
spot for lack of a better word it's
actually called a security lead and they
provide the local leadership and at the
for the particular development group and
they're the ones that really define what
set of things make sense for their
Spock's okay there may be more emphasis
on on one particular task in
applications who are example then there
is in database and there's you know
there's good reasons for that and
basically the security lead is has four
main responsibility areas obviously he
takes over and does the ongoing activity
with this box in it in his area his or
her area he will start he or she will
start a workspace or something where
they can interchange information he's
also very often the technical expert for
what goes on within the product family
and a regarding security also is the
first person we asked to review when
we're looking at compliance issues
regarding products security and
basically you know person is the
security compliance for the product
family and essentially they have to be
well respected senior level people
because they gotta deal with a lot of
different levels within the company from
very senior upper level management down
to like
every day developers you know people and
center groups like myself so it's quite
a range of people that he that he or she
has to deal with okay so what exactly is
a spot as i mentioned can't say this
often enough it's really is the key role
to achieve building security in from the
bottom up all the way from bottom to top
they are security product of experts
within each product component team they
actually generally are senior level
developers a lot of my groups look for
level 5 which is a very high level
experience the developer to do this they
want the person we want the person to
really care about security whether or
not they have any formalized training is
another matter but really have an
interest in doing security they very
much are again they have to be vote well
respected because they're the liaison
between the security lead and our group
for compliance reasons on the components
and they really need to know a lot about
the product life cycle and all the
activities going in with their so the
basically the primary principle out of
all of this is the spock is responsible
for the security assurance of the
component overall so if you don't take
anything else away take that point with
you and as i mentioned it's meant to be
a flexible model some of the things will
you know like your gas mileage will vary
some of the activities within a
particular development group will vary
and the other point to is this is a very
busy job and we actually has started and
we encourage that some of these has to
be delegated to other project members
and again it also is quite smart because
the Spock The Anointed Spock and they
move off into a different group and then
what are you going to do so you really
want you want to backup you want someone
who cares about security it's a good way
of getting people up to speed and caring
about security so what else does the
spot does you well ed addresses a lot of
questions from other spots about his his
or her particular component and a
security perspective they share practice
is across a family as I mentioned the
security lead has the ongoing activity
of the community but the spots
participate and a lot of them now do a
lot of experience sharing and I have
actually implemented that in some of my
summits as well that because if they
learn and they have a lot of great deal
really interesting stuff going on that
could be shared they have to be a
juggler you know really so they have a
lot of stuff to do and they have to
figure out what's important on what day
and get it done and you know it could be
the new releases paramount today but
then a hot issue comes in from a
customer so you know there's all of that
going on they do for their particular
component they are responsible for
security compliance for the product
security compliance and we like to have
them to be very proactive in in doing
their component security as I mentioned
all of this experience sharing I'm my
last bak newsletter i'll talk about in a
minute but i had a lot of them now
writing articles about what they found
and i would like more of that to share
that that knowledge okay keeping on
track I mentioned about security
checklist yes they actually do a lot of
writing code to it's kind of like we
would like and that's why I've written
up the role that definition is at some
point I think those I would like to see
those turn into full-time positions but
right now we do have role definitions
it's been up actually the work has been
getting management to to basically see
that this is important and and now again
touch on this a little bit we actually
do have some of the development groups
using those role definitions for
performance appraisals and stuff so that
it is getting more widely respected and
known so over time hopefully these will
be full-time positions so but for right
now they also do a lot of development
work so so getting back to the security
check lists here and this is a
screenshot
what's really kind of interesting this
really if there was anything that's a
terms of development a key task force
box it's doing this because it's needed
for product release and it does cover
the product down the lowest component
it's automated is completely
customizable it can be extended to
include new technologies all of these
little things when you click on them
they can it they'll expand and you can
only it can be written so that you see
only what is available for your product
you don't have a lot of superfluous
information there's been a lot of time
and effort spent by one of my colleagues
and product security to make the
security checklist process is automated
and as pleasant as possible considering
the number of things that it needs to
cover so that's a screenshot of it I
certainly we can certainly help you up
if you're more interested in finding out
more about the security checklist
process the second thing that we use is
the security Court card and I've
actually if you notice i purchase a lot
of data out of this I didn't want to
embarrass any development groups but
it's basically a red green yellow system
you know green is hate you're great
you're in compliance red is probably not
where you want to be and this has been
used its key management tool more than
getting the product is kind of the
opposite end of the spectrum from the
checklist which which is available to
help us get the product release out the
door towards really being the key
management tool to being in compliance
and security compliance is actually
graded in several areas which kind of is
an ice cruncher here but there you know
as I mentioned the secure configuration
guides whether you're using the security
check lists are you using the the Oracle
approved libraries there's a bunch of
stuff that that you can get great graded
red green and yellow on how active in
Swat community is certainly one of them
and this is reviewed at the executive
management level including it does go up
to Larry Ellison our CEO he is very
interested in security obviously the
background of Oracle and the Oracle
database coming out of the CIA CIA
project sort of governs some of that but
essentially security as I
mention way back in the beginning of the
presentation it is a key corporate
initiative we really care about security
both from our own perspective our own
selfish one as well as for customers so
binding the community together or how do
we do that well what works I have a very
successful Spock newsletter that goes
out once a month it's changed over time
there's a lot of interesting stuff in it
and in fact some of that stuff is
timeless and I was thinking a couple of
weeks ago in a discussion with one of my
other colleagues that jeez there should
be a way I'd like to figure out a way to
kind of reuse that information right now
that it is posted but it would be nice
it was searchable for example we have
annual Spock summits that i mentioned i
just had the fifth one at the beginning
of june and when i started it you know
it was like oh yeah we're going to have
a spock summit okay and i never really
thought that I'd be up saying that i was
having a fifth one and that it has
changed so much basically it was two
days at first it was more informal in in
terms of what was covered it tended to
hit a lot of process stuff now it's
expanded too well a week and things are
going on all the time it's like Java
Juan it's a mini Java wine and we have
we had all day tools sessions for
example as well as the hands-on fuzzing
workshop that I mentioned all kinds of
things we also do cover of course any
new secure security process type things
as well as vulnerability informations we
have a CBS s workshop for example
because now we're grading all of our
vulnerabilities in terms of severity and
we use CBS s it's really quite an
interesting a array of things so now
we've also had increased in tendence
this last one the beginning of june i
had well over 300 people went the first
one i had something like 175 we've also
done these regionally in india and
europe as well as here in the US
and as I say the emphasis this year has
been more on increased emphasis i would
say a lot more on practical hands-on
content stuff that you can use when you
get back on the job okay so and that's
been very very well received we also
essentially do have several specialized
mailing lists on various topics so it
for example there's a secure development
tools mailing list that's very popular
and is very very much used actually we
have specific Spock web conferences on
technical security concepts I just did
one also up and i'll be talking more
about the QA perspective in a minute but
we I just had one on functional testing
for example and and I'm having one I had
one on Java security features roadmap
I'm planning 14 October on demystifying
fortify so we have a lot of these types
of practical types of Spock web
conferences going on and most recently
that's how I know about the 911 locks I
have we start we actually implemented a
recognition program and we have
identification tags and badges basically
that we can place in the corporate
directory so that you're known as a
Spock and people can say oh yeah it
works in so that's person works and such
and such a grouping is this block that's
a good person if I have a security
question to talk to so I'd like to do
more in that area of recognition because
as I mentioned that the question I got
earlier it's a big job you know and I'd
like people to be recognized for it work
in progress as I mentioned I'd like to
get more of this box to share their
experiences not just within their group
but across product families I mentioned
about the Spock newsletter about making
that searchable well yeah we do have a
centralized security wiki which we're
starting to reorganize because it's you
know you put stuff in there and we
started this several years ago and then
over time it just becomes a somewhat
unwieldy son and now we have some worth
newer technologies so that we're looking
at ways we can basically make that
information a lot more you
so I mentioned documented role
descriptions we have emerging secure
development standards as and again as I
mentioned the secure coding standards
themselves have essentially evolved to
include industry standards as well as
the stuff that we know and definitely we
have a lot more increased upper
management support so you know I come
into meetings we had one the other day
on security training for example and it
you know one of the senior VPS was very
interested oh and what are you doing and
it's going to help my people in that
area so you know they're starting to ask
a lot more questions or pay a lot more
attention to this what has not worked as
well and why have it as work in progress
is basically the social media type
things I have both a connect group and
an aura tweak group group set up the
Oracle Oracle connect group actually is
a closed group and that's because of the
security information we want to keep it
restricted and it's just not widely used
across the company neither is or a tweet
and that has that's so open that
everybody with an Oracle can see it
anyway so it would have very limited
usage I what things have worked seem to
be more on the local area where we have
workspaces set up if your experience
sharing but it's not easy to do the
social media thing across 916 Spock's
plus all their friends and stuff within
Oracle I haven't found a way to to make
that workable basically if any of you
have ideas let me know okay community
growth on expansion okay here come the
breakers and we're not talking about
surfing being here in California these
are actually to the QA Spock's are an
expanding segment within and there's a
growing interest i guess in an
empowering QA now that the spot model is
started and in fact i'll tell you a
little story back at the spock suleman
2011 one of my really good Spock's he
he's in a group where basically his his
application runs on an internal network
it would not likely be used outside the
firewall but he heard about cross-site
scripting and so
is you know I'm not likely to encounter
that and you know it runs on the
internal network and you know not many
people use it but what the heck i'm
going to try an experiment here and he
did and he found a serious cross-site
scripting problem and it said well you
know maybe that's not that serious well
it's because it's only used on the
intranet well what about malicious
insiders so you know he went on and
expanding this and essentially went off
and and taught his q a group how to
build a pleasure and an test for this
kind of thing and of course he they did
fix it well before it went out and
release and i'm not going to tell you a
lot of details about it but i will tell
you that actually it was within our
corporate governance risk and compliance
application that we sell to a lot of
customers so essentially something that
we were going to self to help reduce
risk could have actually introduced risk
at least from an internal perspective so
it was quite an interesting story and he
came to the 2012 Spock summit and
started telling that story and you know
that was the the growing interest and
experience sharing and it actually
basically encouraged a lot more people
to go off and deal with what they were
doing in QA so kind of a little war
story there for you there closer to
builder so they can fix vulnerabilities
much more quickly we have a centralized
ethical hacking team that I mentioned
however you know they've only got so
much bandwidth and they cannot possibly
do all the breaking that needs to be
done again the little boy story I just
told you spots themselves have been very
instrumental in getting a lot more
interest going in QA and and taking
lessons they learn because they felt
with the ethical hacking to team on
product assessments and building up this
interest so some development
organizations are evolving QA to have an
ethical hacking function as well in
particular our communications global
business unit they've just really gotten
into this thing and you know about
wanting to reduce risks in all passable
fashion around security so what is a QA
Spock well those beyond testing
phase it really starts in the design
phase and it's meant we want QA to be
involved throughout the entire
development lifecycle so you start
considering what kind of effect of
testing you're going to have at the
design stage because new stuff is being
introduced you better start figuring out
then how you're going to test it you
want the what you want the the QA people
also look at this not just from the
development perspective the works as
advertised but also from the hacker
perspective like and basically not only
how will it be used but how can it be
potentially misuse so we're doing a lot
with QA stocks in that particular area
we're trying to share security testing
practices across the family that's what
the QA Spock does he talks to other QA
foxes in the organization and they also
help address the security issues that
arise out of all of this so next couple
of slides really go into a lower level
about what how they do this and you know
that they do identify that the practices
that are needed they analyze the
requirements again they're becoming much
more like a Spock in that this is an
additional it's more of a full-time job
for them and they're trying to establish
good practices that continue not just
one offs you know going along through
the development of a release but then
how can this be sustained over time and
they also basically report and review a
lot of bugs to us they throw our bug DB
system so that again they can be handled
appropriately and not fall through the
cracks here's a few other things that
they do they basically it's just another
level of definition they determine how
that security issues can get tested into
into QA testing they review test plans
they do a lot of things around again
there's a lot of them are starting to
write their own testing tools or their
own pleasures that kind of thing they
develop the test plans and choose tool
say for the destructive testing as well
as the good testing they look at
different security environments you know
how is the product
you'd be used and again I'll talk a
little bit more about that in a minute
we have some additional community
members that right now I've been
referring to as Spock associates
otherwise known as friends of Spock's
and these are people there are other
people in development for example people
like product architecture managers who
have an interest in security security
feature developers so for example our
database security team are all smock
associates they have their own spot but
they also are all Spock associates
because there are a resource to so many
of this box and build and we use the
database underneath in the applications
so we do have that role release managers
are in this category as well they have
obviously a big interest in the security
checklist and basically the the spots
are a main provider of content that the
release management managers are really
the keepers of the checklist towards
getting the release out safely and
securely with everything in it product
development IT or as we refer to at PDI
T that's the that's the IT people that
are responsible for our development
systems and making sure that all of that
stuff has security in it our on-demand
business hosted security staff are our
friends of slots they feed us back there
to their defenders they feed us back a
lot of information about what we could
be doing better and what causes them
heartache and the kinds of things that
they found we also have a security
servers the security certified group
within support is very proactive with a
lot of customer issues and in fact that
group came and spoke at my recent Spock
summit about the type of work that
they're doing and how they can be
helpful you know in their role as
friends of lock but also again as
defenders so okay last part where we're
going with this thing okay there's
another community within Oracle that I
mentioned the information security
management community which is basically
run out of our global
mation security group and their goal is
to reduce risks optimize resource spin
contribute to the bottom line for Oracle
and that we do it safely security we
don't harm our own reputation or that of
our customers because we do have quite a
hosted business they want to make sure
that information security principles are
known throughout Oracle that the
information security manager is one of
their chief tasks is talking to the
others within their group or our line of
business or whatever is there
representing about security awareness
and you know why are you doing something
so stupid this is a better way to do it
kinds of things they want to ensure
corporate a compliant a corporate
security have also privacy compliance
across the company you know the use of
sensitive data our own data around
employees etc and what should be where
you know you sometimes you forget about
those kinds of things so and again they
do a lot of the manager of this
community is we talk a lot Tammy and I
do she's got a burden sample also she
has a newsletter that goes out regularly
she runs nuts box summits but she runs
workshops for her people we try to
interchange and exchange a lot of
information as needed a lot of her is
em's attend for example my Spock web
conferences because a that information
can be very useful to them so yeah as I
mentioned very much the defenders Oracle
is actually Oracle's largest customer
these people are the line have been in
fine of business information security
contact there they should be expert
again like I try to have people with an
interest in security who want to build
security in very much the same here that
they have an interest in information
security and privacy and that they want
to do something about it that they want
to help Oracle and drive protection of
that information across the company they
promote security of security awareness
within the line of business if he'd
obviously feedback a lot around security
risks and issues to the development
builders as well as to you know others
within Oracle
particularly there is I do want to make
you again a little bit more aware this
there is a corporate security solution
assurance process which is a mouthful
the compliments our development
lifecycle and basically the I'd say the
big difference here around this is it
concentrates on the actual deployment of
products and of our own internal systems
so it's probably more along the lines
that if you're an IT this is what you'd
be familiar with and I'm kind of really
oversimplifying it because there's a lot
of other stuff involved in this and
essentially when building systems i
actually have now internal systems
people when they're building they they
really actin whereas box so that there
may be doing more the product design and
then the product development cycle but
then they go off and they do a lot more
with see sap and deployment for example
rather than ongoing remediation so it's
slightly different just a slightly
different perspective but we do you know
we do take that into account within
Oracle uh what the direction is well
basically it's more of the same roles
that I mentioned they're documented now
they're certainly becoming more and more
concrete they you know you've all these
seams twiddling with them to make them
better we want to have greater
consistency actually the recognition
around the value of these roles have
grown I'm also now I've come to the
point where I think there's a couple of
other roles that are needed that that
need to be defined we didn't want to go
like role happy and have you know 16
gazillion of these so you know we
concentrated on Spock's box associates
and QA fox look for example i just
mention release managers so we're
finding that more and more release
managers really needs to be defined as a
role because of some of the things that
they do around security and they also
need certain access rights maybe not
quite as great as what the developments
box do but they need something above and
beyond what a normal Spock associate
would get and right now we have to set
those manually so if we build a role we
can do we can start automating a lot
aren't having actually better
consistency around that so that's one
where I think we could use we could need
some work a second one actually because
we have 916 spots and some of our groups
are quite large there is this in some
areas a need for a super spa or leads
fog or whatever we decide to call it so
an example of that is in within fusion
middleware and within our business
intelligence we have a lot of products
that we acquired as well as stuff that
we've built and my BA might be ice walk
he's like a spot like everybody else so
if she's got a lot more to worry about
and I've had ongoing discussions within
and in fact the the first spot who had
that role you know he got exhausted
quite frankly doing all this stuff and
wound up leaving he still acts
interestingly enough as a resource of
the group but he said you know I'm just
done this is a lot of work and so I'm
now on the second generation and we've
been working quite a bit with him
because he has like this mini smock
community within a local community and
and how do we and how do we make that
better and easier for people to deal
with so that's probably another role
that's coming out of this there's also a
need for better metrics we've started
doing an awful lot around
vulnerabilities and that kind of things
but it would be nice also to measure the
good stuff you know we talked about the
scorecard a little bit and you know I
didn't really mention that this at the
time it is great for a compliance but
another thing that comes out of the
scorecard that since we're raiding all
of our development groups say I'm in
development group f and I got this red
thing here in one of these areas but you
know there's Development Group C and G
their style of development and what
they're doing is very similar to mine
yet they are green you know maybe I
should go talk to them and find out what
they're doing that could help me so you
know there's a all this kind of thing
about building up better metrics ways of
increasing how we do things much better
a greater emphasis on applied training
and
by that I mean you know we do a lot and
we we actually fought a lot of training
from from external vendors as well as
develop some in-house but the the really
thing that the thing that goes over well
as I mentioned is the spot summits is
the hands on how what do I use in my
everyday life and I'm looking at various
ways I'm experimenting with some audio
streaming technology right now so that
it's very cost effective for one thing
in but it can be recorded as well and
you can get out a lot of information
that's really very useful in a very
quick period time so there is quite a
bit that going on overall spots are
increasing their efforts i see that a
lot they're starting to do a lot more
experience sharing etc they really do
have and have developed uh basically
want to make OSS AR a much better
program a much better interest in
security what i did not mention you know
the QA Spock's I should have mentioned
one thing about the QA swatch and I
mentioned that I had 916 of those q
icebox is fairly new it actually started
as a mentioned a couple of years ago
where it became more codified and poor
mole eyes I only have right now and
again I know this you know off the top
of my head because of loading the badges
I have a hundred thirty-five QA spots
which doesn't sound like a heck of a lot
except that number has doubled in the
last year and it is going to increase so
that's something else that's going on
that the community segments actually are
growing so not only are they changing
where I have a few more roles but I'm
actually getting more people involved in
this stuff okay change in the forecast
yep clouds okay it's interesting because
I mentioned developers don't tend to
think about deployment all that often we
think about ongoing remediation and we
look at oh we develop in and
traditionally it's been for the desktop
and the server but things are changing
now as you get into cloud mobile it's a
different platform embedded systems
engineered systems we now do
systems and so what I've noted now that
there's actually a change in attitude up
among icebox and here's a couple of
examples so for example of the first
example being last fox summit one of my
colleagues gave a talk around guidance
for package systems the kinds of
security things that you should be
looking for and it was very well done he
got a excellent marks on it but and
feedback on it but one of the things
particularly came back as a number of
the components box not just the
applications themselves that were being
packaged but the components box came
back and said gee is there anything
maybe at a lower level I should be doing
to help make these into better package
systems which I thought was very
interesting okay much more of that going
on that they see more concern about
about that QA swaps another arena are
increasingly asking me about how can I
better test security if I'm going to the
cloud or if it's going to mobile are
there different things I should be
worried about so we're starting to see a
change in attitude that's expanding
beyond the traditional boundaries we've
had so essentially what we're going to
be seeing I think is a lot closer
collaboration between secure development
and the information security management
communities we're going to see these
communities growing for example our
cloud organization I've had extensive
category talks with the DVP that runs
that and she's very very interested in
having Spock's okay not only QA spots
you know she does a lot of testing but
spots she also wants to get a fraud of
our development groups and say look I
can tell you what you need to do to make
my life a lot better so you know there's
a lot more interaction going on and for
the better i think so that's pretty much
it for the talk i tried to elite to
leave about ten minutes or so for
questions if you do have questions or if
not you can yes and i'm not so sure i'm
going to be able to hear you because see
acoustic sir why don't we just you want
to get the microphone here chris
christoff
oh yeah just pops out
and our sound person is left okay I'll
let me what I'm going to do is come down
here walk around this is going to work
now okay belapur or QA they have the
regular roles that the regular bash
leaders but now we're adding this spot
roll on them yes when they have a
patrician between the life cycle
software life cycle versus their duty
how does it how did the opportunity
that's a very good question he's asking
about the balance between those tools
and part of it is that's where the
security compliance angle comes in and
why we're building up some of the things
I mean it's not like you know you bad
you didn't you're not giving your spots
enough time to do stuff and I generally
again too I think that with this stuff
even though the role is not fully
defined as a full-time one we actually
have a lot more upper management support
along those lines and John I don't know
if you want to I saw you waving did you
want to add something or right yeah
that's growing actually the spa role as
I mentioned but I didn't want to mislead
you into thinking all 960 know these
people are full-time but more and more
within the groups that are really in
handling security compliance they're
gone this role has to be full time you
know so he starts of the top assassin
the executive level then it comes back
down to it to eat this pothole come back
yeah I did not mention on the executive
level of course I mentioned that we all
report into the corporate architect
which makes it a lot easier to build
insecurity we also have a corporate
Oracle security oversight committee
committee or Oh sock okay we have a lot
of acronyms you know you know like
anybody else's since in software but Oh
sock is actually the chairperson of that
is one of our co-presidents a for cats
and she is very big into security
actually you do not want to have that
one reaming you out about security
issues she has a very she can really
whiplash you also as I mentioned the
corporate architec I where'd screven
sits on that and that is held basically
roughly every six months and they they
go through product security issues
information security issues physical
security issues anything to do with
security and then a get-well plan comes
out of that okay if there are stuff
you're quite welcome anybody else with
questions no questions no questions well
thank you for coming i hope you learned
something ok ok yeah well but you may
grow too but it's still a good idea to
think about i don't know how many
products and stuff you have but it does
make sense even starting on a smaller
scale to look at your components you
know and start disciplining yourselves
to think about security yeah you know
it's um I realize you know I've been
talking about this on but if we can make
him I work on a big scale he should be
it should be a lot easier for you to do
on a smaller scale so please feel free
to contact me it's a I think my email is
somewhere in in there but ok thank you
