I'm your host Javed Mohammad here at
Oracle code Bogota very excited to be
here and I was my guest today Paul Amato
who's the director of product management
based out of Sao Paulo
welcome yeah I think you take about how
much it's been really exciting a great
day here in Bogota so we're really
enjoying so you did the keynote or one
of the keynotes this morning how did it
go well I think really well I was able
to to show what we came here to and do a
lot of demos and show a lot of code
that's what they expected and and I
think we well we've got a great audience
here a little bit about the significance
of an event like this this is the first
time we're doing a code event like this
in Bogota yeah and so you want to just
talk a little bit about what is the
Oracles intention like what are they
trying to do in terms of their outreach
with programs like our cocoa well we are
our Kuya coders that's the first thing
and that's the way that we got closer to
the developer community so we got speak
common language that's the cold that
everyone understands and that's why work
with developers that are taking away all
those great technologies and creating
the the applications creating great
services so with our cocoa do we have a
way to be the same level as the
developers and we we have this
initiative and that was beans also
series of events that we have as a code
we have developer portal we have other
initiatives also to work with the
developer
okay so again we were talking a little
bit off-camera that most people perceive
article they know it for database well
as you saying some people buy about Java
so but that's not the message and those
them up what we're trying to get across
here so so what is the key what would
you like to get across to the people who
perhaps were not that hasn't been the
keynote but maybe watching this video
later on yeah I would say that there are
many great technologists so it's a great
technology have is a great technology
have many more other languages that that
we can use for every type of task every
knowledge so you said the painter of
this generation they have no Oracle from
one side of the order but it's really
important to show and the way they were
open they were using multiple
technologies okay so kind of obviously
there's been a lot of talk about chat
box and blockchain artificial
intelligence it seems like those are the
kind of the themes coming up again and
again you want to talk a little bit to
them yeah of course we seen this as the
top priority on the mind of the
developers so right away before we doing
this talk of was talking with the
developer he'll show me his project with
with a shed port for finding directions
so it's it's on the date today it's
really something close to the developers
so said port one that brings on
practical application of machine
learning artificial intelligence for a
part of blockchain so this is not just
southern currency but blockchain also
means some way to have to have the
secure transactions among the patches
that may not completely trust each other
okay and also we have some new great
open source projects as the surveillance
functions of Oracle so really showing
how much we advance and are working with
the community okay
so we started off the conversation by
saying that this is a unique event
the first time in bogota colombia what
else is going to be happening after this
in Latin America yeah we are back to
Latin America here first in Bogota and
now after this is gonna be in Argentina
on May 15 in a service that is yes and
then we are going to some follow along
at the same time as open words on June
20 and June 20th so we have other events
that are going on so even for the folks
who couldn't make it here South American
tour exactly Paolo thank you so much for
coming and for sharing with us
