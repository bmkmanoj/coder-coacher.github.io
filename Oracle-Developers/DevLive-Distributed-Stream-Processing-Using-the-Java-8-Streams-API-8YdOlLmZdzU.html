Washington DC I'm Bob Probert with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
another live streaming interview with
one of the people presenting information
at this event and my guest for this
segment is this gentleman
Brian Oliver tell the folks at home what
you do for Oracle I work is and
architecting the coherence team which is
part of the cloud engineering group here
at Oracle what are you presenting at
today's event
what do you talk on distributed stream
processing using Java it's a talk we
actually started to give and highlight
several years ago at JavaOne and we're
now we actually talked about at the
keynote several years ago and we're now
actually showing how it works in real
life and going to the design of it and
what it means to be doing this
distributed stream processing in the
cloud so for the uninitiated what is
distributed stream processing and why
does it matter
I think you wanted to ask what is not
distributed stream very perfect of start
so so Java came out with these really
amazing like language enhancements for
Java developers we added Streep's and
basically it lets you very elegantly
describe declaratively what you want how
you want to process some data structures
so so we can take a set or a map or a
list that contain application data and
you can say well I want to filter it on
a map it on a transform it and you do
that in a way simple what we call
functional programming but using that
style thorough declarative instead of
writing lots of loops and nested loops
and building intermediate data types so
it's a very natural way but it's not so
natural if you've never done it before
but it's a natural way of writing quite
complex algorithms in a very short
period of time
that you can basically read so we have
these amazing things in the java
language and we've worked with a java
tournament well imagine if we could use
that in a distributed
because when you're using streams in a
Java process all your data is basically
even a Java process so if I need to
process a lot of data either have to
have a very big Java process or I have
to keep the data outside and so now I'm
no longer using Java because I'm I have
to do some you know database technology
or I have any some other api's I switch
from being a Java to offer to being an
integrator with some other technology
and and we have these amazing
capabilities in Java and and we're
teaching everyone and the community is
excited about them so why don't we try
and apply those concepts to distribute
can be so very large data sets then
naturally where we host that or where
would people have that stuff probably in
the cloud that's where the data is being
mutated so we then look at use cases and
say well you know I've got lots of IOT
devices I've got my thermostat on my
house I have you know what's my watch
doing what you know what lights do I
have and if you want to ask questions
about a huge amount of data instead of
if you're a Java developer you just want
to use jar all right I'm not a Java and
something else developer though polygon
is is pretty impressive right so how do
we how do we let child developers use
things that they know and on a much
larger grander scale so the distributed
stream processing talk talks about that
that journey of going from programming
using standard basic Java concepts to
apply it to the large data sets in the
stream and when you think about that
your program is no longer just executing
locally on your device or in a stateless
micro service or in some function you're
actually spreading your program across
the cloud and how is that coordinated
and how do we break a stream up what we
call a pipeline up and where things
actually happen and so it's a it's an
interesting talk it's interesting way I
think about processing
without you having to do all of this
stuff yourself what aspects of
distributed stream processing and doing
this with Java might trip up people who
are just starting out when you're
writing Java you're in the safety of
your own JVM you're like you're safe and
as soon as you start to send your
workloads outside the JVM all sorts of
things can happen you know failure is
obviously the first one security is
obviously something we should be
thinking about but the the big things
that start to come out immediately is
there's a difference in latency those
are no longer executing all the
processing in my JVM with all my data
we're talking about you know sub
microsecond later to nano second ladies
and now we're talking about sending
aggressive requests across the network
so the different difference in response
time but your work has to be your work
through the jobs or your tasks have to
be serializable in some way and but I
mean fortunately Java has you know nice
serialization things and we had to do
giannis we had to do quite a lot of work
to make lambdas and streams serializable
because by default they're not really
the standard api is aren't really
serializable
so and the talk actually goes into and
how we did that and some of the
decisions we had to make but that
obviously trips people up because your
code is no longer executing locally and
then had it well how do you do bug it
right so like I send my work out to the
mystical cloud and then like it doesn't
work how do I know it doesn't work out
away so yeah there are a lot of lots of
challenges around that but most of
things like it I actually okay to
demonstrate like how do we how do you
put breakpoints in and how to have you
like coordinate that sort of work I
think I think it's you know we tried to
make it sort of magic but give you
enough control as possible because if
you think what's the other approach the
other perches you as a developer working
all this stuff air yourself it's like
well I'm going to set up you know I'm
going to set up a cluster of things I'm
to set up some messaging I'm going to be
writing methods I better set up some
actors and I better subscribe and I
better deal with all their failover and
right so we want to lift it above that
like what what do you just want to do
yard and and be able to do that and
apply those you know apply the concepts
that we have in Java at a much higher
level with a much broader data set
because it ultimately innovates to make
people more efficient make developers
more efficient to produce solutions you
know I don't know if you want to set up
a cluster that's good the setups are
messaging that's good and we think we
can we can make lives easier for
developers
if attendees to your session remember
only one thing what would that be
magic magic and then a miracle happened
miracle happens we're actually going to
demonstrate the magic so so and go into
what's behind the magic that it is
actually possible will there be rabbits
and top hats involved well one of my one
of my demos is a bit like the magic cup
moving ok think so you know where is
where is the ball amongst the cloud
servers so yeah it was a little bit
magic but it you know the concepts that
we know in Java that we learn and we you
know you can read about you can just you
know Google you can go to Ooty and you
can you know learn about streams learn
about Landers taking those same concepts
that they can be applied with very
little change on a massive scale for
cloud computing and that's one of the
things that you know I think Oracle's
doing is like leading leaing that that
thought thought process and that concept
yeah we can always connect to some other
resource and more and learn some other
language but how do we unify that in the
java language and and hopefully we can
demonstrate that today will you be doing
this presentation or similar
presentations at other oracle coda tom
if you let me come back yeah well if i
have to work out a deal it's it's the
last talk of the day i think one of the
last oxidize so if everyone's still
awake
but we've done one in Austin okay we
have this one and I think Toronto and
Atlanta coming up as well okay
and each time I sort of slightly tweak
it so we learn we learn we learn a lot
from the Austin Austin one we actually
spent quite a bit of time talking about
how to read lambda expressions or how to
read how to read streams because when
you first see them if you've never seen
them before it's like what do I start
yeah and now there's some tricks tricks
that within hints of it how to how to do
that sort of stuff so we spend a bit of
time on on educating you know what non
distributed things are and how they work
and then we talk about shipping stuff
and in the end they look exactly the
same
well Bryan thanks for stopping by and
talking to us again
if you'd like to see Bryan talk in at
the Oracle code event in Toronto or any
of the other 15 remaining Oracle code
events please visit developer oracle.com
slash code you'll find a complete list
of the remaining events and also
information on how you can submit a
session proposal for a future Oracle
code event for the Oracle technology
Network I'm Babu Bart thanks for
