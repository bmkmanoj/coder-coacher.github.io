trial account student guide contained
within the DevOps cloud native
microservices with my sequel workshop
I'll begin by going to the online guide
in github from the readme page or from
the drop down menu at the top of the
page you'll be able to navigate to the
student guide within the student guide
you'll see all the necessary steps to
acquire trial account create and
configure your my sequel database and
then finally install the required
open-source tools on your laptop first
you'll want to follow the steps
necessary to acquire a trial account by
going to cloud.oracle.com slash try it
from there you'll be able to register
for an account once you receive an
account Oracle will send you an email
containing all the necessary information
to set the passwords for your accounts
the student guide will step you through
recording all the information necessary
about your accounts the student guide
instructs you to copy of the needed
fields into it an account info document
and then you record this information as
you step through the student guide most
of the needed information in is in the
welcome email and I've already
transferred some of that information
from the email to my account info
document the welcome email also provides
links to help you get your passwords set
the first account is set up contains
most of the services you'll use during
the workshop the second account is
referred to as a traditional cloud
services account and this account will
contain the developer cloud service that
is also used in the workshop let's first
click on the link to access the Oracle
cloud account this link has
pre-populated my account name and and
I'm required to enter my user name which
generally is my email address and then I
enter a temp my temporary password now
I'll enter in my old and new passwords
and then click on submit
I'm now taken to the cloud services
dashboard now let's customize our
dashboard I'm going to add some services
to the dashboard that I'll use as part
of the setup let's add my sequel the
application container cloud service and
then finally the identity cloud service
these services are are also accessible
from the hamburger menu found at the top
of the screen I'm going to use the
hamburger menu to load the classic
compute console so that I can capture
the identity tenant ID this idea is
needed when the developer cloud service
connects to the application cloud
service I'll copy the ID from the top of
the dashboard and then paste it into my
account info document for later use
I'll now return back to the main
dashboard next I want to collect some
information from the application
container cloud service I'll right click
on the link and open this console in a
new tab window from here I'm able to
grab the data region in which my
instances of application container cloud
service will run this information is
also required when connecting from
developer cloud service to the
application container cloud service I'll
store this information in my account
info document now we need to set the
storage services replication policy some
services like my sequel and the
application container cloud service
require the replication policy in the
storage service to be set a lauda
storage services dashboard by using the
hamburger menu if the replication policy
has not been set a dialog will be
displayed I'll take the default
recommend recommendation on the Geo
replication policy and click on the set
policy now let's set the password for
the traditional cloud account in which
the current developer cloud service
resides I'll click on the second URL
provided in the welcome email this
e-mail link knows my domain name
but it asked me for my username and
temporary password
note that the temporary password was the
same for both accounts I'm able to set
my new password which I'm going to keep
the same as the password I use for the
identity cloud service account I
previously configured although I also
answer a few other questions and then
submit
I will now record the new password in my
account info document for later use we
are now able to switch between the
traditional and non-traditional accounts
from the dashboard
since understanding the differences in
the accounts is important to the
upcoming labs I'll completely close the
browser window clearing the session
cookies and then I'll real aughh into
both accounts after restarting the
browser window I'll go to
cloud.oracle.com and I'll click on
sign-in I'll leave the cloud account
type set to cloud account with identity
cloud service then I'll enter the cloud
account name I stored in the account
info document and I'll click on my
services I'll enter the username and
password both of which I stored in the
account info document now we'll see most
of our cloud services let's now open a
new tab and all and I'll again go to
cloud.oracle.com
this time I'll select the traditional
cloud account type then I'll select the
data center we got the data center
information by going to the application
container cloud service console based on
our example I'll select US commercial to
which which is what I captured or since
the data centers in the US I can also
just select public cloud services US
based on the region in which your
environment was provisioned you may be
required to use amia or APEC data
centers I'm now asked to enter my
identity domain name this was also in
the welcome
after entering the information I'll
click on go next I'll enter in my
username and password we now have a
duplicate of the dashboard loaded but
this time is associated with the
traditional account
I'll go between the two dashboard tabs
and show you the difference in the
dashboard services here are the identity
cloud account back services and here are
the traditional account services the
only reason we're using the traditional
account is the time recreated this
workshop the developer cloud service was
not yet backed by the identity cloud
service but that will change although I
have a tab for each dashboard which may
work best for this workshop you can
actually just change between the
accounts from within a single dashboard
we're now partway through the student
guide will next see how to install
configure the my sequel database now
that the cloud accounts are ready I'll
click on the dashboard hamburger menu
for for the identity cloud account
services from here I'll select my sequel
if I receive a welcome screen I'll click
on the go to console within the my
sequel console I'll click on create
service I'll name the my sequel services
alpha office DB and click on next I now
need to create a public key I could do
this by clicking on the edit and edit
next to the SSH public key field I'll
request that a new key be created and
click enter
I'll now download the key and extract
the downloaded zip file into a folder
for later use
I'll now enter a password the database
schema name and set the backup
destination to none
after clicking on next I'll review the
confirmation page and then click on
create while the dashboard is being
created I can update the status and also
view the current status the time to
create the database can vary but I'll
pause and come back in about an hour
once the data the database has been
created I'll click on the database link
I'll make note of the public IP address
and also store this in my account info
document I will now SSH into the cloud
image running the database we've
documented how to SSH into the image on
both windows and a Mac it's a little
easier on a Mac so I'll show you how to
connect on Windows using putty you'll
first need to go to putty org and
download and install the appropriate
version of putty I already have putty
installed so I'll run putty gin so that
I can convert the private key I used to
create the my sequel image and convert
it to a putty PPK format I'll click on
load key then locate and open the cloud
images private key I'm okay without
using a passphrase for this video now we
can save the private key into the PPK
format I'll close puttygen and open
putty I'll first enter the public IP of
the my sequel cloud image and then
expand the SSH section and click on off
I'll now find the private key PPK file
and click on open I'll click on open
again to connect to the image if I
receive a security alert I'll add the
key to the registry using the SSH key
I'll now connect to the image as the OPC
user I want to install get on the image
so I'll do a young install it will take
a few minutes to install but when
prompted I'll enter y for yes to install
I'll then use the sudo command to
connect as the Oracle user I'll now make
a repo directory and then from that
directory I'll clone the repository
containing the needed set up scripts off
of github
I'll now change to the script directory
and set the permissions of the script so
that it can be executed by displaying
the contents of the file I can see that
it's going to run to sequel scripts one
to create the alpha user and a second to
load the data I'll run the script I can
now run the following command to see the
table names loaded into the database the
database is now ready to go so I'll exit
the SSH terminal session I'm now ready
to install the open source tools on my
laptop we've documented book this both
on Windows and for the Mac I'll cover
how it's done on Windows first I'll load
a command window then I'll check on my
version of Java to ensure the version is
greater than 1.8 if it's not I'll need
to follow the instructions in the
student guide to install the Java
development kit version 1.8 next I'll
show how to install a version of Eclipse
that contains the Oracle Enterprise pack
if you already have Eclipse installed
you can also install this version of
Eclipse that contains the enterprise
pack or you can search online for
instructions on how to add the Oracle
Enterprise pack to an existing version
of Eclipse for this workshop it may be
best to just install this version with
everything you'll need included go to
the oracle enterprise pack link
contained in a student guide after
accepting the license agreement select
the neon version of eclipse
after eclipse is downloaded I'll I'll
unzip the installation I found out my
version of Windows if I renamed the zip
file to a shorter name before unzipping
I didn't run into windows filename
length errors once unzipped I will find
and run the Eclipse executable eclipse
wants a workspace directory and I took
the default once loaded I can select
which windows I want to make visible and
configure where the window
would be displayed
you
we've also provided optional
a Chinon how to configure eclipse and
maven when you're behind a firewall I'll
now show how to install and configure
git and brackets following the link in
the online guide I went to the git
download page I'll select my operating
system and save the file after the file
is downloaded I'll locate and run the
installation file I've already
downloaded and installed git and I took
all the defaults during the installation
let's now install brackets I'll first go
to the URL included in a student guide
I'll select the option to download and
I'll save the file I'll locate and run
the installation file I took all the
defaults when installing brackets now
from a location of my choice I'll create
a directory named product catalog UI
from the Windows Explorer I'll navigate
to that directory right click on it and
select open as a brackets project once
brackets is running I'll select File
extension manager in the extension
manager I'll search for the txt
integration of git and click install on
the brackets on brackets forget after
installation I'll take the defaults and
click on save then I'll click OK to
restart brackets I should now see the
git icon in the right-hand brackets
panel I'm now ready to move on to lab
