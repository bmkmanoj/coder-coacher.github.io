Hyderabad my name is Connor MacDonald
with the Oracle developer community I'm
here with Tim Hall or as people know
Oracle base or mr. Oracle base it's
pretty much the site that comes up when
you google for anything regards to
Oracle welcome along Tim right it's good
to have you back in India yes good to be
back when was the last time you're in
India I think it was 2015 the Sangam
event ok I'm saying I'm the thing that
was a great conference at the end of the
year I'll be talking to side from the
user group later on today Oracle base is
as I said it's pretty much the site that
comes up when you type in Oracle search
terms for almost all topics why did you
start the site and how did it become so
popular do you think I think a lot of
look really I have a terrible memory so
I write everything down that always used
to be carried around between companies
on floppy disks back in the day and then
burnt onto CDs and then it just became
sensible to think well why don't I
centralize this and I started putting
things on the internet in about 2000
year 2000 I was working for an Internet
start-up at the time so it seemed a good
idea to learn some of the skills and
serve the added purpose of being able to
put all of my notes online for me to
access so the thing I always tell people
is I use the site more than anyone else
because I've got such a terrible memory
and I think the reason it's become
popular is because it is kind of very
simple cut and paste examples which is
what I need myself sometimes you'll do
some technology and then you'll not
touch it again for six months and you're
thinking how did I do that I know I have
done it I can't remember how having that
written down is fantastic sort of aid
memoir and this is why I tell everyone
to write I think doesn't matter if
you're popular or not just write stuff
down get it whether it's in a word
document or preferably a blog post and
you've got it there for the rest of your
life to refer to a lot of people
currently writing blogs and often it's
more just like a technical journal as
opposed to yours which is more topics
and solutions and practices those kind
of people often don't get into the
presenting space
so you're obviously a well-known
presenter now as well not just a blog
writer or a technical website writer so
how did you make that switch into
something which is generally inherently
private into interpreting okay I mean
that was very accidental because of the
website I got invited into the Oracle
ace program and prior to that I'd never
even been to a conference let alone
present presented it one and so when I
got invited into the ACE program a lot
of the other aces were presenting so I
thought I better try and that coincided
with getting an opportunity to come down
to Australia to present I'd met Chris
Muir who now works for Oracle but at the
time wasn't and he invited me down to a
conference down in Australia and I just
thought this is a great opportunity and
I was super scared because I haven't
really presented in public before and
it's not natural for me but I thought I
can either be scared and not do it or
give it a go and it went pretty well and
I have to rehearse a lot in order to
appear casual because I'm not a natural
presenter it's something that I have to
work on but I've put a lot of effort
into it and it seems to have paid off my
talks generally go down pretty well
certainly it pays off i sat in on your
talk today and we have what I called a
lectern gate yes the lectern was missing
and then the audio didn't work and then
there was a problems with the screen and
the like yet you've pretty much just
waltz through it be there fairly relaxed
dance like what what's your advice to
someone who's obviously petrified of
public speaking or to get into that that
thing and how to avoid those both
anxiety attacks often happen I think
you've just got to you've got to prepare
well and when I talk about rehearsal I
think a lot of people think I mean
standing in front of a mirror giving it
all that but more than anything I talk
through in my head or when I'm in the
car I talked through scenarios and I try
to think what I'm likely to be asked
what I would ask in that presentation
but also I try and plan for things that
could go wrong so I got some very good
advice very early on by a guy called
Andrew Clark who just said always have a
back-up plan so if you're doing live
demos have recordings have
of what the demo should look like
because then when something goes wrong
you've got something to fall back on and
I think the best thing you can do is to
know your material well and feel like
you've got several alternatives if
something goes wrong because things
always go wrong
whether it's your laptop dying whether
it's turning up and not having your
place to plug into and you're
potentially presenting from a memory
stick so I think you've got to be
prepared with trying to deal with the
unknown which is obviously impossible
because it's unknown but the better
prepared you are the easier you can
bounce off that and I think at the end
of the day your first presentation will
probably be very bad your tenth will be
better your 30th will be better your
hundredth will be better so I think you
just got to sort of give in to the fact
that things will go wrong and deal with
it it was funny like you've gone from
presenting to you mentioned talking
things through in your car I've seen
your YouTube videos where you're talking
to the camera
you haven't crashed the car which is
good and now here we are doing
livestream like yeah next we'll be doing
gaming on Twitch and then we'll be very
close with all the cool kids trying not
to swear now you're taught that I was on
docker now I'm a database guy and your
talk is on databases on docker um for me
that almost seems a contradiction in
terms because I think of databases as
being this thing you install once and
you you never go near them again whereas
dock resistance or grab something bill
to throw it away whatever how do you
reconcile those two things what well for
someone like a newbie and docker like me
what's the what are your thoughts on
database under a docker sort of regime
so that's kind of interesting because I
think we've to a certain extent in OIT
we've fallen in love with docker and it
is a fantastic platform but it doesn't
really suit databases that well in terms
of the regular relational database so
you've got the situation where docker
really is great for stateless things and
databases are the ultimate in stateful
and those don't really marry up but as
long as you plan carefully you think
about the persistence layer that you're
going to use so for example persistent
storage in docker is where all of your
data files are going to go because you
don't want them to disappear when you
remove the container
it's very doable there are Stephanie
some challenges with docker I don't see
many people using their production
relational databases on docker in the
near future but there are definitely
some sweet spots so one of the things
that happened to me recently was I was
doing some apex upgrades at work and
they weren't going so well and I wasn't
really sure what the scenario was
whether it was a problem with the actual
patch itself or whether it was a problem
with the instances I was working with so
I went home and thought I'm gonna have
to do some legwork here and go through
some stuff and I fired up twelve two and
twelve one databases on docker in
multi-tenant and not non multi-tenant
architecture to see if there was a
scenario that was causing a problem and
it all worked fine and it was actually
the stuff I was doing at work that was
the problem not the patch but the reason
for mentioning that is that I got home
and within a few minutes I had four
instances running two different
architectures two different versions of
each and that would have taken me
significantly longer in something like a
VM now you can have a very good build
process but the nature of your build
process is it's gonna take quite a few
minutes to run but in docker with images
sitting around waiting to go its seconds
to get in and test that so from my
perspective smaller databases it's a
no-brainer
for Devon testing so that your developer
gets exactly the same as production it
really means when we're talking about QA
situations so if you're doing a
continuous integration type environment
so you've got your application pipeline
constantly churning through changes into
a QA environment it's nice to build a
clean image and then throw it away
because you know exactly what the QA
tests are running against so those sort
of scenarios docker is great for when
you start talking about production
especially of large databases I start to
be a bit doubtful I don't think it works
well with the current state of play but
that's not to say you can't I think
there's also some issues around high
availability because a lot of the
products we tend to use in auricle
things like data guard and real
application clusters they don't have a
good fit in in my opinion with
jaakor world typically high-availability
in dhaka is fire up more containers and
load-balanced them and that's not really
how relational databases tend to work so
there is definitely issues there but as
a DBA you'll do everything and you'll
invariably have to deal with
infrastructure not only with the
database but application servers like
WebLogic Tomcat things like that and
then there's the really sweet spot for
those with darker so I think it's
important that DBAs understand it but
also we're aware of the pitfalls so they
don't make silly decisions
I still think either physical or virtual
machines are better for your bigger
databases but don't rule docker out
I suppose especially with 18 CXC coming
out this year where it's a small
database that has every feature you
could ever want just for playing around
sure sure dock off with that around it
just - yeah developers fired up play
Explorer get rid of it I heard a quote
from someone I won't mention their name
in case I miss quoting them but they
said when you start using docker you'll
definitely lose data because you'll make
bad decisions you don't understand how
the storage works and you'll think
you're doing the right thing
and you're not and it'll go wrong and so
get playing on it now especially with
like little testings
and when 18 c XE comes out that's ideal
also a new feature in 18 c that's quite
useful is the read-only oracle home so
all your conflict goes in a separate
location which is perfect for docker
because you don't want to have config in
your oracle home which is presumably
part of your offense operates or you
want your config somewhere persistent so
it will makes a lot more sense so i'm
interested to try that when i get my
hands on it
okay we'll wrap it up now but i'll give
you 30 seconds to look straight down the
barrel until what should conference
attendees what's their key takeaway from
today's conference what should they do
when they when they go home today what
should they do I think the first thing
to do is try and have a go at everything
you've got free trials for a lot of
cloud services now that you can get on
and have a go I don't think a lot of it
will make sense straight from a talk I
don't think you'll really understand
things until you get your hands on
play with it and that's when you'll come
up with questions and you'll meet people
at the conference today get as many
contacts as possible to go back and ask
questions from later on thanks for your
time Tim I'm Connor McDonald from the
Oracle developer community we'll have
more videos coming up later on this
afternoon have a great day all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
