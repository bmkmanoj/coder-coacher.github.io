on a wonderful day of the two wonderful
guests here unit via Ned and I'm going
to try to do my best pronounce the name
Sadowski and Leonardi garlic and
gentlemen thank you so much for coming
by
as we were speaking before we came live
by the way I am realized okay just admit
this Jackie that's good enough you guys
have a great presentation about DevOps
and the Greek tragedy I encourage anyone
to leave any of our viewers and those
people who are coming here live so check
it out on YouTube it's very funny it's
very informative it's a little long for
our format so what I thought we do is we
kind of do like an extended trailer or
like you have extras of a DVD so we kind
of take some of the highlights from each
of the three acts and conclude with that
okay so you mean we only have 40 minutes
instead of an hour okay yeah no we can
do it in two in 40 minutes
oh oh we could do like director's
commentary is tour directors catalog at
the earthís no there's a sorry Antonio
is a commentary comment on it very fine
edited version of that yeah so so guys
so yeah perhaps if we can you've got a
great analogy there of and by the way I
could relate to this very well having
worked in startups basically the three
acts we can just kind of just start off
with our one the first act is three guys
in a garage or girl starting up there's
not much in the way of ops and people
just kind of improvise I think you guys
have a great overlap I think you show
one slide where you've got people
process and Technology and kind of the
overlapping area is DevOps so that's
kind of the set up you want to just kind
of give us an idea in from a from a
process and from a technology standpoint
what takes place in acts one sure I
think the interesting thing for us is
when we're trying to write this talk we
wanted to grasp a slightly different
perspective on DevOps right and that's
the interact intersection of people
tools and process rather than the
traditional development operation and QA
and we based some of the stuff down on
some of the research we did at CAA
around the evolution along the maturity
curve of teams that go through this
process and typically everybody
typically starts in the same place that
you can be skilled you can be qualified
if you typically start as a bucket
brigade yeah and then that's part of the
reason because first of all the fires
are not that horrible right so if you
are start above three people in the
garage that the failures won't be
catastrophic to the level that you
cannot handle it so you kind of defer
the installing that the smoke alarms to
later because even if something go wrong
you can definitely go ahead and fix it I
have to by the way I just found it so
funny because back in the day when I was
a developer and I had hair and all that
good stuff it's funny how the problems
always you to keep come on Friday
afternoon after five o'clock oh yes
something I don't know what does are the
best ones those are the best ones
because as we talk in a talk pain is
instructional that's one of my favorite
take taglines from the top and I think
the body tweet that the name is abstract
and then I think we should corner hash
that you know we actually need to but
the reason good teams start in this fire
brigade mode is not because they don't
understand the best practices I think
the trick for me is to have just enough
process that you mitigate the risks to
the business of that team but not more
than it slows you down right so it's
perfectly normal to start at that stage
right and and that goes back a little
bit back to the second talk that we did
today and that the research of DevOps
bottlenecks when we interview different
people and different sizes of
organizations and and what we heard from
the startup age of our interviewees was
exactly that they don't bother with the
process just because being agile is more
important than to prevent trying to
prevent certain failures by more and
more process that it really becomes
about managing risk and cannot just baby
just back up a little bit there so I
think in the first act you talk about
Kanban the just-in-time kind of law that
you can just walk it a little bit
through that because it's kind of it
will take us through the evolution of
going from there to agile to devolve so
interestingly enough one of the
questions is development team has to
figure out is how do we track work right
how do we know what what what to do next
and at that first stage when the team is
fairly small and everybody can be easily
on the same page on where the company is
going on what a product is trying to do
you don't need a lot of management
process for the backlog right like
further than the prioritize list grab
the cart of the top you can do it in
JIRA you can do it in Trello right you
can do it in a whiteboard you can do it
otherwise it is elegance it never is
posture so so I think that's typically
it it goes back to the conversation it's
good enough what I have seen though is
teams that don't get out of that process
into time sometimes people say and come
on longer than they should and for me
the threshold is about 10 engineers
right at that point the communication
and prioritization becomes its own job
and it's difficult to do it with other
supporting tool ok all right so that's
not it so segue I think into Act two you
got a little bit more process down I got
people maybe 20 30 people and I think
you talked about having at least one one
person with an OPS background right
right so walk us a little bit through
that through what happens in that second
act yeah so the interesting part about
this starting emerging Ops is that
that's about when people realize that
you know enough is enough and and there
are no serverless architectures there is
a server somewhere and there are no no
such thing is not the result doing but
by someone and and and this is where you
stop rely on this magical someone will
take care of
my severance for me and something we'll
do the Alps for me and you start to take
responsibility about the above the whole
project about the big picture about the
whole process and that's important
because in this time you want stop
repeating the same mistakes over and
over again and you want to have this
kind of smoke alarms installed in the
places where you know the fire can be
and this is where you become
self-conscious about what those places
are yep I think the other interesting
thing about the stages this is the first
time a reasonably mature level of data
collection and metric collection emerges
and the team it's not necessarily well
used yet but you have to start doing
some of this instrumentation there in
the talk we do talk about having to tune
the system and more often than not
you're still guessing but at least is
starting to put some early
instrumentation in place that becomes
fundamentally important and I think
without which you cannot transition to
the subsequent stage and we'll talk a
bit about that later but those are the
two key elements right there the mature
process of retrospective and root-cause
analysis and making sure that the
problem does not repeat again yeah as
well as kind of more maturity around
data and the data the steps you take
responsibility for more pieces of of the
big picture and you have you you collect
those incidents you collect these data
and based on that you make smart smarter
decisions and you put those controls in
place to prevent it from having video I
think one other important thing that
emerges during that stage is this
concept of the developer on call right
it's a very controversial subject in the
teams because there are teams that just
don't like being on call and
unfortunately the truth is in this day
and age when you work in the
applications that we all work on you you
have to but this is the the right time
to start creating that efficient scene
of interruption right where the
developer on calls one of the key jobs
is to reduce the cost of interrupt to
the broader organization because the
rest of the team is big enough where
that interruptions become fairly closely
and also rotating people on this
developer of call is in making sure that
there
exposed to various you know failures and
incidents and hashtag famous
instructional alright so let's segue so
that we get into some level of maturity
and luckily Morphin regimes in the world
are in being that the second stage the
second stage because it's long enough we
are talking about getting out of this
stage of three developers to ten
developers in sometimes as short as 30
in our case right as a couple of months
and then the second stage of having of
this maturity and going through this
developer on call and bigger supporting
and and knowledge base and all the
things that we spoke about on a second
and on a second stage rather than last
year's and this goes to the third
dimension we're talking about people
because there's only certain degree of
change you can affect into the
development team and how to operate
without disrupting the team too much and
I think that's one of the key reasons
why that evolution process takes longer
and you can accelerate some things but
there's certain laws of physics that
physics that will govern how how much
change you can put through the team
while still being able to do work right
and and we go process fairly hate over
process in their organization right fine
balance yeah yeah so sort of this
processor process is the monk way the
most painful of all yeah right that they
are free if they're read with tools
the referees change they're very agile
and then you kind of start food those
boundaries on those people that end and
their work there and this is very very
you know very annoying and generates a
lot a lot of resistance so this process
of beating the developers into a process
takes a lot of time pain you lose people
in the in the process and people hate
you and and that's that's a painful
process
so let's segue into act three the size
of the company's drone ladies eighty
eight hundred people right now you
actually got an ops team in place so
what takes place here are you know
that's kind of the
the climax of the play well was the
successful companies I think the
maturity there is a ssin of maturity
hits right because at that scale in a
hundred engineers you probably have a
good chunk of revenue right if you use
the usual to fund two hundred fifty
thousand dollars per employee the
company in metrics right your
decent-sized company so the realization
of maturities are starting to hit and
then you're starting getting you become
a bit more proactive about things right
it's about anticipating the next
disruption it's about using data you've
been collective and using data as
information rather than ID data it's
about having the rigor of data-driven
decision making and investment
prioritization like in the talk we have
this great example around product
quality and without the right set of
data or the light set of fine-grained
data you don't know what to fix right it
looks like we don't have a quality now
talk but and we won't give everything
else out but if you look at the data
from the right perspective the action
becomes obvious and and for us Javed I
can give you another example of that for
the young for the three that we do the
developer relations so for example a
when a there is a startup they have
developer relations function let's say
it's the Technical Evangelist the
developer advocate and and they kind of
operate on their own day they feel deep
inside was I need to do how they need to
engage to developers but when you got to
this third level suddenly your boss asks
you why are we doing that where is the
money in that how you content with your
home about ROI that's right they are
right suddenly we got asked for data and
big data driven even in in places in
which we we didn't expect right so it's
easy to measure sales it's easy to
measure marketing it's it's doable in
measuring RNG and and and all that is
suddenly enforced on the company and and
that the that's the bidding the company
into this third third stage
and by the way if anyone is kind of
tuning in we're here with a podcast in
Austin at article code and what we have
as our yesterday Baruch and Lynette and
we're just talking all things DevOps
right in among a Greek tragedy
so Greek tragedies don't end well and
you know it's I was just reading up I
really didn't know much truthfully about
weeks I did I mean it's horrible
yeah everybody died so yeah that's that
how it works but those are the rules
but but I think you've got a nice a spin
on because you have an epilogue and the
epilogue like a Hollywood is set up a
happy ending wait we have to do a happy
ending but even the Bollywood movies
also all something like that we love we
all love happy and the exactly how do we
get a have to cut the ending to DevOps
we know it's a painful process I think
we kind of acknowledge that how do we
kind of get past you know everyone dying
and giving you skipper some hope Eric
and Lena
well so I guess yes and the bigger you
are the more important the process
becomes right and the the difference
between failing and succeeding in this
level and I mean like kind of bottling
those big voice challenges in the end of
phase 2 and towards phase 3 and never
getting your your head out of the water
or successfully crossing that in getting
into this Nirvana of the smokey the
world that one that can prevent almost
any any any fire is is the process a lot
bit clearer it may seem like Nirvana
it's not the run it's still a lot of
hard work but it's the right hard work
where you get to spend the energy on the
right things and that's why sometimes
running through phase 2 too quickly
doesn't make sense because phase 3
builds on those fundamentals we've
talked about data collection metrics
collection becoming data-driven getting
the company and the organization to
think about the decisions based on some
concrete data right if you can't measure
we don't decide and accepted though it's
it's doable and organization is to do
that demonstrate higher level of
customer satisfactions because they are
able to preempt problems they're able to
get ahead of the problems we need with
its quality system scalability customer
satisfaction and purity security is
another one an ability to support the
business as the business continues to
grow because at some point if you time
those processes well a business will hit
an inflection point as well well
gentlemen it's a very interesting
conversation and I would really
encourage our viewers to really check
out the other videos that they've done
the the full version will and you know
you've got a much more edited version
here but a great conversation thank you
very much for dropping by thank you very
much thank you at another podcast Oracle
Ford event as we seem like we meet met
up so far in Atlanta San Francisco often
yeah and DC this is next all right thank
you everyone for tuning in thank you
thank you guys thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
