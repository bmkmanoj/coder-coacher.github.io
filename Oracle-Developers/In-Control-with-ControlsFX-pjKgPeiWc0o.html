nuclear energy and software architect
and here's my partner yep so I'm
Jonathan Giles I work for Oracle how do
you our controls as a day job and when I
finished doing those I come home well I
work from home anyway so I come home
walk into the lounge sit down at my
computer and start doing controls or
weeks and evening yeah I only do it at
night I don't do it in the day job
though so okay so what are we going to
cover the session tonight first we're
going to do a short review of control
effects will introduce the futures do
some demonstration show you how to get
involved explain our future plans and
and the only question time Eugene just
before you start if you don't mind
what's your during the slides I'm gonna
release next you have control the face
that's what I wanted to say so while all
this going on
everything you're gonna see is is the
latest version of controls fats which is
8.20 0.7 which is going to be released
during this talk and hopefully
Jonathan's gonna dance something yeah
just released it it just did yeah okay
okay
controls effects overview so like in in
our high school all the burning
questions were like what is it who when
how and this is sort of the questions
were gonna answer today so what is
control effects it's a Java library the
Java library basically we're focusing on
the very high quality API very friendly
licensing BSD actually free for all and
hopefully low back on that doesn't
depend on us only but we're trying to
keep it long
the controls effects library actually
it's kind of like a big adventure we
have a lot of people committing helping
out and there's only two of us here
Jonathan me there's a lot more people
and here comes the little game which
we're going to play during this talk you
have to decide who's killing who it's
Russian the answer the answer is going
to be I will give you all the session
all the time any the are they and
basically the answer will shock you but
yeah the fugue is alright we mainly only
really roll after you yeah
so the answer will be at the end of the
session here is a short list of the
people who are actually somehow involved
in there in the library one way or
another so altogether it's approximately
60 contributors to the project which is
very exciting and surprising actually
and only two of us are here which is
kind of you know I don't you listen you
spin there yes friends there yeah that's
right yeah so um so it's very exciting
but it actually anyone who can be a
contributor to the project because it's
really easy to to do anyone anyone I had
a bit too much time when I was making it
I I don't know he told me that he did
some Java effects but he did slides so
so we welcome all contributions bug
fixes translations new features new
controls obviously we're going to review
all the code hopefully you're going to
learn something by that but we are not
the place where people can done dump any
kinda code and then forget about it
we trying to keep it very high quality
and before the code will be put in
control control effects that's a good
idea actually to discuss it on there or
discussion groups a point to make about
that is we've kind of view as a two-way
street where you know doing a lot of
time I've our own working on these
controls but it's if people want to
contribute the thing that you get out of
it is that you get the peer review of
your code and you learn how to program
your controls properly in Java effects
through this review process that we do
when you do the pull requests so it's a
good learning experience for you and the
control is a big project and everyone
that uses controls if you explain it
that's right so with its kind of tough
experience when Jonathan gets on it it's
it's pretty tough okay I should probably
add that you know if you've got
questions throughout feel free to ask
yeah anytime so this is the short
overview of our religious previous
releases and you can see the latest
release which is done just now today and
this is a game number two who can guess
when Jonathan son was born mm-hmm you
can kind of see around about end of the
year it's things that slip a little bit
in controls effects and my boy arrived
on December the 25th XO I did or at
least three days after he was born
yeah other than that we slid know for
that reason he missed the last year's
conference actually yes so it's actually
Christmas Day we're still gonna give you
all the time for the first question so
this is a number of downloads as you can
see the number of downloads actually
grew little by little and then suddenly
jumped so who can guess when the release
of jammy-jam effects eight was
Yeah right that's right that's correct
it was March 14th and the point there is
that controls are fix has always been
targeted to Java FX 8 so people that
downloaded prior to March we're doing
pre-release builds and they were using
it before Java fix actually came out so
there's a lot of interest even before
hand but once Java 8 came out with
jariabek say there was a lot more
downloads obviously yeah and we can
actually show it as a graph here and by
our estimation approximately by 2020
we're going to overtake the number of
downloads of JDK I think so why do we
exist as everyone knows Java Java fact
CP has developed pretty slowly and once
they're done they're set kind of set in
stone and they cannot be changed and
because of that there's a lot of gaps
and in Java effects itself so we're
trying to fill those gaps and obviously
our IP as the IPS EPL's are not as rigid
so we can change them with if needed and
you know people basically suggest this
kind of stuff and we still trying to
keep the API pretty high quality and
jonathan is very famous you know
basically for throwing out things but we
follow the same API patterns as Java
effects itself so basically it stays
pretty close to what Joe effects API
John who uses controlled effects we we
don't know all the all the people
organizations who use them but here's
some examples this is the really nice
graphical 3d application created in
Goddard Space Flight Center for NASA by
air solutions and it actually uses some
of the controls from controls effects
and I was talking to Sean Phillips and
he he told me that they're gonna use
even more
so it's very exciting when NASA uses
your stuff actually so I'm pretty proud
there's couple more users here in John
Hopkins Hospital they created a software
for the Cancer Research where the
research they do imaging analysis and
there's several other projects like alt
text which is a very interesting tool
for exploring text alternatives and
documents we do suspect there's a lot
more uses but we simply don't know about
them so if somebody does let us know so
let's go over some features of
controlled effects
the first one is dialog API so they'll
dialogue API always existed in control
but since the beginning and it was
always very popular i I would even think
that the control effects popularity is
based on on this API initially and it
actually became de facto dialogue API
for general effects and then basically
John John Donne called that the victim
of its own success it was accepted for
for next release of Java effects itself
and basically promoted and will be there
starting with Java effects eight update
14 but there was a lot of development of
this API and a lot of different reviews
and many iterations some people probably
saw it on a JIRA and what actually
finally came out is drastically
different than it was originally
internal effects itself internal
implementations are pretty close but API
is very different so it was kind of a
little bit you know
we were concerned but then we kind of
created a plan where we decided that we
will let people use the what would the
official dialog API before it comes out
in 80 or 40
so Jonathan actually formed the code and
created the project called open GFX
dialog it's available only at bitbucket
and now to basically control effects
starting with this release has a
temporary dependency to this project and
that simply means that future official
dialog API is available now in the
latest version version of control
effects as soon as the 80/40 is going to
come out we obviously going to drop the
dependency but for now the old API is
deprecated it's there you can use both
but eventually it's going to go away all
the custom dialogues we had on top of
old API are recreated using the new API
so the functionality is basically the
same with few exceptions we were not
able to do the lightweight dialogues
because of some issues with API
JavaFX API right yeah it's still in the
future plans but it depends on
implementation actual implementation of
Joe effects EP is so this is this the
same information about open GFX
dialogues and the fork it actually works
the same exact way in a 220 so it can be
used now the fork is available at the
bucket here zero question
the look and feel looks a lot different
in you style them so you look what you
lose with open jfx dialogues is these
ability to have been non-native chrome
around the outside of the dialogues or I
should say the question there was can we
style the dialogues like we're doing
controls effects with open jfx dialogues
and you lose the non-native chrome where
we only use the in the official
dialogues a pion in fermentation we only
support the native stage chrome so we
don't support the cross-platform chrome
that like we do in controls you fix
Europe of course in the future anyway in
the controls are fixed we could do it
ourselves and bring that back because we
just take away this stage native chrome
and put back out cross-platform but we
haven't done that year I've got a pen
and paper here and every time someone
suggests something and writing it down
so but this API is available in a
separate library so people who don't use
controls effects but when a when a play
was official future official delegatee I
can actually have dependency on the page
and open the effect that works wizard
API this is something new coming in 8.27
yet just came up it's based on the new
official dialog API and it's very very I
would say simple but effective wizard
API it's still a little Asian so we
we're going to make probably some
changes based on people suggestions but
the the idea is pretty simple so there
is a wizard pane which is based on the
dialogue pane of dialogue API very
simple interface which we call wizard
flow it has only two methods and allows
you to move forward in in the dialogue
all the logic of moving backwards is
handled automatically by wizard it
remembers all the history so you don't
have to implement anything like that we
have a standard implementation of the
local linear linear floor this is for
very simple linear dialogue with linear
wizards
so you basically don't have to do
anything you just have to provide
collection of your pages and it won't
start working custom floors like what
what we call branching flows can be
implemented by simply creating an
instance of this interface and providing
some kind of logic of how how the pages
flow what in the logic of this actual
flow so the thing I like about the
wizards is something that back in the
real world when I was a real web
developer and not imaginary controls
land was that right in a wizard was just
annoying because you had to get the data
out of every single element on each of
the pages what we do in our wizard API
is we have a value extractor that
describes through and looks for every
single control and your wizard and pulls
the data round puts into a hash map so
at the end of the wizard once it's shut
down you just go to that hash map and
you can put all the ticks that's been
put in there or all the values and if
it's a non if it's a custom control you
can write your own revalue extractor
that tells it how to get the value out
of your custom control so just makes a
whole heap easier now in the takes care
of moving backwards where it removes all
the values you know which kind of should
not exist anymore cause you move
backwards so all that I've actually
taken care of the matter
sure me I don't take it black
supplication but it's a model model
window so far we looked actually the
ways to do it but we were not sure if
it's needed another sorry eight you
forty dialogues which were open
GFX dialogues supports modal windows and
Nan modal windows as well as blocking
the non blocking our wizard that present
support module and non-modal they
support blocking but they do not support
non blocking because Eugene commented
out the the block of code that has shown
wait yeah but I come into the Doudna
said as soon as somebody asks for it it
will be there so so there's literally
the Kari done it it is like I method at
description and one line of code
yeah I'm looking a paper someone's asked
for unity I told you yeah okay will
uncommitted the property sheet API was
there for several religious now so it's
a very common common API which you can
actually see in many ID IDs and
different tools but the the main point
of it is that it's not only for looking
at the bin properties you can be look at
looking at anything because it's based
on the property model and this
properties can be provided by by
yourself for example you can create
custom forms or create create some kind
of properties which really do not exist
on a bill what besides the property
editing this basically actually there
are custom a lot of custom pre-built
editors there and ability to register
your own urine editors if you need to
you can actually group the properties by
name by by category and search and
filter those properties all that will be
in the demo which which Jonathan was
shown few minutes
not as a constraint but you can actually
easily create your own your own editor
and register it yeah yeah yep it's
literally several lines of code oh yeah
okay next yeah this is I guess anyone
who used swing knows this it's an action
API it's pretty close to what swing used
to have and enhanced with ability to
bind buying properties automatically to
the UI controls we besides having a way
of creating an action we actually have
ability to create a common set of
controls out of the same action tree if
you imagine pretty common API pretty
common application it has a toolbar it
has constant context menu it has main
menu usually a lot of that is all the
same actions so the way we have it is
that in view in few lines of code by
creating a tree of actions you can
generate the toolbar the context menu
and the main menu and all that will work
seamlessly if you disable the action all
the UI elements will be disabled for
example if you change the text all the
UI elements related to the action will
change the text in addition to that we
have an annotation called action proxy
by annotating the method on your class
you can actually create an action out of
it so it's a simplified way of creating
actions without creating special
instances of action class the decoration
relation APR is a pretty new that's
probably the second release they're
little bit enhanced the decoration is
fairly simple API it's deliberately
simple you can add
decorations to a control at specific
positions land positions right yeah like
top left bottom right and stuff like
that in the middle Center it can be
actually graphics or CSS and we use this
API for our new validation API where you
basically can register validators with
the controls by providing some logic of
how this control should be validated the
very data will be called every time
controls the data and controls changed
and based on your output on your
whatever you basically the logic of of
your validation the validation graphics
will be shown at worst with anything any
change on the only observable properties
of the control that's one thing we
should do yeah we actually did not think
about it to be honest but theoretically
it's possible because it's the same kind
editors but we just don't have any any
validation support in internally in the
property ship it can be easy to modify
it to have them
yeah but it's possible it's one of the
things we probably have to think about
honestly we never thought about that
the graphics graphics on the validation
can be easily changed we're providing
the sort of the standard implementation
the one which provides the graphical
items the ones on the left and the one
who's on the right is the CSS based one
it's very simple kind of highlighting
API but it can be customized any one you
want because we have an ability to do
anything you want to the controller
based on their on their validation state
next one glyph font API this is
something we actually we we've talked to
Jen's letters who created the font
awesome effects and we thought this
really cool cool library but the way we
wanted to have it is we didn't want to
depend on specific specific font so
after discussions with scheme we've
created a very simple API where you can
create an implementation of glyph font
and use any font you want for example I
lately used helped icons from the github
to provide icons in my application
almost any phone can be used the you
have no ability to change attributes of
the icons colors effects practically
anything size as you see on the screen
here we've changed couple of attributes
this is font awesome and we have
built-in support for font awesome yep
font awesome was automatically built in
and it's very very easy to any other
part basically a very simple interface
you have to implement action proxy
annotation has support for using the
such images as you see image may not be
a simple I guess image file you can say
it's it's a font and they provide the
name of the font type and the name of
the icon and the I can belong to my
we end up as a graphic on the only
action notification API this is
something people people always talked
about and asked and it was one night
when Johnson said I just have to do that
and we have sort of two ways a
notification one is a notification pane
which is basically an overlay pane which
is animating in and out there is support
for graphics and text and you can put
controls on it and it has several visual
styles like light and dark here it's
your typical we browser notification you
know that pops up from the bottom on top
and the notifications as the separate
windows you can basically pop up
notifications to define nine positions
of the screen and they can be stacked
and they automatically disappear after
specified period of time
fade out spreadsheet view this is
something people using extensively I
think because it has some properties
which are non-existent on it on a
standard table view and some of them are
self spending and fixed rows and columns
and very simplified cell anything like
with one click you can go and basically
edit it so well on the table view it's a
little bit more complicated a set of
check controls everyone knows that those
can be created pretty easily but nobody
really wants to spend time creating them
so you just it's easier to use them so
Jonathan created three three controls
which is a combo box list view and tree
view where you can basically set your
check States for the items and retrieve
it there are two businesses that it's
easy to do a simple one of these
controls we have a checkbox on each of
the lines of a list of your stomach it's
more complex if you want to be a
programatically go in and say I want to
check row five at least you're keeping
the list of all your checkboxes and you
know which row they reference so this
API here simplifies that down to having
a chicken model where you
say is this road cheaper this road whoa
check this rope so it's just that a lot
nicer way yeah surprisingly a lot of
people use it that we didn't think about
it but there's a lot of you know initial
bug reports and stuff like that which
shows that a lot people actually use it
Derek Lee Mirman actually created this
one this is a really nice control pop
over it's something which exists in the
Apple Apple UI it's basically a window
with the pointer you click on any
control and you can pop up such control
and then feel the content area with
whatever whatever you want basically one
interesting effect here where you can
actually detach it and the pointer
disappears and became the little becomes
a little window which you can move
around and close several several ticks
checks will be related api's there is an
API for out the completion we basically
either provide the static list of the
auto completion values or dynamically
create them if you need to
clearable fields and decorated fields
this is something which we use
extensively and the nice thing about all
this is it's all built-in you actually
can put any graphics and inside of the
field and the thing that drives me crazy
that's the thing that drives me crazy
when people do it wrong they have the
graphic on top of the text field and
then they write the text that goes
underneath the graphic and if the ticks
on the left-hand side looks yeah it's a
clearly it looks like a so this this
will ensure that the text and graphic
never grow up so you can place nodes on
the left to right and do all kinds of
CSS effects to them if you want
this is a special kind of slider which
is normal slider actually has one value
this one has two this is minimum and
maximum values usually people use it for
for this camera setting with by moving
these two sliders you basically
automatically set their minimum and
maximum values other than that it looks
like normal slider and this is something
we guess we went with based on
experience we we had a need to show show
of the controls and the application was
created we call it effects sampler the
cool thing about this application is not
the controls effects application its
supplication can show any kind of
controls your own controls - all we have
to do is create your samples and
implement specific interface on this
sample and the samples will appear in
this UI besides the fact that it
actually shows the the sample examples
of how he controls works there are
several tabs there where you can
actually provide the way to show the
source code of your sample one second
and and the CSS related to the sample
and and Javadoc actually do so there's
several several project projects which
are already users like Jeff extras flex
grant effects and effects forms and
lately we we counted the number of
downloads there's 19 downloads right
just what this doesn't sound like a big
number but these are separate projects
that are using if examples to
demonstrate their own samples
something went there we thought it was
so-so
actually there's a text field right and
the text field searches on the tree is
so it's no no I I pruned the tree as you
type in and as you clear you know every
time it takes changes the tree gets
updated so the trees are you know it's
very few tree items so it's pretty quick
to prune it and no define them what's
visually there it's a very simple
implementation actually but effective
for this case I would say if you if you
take and clear the huge tree I think
it's gonna be slow yeah but something
like that we can think about the thing
yeah typing inside the tree view itself
in the tree view as ficus yeah now what
you just saw was sort of like main
things we focus on but there's a lot
more controls in the library there is a
boulder api which actually some people
used to this in swing in java effects
that exists in the CSS for most of what
I did back in the swing was get rid of
borders yes so now basically some people
asked for the for actual borders API and
exists it exists there we have
breadcrumb bar which is really nice
small control which allows you you will
see it in future in few minutes and the
demo which allows you to do a normal
brain Trump we have grid view which is a
visualized grid container where you can
put in our images or basically any any
graphics or any controls and then scroll
through it very nice for showing some
kind of picture related albums hidden
sides pain it's basically a pain where
you can have sub pains on any side or
all the sides and you can hide them and
show them easily by clicking them by
moving your mouse mouse pointer next to
the side of the control the
I'd paint appears and you could buy
click on it you fix it basically there
so it's very useful for some some
controls hyperlink level you probably
understand what it is it's a level where
you can have links inside of your text
info overlay it's it's an overlay on on
some kind of graphics usually
transparent master detail pane very
commonly used in enterprise applications
where the detail pane actually can be
invisible hidden plus/minus slider
- slider is something which is used for
infinite scrolling where you drag the
pointer actually and it provides sort of
like a what they call it like it is
continuous event continues here scroll
it changes the the value such that you
can use it for continuous scroll are the
rating where you basically show that for
coming like a normal rating you have on
the web pages five stars one to five
stars segmented button where you put
together several toggle buttons and it
becomes sort of like one very nice for
toolbars and it's not short view where
you can actually select something from
the screen graph by by doing a kind of
like like that bounding box selection on
it there's a lot more going on inside
but this is what is visible actually in
current release of a two 2827 yeah and
now we're gonna go to actually you know
it's enough talking is not not good for
for this kind of presentation so we're
gonna show you actual stuff alright so
I'm gonna cut this a little show up
because we're running a little own time
given how much more we're going to talk
about but I'm going to work through some
of these samples here so the self
example our application I apologize for
the low resolution it is what it is
though so you can see here we've got a
few different actions you you can see
these actions have been generated from
the source code over here which is just
you you know so the point I'm making
though is that that if you're wanting to
learn how to use controls if it's the
source codes right there as well as that
the Javadoc for the action group code is
right there as well but we can see that
if you disable say Group 1 you know that
disables it in all places it's just your
typical action code action proxy is
exactly the same except that's using the
annotations
there's your borders you can't problem
you can't see in there but this
different kinds of borders itched and
just normal line you're gonna title
borders that you see there with
different radiuses just new everything
you expect bread crumb bar yeah you know
all kinds of goodness the button bar is
actually deprecated and controls effects
because it's now moved to gyro fix at
you 40 so we're not going to have to
maintain this for too much longer we'll
come out and have changed to the gyro
fix scene control package but the bottom
bar is basically a control that you
enter Tate the type of each button in
your button bar and it lays out
according to your map your operating
systems preferences so Windows has a
different batter or button order then
vectors and so we use this inside
dialogues both in controls effects as
well as the new dialogues API that's
coming up in 8u 42 have button over
operate some specific button placement
so unfortunately resolution so small
that you can't really see but if we
switch between Mac OS Windows and Linux
you can can't no not really
you can see that it changes order
not all of the butts are available all
of the others it wasn't
that shouldn't be the case if it is the
case as a bug I mean all the buttons
that you put in should appear so if
they're not appearing I'll be very
surprised but yes because you can throw
what 10 of buttons you put because you
put the button type there and you add
the buttons and it changes location
based on its type basically so Knicks
control is your typical segmented baton
so instead of having you know your
buttons in total group you can have them
lay it upside each other with various
styles you can have you know ones that
toggle multiple buttons or just just one
like that and you can spread it across
multiple toggle morrible seek minute
buttons like that the cheat combo box
that sets your normal one that's your
cheat combo box and last thing is is
that the combo box doesn't disappear as
you go through selecting same with other
checklist where you same on the cheek
treeview so you can you know it the tree
views a little bit smarter and the
scenes that it can toggles the state of
the cell of the tree items around it
based on the selection so if we sleep go
for this route changes you know as you'd
expect yeah I mean they're just cheat
boxes so yep yep yep I mean at the end
of the day all the UI controls and jar
effects and controls if it's a styled
using CSS so you know if you're familiar
with Java fix we have two skins Caspian
or Medina they look vastly different and
there's no Java code that changes when
you toggle between those two style
sheets it's literally just CSS changing
so there's a little bit of a validation
example here you can see I'm toggling
the teks field requires death so that
top text fields just losing and gaining
their little required status those
decorations so no decorations you can
put the nodes and nine predefined
locations you can change CSS you know
you can do you can have multiple
decorators on any particular node
the validation fire that's what's
happening if you if you go back for a
second you don't see anyone Edition
right now even though the fields are
invented right now so as soon as he
starts typing something they have to go
through the filter the required is going
to be there but the validation
validation declaration is going to show
up as soon as you start editing it and
now all the validation the conditional
yeah yeah yeah it's just to show that
this field is actually required so as
Eugene said we've kept all the old
dialogues API around up for this current
release it's all deprecated so if you
can see lots of strike throughs in your
code it says sign for you to start
moving across to the new API s
but you know the I'm sure those of you
familiar have seen all of these but the
typical dialogues using the baton bar
along the bottom to order the buttons
based on the operating system we support
you know what nice thing about controls
effects is we translate into roughly 20
25 different languages so when we do
builds we download the layers
translations from the web which you can
see when I just run great look no way
way off the top of the list yeah so
downloads all the translations you can
see they're just when I start up a
application yeah I'm trying to go a bit
quick so I've got time for questions at
the end but we can come back to this
later on so we've got a whole bunch of
pre-built dialogues like the command
links dialog font selection dialog you
know log and just everything you did
expiry
glyph font grid view so this is
something that we don't have in Java VIX
which is a nice feature supports just
laying them out in a grid and as
virtualized so it's not creating all the
nodes that you know are off screen it's
only creating the nodes are on screen so
it's very performant unlike this blue
font demo which I've been wanting to fix
up but it's very very slow because it's
not virtualized it's creating every
single node upfront and these are so
these are some of the well this is all
of the fun all some glyphs that we have
support for hidden side panes this thing
where if you move your mouse to the edge
it's just
Pop's now that's a little think of it
and if you click on it it depends it so
if you move away I've been labeled
something that was kind of came up with
that would be quite cool it's basically
code incarnates normal labels and
hyperlinks if you say hello world it's
just in a normal label you can see there
but if you put square brackets around
say world it turns the world into a
hyperlink and that you can say yeah so
you put multiple hyperlinks and then it
kind of reports back and which ones
being clicked which is something I've
always done in the past when I was
building dialogues in a real world and I
just you know about dialogues this this
application was written by company name
and I wanted the county name to be a
hyperlink this the paint had to do it so
no info overlay no just little things
that you know saves you having to write
them so master detail so we can you know
animate things in and out
programmatically from out from any other
sides notification this shows it
currently from the top but you can also
slide it from the bottom it's got a dark
theme as well
Oh stylet hey hostile what's the tally
yep yep
so notifications you know these are your
typical things is this text then if you
do models and they slowly fade out at
such low resolution I can't do too many
in one place but you can kind of run
them up off your screen plus/minus
slider so this is that thing we you know
it's just going to keep on fire and
events until you let go and then it kind
of slides back to the scene too so if
you've ever used Picasso or something up
there it kind of allows for the infinite
scrolling popover control so this is
what Eugene was saying that you can just
drag off and detach and you know other
modes got no content which isn't a very
compelling demo but yeah it is it's
chosen that something we should change
against yeah
Eugene's properties cheap so the sample
shows that the property she currently is
before that button which is this button
here so you can see for example if I
come in and change the text you know
we're just changing the properties of
this button from the properties sheet
and it's reflected over here so it's the
same of the text field and he's got some
at custom beans as well just the range
slider control you can do the look
there's the low in there high and you
can drag the range to modify your rating
snapshot we've used quite a cool control
you can just select text here you can do
it I don't think you can even do it on
you know animations all those a little
bit baggy as you yeah and what you can
get down the bottom right is just a
snapshot so you can scare kind of a live
image of whatever's happening inside the
snapshot view
well this resolutions really low so you
can see this fixed columns in the
spreadsheet view fixed rows there's
cells spanning is editing so in line
either Tina doesn't really show that the
text field little staff spar control
which is just down here which you know
supports things like showing progress
and having multiple items on the left
and the right Jack's were running low on
time Yugi right it takes fields so this
is you normal text field this is a
clerical text field that does fades in
this little button
this is what's telling you it drives me
crazy so that takes kind of goes up to
the image and no further and saying if
you've got two images like that and I
think I'm gonna hand it back to you
Eugene okay okay so how do you I mean
how do you get involved the the thing is
that this this is all done by a lot of
different people and you can influence
this by asking for something or do it
yourself so how do you get involved it's
very simple way of doing it by by doing
it and six steps so what you need for
the step one is you need mercurial
grotto and JDK currently 8020 on your
machine all that is easily easily
installed without I guess all of you
know how to do that you need about
bitbucket account which is free how the
controls affects people is on a bit
bucket so you have to be able to fork it
so now I'm step number three you fork
the main control controls of X repo and
then in step number four you clone into
your machine this is an example of me
cloning it and after that the repo is on
your machine you can build it by simply
typing Radl clean assemble and run the
effects sampler by typing run run and
that's basically all you need to to be
able to have it in your machine and
happen it if you need to
so where is control effects this is our
main site it's its own effects
experience
as well the futures are listed features
are listed and I guess Jonathan just put
the latest latest update they're
describing 827 we have a Java dot latest
wait a stable job that conducts that
controls controls of factors at all
yeah we put a lot of effort into our
Java Docs that's one of the main things
we we try to do it's very we don't want
to have multiple sites where we document
things so all the documentation goes
into the Java doc the code is actually a
bit bucket you can see all the walls
going on there and the weekly pages have
all the informations in information you
need to start working on at all or to do
anything the issues are also a good
bucket
anyone can supply the issue and we work
on them as soon as we can then you
should understand it's not our day job
we have news groups at groups that can
still control effects at work we
currently have 182 members on the group
it's fairly active all the translations
are done on this nice site called
trans-fats where you can go and
basically translate our bundles to any
language you know currently we have
around 20 23 and 20 and our build
automatically downloads all the
translations for for the next Thank You
sorry iteration the thing with
translations is unlike the Java code
Eugene and I can't go in and translated
into simplified Chinese because we just
don't know their language so some
releases have more translations some
releases have less it depends on if the
translators come around to translate in
the strings that need to be translated
and we have a strict policy there just
has to be a huntress income converted
and it has to be huntress even reviewed
so in this release I just did I think we
lost about five translation yep so we
took one take 100% finished
illustrations and this is URL so how
does how does the how do you get the
controls effects the group IDs org
control effects artifact a these
controls effects you can get it at maven
central we have an alias which is
religious that
that or control affect the board our CI
server actually pushes the snapshots
every hour and that's again an snapshots
maven cetera and this is the area
snapshots that control spectacle it's a
good way of keeping my house warm in the
winter just running a build so there's
always a lot of questions were snapshots
on the moment nobody seems to find it
so the alias was created how do you
contribute very simple we open source
all we have to do is sign sign the
contributor license at CLA that controls
effects at work and there are simple
rules basically everyone works in their
own Fork and contributed by giving us
the pull requests and we basically the
view the bullet quest and in Mirjam as
soon as we can you can contribute
anything we don't guarantee acceptance
but any good idea will be considered if
you in doubt post to control checklist
anything bug fixes jar samples whatever
new features obviously will be discussed
in there on there on the list and either
accept it or not I guess Jonathan
usually doesn't write yeah and if you
don't discuss from the list it says a
pull request until I get around to
thinking about whether we want it as is
the case at the moment okay so what are
the future plans there's a lot of ideas
and a lot of things to do
we actually have to add more pre-built
dialogues based a new new dialogue API
there's a lot of requests related to
scene builder support there's some
support already there but there's more
work needed we have to do some research
and implementation of glassman API that
probably going to depend on the job eh
CPI which is not there yet and based on
this new glass pane and we're probably
going to implement the declaration in
validation as soon as it's ready and
then use it to implement like
reemployment lightweight downloads we
have ideas for table view improvements
search
filtering there's some work started on
docking frame it's in the early stages
but it started and we did some research
on the controls effects mobile which you
may hear religion also this is kind of
maybe a bit shocking
Metin use the guide effects library
donated all the work to control the
facts and we actually have it in in one
of our branches so we're planning to
incorporate it as part of control
effects we don't know yet what will be
included all of it or some of it it's
very hard to judge and it's a lot of
work you can see there's a lot of stuff
in side effects yeah and we're not gonna
just report it yeah yeah it's it's a lot
of work so we honestly don't know when
it's going to happen but we'll try to do
it as soon as we can because we know
people people like these controls so J
defects becomes part of controls effects
tradition and that's wrap up basically
we're obviously depend on community and
all you should know is that this work is
not our day job we'll do it at night
usually 17 hour difference so we do it
as as time allows and basically you
should celebrate the expectations
accordingly so thank you very much time
for questions I guess oh the answer to
the board the burning question what do
you think I guess it's obvious right
shocking right
so Jonathan actually is doing the
session tomorrow 3 p.m. this is a very
good session about how to build custom
controller so if you have an ideas about
doing such thing
I suggest you visit this this session in
that room right there yeah right
question questions
as the question is do we know common
terms for translations and the answers
unfortunately no well they'll be good to
find a resource like that because we
sometimes do get people saying what does
this mean yeah because then sometimes
when the people put a string in for a
spreadsheet view that the guy that did
that was French and the word he used was
unfix the rows and I don't know that
unfix is necessarily the right word but
that causes consternation with the
translation team I think it depends
highly on the language because I've done
Russian and Italian translations besides
all the standard English we had and it
it really depends on the language
because some words are totally different
I know Lithuanian words are not even
comparable to what it is in English I I
guess Chinese is even more drastically
different so so it depends on specific
language I think
so so the question is controls if it
couldn't be rolled into jar effects and
the answer's no I mean as one of those
it's it's just totally super project
it's just a coincidence that I'm
involved in both really but the goal is
of course to have high quality API with
good documentation you know all that
very consistent with jar effects where
is a situation where we can move it up
such as dialogues we do although if you
were involved in the Jaro discussion for
dialogues come into AE 40 you'll know
that was a very very long discussion
which resulted in a huge amount of churn
and a discussion over the right approach
and the end result being that the API
for dialogues met you for tea is
entirely different than the API and your
own controls effects but the
implementations the same and that in
itself saved a lot of time you know need
at least now if anyone ever questions
the jar effects at you 40 dialogues API
I come I've got burned into my brain the
GRI ID RT 1 to 64 3 and I'll just safe
does so there and they'll know they'll
read you know you know a hundred pages
of text and they'll understand all the
decisions but no there's no plan to
wholesale movie everything in the jar
affects the fact there's no plan to move
anything more into geography except this
time
well I mean I'm an Oracle employee but
this is not an Oracle project so yeah I
mean that so the question is is there
any support from Oracle I mean I haven't
been told not to do this project which
is you know here in real risk so and
there is no kind of support that yes
yeah so in that regard it's ya know so I
mean yeah as far as I'm understanding
I'm taking that ask for forgiveness
approach with winnin if time comes but
as far as I'm concerned right now
controls me because my spare time
project I'm not I'm not making money on
it I'm not competing with the gyro fix
UI controls projects so I don't think
there's a huge amount of consternation
going on inside Oracle HQ well only so
far is that I'm not going to build a
controls effects control that's going to
come in the next release of gyro fix and
so so you know I I have insight into
what we're going to do and it's all
public record what we're going to do in
the next release so and that goes for
any of the other jet you know Jeff
extras and other open source projects
with UI controls of Bill it doesn't make
sense to duplicate efforts so yeah
that's the extent there is a procuration
between projects it's not very tight but
everyone knows what everyone is doing so
we're trying not to have any kind of
overlay yeah there are things I'd like
to build by that Jeff extras have bound
not going to because they've done it and
it's just even if I could possibly do a
better or differently as there's no
point I'm as will contribute to TV
extras so so my day job is to be
backwards compatible like my controls
are fixed job is to make nice API and
you know I have a proper implementation
that works well so I'm more focused on
doing there and if I break API I'm not
as concerned if there if it becomes
mission-critical to someone that we
don't break API we can review their the
in bet as far as I'm concerned you know
we've got the controls if XD of mailing
list if if you're sending it feed up
with us break an API let us know there's
instances where we can help but for
example what we're doing with dialogues
is massively upsetting but the
alternative was to well there was no
nice alternative you were going to have
to either stick with the controls
effects dialogues API which you can
continue to do or you can have to move
to the new one what we've done is
provide you for the option to transition
over time but we don't we don't just go
and go what I'm going to replace foo
with bar and you know and break
everyone's API but you know so it's
considered Burnitz
obviously we're not going to break it is
if we can yeah but when there is a good
reason yeah we will with tab ordering
tabi hasn't just person tab King going
through the fields oh okay
so we do have an API for tab navigate
orphan
focus traversal I I don't know the
extent of whether we could do that but
it's something we could look into I mean
you can put in your own focus traversal
policies but yeah we I've never really
explored it - I've only explored it to
the extent of how do I get focus into
this part of my control but it's
probably some way we could do that if
and that's one of those things we you
know put a feature request and I'll say
either in Java fix itself or on
controller fix as a stopgap no yeah same
build of support it's one of those
things I don't use scene builder I mean
I'm I'm inside the guts of the UI
control so I never really pop out of
that and go into C and build it it's one
of those things that's you know higher
my list just another request for that
I've tried some I've tried the library
imported the library I've seen at least
50% of controls working yeah I mean at
the end of the day well it comes down to
it's just someone I mean I've tried to
convince other people to just do the
scene builder project and get all the
controls work you know comes down to you
know having the right kind of
constructors with the right type of
annotations that you know that simular
can understand it's a pretty simple set
of requirements but it's just hazarding
a higher analyst up till now but we've
got quite a high number of things to do
it's one of the things on it's not as
high minutes yeah ideally I'd like just
to have someone if and if no one stepped
up will be one of us there just sits
down and makes all of them work but yeah
that's what you know bit back a pull
request so forth
yes yep I've said that on the list a few
times you know if someone wants to do it
I will work with him to you know clarify
the process because honestly at right
now I don't know precisely what the
answer is
I'd have to sit down and work out for
myself I know some of the requirements
but I may not know all but if someone
wants to do it I'm more than willing to
sort that out because that would will
take a few hours but they'll be and
that's when yeah and that should become
a requirement for every new control yeah
you know once we do that we're not going
to accept any controls without sim
builder abilities so yeah we're out of
time but I don't see anyone kicking us
out so if you've got more questions feel
free to ask our second Alice station to
go to feel free that you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
