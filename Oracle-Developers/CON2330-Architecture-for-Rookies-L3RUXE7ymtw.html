twitter handle and today i'll be
speaking about architecture for rookies
and now another question I'm really
tough Speaker I thing because I'm just
asking and asking questions from you
guys how many of you actually read the
abstract of the talk oh my gosh I'm
surprised okay because Big E before I
even start I want to us again set a bit
of expectations connected with this talk
it is about analogies that we can use in
daily basis speaking with the business
people who make the decisions in order
to make them aware what kind of
decisions they are making because
suddenly or not something there is a
plenty of technical decisions that are
made on the high level people who
actually not necessary understand the
technology not necessary even we're
connected with technology in any point
of their life except emails and maybe
Excel spreadsheets and then they are
saying oh yeah you know I heard about
awesome staff called microservices we
want this so this is the talk about
analogies what we can use how we can
speak so if someone expected
introductions and different
architectures stuff like I don't know
different way of architecture and
software it's not the talk so yeah but
still I hope that will be useful okay a
bit of me so how many of you attended
the previous talk i did this tuesday
okay so for the rest i'm basically
started as a software developer that i
was network administrator then i finally
ended up idea as a business analyst
product owner kind of thing so basically
I speak with business and I speak with
developers also have experience in the
internal IT departments as well as in
working in a software vendor kind of a
company so I have like really various
kind of the
effectives come connected with
delivering software and basically
speaking with the people who we can call
customers sounds really scary so
basically if I just say a customer or
business person I mean the people who
are not developers or architects I also
have like the adult background really
but you can basically see and what we'll
be talking about during this
presentation in particular I try to
present you a bit of a change in
thinking in terms how we can present the
staff to the business try to give you
examples of the analogies we can use in
order to tame the terminology and
convincing to change in the way that how
we can actually convince people from
business that refactoring is not waste
of time that we can actually scarfing
delete something from our software yes
delete that basically tests and stuff
like that are quite useful and is not
waste of time having automated tests and
how to maintain the maybe not maintained
but how to approach the documentation
which also people usually want to have
and the concurring the fear how to that
give up this a bit of the predictability
for the business people that to make
certain that we know what we're doing
because again trying to see from a bit
different perspective sometimes when we
present the business our ideas connected
with technology they think okay first of
all I don't understand what you talk but
I can't say that say that because I mean
oh hi executive so obviously I can't say
that I don't understand again how does
people actually know that it will work
so how we can figured out that basically
nothing will collapse there is a bunch
of other stuff like that that will
basically talk through okay that's good
let's start them but before we even
start we need to think a bit do we know
the people who are talking to
I just mentioned customers business
people so there are like general crowd
right but when we are preparing to
starting talking with those people first
of all we need to know if they have any
personal benefits from the change that
we would like to introduce why because
if we can mention that all you know this
is this refactoring staff maybe you
think is like its technical you don't
understand the word turn factoring but
basically application can be like twice
as fast as it was and we are doing the
search engine for the airline tickets it
basically means that when customers
click to the phone and in stating you
know instead of waiting like you know
one second which is like ages he will
say wait for instance half of a second
then it's quick winning the comparison
to our competitors so this business
people can understand oh okay so if I
will be responsible for making our
application faster and earning money and
taking the customers from other
competitors it's good for me good for my
career so it's good to like try to think
what could be like personal benefits for
the executive we were talking with if we
are talking with the finance person who
have to like you know give us money and
not necessarily care if our product is
like you know competitors come on i care
about cash so then maybe we good to have
this having like rough idea about what
this means from the finest perspective
and so on so depending how with whom we
were talking to trying to find the
personal benefits for this person
because then if the person will be
convinced probably will just again
support us up in debt you know those
challenges that we have a refactoring or
deleting or any other changes are I
don't know changing the infrastructure
from manali to micro services or
whatever we think about risks okay we
cannot pretending that there is no risk
in doing stuff that we're doing in
we now move that our beautiful
application right but it's good to at
least say okay there is a possibility
that something goes wrong and those are
the stuff that can go wrong but we have
ideas how to mitigate the risk and if we
don't have ideas then it means that okay
it's pretty tough and then we at least
have to say to the business as well and
also I work in the project when there
were like no rollback plans because the
rollback was not possible at all so we
are doing the step and there's no coming
back so if something goes wrong we are
down and so far never went down so you
know hopefully it will be with all your
projects as well and again what kind of
changes are the stuff brings if it's
refactoring then probably there is no
changes from the user perspective but
sometimes if we are deleting features
and we are talking with let's say our
marketing partners and saying okay we
just noticed that our customer never
ever used this feature so maybe you can
you know change your slide deck and
remove the screen from here because we
would like to hide the feature and then
remove it when no one asks about it so
again we need to think if they're
changes from the person that we speak to
is required if yes then what kind of
change we expect because the worst stuff
we can do it's like okay trying to you
know quietly do the change no you know
not saying anyone then probably people
won't notice but if it's like on the
power point somewhere customer will
notice and they will ask you sold as a
product there was the icon here and the
icon disappeared and it was on the
slides and everyone no slide deck is
dyin on the most important style stuff
ever yeah who cares about dimas slide
decks important stuff okay so changing
thinking is quite difficult but we can
support it in terms of the architecture
there is like one popular way of doing
I don't know how many of you knows this
diagram because it wasn't plenty
conferences and print the other places
as well not a lot of you so basically
this is called box arrow box are all
cylinder architecture Ted New York quite
frequently speaks about that and
basically this is simplification of all
architecture that exists and we can
actually think okay is it useful or it's
not useful well if we start talking with
people yes it is useful just to try to
explain stuff however we should remember
that our deliverable is ready system not
beautiful diagrams not beautiful post
its not or whatever we have and
sometimes you can see in a company's
like walls covered with diagrams like
that that are really beautiful I myself
produce a lot of diagrams in beautiful
language called UML just to simplify and
obviously business people don't
understand women at all but still we are
doing that we are doing a lot of boxes
as well my advice is when we talk with
people just draw when we are talking
then maybe scan had not put a lot of
effort in doing stuff like that because
again it's kind of an analogy and in
real systems basically anyway not work
like that so remember that this is not
something that you want to delivers of
the diagram you want to deliver the
software and again it's useful ok so the
really popular stuff i think thats
everywhere right now we have discussion
monolids and microservices so business
people also hear that and they are
starting to wonder ok what's basically
going on because from our perspective
our beautiful application have like I
don't know modules let's say so modules
are separate right so we have
microservices right it was joke okay bad
joke sorry guys so again I just can't
diagnose after the power our children
party so yeah
so ok so again trying to explain this
maybe sometimes quite again tricky and
especially if the people in our company
our land now pretending that there are
you know technical executives and they
know everything so sometimes when we
trying to speak with business people we
also have to think what level of the
accuracy went to you know involve those
people in because maybe it's better not
to actually going too much into details
because then suddenly try to explain
that you know monoliths are some kind of
the you know containers and then the
magic containers happen and the person
says all right I know Tucker no no no
it's not necessary I mean let you know
like the bucket 0090 and then finally
another stuff that seems to be like
revelant but basically it's not so
explaining the things that for us seems
to be really obvious yeah it's quite
difficult and challenging as well so
remember appropriate level of details
because in the end yes we have
rectangles and then quite surprised that
you haven't loved I think I have to let
you know give you some kind of science I
don't know maybe if I just wave like
that then you start laughing right now
okay so yes in terms of trying to
convince business to actually move from
monolithic architecture to micro
surfaces again we have to at least try
to explain them that okay so the old
kind of doing architecture is not
beneficial for instance because if you
want to upload update one kind one part
of our modules basically it means we
have to update everything microservices
gives us you know no dependencies
between the other stuff in order to do
that we can try to draw like the staff I
just word container again maybe would be
bad so the model is like the one kind of
a bucket
the container the microscope services
are separate so how to can illustrate
that if you have the applications with
the modules you can draw basically a
tree so tree have like separate branches
branches cannot connect if your features
are connected it means that we cannot
have the separate things because we have
dependencies and in business people we
understand that basically two branches
cannot like grow like together so just
go ahead and be joined together again so
this is the kind of analogy that we can
tell we can try to use in terms of you
know trying to say about date place and
how to disconnect the date paste maybe
it's the level of details that we
shouldn't go in just to make certain
that we know that we need time to make
the appropriate architectural decisions
on the database level as well so it's
not only the GUI and speaking about the
dependencies again sometimes we are not
aware about all the business
dependencies that exists and they are
added on during the development and
sometimes we have a bit of a mess like
that in terms of the trying to figure
like okay what's connected with with
what other part happens especially if we
have that quite big kind of software so
if we have like RP kind of a software
then answering the question especially
of the system that it's kind of the
legacy system of okay how to divide the
staff is quite tricky so again one step
at a time so trying of the small steps
trying to separate one thing then adding
and adding and adding why again just to
suffer the conversation and support the
business in the way that we won't just
destroyed the whole application maybe we
destroyed only one module so the rest of
the sub the only part of the business
will be affected and again it's maybe
not sounds that convincing but if you
have the big business that you support
you can prepare to be down for a moment
for one part of the business but
basically being prepared for being down
with everything it's not really
not really easy so yes I had an example
from one of my companies basically we
were moving from the kind of the
spaghetti kind of architecture to
something more surface of land oriented
than in the end to like more across
services oriented and again we split the
staff one by one because again downtown
was quite precious for us it was like
the TV company so every minute every
second even of downtown is basically
losing money so business do not want to
allow that some better start from
something less risky ok next part is
basically talking about terminology
terminology so this is a bit tricky as
well because sometimes we even do not
understand that some people cannot you
know they're operating in different
languages we because obviously everyone
understand that no word interface for
instance right everyone understand what
integration is but not necessarily it's
that the way so again before we start
talking it's good to like answer a few
questions again there are quite useful
questions 3w door code so obviously why
would like to talk about this particular
thing why we need to do that and why
basically this person will be interested
in that part because maybe we actually
don't have to talk about the
architecture because maybe we can do you
know like obstruct it for one level up
and then it made easier in the other
hand maybe it's actually really
beneficial to talk about our constraints
now you know use in a human language way
because then the business will
understand why it takes so long and why
you know cause us so much right so yeah
okay so what we would like to
communicate and obviously the question
that we already answered who now
analogies so why we need analogies again
just to simplify our life so this is
quite easy and also we need to think
about what kind of the business answers
we require to deliver
the stuff and now we just move to the
example of from integration World War
integration because when my mind to
majority of projects I worked in were
quite like integration or like moving
from one database to another some kind
of specific kind of product person
integration is especially tricky because
you can think okay one actually business
should care about integration and what
kind of the business questions we may
ask connected with the integration but
let's say that we have like frequency so
how frequently we should refresh the
data right it's a business question
let's assume that we have again this
system for search for a ticket and
basically booking the airline tickets
right so if we have a question like okay
what is the price that we should show
can we show the price from last day so
how long the caching should take should
take this is the business question if we
ask it correctly so okay are you happy
with showing the ticket price from last
week probably business will be like
terrified come on last week for a ticket
for airline customers will kill us when
they click x and then discover the
prices they know twice less as higher or
10 times as high as it should be so
obvious question now last week it's not
in the fresh enough so then we can
basically start discussion again data
mapping or dictionaries so let's say
that we have again airlines and we have
code of airline like 101 which is for
instance united and 102 which is that
sale of tongues us or european career
and you know there are cooperating
during the same ireland so maybe if the
mapping changed nothing happens so we've
suddenly instead of ticket for united
will show the ticket for Lufthansa well
again it may basically make the
difference because there is not the same
airline so customers can be disappointed
especially if we discover that we choose
the wrong flight because
this time the flights were weren't
connected so again data mapping is the
question as well so how would like to
handle it and if we actually occur in
the other hand if we have let's say some
weird stuff like seats colors and if
changed map their color mapping will
change maybe the customers even don't
notice because who cares so those are
the questions we should actually ask
again even based or scheduled so let's
say that we have different kind of
example so do we want to have the
changes of the ticket prices checked
like every five minutes or maybe if
basically someone booked the ticket so
the last so the previous price is like
not valid anymore then we would like to
refresh the price right so this again
the business question at least the
business should know the answer oh yes
yes we cannot have the scheduled checks
because we need to know instantly when
the ticket price will change if we ask
it in the correct way they will
understand that and they could respond
to us and surprisingly sometimes
business side oh you know actually we
need the report from the ticket prices
only once a week so we don't need to
refresh the the reports that are read by
the our accountants every five seconds
or you know every time the price will
change because accountants check the
report only once a week so then
surprisingly we can discover that okay
we don't need real-time integration and
in one again one of my projects actually
we tried we will really try to make
real-time integrations for reporting
system and then the business set
actually we need the reports once a day
so it simplifies our life a lot and no
one actual you know everyone assumed to
come and 21st century we have to have
like almost real-time response from our
systems again so even if we start
talking with the customers about the
integration we also can use that kind of
nice analogies so like talking line
alright so sister
and just knocks hello could you give me
a price to the system bar this is Tembi
system B response and again this is nice
kind of analogy so here you can show
people how the integration works in
terms okay so do you want to have like
request so okay give me the price and
then respond or do you want to have like
you know waiting so the pool okay just
I'm waiting if the price is here I just
take it right so so even based stuff so
depending on what you basically want to
show to the business want to want to
explain this is very nice because it's
like talking with people people
understand talking with other people and
systems basically talking as well but in
the part of a different maybe slightly
different manner why it's like helpful
as well because sometimes if we say okay
the costs right so we are thinking okay
do we really need the real-time
responses and stuff like that so here
you can basically illustrate that the
the cost of checking every five minutes
if there is something new it's different
than if we basically have the
communication real time because this is
like for instance I don't know checking
every five minutes if the new email
arrived without any notifications of
your screen right so if you have
notifications from Outlook it's like
okay it's like instant right so a lot of
analogies around that connected with
again costings and stuff like that okay
so going forward because I see that we
are like halfway through and there's
like half an hour left how my favorite
part actually so convincing to
refactoring because again I work in a
software house and internal IT
department and the approach the
refactoring involved of both of them is
quite different if your software house
people are usually more aware that if
you invest in your architecture if you
invest in the stuff that you have is
beneficial for the future because you
can build on
if you are in internal IT department
people not necessary understand it that
well especially that they want something
that is working so also we need to
remember about having the balance
between the two because again
refactoring is important but doing
graphic Turing only for refactoring oh
yeah you know it's not necessary it's
probably fun at least for some of you
but it's not that's beneficial for the
people so how to convince people to
change the stuff so first of all we need
to remember what is the core business of
the comp of the stuff that we are doing
what is the core business process if
refactoring effects that core business
process in some way it's worth doing why
because all the side staff actually
usually don't bring us money and core
business processes that are supported by
our application are the stuff that are
beneficial for customers even if its
internal customer if it's a software
house no matters so why we also remote
you should remember about that because
if we're a factor something that's not
core business process but it's cool
anyway and we decided to do that but we
destroy the core business process and
for some reason our whole application is
down because someone I don't know delete
some class by mistake then it's pretty
tough so it's always good to keep eye on
that and here the context is the king so
depending what you are doing you have to
keep eye on that so in terms of the
booking engine performance is one of the
key stuff to do you probably need to
watch if you can do the booking if you
can do the search those are the three
stuff that you are really cut off so
this is the the key thing that we are
thinking ok so now it'd be fun part I'm
trying to figured out the influence of
the stuff that we would like to do so
let's say again booking stuff we have
brilliant idea to add new feature the
new feet are actually two maybe room
maybe not adding new feature because
it's not refactoring but again maybe
okay if you want to like
change the algorithm beneath from the IT
people I would name it like new feature
because we are doing something brilliant
because we were a factor the algorithm
and because of that it would be faster
right from the business ok such works
kind of the same guys you know this is
the same ticket here so sometimes people
don't understand that the technical
stuff that we were doing beneath can be
kind of a features okay we want to
change the algorithm so we have to think
okay how it influenced let's say
searching right could be like positive
in terms basically oh sorry this example
is negative power to you know guys party
so if it just is negative for the
overall stuff maybe we should rethink if
it's something which is positive so we
expect the increase of the performance
okay that's good why this is like the
mental check I especially didn't put
here any numbers will go to the numbers
in a moment just to make certain that we
at least mentally give the you know some
kind of the exercise of validating our
ideas connected with the stuff that we
want to do if we see that really bad
class that is I don't know if you are
scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
and it's like full of if and other stuff
inside I think oh my gosh I really want
to change it because it's awful but when
when you think thats basically change
maybe actually you know doesn't change
anything in the code maintaining t my
tendon ability actually no one used this
class anymore so then it's the kind of
the check that you need to do in order
to actually decide if it's like worth
touching it or not why because we have
usually a lot of brilliant ideas with
and we are not validating them
especially if we work in a software
houses and its really good to at least
mentally validated because then we can
prove that it's it was actually good
decision and if we were wrong because
okay I know that everyone are perfect
developers yours but sometimes we are
wrong really rare occasions we can learn
from that because we had some kind of
assumptions if we don't do that then
usually base
okay no lessons learned and again there
is like really high level at the
beginning because we don't want to waste
time especially if we are like group of
you know we are doing it like at
refactoring as a team and we are like
discussing and we don't want to waste
time of doing like really complicated
maths but if we decide that our
refactoring idea is really brilliant
then is the time to think okay what
basically it will do maybe it helped us
to maintain current code easier but
maybe it basically had the influence on
our application in the staff like I
don't know our response time currently
is that but we expect to have some
better results again this is like
measuring stuff that we already have and
putting the really rough expectations
don't if you put here the second and god
forbids show it to the business they
will measure it afterwards and said you
failed so those are our expectations and
own it's good to have them just validate
because maybe it would be better maybe
you'd beside the words and maybe it
stayed the same but again we have at
least lesson learned and we can check
and also if we try to convince our
business people are we have this idea we
decided that is a good idea and we
basically Finkle that will be benefits
you know there will be another customer
instead of you know waiting ages for
their where a response will take you
know half the time it's like brilliant
so this is one of the staff again
thinking about the measures fears are
quite important because usually we just
we are humans so if we just keep on you
keep an eye keep our eye on certain kind
of things that we decided to measure
first and usually don't take into
consideration other stuff because we
want to improve our measures right so
this is kind of the point of the factor
that we as a human's follow so beware on
that so if you think about crazy here
then probably you would like to improve
this crazy stuff so it's good to at
least think in the way that we can
actually prove that and measure
afterwards that this change actually
happened so the example of maintaining
email 10 bility sorry difficult word
after party really then it's hard to
measure if it's called more maintained
or you know you can easier maintain the
code or not really so if you put
something like that in the table and
then someone would like to validate that
it's like oh okay but how so keep on eye
on stuff that you can basically have the
clicker measure it and it's like easy
just don't waste your time of on the
complicated equations because I've seen
the complicated equation of trying to
figure it out there it's easier to
maintain code or not okay another really
useful stuff that we should have its
tests if you have regression tests and
doing the refactoring and you have a lot
of dependencies you don't you simply
don't don't know if you broke something
or what really probably after doing the
manual regression people will notice but
if you have software that is ear p kinds
of software so it's huge and you have a
lot of dependencies because it's 25
years software which were built by
several engineers and it's like you know
modules are mixed somewhere like Roy tan
in Cabo Sam in C and there are a few
nice Java parts but the rest is like
nightmare then it's becoming quite
tricky if you have newer application so
I don't know five years old maybe it
still seems to be old but you have a dis
hope that you have covered for tests
it's easier to make changes it's simply
easier because you can see if something
is broken or not and again if we be
build software usually it means that in
the future there will be changes in that
software so if you have tests and if you
do the changes then again you are
covered in terms ok
we didn't broke anything that's success
surprisingly even it's like really
convincing for business if you have
tests and said okay we do the
refactoring stuff and we promise we
won't broke anything because if we broke
something our test will be read and we
will see that it's broken some of you
can laugh but I worked worked in a
company which had like only manual tests
and it's nightmare and I work in a
company where we had like around
seventy-five percent of coverage of
tests it's not that bad but if we take
into consideration that it was like kind
of five years old software it's you know
quite good and it was right quite of big
because it was like five development
teams on different location constantly
developing new features so it was big so
those stuff giving not only as a
developer's kind of the you know feeling
good that we didn't broke anything but
also the business obviously sometimes we
don't have full coverage so again
regression tests are useful as well hmm
and another stuff that we usually use
here is the documentation obviously we
finish it we change something and then
it's outdated I assume that having the
you know user documentation is like good
because maybe you I don't change that
frequently but if you have like class
diagrams or those beautiful legs angles
i showed in the beginning they are
usually changing quite frequently so we
have to like beware that it's changing
especially if we are doing like trying
to figured out what is in the code after
few years again returning to the test if
you have tests we are more or less
certain that the stuff is doing what it
meant to do and maybe one another for
funny story from my previous company we
were rewriting one of the features
because requirements didn't change but
we want to have like more independent
architecture so again microservices but
we didn't have a clue what actually
featured do so we checked in tests
because documentation of this
I was a bit like that so it was quite
impossible to check in the documentation
what the feature actually soup was
supposed to do I see that some of you
are loved for themselves is that you
know even without me mentioning that you
should laugh so it's progress few of
your waking up ok so ha ha oops sorry
raise your hand who just woke up ok rest
fall asleep oh my gosh I'm so bad today
ok so another part is ok how to compute
conclude the fair connected with
deleting code yes deleting and basically
maybe we should answer the question ok
why the hell we should delete the
features we develop them one so why
again we should keep in mind that our
application will live longer than a year
at least I hope so that our applications
won't be like killed after a year of
being on a production so it will grow
and people will have that change
requests surprisingly some companies
have work special boards connected ok
which changed should be implemented how
to prioritize and other scary stuff and
we were quite good in adding features we
are quite good in you know managing how
to add additional staff our poor you ux
colleagues are quite good in squeezing
yet another feature term shiny
application that go afterwards is lean
on quite heavy but then not literally we
think about ok how we actually can
remove stuff from our application why we
should removing again maintaining code
is easier and if our customers don't use
the features it's really easier for them
as well if they don't see additional
icon our UX people probably already know
like blessing me right now because oh
yeah we can have like nice kind of clear
design almost like Google's nice
interface from the search engine or
almost like other shiny stuff that are
like no beautiful and seen
for without time on the bottoms okay so
deleting unused part of the app
yes so we should be at least certain
that if we delete something it's
basically doesn't collapse everything
again if we build something it means
that there were people who fought that
it's the brilliant idea to do something
like this maybe because there were like
constraints connected with the
technology that was available during
that days again I work in a project
where the software was built before
internet protocol exists existed so
basically if you have something that old
then you just do a lot of you see a lot
of workarounds that were built during
the development just to do something
right and then if you want to change
that it's quite sometimes tricky to
understand ok but why so for that
basically we fear changes with your
deleting and business fears as well it's
not that only we are you now feeling
okay we don't know what is that you know
why basically call someone thought about
you know putting extra if here or extra
loop somewhere in the different place of
a code it's also the business things
okay if you guys don't know what
basically happens if you delete this
what I should all know that right
especially if person is not necessary
technical and don't see the fun in
refactoring so why the hell they should
agree okay so it's good to first of all
start from measuring up front okay how
the application works if we don't have
tests we can still have this measure the
performance and merge and try to track
okay how the features are working
currently just afterwards compare if we
broken something or not it's quite
challenging again if we don't have
coverage if we are covered with
automated tests obviously our life is
easier but I also just want to give you
a hope that if you don't have automated
tests there is a way to measure stuff
you can plug something in the code just
to track the performance of this
particular bits and you can try more
like soft way like observing users how
they are using the tool basically you
can again
try to write the tests afterwards to
check you know how it's working and then
try to refactor again I'm speaking a lot
of tests but also we need to remember
the tests are not the product so we
should still remember that we have to
build the product that is working so
working tests are not the same so yeah
balance is the king so again how to
think about the stuff how to delete what
to delete this is another question
because okay maybe maybe we have few
items you know the features that are so
no there are quite old we notice that no
one asks for change requests for them so
maybe this is possibility to get rid of
those so first of all it's good to have
at least a list of ideas what to can be
let you know smuggled or hidden and
basically get rid of it as I said
measuring again this gives the kind of
the predictability and certainty for you
guys and for a business it's good to
remember that if we show the business
that we actually not will actually know
what we are doing it's more for them
it's more easier for them to agree for
that again checking the dependencies if
you don't have tests between the modules
and if you don't have microservices or
Michael microservices kind of
architecture so your modules are
independent then you need to try to
track dependencies because sometimes the
quite weird way deleting one of the
feature influenced everything and no one
knows why suddenly our application you
now have like several errors so it's
good to at least trying to check and
track where this particular class you
want to delete you know appearing
anywhere in the code and again you can
hide the stuff that you want to remove
just to toggle on the glove maybe not
for all customers but for one customer
and tell you know just trying to see if
they're actually noticing or not again
before do that usually better to speak
with marketing people because as
everyone knows
odds are most difficult part of changes
if sides is that you know that
screenshot on site is done once it's
really hard to convince people to change
so you know remember about that and if
no one noticed and basically market
marketing also is like oh my gosh but
you want to sell this feature so why you
want to remove it so if you convince
them as well that basically no one
actually use it and we have proved like
we measured that no one clicks there and
we also hide it and customers didn't
notice that is basically the proof that
really nobody uses inc then we can
remove and again one story from one of
the companies are worked in it was like
the broadcasting company and there was
like again feature we were tracking for
like half a year just to check if
someone's using it no one click it so we
decided to hide it we hide it no one
noticed so we were like almost you know
ah ok maybe we can remove it but ok
let's wait for another month and then
suddenly we received a call from the
mine accountant hello I had the
beautiful report report that I used was
a year and now my button disappeared so
yes so beware and always if you watch
the stuff like that keep in mind what
was the purpose of the future if it's
like the one time report delivered only
for the you know it is internal IT
department and the main accountant want
to have the feature to produce one
report once a year you probably want to
keep it so then you know remember what
it is feature about and measuring the
time when the people can actually use it
because let's say that you have like I
don't know retail company that use the
certain features only like in festive
periods and you are measuring it during
the summer when basically nothing
happens then probably they won't use it
but afterwards when there is a festive
and they say oh where is my festive
feature and you say oh you know you
haven't used you just deleted it there
will be panning around and people will
be like really really terrified so
remember what basically the future is
doing
remember to check it in the period of
time that is revelant for this feature
as I said several times before context
is a king okay so we are going slowly
towards end so quickly wrapping up we
should remember to first of all answer
the question connected with whom we are
talking to what they are like personal
interest in the change if there will be
skirt if we do the child so what is the
kind of the risk what is the
dependencies in the other areas of the
business connected with the change we
would like to introduce in terms of like
deleting code or a refactoring
especially if we are removing its really
good to align with the old sylosis that
will cooperate with because again some
companies have still sclerosis some are
more flexible but I assume that usually
we have departments just make our life
easier or more difficult hard to say and
because we have cirrhosis and because we
have to communicate it's good to answer
the question what is the influence for
other people not only for the users
again it's good to have like at least
mental check what the change will bring
to the core business process we are
doing even if the refactoring is cool
and it's for something that is not in
the main business path we have to make
certain that it won't destroy the
application and again we need to present
it in the you know quite nice confident
way to the business yes we know what we
are doing so if we delete this pillar
our application won't collapse if we
have tests that's excellent because then
we can say yes we have test so we are
certain that it's not collapse and if we
can also present the benefits because we
expect to have benefits it's even better
if we don't know the benefits it may be
sometimes good to try to think if there
are any is it hard to measure them again
it's better to at least say okay we
don't we are not clear so it's always
better than pretending something that
weighs
he won't happen because we managing
expectations around here so if we set
and we say something it's good to them
deliver that even if it's like maybe not
visible in the features level so
customers don't have new things to click
but yes those are the stuff okay oh it
was a lot we all have like ten minutes
left so tech ideal for questions would
you just one scream one coming small
because I love comics as you seen your
really buttered laughing today I don't
know if I'm not funny enough I know
partier oh yeah challenging okay do you
have any questions then Bureau oh yeah
this is the hell stuff okay okay guys so
I won't keep you longer thank you for
your attention obviously suggestion no
bribery but beer is waiting for you guys
I suppose so thank you once again and
see you around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
