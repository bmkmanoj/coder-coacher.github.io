the outbound product manager for
database security at Oracle for North
America this is the April ask tom
session and with me today is Pedro Lopez
who is my counterpart for Europe Pedro
does two jobs at Oracle in addition to
being the outbound product manager for
database security is also the product
manager for the database security
assessment tool which is what I think
the more interesting things that we've
come up with lately at Oracle just a
quick administrative reminder again we
are recording this session that means
that anything you say or put into chat
has the chance of making it into public
notice because we need the recordings on
the ask tom page so today's topic is
database security assessment tool DB
that came about as a result of a lot of
different groups at Oracle that we're
sort of doing the same thing and that is
looking at Oracle databases saying there
are thousands of parameters in the
Oracle databases there are lots of
things that we've all learned over the
years that you should do to secure an
Oracle database and we needed a way to
quickly scan an Oracle database and see
if things had been done properly and so
many of us had developed scripts to do
this I had done this in North America it
had been done in China and Singapore
we had several separate people in Europe
that were doing script based analysis of
Oracle databases to quickly identify
security risk and and find things that
needed to be fixed so this was sort of
silly that we were all doing this
separately and the database security
assessment tool was the result of our
product development team saying wouldn't
it be great if we had one single tool
that would do what all these scripts
were doing and it was perhaps a little
bit higher quality and produced you know
more usable outputs
what you're going to see today is the
result of a couple of years of
development effort we're now on version
2 of the database security assessment
tool and it is believe it or not one of
the most downloaded if not the most
downloaded utilities at Oracle it'll rip
over 15-thousand right downloads yep so
over 15,000 downloads of this and it's
just amazing how many people are now
using the database security assessment
to them what we're going to do is going
to run you through a quick overview of
the tool will show you a demonstration
of the tool and then we will open up for
general Q&amp;amp;A so with that Pedro I'm gonna
turn over to you thanks for us that's a
great introduction and I think it's
worthwhile to get through this
background because it's the basis of
this set and one of the good thing is
that we were able to get a big internal
community to contribute to the beset
pool and of course we are also getting
contribution from customers and partners
that we prove the pool but let me first
go through some drivers on why this is
becoming more relevant and well if we
look at the news it's almost well we
have we're getting to be in the news
almost every day cases of data breaches
and we know and we just got that
confirmation from one of the last
Verizon reports on the importance of
databases and the data bases being one
of the most important targets for well
which occurs are after and if we look at
the the cost of a data breach well
there's a lot of different numbers that
you can grab from different reports but
at the end this is about that much to
brand businesses and the victims and
just for you to get an idea the
the litigation costs is really really
huge these days so no one wants to be in
that place where you got the date which
because if I figured something in the
way that you shouldn't be doing and of
course well biggest challenges around
apart from the well known severe
shortage of security skills in the
market and if you drill down to database
security expertise well it's even harder
to find someone that is expert we often
see these role beings being around in
dbaas
some DBS do not have any security skill
some of course have if if you discuss
this database security topic with any
CSO or any security departments well you
know usually you will hear back that
this is a deviate of mine you know so
there's a severe shortage from secure
getting a lot of automation tools to
exploit weaknesses in databases in tough
to find out databases and from the
customer side there's well this shortage
of security skills hard to get people
from the market and no automation tools
or and nothing that can have really
helped to speed up the process and of
course while many organizations don't
know how vulnerable they are and we can
really say this by looking at data
religious people say that well you know
I'm not using encryption I don't need
encryption because I'm I'm secure or or
I have a firewall and I'm done it's
furious when you append some security
sessions and get out of those sessions
with the idea that defense in-depth
approach stops at the application so and
what about the rest right what about
where the data is so this is a challenge
not the
our vulnerable you are and and if and
again back on one of the hottest topics
these days channels data protection
regulation which of course is to protect
personal data if you go and listen to
some of these conferences about GD P R
and the presenter asks the audience know
how many of you know where your
sensitive data is you have an asset an
inventory of your assets and you know
most likely you'll see that three or
four hands will graze up and the rest
what so there's also this challenge of
understanding where the sensitive data
is and how much data there is around so
of course most people know that they
have sensitive data now the challenge is
to find out where and how much and of
course one of the biggest drivers that
we are seeing around is the EU GDP our
it is affecting companies worldwide not
just in Europe in fact well if you
provide goods and services to a European
citizen you need to comply with the EU
GDP are and EU GDP are introduces some
key aspects on data breach notification
on tracking concern on the right to be
Brasher or to be forgotten another other
requirements as well what we are seeing
is that this GDP our regulation is
strong and is being adopted by other
countries and even in North America in
some states by well almost copy-pasting
the ugdp are law taxing to their own
regulation just to step up the current
data protection regulation at that state
or country to match.you GDP are and this
will of course make it easier to
than do business with EU citizens of
course we also see that gdpr is being
used as a differentiator so well you
know I am I'm following this GDP our
regulation and I'm a head of my combat
competitors so this is also something
that we are seen coming and we will see
more as soon as we have some
certification bodies for each GDP are
well again well this is all about
protecting data and we have sensitive
data laying around in databases for some
some decades now and of course hackers
are after after these data because these
data typically translates to some euros
or dollars or pounds or yen's right so
in knowing or getting your hands on
credit card numbers or payment
information per take off words social
security numbers your personal IDs well
you name it and in in in this sense to
grab to get there and on this data
hackers are thinking in kind of these
terms right so they can use these
automated tools as I just explained but
they are really after the data so
knowing which databases are available if
the deck is encrypted well I have a
bunch of rainbow tables here like we try
to do brute force force attack are there
any users with default passwords maybe
there are I can carry in who are the
privileged users how can I affect them
in reaching these three is this company
so maybe I know what data do they have
maybe it's valuable data if I'm if I'm
able to know the database version I can
know how vulnerable this database is and
of course the main objective is to get
in and get out as fast as possible
without being tracked and of course if
ik
know what security controls are in place
they can avoid being caught and you know
what in the mind of the DBA or the DPO
in GDP our terms should we should really
be thinking about about these things in
the similar manner in fact we don't want
to be in that place where the hacker
knows more about your databases then
then you do so at the end we should be
asking similar questions well is my
database security configured where is my
sensitive data who has access to this
data what security controls and policies
are in place and one thing that is
missing on this slide is well what
security controls are available to me
okay because I might not be aware about
security forces that are available so if
we could have a kind of a report that
tells me that that would be great but
the challenge typically is as I I was
just telling well you know do we have do
we really have the knowledge we have a
database security team do you know what
else to look for it we have time to do
the analyses and then how can I
prioritize and what are the risks of not
doing or fixing these findings and this
is typically questions where TB SAP can
help you answer ok so the database
security assessment tool as russ was
saying is a run for some time now and
typically it helps you to address these
three key things that you can see on the
triangle on the on the right hand side
so it helps you to understand if your
database is secure be configured if you
provide you information about database
user accounts and their entitlements and
will help you as well to identify
sensitive data we then provide some
nice-looking reports easy to read with
some priority prioritization in place so
you can address most important things
first
we added up in this mapping to EU GDP
our articles and recycles and CIS
benchmark recommendations so you can
immediately see in the report if that
finding is related to any CIS
recommendation or you can also see if a
particular advisory that we are giving
is related to AU GDP our article or
recycle and this will help you to at
least understand which security controls
can help you to address that article I'm
not saying that if you pass that finding
you will be gdpr compliant know you want
GT car compliance is a lot more than
just technical controls but at least it
will guide you in the right direction if
you want to address those particular
article several cycles so this is a
standalone tool as you'll see on the
demo later it's quick and easy to run a
nice fall and it's free to current
Oracle customers and partners so what
does DB set checks for so it checks for
the security configuration and we have
some categories in there it checks for
users and entitlements and also for
sensitive data in this latest version so
it works for database Oracle databases
starting in 10 2:05 and later it is also
supporting 18 see it's certified running
agency if you want to give it a try and
the way it works is we have kind of two
different
two different workflows so one is to
generate and you can see there at the
top of the task title of the slide one
is to generate a database security
assessment report and in that report
you'll get the overall security status
and users and their entitlements and for
that you need to run the DBS have
collector the division collector should
be run at the database server well
because we are grabbing some data from
the operating system as well it will
generate a JSON file that if you don't
say anything you don't pass any
parameter to the collector it will be
put inside the password-protected zip
file
and then that file that actually
contains the collected data can be used
as an input for the DBS reporter the
deficient reporter is where the
it's like the experts in the box so is
where the actual rules and intelligence
are so this report will run through this
collected data and will generate a
report in these four different formats
okay so rent collector grab that file
you can read the run the reporter on the
same server on your laptop run the
reporter taking that file if you'll
generate a report in four different
formats HTML is the most and widely used
one because it's simple and contains all
information you have the Excel one it
doesn't contain all the information but
it's good if you want to put some
prioritisation into some tracking on
what's been doing but what is going on
if you assign some person to do it or if
you want to change the severity level
for example or some of the findings the
text one is more is there more for
backwards for some backwards
compatibility with some of our internal
processes but you can also use it for
copy pasting for other formats and the
JSON file we introduced it also in this
latest January release into all T is
contains the same exact information as
the HTML report but in a JSON format and
in the main objective is really to make
it available so you can further process
this data in the way you you want okay
we got some requests from customers
saying well I'd like to process that day
how can I do it well you can also you
can always parse an Excel or a CSV file
but it's a lot easier if you want to do
something over a JSON file and if you
didn't have a chance we updated the DB
set download page to include some DB set
sample utilities in Python that will
help you to extract some findings and do
some comparisons so you can find that on
my Oracle
okay so we provided sample files for you
to do that and of course you can use
that to extend whatever use case you
want to cover so these findings that we
will see in the report will be presented
like this so we typically have a
category of the finding on top left and
we present this in a way like UFO
category all deep dot records and this
is kind of the rule ID so if you want to
say something well you know you have an
issue in rule I'll get both records we
immediately know what you are talking
about or let's fix all the dot records
on the top right hand you'll see some
tags I'm writing well this is related
CIS and gdpr
and if you want to know more details
it's at the bottom mapping to
regulations it provides you some
information about the actual
recommendation number and gdpr articles
it provides you of course some details
of the finding and remarks so on the
remarks you'll see some rationale and
recommendations on why this is important
to to look after and to fix okay so at
the top of the borders will show the
demo you'll see these summary and this
will help you to understand four
different section the current status so
you have the pass
so that's okay it's it should be false
it's false so you'll pass that rule so
there are some rules that we present it
as evaluate so this means that the pool
alone are not able is not able to find
out if that's a good thing or bad thing
so for example if you have ten users
with the DBA rule is that good or bad
I don't know do you have an DBA is 100
DPS are they sharing accounts not is
there any Scott with the DBA role
assigned so these these are things that
you can of course and mostly most of
them are as you can see here on the
report are on
the privileges in reception so we say
well we found this please have a look
okay the advisory ones are the ones that
we are giving you with some advice we
haven't found anything configured around
these topics for example you are not
encrypting data
maybe you should if your databases
containing some sensitive information or
your company's subject to any regulation
so we are saying well we advise you to
encrypt data but well you'll take a
final decision about that then we sort
it out by low-risk medium risk I'd risk
and represent the total number of
findings
well so we have the overall security
status from that table and just to give
you an example on knowing the users and
their entitlements there's finding there
with which is called DBA which will show
you the users with grants of DBA role
and we show direct grants as in this
case so someone grant the DBA to Scott
and we show indirect grants as well
whenever you see this arrow so this
means the DBA rule was granted to the
Afro that it was then granted to Deborah
okay so this is an interesting thing
that we you will know better and we say
well we evaluate this if this is it
should be like that or not probably not
so you get these reports reporting
multiple formats as I said and it
contact they contain the same exact
information so and then you can use it
as as you wish the spreadsheet contains
a bit less detail but it serves
typically for a different purpose right
if you want to track or change them
change some status levels based on your
knowledge of the environment very what
running is just to give you an example
someone might say we might find out that
you well you know you are not e I'll be
think in the database so you'll say well
this is disposes of high risk but you
might be using any other tool to do
auditing so maybe for that particular
case shouldn't be I risk so you can
change it in the Excel spreadsheet so
and that covers the first
the first report okay so the database
security assessment report so the second
use case is or I should say the third is
to discover sensitive data and for that
you use a different component this
component is called the discover and the
discover does not rely on the collected
data from the collector so what you'll
need to do is you can review this
configuration parameters where you will
be defining the database connection some
sensitive categories and risk levels we
provide categories and risk levels out
of the box that you can change it if you
if you want
so typically we just need to edit the
database connection and you're done
there's more into it you can scan a full
database particular schemas or add some
tables schemas tables and columns to
some exclusion lists but well typically
you just need to change the database
connection and moved on then you should
review the necessity the the sensitive
patterned file we also provide these
files this file out of the box for
English you can create your own or add
existing one and we also have some files
for different languages different
European languages that we can provide
you via well either yours security cells
specialist or the three cells in your
country if you have a special need for
language file in your local language ask
them and we we can get it to you so
after setting the database connections
reviewing this sensitive pattern file we
are set we just run the discover it will
use these pattern patterns to scan your
column names and column comments and
generate the report an example
what we call the sensitive type you can
see here on the screen birth date is 65
then we have these three three
parameters you can define the regex
to search for column names the regex to
search for column comments and the
category so if I find these I will
categorize it under PII linked party
pets okay so you can as I said you can
fully customize customize these the
categories and either on on the pattern
file and on the category file but they
be to match but you can customize this
of course well we expect some false
positives but we provide you tools to
filter them down and exclude some
columns either by editing the sensitive
pattern file or by adding them to
extrude lists again you'll see a report
like this so will be the report that has
a summary of the sensitive data
landscape so you'll have a list of all
categories number of sensitive they've
also identified number of sanskrit
columns and the number of rows this
might not match if you add up all these
robes because well basically one table
can have columns in several different
categories so you can really you cannot
really add this number and expected
anyway and the report if you scroll down
you'll you'll see some findings for each
category and a bit down you'll see this
table summary so you'll print it will
show you the schema name
table number of columns out of which
this ones are sensitive this number of
rows and sensitive categories and
typically these columns these tables are
good candidates for encryption to put
some controls in place for protecting
from privileged user access or in gdpr
terms to restrict processing of these
data by processors a bit down you'll see
the column details so you'll know which
columns are sensitive data and how much
so we'll be showing the schema name they
will name column name column comments
sensitive to the category in CC spike
typically on this table you'll see
candidate columns for masking or to be
pseudonym eyes by this I mean value can
reduct these columns
segregate these attributes from the the
data that can uniquely identify the
person and of course we can also define
some multi policies based on those
columns that contain sensitive
and guys this really is easy the reason
I'm using a view it is there's one step
along the way here where it'll take a
few minutes to do stuff and I didn't
want you to have to wait for five or six
minutes so let's let's walk through
database security assessment so the
first thing you're going to do is you
are going to go to my local supports and
download it when you download it what
you're going to get is a zip file it's
as simple as simple as that you're going
to copy the zip file up to whatever
server you want to look at and you're
going to unzip it the actual file name
may differ depending upon version but
it's going to look very much like this
okay once you've insisted you're now
going to go out and collect information
on the database that you want to analyze
I'm going to collect both configuration
information and entitlement data but you
could just do one or the other
completely up to you okay for
configuration data I'm just going to run
DB SATs collect and I'll tell it what
database I'm going to log into username
and this it into the database and this
is the point that's going to take about
five or six minutes on a simple database
long run a database with a lot of moles
because that else you don't have to look
at it it's going to take the output and
it's going to fit that into a zip file
which in my case I have encrypted now
I'm going to collect I'm going to create
a report from that data so I've
collected the data I'll create my report
by running DB set report just tell it
what file I want to give use give us the
password I create I use when I created
an encrypted zip file it runs through in
it creates reports which we re encrypt
with a new new file and if you can see
through the the board out here it's
created a test for for an HTML report a
spreadsheet version and a JSON version
okay now these are all the same data
just presented in different ways because
sometimes you want to just read through
it HTML is great for that spreadsheet
might be good for you no I wonder
checklist stuff JSON for manipulation
several different things ok now let's go
through and look for sensitive data you
can do this from any workstation you
don't have to be on the database server
I just happened to be on this in this
case but the first step for doing this
is going to be to go out and tell the
discoverer portion what database you're
going to talk to we give you a sample
configuration file and normally all you
do is copy that and go in and give it
the connect information for the database
since I'm running on local horse host
all I have to do is give it the service
name but if I was running in remotely I
changed the host name import I can
choose to change the language I'm
looking for I'm looking in English in
this case I can choose to tell us
specifically which schemas to search by
default we don't look at empty tables so
it has to have at least one row in it
for us to look at it if you can choose
and look at empty tables if you want to
look for columns that might later
contain sensitive data instead of doing
an inclusive list with schema scopes all
I can say I want to ignore certain
schemas by giving it a list of schemas
to ignore there's a lot of configuration
you can do here but all you have to do
is tell it what database to connect to
now that we've got our configuration
file set up we run the discovery portion
tell where we want the output to be
placed I tell it what our configuration
file is and tell it where we want the
output to be placed in this case I'm
going to put it into something called
sensitive data dot report tell it who I
want to connect into the database as
username and password and we're off to
the races and running as with the 'kathy
collector the you know the configuration
the output goes into an encrypted zip
file and in this case what we have is an
HTML format and a CSV format that we're
fitting out so not quite as many formats
as the configuration data ok so that's
it I've now got everything created I
simply copy those two
to some location unzip them giving the
password I used when I created the visit
files I'll unzip the sensitive data
report as well and now let's look at
what we've got
so for configuration this is the same
stuff that Pedro already showed you
you're just seeing that the total report
now we give you overview information we
give you kind of a highlight of what
you're using and then we give you
findings and the findings might be high
risk medium risk or low risk we'll tell
you what we if we found something what
we think is wrong and why we think it's
a problem and how you might remediated
and we give you the same information
again in spreadsheet form I like to use
the spreadsheets to create a project
plan and what I'll typically do is I'll
merge the tabs from multiple different
databases into a single spreadsheet just
rename the tab with the with the
database name but it's really as simple
as this for sensitive data again we have
a couple of formats but what we're going
to see is what parameters were used to
run the report a quick summary of what
types of data we found what schemas we
found what we've data that we think is
sensitive in and then a drill down
individual tables how many rows how many
columns and then actual details on the
columns of sensitive data itself from
time to download to the time when you're
able to actually start running or start
reviewing your reports it's typically
about 10 minutes it's really really fast
because there's no real install and
there's no you know massive amounts of
data that are that are being scanned
again what you're looking at with the
configuration reports is the same stuff
that we used to do with our own scripts
with the sensitive data discovery
reports were not going in doing a deep
scan on the data
looking at column names and column
comments we had a question earlier in
chat about performance impact on this
it's the same as any time you log in
with sequel developer and you run your
background queries that's about the
level of performance impact which you're
going to see by running the
configuration and sense of data
discovery reports okay so with that
Pedro I think I'll turn it back over to
you
Hey happy just share screen and while
you're doing that Sara asked what
permissions are roles as the user you're
connecting for DB set need there is a
list of permissions in the docs for it I
usually run it as DBA but it doesn't
actually require DBA it really just
requires select privileges on a couple
of data dictionary views yeah that's
pretty well-documented and uh we advise
we advise you to go through the docs and
just create a user for that we've been
in privileges but more slowly it might
turn out to be easier to just use the
DBA
but anyway well thank Thank You Russ I
think it was a great great demo I think
it has I liked the main steps of how to
use DB cell to get the security risk
assessment and the sensitive data
assessment report so with with this in
with these two reports we can of course
help you to address some of the EU GDP
our challenges we put in there some
patterns to identify sensitive and
personal data in Oracle databases you
can also you can always tune these
regular expressions to meet your own
needs but well discovery part will help
you to do that we also believe that the
output of the database security
assessment tool is a great tool to
support the data protection impact
assessments we know that data profession
in PARCC assessments or in the GDP are
is a lot more than assessing database
security risks but a it is of course it
is also that so you need to know how
your database is secured and the risks
you carry to be able to feed that
information back to the data protection
impact assessment so you this is
information that DB sub provides is
really useful to be part of that the EIA
report we also map these findings to GDP
our articles and recycles as I said it
will help you to match the GFI global
security controls to address these GDP
our articles and recycles and let me
just pause here just to say something
about GDP R&amp;amp;D be SAP we I like some
findings and we clearly tagged some or
find some findings saying well these
addresses GDP our article these and that
but if you look closer all findings are
important to the GDP are okay
of course we are just I
the ones that have some direct
relationship but if you go through the
regulation of course good security is
something that you should be doing and
good good security practices so
everything that's in the report is
actually actually important and of
course we also provide some advisories
on security controls that might help you
to comply with with these articles and
recycles even if you are not using any
any of any of our security controls we
advise you to use some folks
well in summary the Assad is a great
tool to get a quick overview of the
database security studies you'll help
you to identify users and entitlement
and do identify sensitive and personal
data inside Oracle databases and with
that you'll be in a better shape to know
the risk you are carrying and to
understand what are the security
controls that you could be putting
putting in place to be in a better shape
and of course this is using Oracle
database security best practices so the
basis of it is of course Oracle database
security best practices as we said in
the beginning we grab some information
from scripts from all over the world but
we moon Alice's and included the ones
that we considered at our best practices
so you might find out there that there
are some things missing of course we are
always keen to listen back from you and
to get new requirements but but at the
end the basis is really database
security best practices so of course we
then take some other best practices we
took some from CIS as well and we aim to
add and Morris as we as we move forward
this will help you to leverage these
findings to accelerate complaints with
eg DPR or any other data privacy
regulation in fact it supports databases
starting in 10g
works in eleven twelve and eighteen C
it's provided at no additional cost and
it's available now there's last version
as I said it's available since
mid-january and would be great if you
could give it a try and provide some
feedback there is an OT n page just to
finish and open up for questions I would
say there's a no TN page where you'll
find it from a table that's like a FAQ
some
think of the tree the real that is there
but we'll be able to follow the tutorial
on the learn more tab there's a there
was a TV set focused webcast on gdpr
it's recorded you can watch it on demand
if you wish
and of course well we have a very
comprehensive for white paper on
database acuity and gdpr and I think
this is a great source if you want to
know more by we map particular finding
to specific article if you want to know
more these white paper is a great
resource and well of course gdpr is not
only about the database security if you
want to know more about gdpr and other
oracle solutions you can just go to our
calm go to gdpr
I have another slide here but I think I
missed that one rust you want just to
share the some information about the
e-book I think it would be relevant okay
so we do have a an electronic book that
we put out a couple of months ago
it is available on or on wwr comm /
database / security but it's really a
just kind of a walkthrough of the
different things that you might do to
secure in a local database a little bit
of considerations around it we've got a
chapter in there on GDP our chapter on
on cloud it's a fairly quick read but if
you get a chance to take a look at it
I'll try and find the URL later on here
I was searching for a chance okay we've
got all the lines hang on I think I've
got all the lines I muted
so I've got all the lines I muted and
less yuppies specifically muted yourself
we've now got open Q&amp;amp;A Pedro there's one
question from Patrick that I can't
answer and an Frank for yours no to the
best of my knowledge Rob wasn't involved
he may have contributed some scripts we
collected switch for a lot of different
people
rob was not directly involved in the
development of tv-set
and again just reminder for everyone
that we are recording yeah can you take
a look at Patrick's asking it yes and I
guess he sent your report on a problem
yeah I think it well it's already it's
already fixed Patrick we fixed the that
issue and it will be part of the tool to
release okay we will we will release I
think it's still this month so that will
be one of the things that we will
include in 202 and also the ability to
further discover to connect to the
database using TLS as so far is just
simple JDBC connection no encryption
place so we are having a few more
parameters to the configuration file so
you can set that up if you want to run
the discover from a remote server or
laptop and thank you thank you for
letting us know Patrick about the the
issue that we found and just fix that
thank you what will be required for
running it from an external server you
mean the discovery part right you just
have to have the the Sibyl library so
that you actually you don't even need a
sequel otherwise right because we're
doing this over Java yeah it's the
thrust store and you'll need a thrust
for and a key store we will update we
will update the product documentation to
include some samples on how to set that
up to make it easier okay because I
think that just by looking at those
parameters might not be that obvious but
it's typically how you set up encryption
on a Java program so you'll need some
trust stores in there and link it on
those parameters and that's it
I thought I saw a question and pedra I'm
seeing your chat and for some reason
you're getting stuff I'm not maybe
someone sent to you but if you scroll up
a little bit someone had asked about
pizza again oh yeah because he said to
you privately
so Frank Pete wasn't directly involved
but I've been following pizza again for
many many years and my scripts that I
was using which are in Indy beefs at a
lot of that was information that I
learned from Pete over the years so what
he what he didn't do any coding his
touch is certainly on there great
question
yeah yeah yes we've discussed well we we
grabbed some of these checks from
different colleagues that were running
these assessments and of course well we
we've seen some really interesting
things and some silly things and you
know we as you can imagine we've got a
lot of a lot of sequel statements back
and then we we did some three arch and
of course there are still some people
complaining that we should be doing some
things that we are not doing yet but you
know this is I like to what I really
like about DB Seth is that we are trying
to eat the kind as a community effort so
well my request to you is that if you
have any recommendation or any check
that he should be doing that we are not
doing at least we what I can tell you is
that we will have a look and if it makes
sense we will consider including it into
a TV set okay oh absolutely I think
that's probably how this tool assuming
that's how this tool evolved to its
current state is is by community by
crowdsourcing things to Jeff for if
you've got something we're not looking
for please give it to us so yeah so this
is the the e-book it was an effort made
by the PM Kim so each chapter was
altered by p.m. in our organization
inspected by scooter
musician and it contains a whole lot of
great information and advices so I think
it's C first reading</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
