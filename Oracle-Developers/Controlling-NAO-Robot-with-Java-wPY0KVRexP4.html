and we have to talk to you about this
robot cornell and the company with
making it are the robotics so i'm going
to talk a little bit about what the
robot is what it does and then i'm going
to show you a little bit how you can
program it first using graphical
software we are making and then how you
can do that in java
so let's start so sure what about the
robot so this robot has been absolutely
everywhere it's been sailing across
equator
it's been on the South Pole is a great
picture of him with the Penguins behind
is also been all the way down to level
one and it's been shooting all day long
so if you mister so we were just in the
other hotel in the Oracle double bond
and everything was working fine
so sometimes me of he hits me
okay so maybe you've seen as this guide
on reddit so maybe you can let the guy
with with elding's of famous now robots
so that's our president mr. island and
this image has been a huge success and
we've got people starting putting lots
of different pictures on all of us
internet so we got our first name out of
this so thank you internet you guys Rock
so let me talk a little bit about the
Halderman
history so we started in 2005 and we
were not in a garage we were actually in
a nice apartment is a calculator and
this is a first prototype we had and
back in 2008 we went to the RoboCup so
the goal of the rubber cap is to have a
soccer soccer team of robots playing us
against un as they are supposed to win
by 2050 so at the time they were using
dogs you know the dog from a boss and we
went to them and we said okay so you're
using dogs to play soccer
and what we suggest you do is that you
use human weight to do to play soccer
and so okay and so we said great we've
got customers and so is
that improving hardware and then since
then we made several evolution of the
hardware so first one it was very
fragile and was breaking all the time
and you had to be a really good
programmer to make it work and now the
robot is very 3d can fall tell sometimes
with braking and anyone can just take
the robot and play with it and won't
wake so if you were all about the
company so we are more than 400 people
and so we have 40% of these people are
having D so we are constantly constantly
working on improving the hardware doing
new software versions and so improving
the weather but work and it's
reliability and so on we've got a PhD
we've got a sales team we've got offices
in Shanghai in Boston and everything is
done in Paris most of the work is done
in Paris so we assembled the robot in
Paris and we do all the work from the
mechanical design to programming of
cards of the Motorola to the higher
level software which is running on the
robot and all the software tools we have
and there are more than 400 universities
and labs while using node to do all kind
of research studying human robot
interaction or studying artificial
intelligence and also stuff so what do
we want to achieve where as a company we
want to have robots being into people's
home and helping them that's our goal
and there what you are seeing here is a
platform we are building to help us do
that and we all have in mind this image
of the companion robot we've seen in
movies in science fiction where you got
this robot helping people being with
their as a friendly robot and that's
well doing and in order to achieve these
goals are turns of challenge to mate
as are some hardware challenge there are
some challenges about how do you create
a market for this control pod what are
the mechanical design to do and so on
and that's what the company is doing but
in order to do that you also need to do
some fundamental research to make
progress and so that's why we are
eager to have people from universities
working with us and the last part and
the not least part is that we really
want to have people writing new
applications for the robot and exploring
solution with us and we're constantly
looking for developers we've got a
vision of what robot can do and what it
means the robot in your home and we want
to make sure that anyone want to hack on
this robot and write new software can do
it so that's how we have thought so I'm
going just to take this one so if you
look at the whoops if you look at the
robot it's got many different sense
holes so it's got two cameras it's got
four microphones it's got a sonar
detector also I can detect obstacles you
got the near shells and sauce so you can
know when it's falling and get up
it's got pressure detector is called
bumper and got tactical sense cells so
you can know when know when I'm touching
it so we need at least that should be
really easy to further able to interact
with you and to speak to you is got
speakers and can speak now something
like 14 different languages so that's
that's a hardware we are building and we
are not just doing this robot so
obviously when you have a lot of this
size it's real easy to interact because
everyone will see the robot fall system
is always like a little shy I want to
take it in my arms and so on and we also
got a bigger prototype called Romeo
which is four feet seven inches tall and
what you are going to do is that we are
going to take all the applications and
software on research that has been done
on the new robot and use them on the
bigger omiyo orbit zeroes octobots
you're seeing on this slide as a jazz
robot which are half of telepresence so
when you are home and you want to so you
are working from home and you have a
meeting to attend and you can just take
one of these robot and we can moving
around the office and thing is emitting
while you stay at home and if you
looking if you have you those of the big
boom theory as Alvin episode well
character does that and it already
happened in a Lebanon so that's one of
the crazy thing about a LeBron and why
it means to walk for the man is that you
can really sing you can really be seeing
what the future is going to look like
happening right before your eyes and
that's very exciting and as I was saying
we have this really cool hardware who
knows how to do tons of stuff and we are
building lots of software to go of it so
we've got similar tools for you to try
things where all the sensors are
submitted we've got tools to monitor all
the data that robot is a seeing and
something we've got a graphical form
environment called coil off which I'm
going to show you in a minute
and we also have lots of values SDKs so
we wanted to make sure anyone can
program the robot so you can write code
on Linux Mac and Windows you can use era
you can use surpluses in spider you can
also write a JavaScript code on your
browser and you can also write code
directly on the robot so let's talk a
little bit about what this platform can
do so one of the first big usage forward
which was completely unexpected for us
and he started here in the United States
it was a University of Montreal who come
to see us and said we've got this
autistic children and we will need to
have we can't just help them using human
doctors and we need to have a kind of
complementary object besides the doctors
who help the autistic children and so
they discovered that by using the robot
it was very easy to express
basic emotions and robot is never going
to be tired and autistic children have a
great interaction with the robot and
since you start building an interaction
between the autistic child Enzo robot
you can then have the doctor
be part of this interaction and stuff
helping as a child so that's very wet
and we now have a business for that you
can go into the asks know.com website
while you can site details about that
and that's really one of directly we
will concrete usage of the robot today
so the robot can also help one of the
big market where the nine is as I was
saying the companion robot so you can
imagine having the robot being with the
elderly people and monitoring them
Colleen Zi system trying something wrong
and we've got many insurance companies
that we weren't rested about that and
were any contact with us
blast free there was this big topic to
the edge everyone about what it means to
have connected device everywhere so the
robot is able to be connected to the
Internet is got Wi-Fi is got an Ethernet
cable we are also have engineers working
on adding Bluetooth and 4G and all of
this and we are living in a world when
there are more and more connected
devices are more and more data about you
putting the output on the line or in the
cloud and so on and what will you won't
do is to have this robot as an
ambassador for big data because it's
very much less frightening just to be
able to talk to robot and have half the
data exposed then yeah it's really going
to be anniversary for this and of course
there is one of topic so the robot has a
processor inside and we are very
attached to the fact that he's fully
autonomous but sometimes when you have a
ton of data to explore or heavy
computation to make and that's where
having the connected devices useful
because you can do all of this
computation is a cloud and revised also
defect language to that so you can just
write your web service in Java and have
the robots use this websites
so what next I just put on this file the
reference for this but you have to know
that robots are going to be a great
market is efficient they are going to
create tons of job our goal is not to
replace human with robot we just have
robot as a complementary object as a new
tool for humans to use and the
revolution of robots is going to happen
so you can choose by joining us and
draining out every problem and working
with Aldebaran robotics to be part of
this revolution right now ok so a few
odd about what exists already so we've
got this tour you can reach at Stough
dotted around Ephrata come and there you
can find lots of applications so we've
got n user applications like everything
we said about helping autistic child
it's just an application you can run on
the robot and we also have lots of
end-user application like for instance
an arm clock
so the robot is ringing and then he
walks away so you have to get up on the
bed and follow him and just tap in with
the head and we also have lots of
libraries because programming for work
like that is very hard you've got to do
tons of hardware and work and design and
so the idea when you join to the report
form is you get in contact with many
different people who are doing software
libraries or animation libraries of some
libraries and so on so it's really easy
to get started ok so now it's time for
the most so originally I was going to
connect the carafe to the robot but I
come to that so I'm going to just use a
carafe I don't know so let's see no
that's for it
okay so this is what coral reef looks
like so you've got simulation of what
robot is doing and actually here is
connecting to a vehicle robot so also
cirfairy white is a variable is a force
or baton on your desktop so that's how
I'm going to be able to show you some
things because I have the actual nerve
running on my PC so for instance let's
say you want to make sohbat say
something
so you just drag and drop box just click
say and how my PC is not playing any
sound which can see the bubble in the
text and let's say for instance you want
to make the boat where this hand when
same arrow so we can do that so I'm sure
hey I'm just connecting one works I've
thought zero so you can see saying hello
and then is moving and of course it's
not really interesting so you can just
connect the box on rows away and here
just doing both things in parallel so
that first graph and that's also how you
can use this to plumb very simple
behaviors or if you want to program a
dance you can also use that and we've
got the animation tool where you can
program all the movement of the boat
will easily and a timeline and so on so
that's the tool we use to make the robot
dance and so on
come on
okay so what I just showed you is how
you can just drag and drop some boxes
and do behavior so how does it work
beneath that so beneath that we've got
the new key frame lock which is also the
software that is running on the robot
and is able to make it arrive and also
just a thousand was running on my
desktop and we're making the vehicle
robot move and what we have is that
first on top you'll read these
applications you can publish from the
store and share with your people
those applications are made of
animations or behaviors and those
behavioral work by calling services that
are running on the robot and we've got
tons of these services but wherever the
language you choose to write your code
in so some tags to call the methods of
services is pretty much the same so
let's take a look of what it means so
here you've got a nokie main software
running on the robot and you've got this
list of services that are available and
each of these services has a list of
metal so for instance we've got services
to store and retrieve some data we've
got services to make the robot move or
walk and set up a good waste
we've got services to control the LEDs
and so on and currently currently they
are mods and things as searches
different services and maybe a thousand
of methods available and we are all
documented that so if you go to
aluminium ticks that comes like
documentation you can find this the
competition and you can find all the
list of API we have an examples of how
to use them
so Leslie so with what all these
services running together and key
messaging is a glue that is able to
connect this services together and also
what is the communication network which
allows do - well code on your desktop
and communicate to the robot so when you
have an interactive device like the
robot you've got to have many things
happening all the time because you've
got sensors processing data every all
the time
you've got events coming up and so you
may need to be able to react to these
events and to do stuff in parallel and
so it was really important for us to
offer all these things directly out of
the box within a framework so it's time
to do a bit of Java so here we go
drilling to make that bigger oops
here we go so I'm not going to explain
what the application of the session is
right now but you can see you'll just
create a session and then you get an
object which represents a service and
then you can just call method of this
service so if I were to run this problem
you would heard the robot say something
so here's another one so here's a little
bit in more detail what's going to
happen when you create a session so when
you create a session you first try to
connect to an IP address and so we get a
feature so maybe some of you know better
future his photos we don't it's just
something that has no value yet yet and
you have to wait for the future to
receive a value and then you can get it
and you can either block the call
waiting for the future of to terminate
or you can just do a synchronous
processing and so everything we do in
chemistry thing is a synchronous so when
I connect I can just wait for the robot
to be connected and this is going to
block until the robot is connected
is going input time I would an exception
and so here we can also see so I'm going
to make my call and it's going to return
or future
so if I put get in front of it it's
going to block until the call is made
and if I remove the gate it's going to
be making things in peril so that's
exactly how you would do the things I
was doing I was making in choreograph
you can do exactly the same thing in
Java yeah look yeah it's still going to
show this one let me think
yeah I can just physical so here we
create a service to the text-to-speech
and we also create a service to our
memory and we can raise event from
anywhere in the forum and get a callback
code and so those so that's how use it
you get a subscriber and you connect a
signal to a callback and so in the
callback you can do pretty much whether
all you want so again if this software
was running it could just tap on the
robot head and it would say something
every time I thought she said yeah so I
country show you the last example I'm
just going to continue
so that was all for all the software and
how you can use Java to program the
narrow road what I would finish by
saying a few words about the website we
have to build this community a Guzman
Chang REO so it's available at community
that I live on - Poetics dot-com and you
can join this and whenever you join -
the rapper forum you'll be in contact
with also developers these are some
people from the developer here today
yeah here we are and so what's really
nice is that you can share with other
people about the applications are making
we've got for when you can see the
source code or for some animations or
what other people are doing and what is
really great is that can also discuss
directly with the people from the R&amp;amp;D
about your problems and solution and
directly as them and that's a really
exciting place to be and also we do
produce and develop reproduce and bettas
all the time and we invite people from
the wrap-up 1 to beta test our code and
they get early access to all the
exciting new features or what so we need
a great place to be yeah I have time to
show you a little video so this was
happening in 2012 which we desire all
time
welcome to nowadays the question is who
we given up some Universal robots who
the evil of which we support is one
application that people have fun with
spending hours with something that maybe
- Hawaii love possibility
now if I am trying to I it's going to be
a comprehension test where now we'll
have a story and then are some serious
questions afterwards save each other's
listening
just going to say that now we stuck up
my family my help
okay so that was all for my talk so just
to give you and going to leave this
slide open so we've got the URL for the
developer program we are also hiring so
we can you can join us at the shapes of
our but a foul
there's a missing at the DOS box office
so you can register there but you should
restart before 4 p.m. and I was all even
my email if you have any questions so I
think we've got quite some time for
questions so yeah okay so the question
was if you are going to have the robot
talking with elderly people we've got to
have a really good speech recognition
software and so we are working with
neumes which is a company which is doing
the speech recognition software for the
iPhone and so we are going with
regretted that at first we were only
able to recognize a few words here and
then now we've got people working on
free speech to text recognition so you
can really have dialogue with robot and
sorry for that what I wanted to say
I know that's also we're still making
for us about that and oh yeah and we are
also working on improving the hardware
so for instance we can think about new
microphones to be able to hear the song
more clearly and simulated yeah yeah so
the question was about battery power
power of the robot so we've got the
battery in the back that can last
between one hour half or one hour
depending on what you are doing you are
doing and we have a project I don't
release them but basically you've got
research station and Robert is just
working around and when it sends that is
but really low is you just go back to
the battery station and charge himself
back and so that's how we are going to
be able to have robots really living
into your apartment
for long time it's still a walk in place
yeah yeah
so the question was about the movement
so actually there are several ways to
perform the robot you can either do a
very open loops like just saying I want
to move the joint from here to there you
can also do more advanced stuff using
Cartesian movement so you can just say I
want to do a rectangle and then we've
got two software that is going to do to
make all the computation so that you can
draw a rectangle computing all the
joints you can also do things like like
for instance robot does not have a
weight tilt its head but you can say to
the motion service tilt your head like
this and is going to compute all the
joints and do a whirl body motion to
help you achieve that and you can put
constraint like leave your feet on the
ground or leave your center of mass so
that you don't fall and so on and for
instance when you are saying the dancies
of the robot what happened was that we
we got the animator or just manipulating
the robot and taking some snapshot of
position even teacher would have and
then the soft rice computing
interpolation and making sure our bodies
not fall and so on so that how we can do
it so the question was about how we can
walk so it can walk on a solid floor and
make the transition to a carpet it can
work on its own cord or little obstacles
and the way we achieve that is also so
we we have the inertial sensor but we
also have position capitals for every
single motor so it can detect things
that usually people don't detect involve
ethics such as the backlash or sing like
that and we can know that the food
should be on the ground but is not and
we can compensate for this kind of stuff
I still work in progress so right now is
about it's moving and you push him it
just being too full but react to the
phone and protect himself but we've got
people working on improving that and
then there
is working you push him and just do a
few steps to convert says okay any other
questions yeah so the question was are
we using Russ
so not Freud not just right now so what
can I say well Russ Russ is a really
great orbiting firm rock which is
designed to help people not just making
time we won't take the wheel all the
time but it's mostly intended to
researchers so they got lots of tools
hype research what we wanted to do is to
have our own framework because we are
having different needs when you think
about what it means to distribute
applications write applications and our
store it's you have different
constraints as I'm just doing research
that being said there are lots of
programs that are common to both for us
and what we are doing at alderman and we
are working on having bridges and yeah
federal functions that right now all the
communication arrays we have further
Agata closed source and run the process
of open sourcing them so key messaging
is going to be open source and it's
going to be much much easier for
everyone to just write bridges between
our robotic framework and also from
rocks yeah
the question is what do we give
developer access in term of source code
so we don't have an open hardware we
have a closer hardware
mostly for security reasons actually but
we are using Linux and we are also using
tons of open source software and
obviously we are following the GPL so we
can send user patches we have to make
here and there and lastly if for
instance when you judge the were
performed we've got an animator or
professional emitter which is doing
animation how's about all the time
and is doing that in a creative common
license so you can just grab its
animation and use them for free in your
code so it's still a balance between
what we want to open what is part of our
probability intellectual property what
is required to stay closed for security
reasons and what we want to open so that
people can reuse them so yeah ok
okay so the cost for the robot when you
our company is between twelve and
fifteen thousand dollars but we've got a
special discount for developers and as
the price goes down between three and
four thousand dollars and the only thing
we ask in return is that we write two
application for the robot in two yells
and because we really want to get in
touch with people who have a vision of
what it means to have a robot exist in
the home and have ideas and want to
explore so that's how it works yep
in the process
oh yeah there are two cameras in the
front so right the Mo's they cannot be
used at the same time because you've got
two camera into the front to see what's
in front of the robot another one here
so that you can see what it's very sweet
but we've got with web bundles of head
when you got stereo vision but the
direction we're explaining to is to use
directly 3d sensors because it's getting
cheaper and cheaper of thanks to things
like the Kinect or other products of
this sort and we actually have
developers who are just plugging a
connect directly into the head of the
robot and started doing that
I did but it was first doing that and
yet right now we are thinking about for
the next version of the robot having a
3d support and then it directly
so it's the kind of roadmap for for new
robots coming out you have a plan like
one year we don't have any we're going
to until next year and people are
waiting for five years and it does not
it has an a but for the moment we are
always working on the new version
there's no surprise about it each time
you release the software there is a new
sutra we're starting to work on and it's
the same for the robot what we'd like to
do is to go public
really to be a consumer within the two
years to come so there should be another
version of this product to be honest
that will go to the market it's not
robust enough at the moment and we still
believe that it can be enhanced enough
before reaching a consumer but this is
our timeline at the moment that I mean I
would like to stick to I cannot really
commit
my name is in two years we'll be really
deceived because we will feel like I
lied to you but today it's not okay and
we're an independent company at the
moment so we are really playing our life
with that so going to the consumer
market for us is the question of
changing the size of the company you
know were a small start-up with a
prototyping robot there were lots of
problems with the robot they were not
always working this is something that
people from research labs and so on can
cope with because they are used to this
kind of stuff if we go to the consumer
market and one out of five robot is dead
on arrival this is just not possible so
we are working really hard on that I
judge the company a year and a half ago
we were less than 200 we are now 400 as
you can as we were saying so yeah we are
trying to reach the critical size so
that we can go to the consumer market so
that's really a good time to join the to
join the robotic revolution because it
will be very short time from now maybe
five years but it will be a short time
and you can see that there are lots and
lots of devices at the moment that our
robotic device
people are trying this market trying to
see how people react to this but it's
true that it's the next revolution yep
somehow that brings up the point in my
mind already financed now and then you
consider crowdfunding so we've got
various investors and I'm not sure we've
considered funding at one point and they
try to be honest it's not maybe yeah we
talked about it - I don't exactly though
I know how to spend a lot of his time
trying to get money to have to pay for
all of this all the research we are
doing or the new products to develop and
so on but grant funding I don't know if
we've ever been thinking about it maybe
we can suggest him I really think you
should suggest that if they don't I
don't know what it's like in Europe but
here's all the rage and it seems to be
very successful for wildly crazy things
this is far from the craziest thing that
anyone
I think you would do really well if you
explore trying to go this way of
crowdfunding you have just just to help
our forever my money should take you to
find that very valuable yep yep I'm not
sure if this unit so what you saw in
cell Carla for just a very crude version
of that so just a 3d model your serve a
full fledged simulator which is made by
another company called C diabetics which
is called wabbits but actually when you
are writing your code you are against
nokey api and you are just calling
remote services so it doesn't really
matter which language you are using
so web it's a support for Java already
and no key I started to have really good
Java support starting in the next
version of software so it's going to
work pretty well and the other question
was can you have a simulator where
Watson robot I'm not sure yeah in fact
you can drive the community website and
if you create an account you'll be able
to download the software without being
able to see the result so yes you can do
that I don't know if it's one month
trial or three month but at least or
four weeks you can try to have fun with
it and maybe then just contact some of
our developers we have a community of
the root password one right so maybe
there might be something interesting to
do for example to work on your own with
our tools and maybe meet someone who
owns a robot just to test it in real
life
we have lots of users group that are
taking place mostly in Europe at the
moment but the meeting we have tonight
is to try to do the same in the in the
u.s. we have more than 80 developers in
the u.s. or maybe they could gather
regularly and welcome people wooden on
the robot but who are trusting and not
trying the software no more questions
