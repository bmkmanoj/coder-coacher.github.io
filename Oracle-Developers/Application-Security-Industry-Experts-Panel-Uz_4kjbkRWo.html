listening into this as a recording later
if you're expecting the slides to turn
you're going to be waiting a long time
because this is a panel and we have just
this one slide so I hope you enjoy
watching this one slide while you listen
listen to the panel I'm Donald Smith I'm
in the Java SE product management group
I work with with Milton here
I was graciously asked and I'm proud to
moderate the panel here today there's a
few things about panels when I moderate
them I have a few rules number one is no
long intros because usually you waste 20
minutes listening to the panelists
introduce yourself and we're going to
get right to the good stuff and then the
second rule is the eyes all start
agreeing with everything else everybody
else says I'm going to start shaking
chairs or something so let's try to make
it a little bit controversial and fun
without I don't agree with that
philosophy yeah all right so here's
here's the drill you each get five words
to introduce yourself
starting with you Milton five words
there's three hello testing I don't
think I'm on line you're on okay five
words java.security P security PM Oracle
Oracle good all right Michael I hope you
do better than Nathan did Michael coats
Mozilla OS Board longtime security guy
that was like eight Jim convert to
base64 open quote hi my name is Jim
Monaco I'm one of the OS board members
work for white hat security ed of a
secure coding instructor end quote
and basic support conversion I was
sequel injection attack that's awesome
all right right it's gonna be one of
those panels is it alright Frank hey hey
guys Frank Kim sands Institute and my
favorite fruit is watermelon all right
so we're off to a good start as you can
tell we're gonna be very serious because
this is a very serious topic all right
so let's launch off with a good one bug
bounties good bad why should we be doing
them or why shouldn't we be doing them
Michael you yes they are wonderful
Mozilla started it in 2004 with Firefox
and there's not enough good things I
could say about bug bounties now if you
jump in and do a bug bounty without
doing the pre-work without having your
program mature enough you're gonna be in
for some pain but the value of a bug
bounty program is incredible and I
mentioned this on Tuesday so we pay
$3,000 for a critical issue in Firefox
or a website and someone asked well how
do you get the budget for that and so I
ask you when you think about a bug bunny
program if you had a critical issue
right now that you had to scramble on
and rally your team to do a dev fix in
engineering QA testing roll it out press
would that cost you more than $3,000 it
probably cost you a heck of a lot more
so just to keep it short I wanna see if
anyone disagrees bug bounty programs are
really fantastic good way to bring in
community good way to mature your
security lifecycle the security program
so bug bounty programs are a tool and I
think in most situations it's a good
tool but you can't apply a bug bounty
program my opinion to every situation
there are some applications like
administration of a credit card
repository for a large bank I think it
provides at in a bug bounty way in fact
I'm gonna set it up where one access
control violation and I lock that user
out I'm going to have such rigorous
obscurity in addition to security where
the and an intrusion detection the
tiniest misuse of that app and I locked
that user out maybe in a relatively
permanent way those unique situations I
would never a bug bounty but look
Microsoft just jumped in the game
cheapest bastards in the industry and
they're they're offering 150,000 for a
Windows 8 0 days so I mostly agree with
Michael in most situations a bug bounty
is a is a great way to engage the
community
it's a great goal for dollar approach
but I wouldn't use that tool in every
situation just most situations I will
say the situations when you're not using
it they're still attacking you there's
not telling you well they're situations
like a credit card project and a credit
card repository where it's authenticated
use of that service only protected by by
internet isolation which isn't perfect
but it's there where I will get attacked
but unless you're an authenticated user
and it's a well built system no attack
it's gonna really cause harm unless it's
authenticated so in that case I could
really limit any prodding into the
application and it just doesn't make
sense to bug mounting it but I agree
with you you're you're gonna be you're
gonna be an attack whether you like it
or not but again I would only apply a
bug bounties to most situations not all
well bug bounty programs are great
there's so many companies offering them
now doing it but the company is
obviously doing it are the vendors
leading web companies and so on what
would it ever take for an enterprise to
offer a bug bounty program how would
they get get that going so there's
several new companies there's there's a
handful that are actually offering bug
money programs for companies because of
that same issue yes
bug crowd Cenac there's a couple others
but yeah they're doing that exact same
thing because some companies want to do
it but they're not sure what are they
getting into you know what does this
mean how do I manage this resource the
last thing you want to do is launch a
bug bounty program do it wrong and anger
the security community because now they
know your issues and they're mad and we
know how that goes so I think that's one
way to get involved there's been a few
different talks of I've done some on how
to launch about bounty program it's
definitely something you want to think
about the steps learn from people's past
mistakes to do it right what Frank I
think was saying is what if you're an
enterprise and you have tons of intranet
web applications that drive your
business how do you bug down you that
you give everyone VPN access to your
internal network oh I'm saying it
applies I'm like Michael you're mostly
right you're almost oh how do I say
you're you're almost completely ready
just a little a little bit you're wrong
okay I think we've hit this one good
question from the audience
yes so the question was for an
enterprise you could have an internal
bug burning primitively
and you can incentivize the different
ways I mean cash for internals a little
weird but you can incentivize it with
other things I think it's good we do
that in our company we it within my
within my own employer we have an
internal bug bounty program you can't do
this during your normal work day during
your normal work responsibilities but if
you want to like be that the
infrastructure on your free time will
drop like 500 bucks Pavone we're
actually very good about that and so it
we went we actually when we first turned
this on and we're like guys don't do
this during the day guys and gals don't
do this during the day when you're doing
a normal work and then 6 o'clock rolls
around I look in the back Research
Center at least for the first few weeks
the whole team stayed after work and
they all made good extra bucks on the
side doing you know assurance work for
us we got a lot of assurance at low cost
our employees got a couple grand checks
for doing some extracurricular work that
idea of an internal bug bounty program
when you have the right expertise is a
wonderful thing I think one of the
things that Michael said yesterday kind
of stuck with me too about processes and
the fact that when they turned it up
people just started attacking everything
not even the things that they were
supposed to be attacking so probably
having those rules down is you know it's
good yeah the rules you have to have
then you have to be ready for everyone
to ignore them and that's that's the
reality of what you do because you like
alright we're just gonna do it on this
one site and then they just attack
everything so you have to really be
ready for this all right I'm gonna
invoke the 7 minute rule no more that's
seven minutes on any one topic so we'll
switch gears a little bit and actually a
question for Frank can you maybe give
some guidance on how people should go
about setting up an application security
program so I assume we have a roomful of
application developers here if they
don't have a security program what would
you recommend they do how do you start
that well besides hiring you and paying
you lots of consultants off ball okay
you came up with these questions to use
ridiculous here let me let me end us the
audience though you guys are all
developers right how many of you guys
quick show of hands have a secured
application security program in your
environment whether that's part of the
development team or part of the overall
enterprise security program Frank your
sexism disappoints me guys women
and men oh thank you thank you - so
there's about 70 people here in 35 raise
our hand really was that about half 50%
yeah
oh okay what is an application security
program now you guys know it takes a lot
of work to build an app and put it out
to production right there's all your
typical phases of the SDLC requirements
design development and testing and so on
you do all of this stuff the application
security program is essentially
recognizing the fact that not only do
you have to do a lot of work to build
the app well if you want to secure it
correctly you have to do a lot of work
during those phases of the development
process so it's taking a step back
looking at the whole development process
and saying well where can I inject the
appropriate levels of security in
development in requirements in design
and in production as you're rolling this
thing out so if you have no security
program if you're at a company that has
no security whatsoever I don't recommend
doing this but a lot of people will
start a lot management will start and
say you know hire some third-party
company like McDonald was saying and hit
say come in here and hack our
applications because well you should
know that they're already insecure if
you haven't been focusing on security
but they'll come in and use that as kind
of a little stick to say well look how
insecure our applications are and use
that as the first nugget to say well we
need to focus more on this thing but in
my opinion just as we invest a lot in
all of the faces of the sdlc there's a
lot that we can do in terms of coding
code review secure coding practices and
so on to bake the security into the to
the process itself so setting up a
knapsack program kind of like Michael
was saying in terms of a bug bounty
program any time especially at a large
company if you've got a larger program
process that you have to set up you got
to make sure you got the right staff the
right resources the right people
allocated to it so I would say the
number one thing to focus on is is
getting the right getting the right
folks looking at the problem and focused
on the problem I'm gonna add to that
give some thought if you're starting
this off if it's gonna be a grassroots
effort you know you're a developer you
have some other developers you like guys
let's let's try and make a secure coding
guidelines do some security code review
as we move on think about if it's going
to be grassroots like that or if you're
going to try and stand up a program and
if you're trying to stand up a program
the first thing that comes to mind is
are you gonna try and force that in
there and tell people hey stop working
on that feature you need to do security
which is a tough tough sell
are you gonna try and get management
support because it's a lot harder
without management support when you say
hey that feature can't ship because I
think security is important and that
discussion is a different discussion
it's about risk it's about why do we
really care how does this really matter
compliance on its so so so pretend
you're a developer and Milton is the
manager you're making the case for go
sure why do I want to do this Michael
sure yeah how is what's the ROI here
sure so our product handles users
banking information and it does lots of
great things that gives them awesome
graphs I love it but imagine what's
gonna happen if it's on the New York
Times because data leaked and it's
insecure how many people are gonna be
looking at our graphs now when they've
pulled all the information out so let's
spend 10% of our time now to make sure
that never happens and then the rest of
90% we can make all those awesome graphs
you want I see but I think you know the
one thing that I'm thinking of as the
manager is that if I invest in
insecurity 10% of that time that's you
know that's money that's gone but if I
if I roll the dice you know what I could
actually get 10% benefit right sure
you can roll the dice but the the impact
when the dice fall poorly is a magnitude
many magnitudes bigger and you can just
look at any of the headlines we can go
through it's a nice thing to have all
the headlines of people have been
compromised
the fines they face the impacts the
users that have gone away FTC coming in
and saying you can no longer say your
secure company that actually happened a
company can no longer use the word
secure in their product which was a
security product from the FTC perhaps
some of you have had this conversation
before
excellent cool so I'm just gonna quickly
summarize comments from the audience for
the recording side of this but basically
the comment was is that a an enterprise
company screwed up something they didn't
have the right program in place and the
FDIC came in and and they themselves
emailed their customers and that is
pretty good motivation for a manager
sorry
paper letters so I think the lesson
learned here is that companies
understand compliance but security is a
little tougher sell it won't pick note
here when I approach a company and we
talk about software security and
building process into an organization
the worst thing you can do is show up
and expound what to do the first thing
you should do is learn what a company is
doing so my goal in SDLC improvement is
never to add a lot of new things but to
see what they're currently doing and add
security activities to current processes
it tends to be less invasive to the
company and people take it seriously so
here's an example when I approach a
company that usually has a level zero
maturity at software security they're
new at it they have some expertise but
there's there's no program and there's a
lot of insecurity of their software I
like to you know with the custom after
talking to customer about what their
risks are if they're using a database I
like to approach sequel injection first
this is something where all data can be
stolen easily attackers have kits to to
attack this relatively easy and it's
relatively easy to fixing code if their
decision is to fix it in code if it's
that kind of software shop I'll very
often recommend the company just do a
sweep of all applications and just fixed
sequel injection and get that push live
it does a few things it it first of all
it educates the company about
application security risk that's
relatively easy to talk about number two
it tests the organization's ability to
actually do remediation in code and see
their ability to put
that life and it also eliminates what I
think of as the biggest risk in a piece
of web software so going through an
exercise like that you it tests the
organization's ability to do software
security because you can dump all of
these complex processes on the company
and more times than not they just skip
it a lot of people say there are agile
they're not doing agile they say they're
doing DevOps they're not doing DevOps
it's usually some perversion of these
engineering theories so I want to get to
practical as soon as possible when
approaching STLCC are secure software
development ok I'm going to evoke the
seven-minute rule on this topic I have a
I have a good question for the next
topic but does anybody from the audience
have a good question does anybody from
the audience have a topic they want
covered yes yes it's always complete sir
Jim let me just really please know after
the recording if the question was is SSL
sufficient for securing data let's say
something really brief of it and let
Michael and Franken and good friend
Milton jump in SSL is completely broken
the CA system they're a bunch of
complete idiots who don't really care
about security and the all of SSL is
largely broken and you want to implement
something you want to implement
certificate pinning to detect when a CA
is doing fraudulent things I think your
micro and that's ok I think SSL is a
complete joke ok so go Michael what you
really think
SSL has its challenges there's plenty
not doing us a Cell I think is worse so
yes put your whole site under SSL for
sure we actually made a cheat sheet
guide at OU ASEAN the number of ways
people mess up SSL and there's a ton
people will put login forms on each GP
that post SSL yeah the credentials are
in the clear but they're encrypted but
that doesn't understand the threat model
the attacker just replaces the whole
page so yes whole site under SSL
use HSTs which is going to force
browsers to only connect over ssl that's
a new feature the CA system has some
challenges you should do sir penny and
yes I think there's if you if you're
following the issue there's a lot of
people talking about you know how do we
fix the CI system and there is not an
easy answer we would have done it went
to Firefox will give a certificate pity
no seriously I don't know at the time I
head but it's under it's on it's being
worked on yes so yes to answer your
question definitely do it just
understand what it's giving you it helps
encrypt the channel between the user and
your site once you get the data you're
gonna have SSL termination on your your
load balancer so internal communication
it could be vulnerable wherever you're
storing it could be vulnerable just
really understand what it gives you I
think a lot of people say hey it's HTTPS
all is good which is definitely not true
yeah I think Michael makes a good point
is that you really need to think of
security from a systemic perspective so
you've got Transport and SSL helps with
that but then you've got to think of
where it's the data at rest and what are
you doing with it there and you know
when it is in transport are you just
going with the default cipher suites or
you you know crafting it too you know so
there's hardening of systems there's a
whole you know scope of things that you
really should look at well said yeah the
cypress we think is a really good point
if that doesn't ring lots of bells it's
something to look into for sure there
are a lot of problems in even TLS 1.0
that were reported last year and so a
big recommendation was well let's move
to our c4 as one of our ciphers so about
half of the internet started switching
to our c4 which was one of the stronger
ciphers and is usually agreed upon in
negotiation when SSL handshakes being
set up and then oops
there is a huge vulnerability discovered
in our c4 not too long ago so we got to
move away from our c4 now so this is a
especially in the last two or three
years getting your SSL configuration
right has been a brutal excuse me has
been a brutally difficult moving target
to get right one of the two of the tools
I use to check my server to see how good
is configured Michael authored or was
one of the lead authors of the Olaf's
TLS cheat sheet that tells
administrators how to build it correctly
this
is more than a cheat sheet ISM it's more
of a guide for configuration folks
really well done by Michael by Ivan
ristic and a few other really
heavyweights in SSL configuration and
again this is not a this is not a
non-profit as I can mention other
commercial entities one of my
competitors has a it has a site called
SSL labs comm this is written by an Ivan
ristic and this is just such a brilliant
free tool to check how good your SSL
configuration is set up things little
check for a few renegotiations turned on
are using the right versions of SSL and
TLS how strong is your cipher suite and
a lot of other little knits and the
offices of free service I highly
recommend you do it and again a
certificate pinning happens if I was a
my own CA and I had a low enough
integrity where I would sell my private
search to a private company that private
company could put that cert in a proxy
server and as you make connections to
outbound the proxy server will just make
a cert on the fly for that bank and
because that cert or that website and
because that cert has been signed by a
legal CAS private certificate your
browser doesn't complain so certificate
pinning is when you take the real public
cert of the website in question and
hard-coded in the browser hard-coded in
a mobile app hard-coded in your thick
client so if the CA gives you a
fraudulent but signed certificate you
can detect this because look across the
world today when when you're able to man
the middle certain people around the
world with certain services in certain
countries people die and now I'm not
this is not an exaggeration so
certificate pinning helps get around the
the world we live in where we see a lot
of less than less than high integrity
things happening around the CA system so
the question was about government
they're here for us so that this is a
really interesting question with the
government I mean if
the only thing that I have assigned this
is if you're a company that operates in
the u.s. think very carefully about what
kind of threat model you want to have if
you don't want to trust the government
what does that do aside from the
technical issue sure maybe they can
technically do things that you don't
want them to do even if they couldn't if
they walked in the door with the good
the right legal documents as a us-based
company what are you gonna say and as
though just think of the whole picture
yeah not just as a company but as a
consumer think about what service is
online that you're using and where those
companies are based if you're using
Gmail right there that's that's that's
potentially an issue if you're using
other online services but from a
development perspective I mean these
guys mentioned certificate pinning
Michael mentioned HTTP strict Transport
Security that's really important if you
guys want to we're mentioning some of
the defense side stuff but if you look
at on the on the how do you exploit some
of these things there's a tool written
by Moxie Marlinspike you guys heard of
SSL strip strip right which is exactly
is basically downgrades
HTTP connections to http he's on the
watchlist by the way of course right so
definitely check that out and that's
that's just a I mentioned that not to go
out and hack a bunch of sites but so
that you can see why some of these
defenses that we're mentioning why these
secure configurations are so important
right and folks other other threat
agents other nation-states other
attackers right are using these type of
things and many others to get access to
some of the some things that we don't
expect them to and look even NIST
recently went out and said yeah we no
longer recommend you use any NSA back
standard so even like the US government
standard organization is striking back
against some of the less than high
integrity things that we think the NSA
that we con jecht that the NSA has done
so there are things you can do to
strengthen your system it's not even
about trying to keep the NSA up eh it's
just trying to build a good secure
system for your users so I will avoid
certain standards that that has come out
at the NSA has influenced in some way I
will do certificate pinning so I can
detect when if someone has a has a
private certificate they're using
fraudulently and I will use a very
strong cipher suite when I can I'll use
AES a glossy encounter mode is my main
cipher and these are all like
there you can do really good crypto you
have to be in the know to pull it off
you have to wait until different browser
and servers support it and doing all
these things really does to some degree
keep the NSA at bay but that's not why
I'm doing it I'm doing it not because
I'm trying to you know counter the
Snowden thing I'm just I'm doing it
because I want good crypto in my
software okay gonna invoke the seven
minute rule on that topic that was a
great topic thank you
does anybody have any other topics
before yeah okay okay yeah let me just
summarize for the home audience so the
question the question was so we've been
focusing on the network layer and and
you know that kind of security
can we talk more generally about
security like social social engineering
and and other other types of attacks the
the data point I put out there and I I
wish I knew it exactly but the last
Verizon data breach report had the
overwhelming majority of attacks come
from outsiders now I don't say that
means you should disregard insiders I
think you need to look at two things one
from the from the perspective of what
the outside attackers aren't I've used
this analogy I used it on Tuesday
so I'll use it again you know when
you're on the internet you're on the
you're in the worst neighborhood in your
city because everyone's is next door
basically so you know anyone can attack
you for external but the other the other
side that I'm on the inside these people
most companies struggle to do security
well period and then when you're on the
inside they're like wow it's an internal
system we don't really care and I think
you get into problems where you can have
cascading failures of oh it's just a
cafeteria but bam it's on the same thing
with all this database with all these
users so you can't discount internal
attackers again he gets any or just your
robust security program social
engineering highly effective I did it
for a few years about ten years ago and
about half the time I'd be standing in
the vault calling my contacts and yep
I'm in the vault I'm in your server room
you didn't do too well and it's amazing
how friendly people are if you either
your phone on your hear down your ear
people don't to interrupt you and you're
walking past them in the restricted zone
if you're smoking a cigarette out back
with them they're happy to let you in
and how half the time I tell them on the
phone like I'm doing a security audit so
we're secure don't tell me your password
please enter into this website they
happily do it's my website not theirs
then so social engineering is a real
problem regarding the smoke cigarettes
and like to break it so but so how do we
defend against that or can you well well
religiously that I mean I think a key
thing to think about is you were saying
well what are the threats what about
social engineering is I think the
important thing to focus on is what what
industry are you in and what are the
threats what are the threat actors that
are potentially trying to target you the
Verizon data breach report is kind of
one of the biggest reports in the
security industry but if you look at the
sources of that data it may be more
heavily weighted towards an area that
your company is not in right so if you
look at your organization maybe you know
maybe you're not in financial services
which is getting a lot of the press
maybe you're in health care maybe you're
in pharmaceuticals maybe you got some
other specific intellectual property
that you need to protect and how are
those attackers going to try to target
the things that are most important to
you in some cases it might be social
engineering in other cases it might be
insiders because of other compliance
regulations it might be you need to
protect the the data that you're
collecting from your customers more than
some of these other threats and that
just may be where the level of maturity
is for your specific industry so really
focus on what what threats you think are
targeting you what one of the main one
of the main software security controls
that we'll get around abusive use of
accounts as behavioral analysis for
example when your browser is Trojan
dwith is with the Zeus malware they're
gonna wait for you to login to the bank
and then ride that session that's almost
impossible to stop from a web defense
point of view and it's pretty easy to
get malware through antivirus and
anti-malware software so when you're
when you're affected with malware all
controls go away they just wait for you
to login
game over so what you can do server-side
is a is a field of secure software
security called behavioral analysis you
log into a system ICU
and every Friday you transfer money
every Friday evening to your grandmother
you check your balance Monday through
Friday once or twice and I and then over
time I get a really good statistical
model in terms of how you use that
system and when I see abnormal behavior
I may take actions like lock the account
or force you to log in or a variety of
different controls this is one of the
only software controls that gets around
abusive use of insider type of accounts
it assumes the accounts going to get
compromised and looks with it's a
statistical anomaly when that happens
and this is I'm a big fan of that
control it's rarely used and so is there
any information available maybe I'll ask
about that hint and oh there's a
behavioral analysis is a special branch
of Statistics to detect anomalous
behavior of a good user there's another
project that's similar there but really
a big fan of called app sensor this is
the wasp app sensor project it's an
intrusion detection library it's not
like an IDs you put on the network those
have limited use its intrusion detection
that you build into your java app it was
it's a brilliant piece of code even
though the guy who wrote it is a
freaking idiot but the actual project it
does have a behavioral element in the
documentation they talk about and and I
I trash OS projects that aren't of high
quality absurd sensors were the ones
that is a very high quality that
addresses the insider threat behavioral
anomaly embedded intrusion detection
that's my answer and early this this to
me ties back to the comment earlier the
discussion earlier about how do you get
money how do you go to the management
and say well fund this from a security
perspective if you can tie some of this
analysis directly to what the business
is trying to achieve right what does the
business want to do they want to sell
something they want to protect some data
they want to process some data if you
can tie it explicitly to that you go
back to management and say hey we need
to fund this because this analysis is
securing exactly enabling what the
business needs to do cool did you have a
question or comment
okay Oracle has products in the space
okay do you work for Oracle by choice
you do not work for work okay I do so
thank you for plug okay it's cool so
just as a consumer I had an experience
with the behavior analysis of a credit
card company i gassed my car up in
Toronto rental car dropped it off at the
airport got on the plane got to Ottawa
got off the plane picked up my car from
the parking lot went to the gas station
and it was less than an hour between
these two things for what is normally a
one-hour flight right it was just
miracle of miracles everything just
aligned got on the earlier flight or
whatever and when I stuck that credit
card into the into the machine in Ottawa
it was did that make it when it was
denied were you happy it was denied my
credit card get tonight I'm like so
they're looking out for me I live I get
happy actually yeah you know what
actually I was happy but the guys
running on the gas station were upset
because I was holding my cell phone
while I was trying to fill gas which is
a no net that's an interesting risk
apparently but yeah anyway so yeah so
behavior analysis sounds like promising
this is true there they are saving
themselves money but it give it's an
interesting user experience or the user
feels like they're being protected even
if they don't understand in the end it's
not their risk it's kind of the same
thing when a website says hey you're
logging in from a different continent
let's double check this is really you I
think users actually feel like oh that's
cool they're there security is a scary
thing I don't get any of it they're
doing something that makes sense
but you're right cuz the actual risk
model like I don't please don't cut
steal my credit card but I don't
actually care that much when my credit
card gets stolen cuz there is no risk to
me when it would my credit card when
they locked my account
like it because they saved me time if
fraudulent charges appeared on my credit
card and my wife caught it and she'd
make phone calls so number one they're
saving me time but the when fraud
happens the company takes the hit and
when the bank takes the hit of a lot of
credit card fraud what do they do they
pass it back down to consumers with fees
and extra BS so to sum its admit it's
tangential but it still protects myself
it's not just ignorance there is some
benefit too when they lock fraudulent
transactions all right a good topic so
I'm going to book the seven minute rule
I have never had to invoke the 7 minute
rule this many times an especially
that's a good job okay so so next
question actually this is for you Jim
again so we all know about sequel
injection I hope everybody in this room
knows what it is and how to defend
against it as application developers or
at least know that they should or at
least know that they should have
somebody so give us one two or three
things that we probably aren't looking
for that we really should be I'll go
password storage cross-site scripting
and good access control design I think
most frameworks out there are role based
access control which is an anti-pattern
is this bad bad can you give us just a
little paragraph on each of those
okay so first one I mentioned was press
restore and password storage and I'm
recommending to use be crypt
s crypt pbkdf2 with a strong work factor
those are non keyed slow ways to do
password storage with less scalability
needs but if you need to scale a handle
millions of concurrent users all that
breaks down so I recommend like an H Mac
if you have a good key storage system
for a private key this is why I
recommend today for password storage I
think most of the advice around using
hashes and salting and loops of hashes
this is all bad advice attackers have
GPU performance computing so
recommendation number one get password
storage right well Jim you just said
that it's bad advice but isn't the key
not specifically what algorithm but the
fact that you do use a good algorithm
make it slow and use a salt no that's
not true why not if because if you're a
bank because of the mint service you're
handling two million concurrent logins
at any one point in time and if you're
using a slow algorithm like bcrypt with
the work factor that makes it slow
enough to be useful
and preventing hacking then you're gonna
need like hundreds of thousands of
servers just to handle login and that
makes no sense so so you're saying it's
for admin like I admin that a system
administrator don't need scalability if
you don't have a lot of concurrent users
then a slow algorithm like pbkdf2 a
script or bcrypt are good but if you
have high number of concurrent logins if
you're a Google if you're a top to your
bank that advice breaks down because
it's too you need too much hardware to
handle all of those slow purposely slow
algorithms that log in time so for those
situations I recommended H Mac and H Mac
is an authenticated hashing algorithm it
takes your string salt plus password and
it takes a private key and returns a
hash value the benefit of an and this H
Mac is nothing fancy it's a crypto
primitive the benefit of using an H Mac
for password storages it's as fast as a
hash it's just two loops of a hash so
it's super fast 100 milliseconds it
scales for millions of users and as long
as you can store that private key and
isolate the H makng process to a
separate service it's not going to be
cracked before the Sun stops working if
your private key is long enough so I
want those that's my specific advice I
advise nothing else every other piece of
advice is crackable or has a weak
implementation so that's the specific
advice I give depending on if you have a
need for scalability or not or if you
have the ability to store private key or
not this is all relatively new
information from John Stephen at sigil
he wrote he wrote the password storage
cheat sheet I edit it and make sure I
understand it before I pushed it live
this is about four or five months old
information that's pretty contextual to
today's real password storage yeah we
use this seven azolla we put bcrypt with
a system salt in two years ago I think
system I'm sorry by say system saw they
mean a stay salt for bcrypt that we
store on the file system awesome the
thinking behind this and it doesn't
change your crypto but the attack model
is more than likely a sequel injection
is going to strip you know pull
everything from your database so if
you're if you're solved from the
database it didn't really do much good
but if it's on the file system you have
to do a file system call so what that
means is the attacker has to find a
sequel injection vulnerability
and a level vulnerability to do to get
both pieces of information so it changes
the likelihood they're gonna get all
that data do you know what kind of what
makes a beat crypt good for password
storage is the work factor you give it
that will force bcrypt to take longer to
compute so now I have a GPU cracking rig
that can only do like 50 billion hashes
per second try to crack your password
storage mechanism not remotely I steal
your database and now I have a
high-speed video game rig and I'm trying
50 to 100 billion hashes per second when
you use a slow algorithm like beat crypt
what used to take me 50 billion per
second now takes 2 per second but you
should take me a few hours to crack now
takes me months or years to crack what
work factor do you guys use for bikram
this is a problem I have a lot of people
use bcrypt but then they'll take the
work factor and tweak it so it's really
fast out yeah
which defeats the purpose of using it I
see a question there I think we're at
the default we haven't changed it and
the nice thing about bcrypt is you can
increase the work factor as technology
issues come about ok so what was the
second was the second one so with what
I've never heard of that term before
what is back off timing
yeah your time so it does a response to
life or the user
that's a timing attack basically no he's
talking about a defense using so yeah
using slowing down the ability for a
user to add more to attempt another
password guess I have never used it
I think implementation may be tricky I
mean if you try and track the user with
a cookie they'll just clear the cookie
you can try and track them with an IP
address but then you hit a whole
University and once you do a P address
tracking then people will skip it with
tor and distribute the attack I think
it's I think it's tricky you could do it
server-side based on a target so
everyone trying to log in as Joe that
could increase that might work but then
you have the distributed attack with its
hit every user once and then every user
again the next okay I think it's tricky
yeah you get to not have service your
whole system and I do have everything
else done right with password storage if
not I tend to not bother with that
control because it does more harm than
good
that's my conjecture all right Jim what
was the second thing you listed
cross-site scripting cross-site
scripting all right yep can you do so
cross-site scripting is when the
attacker can inject evil third party
JavaScript into your website and then
once I can once I inject JavaScript into
your website when one of your users
looks at your website and sees that evil
JavaScript we can do things like steal
the session cookie and exfiltrate it to
face any part of the site keystroke
loggers the mouse up and mouse down
events load scripts from third parties
it's complete ownership of the browser
and what was the third all right before
you go to the third one I'm curious has
anyone heard of content security policy
Rick show of hands content security
policy that's good that's a handful 10%
so content security policy yes it takes
a little bit of work to get this into
your site but the major browsers support
at least Firefox and Chrome do and what
it will do is it will let you take your
JavaScript and put it into your
externalize your JavaScript and then
even if you had a cross-site scripting
vulnerability in your page it wouldn't
execute the victim wouldn't be
victimized because the browser knows per
the CSP policy do not execute inline
JavaScript only execute it from this
trusted third-party location where they
put it you have to do some work to make
it happen
once you do you are in a really good
place for cross-site scripting which is
just terrorizing everybody a show of
hands who here embeds javascript in
their HTML it's okay to admit it here
Beavis demure strictly puts their
JavaScript in a separate J's file but
about half and half that's the button
CSP is I'm really that's awesome that
it's half and half this half the room
could just go do this and say what is it
you you want it to be in a separate file
me if therefore content security policy
to be effective externally to have all
your JavaScript and external files
there's a couple use cases where you
really need to not do that they're
esoteric rarely do we run up into that
into those but overall if you're
externalizing your JavaScript you can
just flip on content security policy and
stop a whole class of stored and
reflective XSS you don't stop down XSS
but you do stores you do stop the stored
and you do stop the reflective and what
was the third third thing there's a
third thing is a access control design
most frameworks that we use today are
role-based we'll say things like if the
user is a manager or if the user is
administrator or if the user is an
editor give them access this is only
vertical access control defense it's a
weak pattern for access control
so I recommend capabilities access
control which is saying not if the user
is a manager but if the user is allowed
to view report 37 we're asking about the
capability the action not the role and
so Apache Shero is an Apache Java
project that is built capabilities from
the ground up role based access control
is so limiting you have to hard code it
per page it's vertical only it requires
if you forget to add the check very
often they they're granted full access
by default so I think role based access
control is dead there's no need to ever
use it and we should be shifting to a
capability space world so sorry sorry
just if I can just you said Apache Shiro
how do you spell that it is sh iro those
open source Apache security library
specifically for authentication and
access components sorry for interrupting
I I hear you it's it's hard coding
policy and hard coding checks that are
about to user so anncr back is a little
bit different yes
so you think ansi standard are back is
acceptable or its capabilities based but
this is the way most every free matter
that would be my failing to size this is
what most developers are confronted with
in strength spring security instruct
security and from the on rails and core
java ee in and django and every major
framework out there there were hard
coding roles into code i'm with you two
percent so an see the ansi standard on
our back is basically capability space
access control as as i know it as a
developer verse I'm with you 100% you
have a quick comment
yet Yakima has us all built in Yakima
was it's a really well does it scomp
lexo it's a very well designed standard
you have to rewrite your whole system
you have to gut the most inner deepest
workings of your whole system alright
alright yeah most of us has Deb's we
think of our back is that that's what's
stuck in our brain but all right so yeah
so you read standards you're a pedantic
standards reader and you're hundred
percent right so just to summarize for
those who may not have heard it
basically the comment is we have a lot
of entrenched technology here and to
change that pattern it's not trivial but
it's something we should be striving for
oh yeah give me high five high five and
attribute access control yeah baby
okay so so next topic this one is we'll
start with Michael cuz cuz I think
you'll probably have a lot to say we'll
have to cut you off but but there has
there is a very clear trend in terms of
application deployment you know so
basically we've we've kind of gone from
this plug-in model to more of an app
store model right so it's we seem to be
moving towards a space where you have a
browser and you have a blunt a whole
bunch of different plugins or you know
you're plugging stuff into your desktop
to where you're going to like the Apple
iTunes Store or the Windows Store or the
Mac store or it seems to be we operating
systems and browsers and seem to be
locking down so you're about to get your
photo taken there tonight photobombing
there we go yes so so I guess basically
to generalize the question is you know
is the concept of a plug-in browser
plug-in dead or dying
what should application developers be
doing to to
therefore sorry the paparazzi's
distracted me yes so yeah so what so
what's your general advice on that just
so we're looking for general trends in
how applications are built and deployed
especially as it relates to browsers and
operating systems and so on and what
should we be preparing for what's the
future yeah so we talked about plugins I
definitely think plugins are dead and
dying you should definitely go to the
web what does that mean the reason
plugins were created is because the
browser couldn't do what you wanted to
do and so you could put in a plug-in for
for video for audio for thick client
whatever you want
but the web has advanced browsers or
advanced in html5 is coming leaps and
bounds so if you're thinking about where
you want to go so you don't have to rip
it all out go to the web go to html5
don't use plugins from a firefox
perspective you may have seen we
recently announced we'll actually in
January we announced I announced what we
were going to do and now we're doing it
plugins will be clicked to play by
default and so what that means is when
you go to a website you're in control of
your browser just because the website
says hey I want to use this plug-in and
that plug-in and I want to make dancing
cats go over your screen you have the
ability to say no this plug-in is I will
only turn it on if I want to click to
play by default so one of the reasons
we're doing that is because vulnerable
plugins destroy people the black hole
exploit kit uses vulnerable plugins it
just does a little tiny iframe whatever
it once in the corner you can't see it
it's hidden and it exploits the user who
never uses plug in X Y Z so instead if
it's a site you want to use it will
prompt you which first of all kills most
drive-by downloads immediately because
most people won't click it unless they
see something on the screen that says oh
there's a video pain I want to a turn on
shockwave for our implementation just
cuz I'm talking about it current
versions of flash will also
automatically load the reason is just a
pragmatic point there
that's a tough beast to just turn off
flash across the web but you can enable
that if you want to yeah you do have the
option if you want to take it further
so yes if you're designing apps I'm
sorry websites don't use plugins just
don't go there it's it's a dying
approach the whole thing in app stores
the only thing I want to say on that I
think there's some interesting decisions
totally unrelated to plugins about app
stores I mean it's moving back to the
thick client model where you're
downloading your mobile phone an app
that has to run it's a weird feeling for
me the web does a lot of awesome things
that so I just said and we're
approaching it differently at Mozilla
Firefox OS we are having the apps be
actually of the web html5 JavaScript
killing this whole thick client type
idea the other thing that's a really
challenging area for people think about
is permissions and users if you prompt
somebody hey I wanna I want to come to
your website okay well can you give me
your name address the ability to access
your camera all these things just in
case I might want to use it later it's a
really weird paradigm and that's what we
have with Android apps so if you think
about an extrapolated to the web it
doesn't really make a lot of sense users
are confused like I really just want to
see the sports scores so sure we're
approaching again a little different on
Firefox OS when it comes between
security and dancing cats they're gonna
click on dancer hats true dancing cats
alright it's a good kind of paradigm
dancing cats always win so how do you
build a system and it keeps people
secure so I think the the user
experience with privacy and permissions
is a tricky one Firefox OS is going out
a different way where you only enable
the permission when you actually want to
use it like a I'm looking for a
restaurant sure you can use my GPS for
that one yeah makes perfect sense I like
that
hey I just I just killed the dragon oh
can I email your mom nope no those are
some things on plugins and app stores
but yeah stay away from plugins build it
for the web so another rule of panels is
that the person who works at the same
company as the moderator gets ignored a
lot so we've kind of been ignoring you a
little bit here Milton but so I have to
caveat what Michael says with many phone
calls that I receive on plugins
so might have to say that it's not
entirely dead
so yeah Michael just said they're dead
so what what's our strategy around
applets and what are we what are we
trying to do to
you consider you know considering we
have a twenty-year legacy of of
enterprise users here what are we doing
at Oracle yeah absolutely I think you
know I've been asked the question many
times whether you know Oracle's gonna
kill applets and things like that you
know I think from my chair which is the
security chair you know it's not my
decision to kill applets or not and you
know as long as we gots Mario Brothers
it's Dan somebody clicked on somebody
chose cats house Mario Brothers go to a
rave or something our jobs are stressful
I like little dancing cats just me so
yeah so it's not it's not up to me to
you know kill applets or say you know
what the future of applets is it's
really you know my chair to protect
applets and and so and that's exactly
what we're doing we put a lot of
investment into applets to keep them
safe and we're gonna keep doing that and
Milton I think that's the difference
between an amateur security guy and a
professional security guy if your
security guy comes up to you and says
you can't do that stop doing all that
that's usually that's not the right
answer the real security profession was
like hey you're doing something that's
completely insane let me help you manage
let me help you do that in a more risk
managed way so that's the right answer
we can have applets that are secure that
our lockdown there's work to do to get
there but it can be done yeah and I mean
I got off applets you're gonna shut off
like half of your top customers you
can't do that I mean I think that's the
thing we can't break business in the
name of security security is the very
thing that we're trying to use to
protect our business so yeah that's
that's really the challenge I like it
how most how maybe not most but a lot of
the tech media they say Java is dead
it's insecure and you shouldn't use it
and they have no idea what they're
talking about they're mixing Java
applets with Java server use with Java
on the client for mobile for Android
there's a Java means different things to
different people in different
architectures and I don't think the
media has done a good job talking about
that absolutely yeah we get that
confusion a matter of fact you know as
far as uses there's actually countries
where applets are required to do your
taxes
so the whole idea of shutting off
applets is really untenable
I like the idea though of only anab but
only enabling the JVM engine in the
browser and click to play yeah just to
be specific we're not disabling anything
we're just saying you get to turn it on
or off it's your decision it's not
automatically good and yeah I mean like
the deployment rule set that we just
implemented recently 70/40 is I think
it's a good example of how we can give
give the enterprises the tools they need
to manage whatever defense whatever
security posture they want if I
understand correctly we have seven
minutes left we have the full hour right
seven yeah yeah have some of this I can
do
oh geez we have wait a sec sorry is it
quick why not flash so the way we're
doing is current versions of flash are
not clicked to play because it's it's
just too big of a beast to tackle on
this move to turn off flash across the
web we have to balance what does this
mean for users are they just gonna say
well this is just ridiculous this is
never going to stand and totally abandon
everything sure would it be more secure
would it be more a pure approach yes
it's just not realistic
on the first pass yes only the current
version is allowed anything older than
the current version is again click to
play alright so in all browsers I
disable flash and have click to play so
if I want to go to YouTube Clint ok I
don't want to spend our last 7 minutes
talking about flash if we can quickly
yes so the question was does it remember
whether you want to prove or deny I'd
have to double-check the settings I mean
the usability of it we certainly have
consent but have a new topic yes great
question
long term who's with or you know short
medium long term who's winning good guys
are bad guys I'm very optimistic I mean
I've been here coming to Java one since
back in the day being here the last
three years and this is the first time I
was telling Milton this before the
session that any developer conference
that I know of especially one of this
size has a dedicated security track you
know Oracle Wright is investing a lot in
security I'm very optimistic about this
and now thanks to Milton so all right
thank you now this is probably a little
bit of a self-selecting audience but I
want to ask you guys how many of you
guys care about secure coding quick show
of hands all right some very
self-selecting but in my opinion right
we can't just keep on going back and
hammering down the little
vulnerabilities that come up and fixing
the code itself we need to push more and
more of these protections into the
frameworks into the libraries into the
api's into the servers small example of
this newest version of Tomcat for
example has a session fixation
protection enabled by default and so
it's those type of things where we as
the developers we can't keep on
hammering down these little issues as
they come up we need these things
built-in and other frameworks while
Jango Ruby on Rails they've got a lot of
really good protections built in and we
need to get move that forward on the
Java side as well well said I think the
bad guys are winning more these days I
don't mean to be a pessimist but the the
amount of damage done globally in cyber
security or cyber events has eclipsed
the global global illegal drug trade so
I think it's gonna get much much worse
before it gets better and it could take
like three to five years another quick
thing the security industry the security
vendor industry I've never seen an
industry that's had so much epic failure
in terms of security products and
services yet the world just keeps
pouring billions of dollars into it
that's got to change Italy an industrial
complex that's got I'm gonna say that I
think the good guys are running and the
reason I say that is as tech
she keeps advancing we keep doing more
things on the web the money money talks
and if the money wasn't on the web then
we wouldn't be using it so yes fraud
rates malicious malware all that the
rates are higher than we want we want to
drive them down but at the end of the
day we keep investing in technology I
think the bad guys you know when they do
things that it's very much in the public
eye but I think that you know the war is
there's a speaker by the name of David
Rice who kind of draws these analogies
between industrial pollution and what it
used to be versus what it is today and
how we've actually evolved in pollution
to be even green you know GE has eco
imagination programs and things like
that and how does that save us any money
but I think we've grown up a lot in
pollution and I think security will take
the same trajectory
I agree bill I think it will get better
ok so we have like time for one minute
so Michael Jim and Frank JavaOne is not
a conference you would normally attend
right I don't think you are you hear all
the time not been to Java it was a waste
it was embarrassed that I did not know
but ok so let me let me restart that
question a different way okay so as
security practitioners and experts Java
one is not a conference that usually has
a security track it has lots of security
content anyway I'm taking a whole long
time awkwardly embarrassing myself here
let me get let me get right to the
question what I want to know is in a
minute or less what did you learn this
week that you didn't know before you got
here let me kick it off real quick I'm
gonna say two things vary under a minute
number one when security guys go to
security conferences you know what that
is that's that's a mental exercise in
showing how cool you are in front of
your security peers and does absolutely
nothing to actually move the bar down
the field and software security when
you're a security guy and you come to
one of these conferences
and talk to developers about secure
coding that's how you make a difference
so the fact that more security people
don't show up to Java 1 in similar
conferences is a shame this is how we
make a difference it's what I've learned
here is how much Java developers care
about secure coding and how difficult it
is to find that knowledge in a usable
way so thank you all for being here all
right yeah I'm gonna quote you word for
word on that afterwards because I was
brilliant all right Michael Frank can
you match that brilliance how well do
you know kind of stole the the gist of
what I was kind of gonna focus on say it
again Frank's know I've been doing Java
since the beginning of my career being a
Java one back in the day many many times
and come into Java one the last few
years and about four years ago you know
I found found myself with some limited
time my daughter six years old and I had
limited time to focus on going to
different conferences to speak so I had
a choice of either going to security
conferences or developer conferences and
four years ago I made a conscious choice
to say you know what I'm not gonna go
speak at security conferences I'm gonna
go to speak at developer conferences
like Java one like DevOps devoxx like
uber conf in Colorado Java zone some of
the other ones in Europe and so on and
it's now just now is the first time that
I've seen such a large audience with so
many people dedicated security track at
JavaOne with as Jim said so many
developers that are caring and learning
more about secure coding that's why I
found you very optimistic all right
Michael you get the last word I think
this really comes back to what I talked
about on Tuesday for those that were
there like the only way to tackle
security at scale is to realize that
security professionals can't be a
chokepoint
and so I think we've grown up a lot is
in this industry we're no longer the
guys that think well we still think
we're super cool but we realized that
that's just silly you know you can't sit
in the corner and just hack everything
secure or just to know be the security
guys to say no it's it's about
understanding all the details of the
lifecycle and working through all the
parts and so the only way we have a
chance of building secure software is
all gonna amount together and so it's
really encouraging that at a developer
oriented conference where again we're
building the latest and greatest things
on the web we can step back and say hey
let's also get together and build them
securely because we know
important that is excellent all right
well thank you guys very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
