I'm here at JavaOne Brazil and I would
like to share one of my favorite moments
with Java first of all this is a very
hard question I have been working with
Java since 2001 and this give me more
than 10 years of great moments with
technology but if I need to choose one I
would say that it was the first time we
met James Gosling so we got we sent a
simple email to him saying that we would
be a Java one and we would like to do an
interview and for our surprise he just
say ok let's schedule for 1 p.m. on the
certain date and so that was really
magical to see how the doors for Java
and Java community and opportunities
were open for everybody not just for
famous or very expert people since we
were starting at that moment so that's
one of my favorite moments with Java my
favorite moment in Java is when I write
programs
I develop I develop technologies that
really creative varies from peoples and
companies
my favorite moment was when I knew Java
in 12 years ago and I went to some tech
days and I knew it was my future I just
loved it it was love it at first sight
one moment I'm not sure I can I can name
but I think I have every year I have a
favorite moment in Java and that's the
gel one celebration him for me that's
the most important event of the year and
I'm doing like more than 30 but Joe one
is easy is the highlight of the year for
me so that's my favorite moment in Java
so Java gave me a lot of good moments in
life you know from from my daughter when
she was a little kid and you would say
you know she would recognize Java symbol
when she was like 2 years old like
everyone was amazing
like oh she knows Java right like you
know she's been called the Java Bay
because of that for a long time but also
it was really really fun when we got
together everyone from the JavaScript
community and we created a new mascot
juggy that's the mascot for Java C
groups because there was like a huge
community effort to make like a new
mascot that turned out to be so fun but
also but I think that's that's for me
the most special moment really is when
Sun releases it open JDK as open-source
because that was a work that I was I was
working for several years to help
support and making half
and for me I think was like really sexy
sex like a lot of satisfaction for each
you have because it becomes so I really
think that that moment was a lot of
subsection because it was like a long
road to get Java as free software and I
think that was had such important facts
on the future of Java that I would
choose that one as my best moment oh man
my favorite part of job is do of course
you know he's my big friend the guy that
I love you know actually Duke is such a
cool guy that I hang out of him all the
time we go out to have dinner together
actually but the thing we do nicely is
we go coding together you know because
Duke is not a guy that talks too much
right I'm a guy that talks a lot but he
like codes a lot right so I think that's
very cool when did you know you have
just two guys working together all the
time all night long and you know oh man
is so cool I just started studying in a
technical school so I'm new on
programming and all that and I just love
the fact that you're just writing codes
and just seeing a lot of the language
and suddenly you just find something
great that you just build and I think
that's so magical and creative simply
amazing my favorite moment was when I
realized that Java can make
communication for things and these make
total difference when I am just not only
programming for web assistance or mobile
where I can program for a lamp for a
freezer for an integration of these
things and there's a car running Java
that's a great moment I've been a Java
developer for
so ever since I heard about Java 1 I
always dreamed about being successful
meeting these awesome people learning
some of this extra content and feeling
the atmosphere that job one can provide
so any attendee so the first time
attended Gama in San Francisco was in
2013 and for me it was a very special
moment to be there
I always will I'll never forget my first
job on my best ship pivotal moment in
Java is when I joining a user group this
is my best moment when I learned that my
project had wonderful choice award 2005
there was like getting an Oscar for me
it's the highest moment of my career and
I will never forget that moment when
that email arrived and everyone in the
office was jumping around and
celebrating that was my favorite moment
my favorite moment
about being a Java developer a when I
woke up in the morning and go to work I
don't feel like I'm working I feel like
I'm playing and have fun every day my
favorite moment is a Java developer I
think it was way back in 1995 when I
don't first downloaded the Java
development kit I think it was that name
I'm not sure I used to run in the hot
Java browser and I wrote a small program
which I was able to place in a in the in
the browser and see it via my website
and it was very interesting because in
those days there was nothing nothing
moved in the web
everything was static the site the web
pages were blank black and white you had
you could put images but they didn't
there was no such thing as I'm animated
gifts so the first thing you ever saw
moving in a web page in those days was
Java so that was very exciting for me
and I made that program and there were
very few programs like that in the web
at a time like whenever I liked a lot
was when that NASA used to map something
about the not Mars program I'm not sure
but it was very interesting so those are
the I think that was the probably that's
was the most interesting moment I can
remember of now which was 20 years ago
my favorite moment with Java when I run
my first program and it working my
favorite Java moment was when I was
writing the second version of our server
using a new Java API for networking Java
and IR and it got more than 10,000
connections simultaneously and I didn't
think it would reach a high and it did
and I was very excited about that
my
my favorite moment of the other
developer was when I
learning Java and great my first swing
up here
my favorite moment in Java was when I
discovered the community of developers
in this moment was when when I
discovered with developers can work
together to make programs and systems
my favorite moment as a developer was
presentation that I made in Java or 20
all night my presentation was about the
Java digital TV application in Brazilian
Broadcasting TVs and in that occasion I
was
searching with my friend about the
application of the api's of the
java.util TV in the box of the distal
tubules in brazilian market i think
about pheromone in java is when you
actually learn a software and the
subject says using by years or in use it
and you see the results you see like
what if you actually work
these Chingy lives it's changed people's
lives as you see sitting because it's
important for them it's important for
you and the work is darker well in my
career haven't done it like a thousand
systems well I think what's most
important is there's the national ID
system in Brazil so I done it so every
time I see anybody using like a national
ID say I was part of that
so because of me you got that my
favorite moment alone as Java developers
when I came finally returned water learn
if Java I can finally give some things
to the Java community so they my
favorite moments on Java developers when
I start to contribute some open-source
products search of the open JDK is some
specification as javac swatch group ok I
think my my favorite moment with Java
was when I got my first job or maybe my
first certification my favorite moment
with Java is when I discovered that I
can work with small devices and I can
also teach my kids about that so that's
my best moment
developer is conferences really amazing
we'll get together Agra Gardens because
get in action that you can really see
things happening this is
until this bidding and this is why the
assessment will get together in these
conferences and they really love what
they do and they do it with passion and
then amazing things happen
I have two favorite moments as Java
developer the first one when I met my
wife in the classroom giving teaching
Java for her and the second moment when
I work at with Jamie's Ghazni
open-source project or Javadoc
