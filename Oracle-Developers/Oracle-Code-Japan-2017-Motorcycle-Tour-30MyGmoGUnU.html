of the Oracle code events worldwide
we've done these across the u.s. Europe
and now Asia we just finished Oracle
code Japan which was an awesome event
we're on a motorcycle tour following
that event traveling across Japan
visiting different user groups the
reason why Oracle is reaching out to
developers is the way people buy
software services and products has
really changed now developers have a lot
more control over the technology it's
they use so we want to directly engage
with developers teach them about some
new open-source technologies and then
show them that those technologies were
using run very well in the Oracle cloud
one of the big advantages Oracle has is
having a very large community so by
building on top of our stack you're not
only getting the you know Oracle
products and services which run in our
cloud technology but you're also getting
a lot of community support from folks
and those open source technology
commitments there's over 300 Java user
groups globally Java user groups and the
Oracle user groups they run their own
events they talk about technologies they
help folks get up to speed on how they
can use our cloud technologies and
platforms and you can be part of the
community basically we're traveling
across Japan and stopping at a dozen
user groups in between via motorcycle so
it's a very efficient way to hit up a
bunch of different communities
throughout Japan it's in the big cities
you get large numbers of developers
because there's large consulting
companies a lot of software development
happening there but in the smaller areas
of Japan you get a very local flavor to
the communities and user groups and
there's large user group communities but
they don't always get the attention and
the visibility which they would get
normally if they were in a large hub
like Tokyo on this tour we have
Sebastian - nur who is a Java champion
from Germany he's presenting about cloud
native Java development we have Kirk
Pepperdine who is a internationally
known performance tuning guru and lastly
we have David Dell'Abate who is a Java
EE and WebLogic evangelist for Oracle
it's great that we share a common
interest in motorcycling and we're able
to use that to spread a little bit of
our
passionate about Java to the global user
group
