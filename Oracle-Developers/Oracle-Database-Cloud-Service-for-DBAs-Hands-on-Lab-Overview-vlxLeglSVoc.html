designed to walk you through each of the
steps required to create a database
migrate data perform routine maintenance
and use the CLI curl commands to find
the various status of cloud services
without the need to use the cloud
console well accomplish this with the
help of the Oracle public cloud
throughout our journey we'll assume the
roles inside a fictitious company called
alpha office meet Howard he knows the
data over the past 15 years working for
alpha office supply Howard has watched
the information he manages grow as his
company has expanded from a small three
store regional supplier to becoming a
nationwide business three years ago when
alpha office first needed an online
store Howard got to spend most of his
time doing what he does best building
data models writing peals equal
procedures and developing innovative
database driven applications his ideas
and innovations were crucial to his
company's growth and success as the
business has grown so has the data the
system complexity and unfortunately red
tape today it seems like QWERTY patching
routine maintenance Network approvals
and hardware resource requests take up
most of the time Howard used to spend
doing what he loves most innovating to
help expand and improve the business but
most of all of that is about to change
as alpha office looks to opportunities
to simplify and enhance its IT
capabilities and unleash the creativity
of innovative employees like Howard by
leveraging the Oracle public cloud
now that we've met Howard and know where
Alfa offices heading we can take a look
at the cloud services Howard will be
using to help them along his journey the
first service Howard needs is a platform
in which to run his database from he's
chosen to use Oracle's compute classic
bare metal instance this instance will
simulate an on-premise 12.2 database
we'll be configuring an archive logging
configure archive logging and
transparent data encryption to support
the migration and we're going to use the
compute classic platform as a client
platform and finally use sequel
developer and SSH tunneling to access
access the DB CS resources Oracle's
compute bare metal servers without a
hypervisor deliver uncompromising and
consistent performance instances with
the latest generation of nvme
solid-state drives and providing
millions of AI ops and very low latency
are ideal for i/o intensive web
applications the most demanding data
workloads and the Oracle database true
on-demand bare-metal instances deliver
elasticity for your workloads
start terminate and monitor bare metal
instances and VMs as needed using the
console api's or SDKs Oracle's compute
servers have three different options
bare metal GPU instances and virtual
machine instances now that how our
chosen the platform he will use he can
continue on his journey and choose his
database
although there are few options to choose
film Howard has chosen to use Oracle's
database cloud service not only does it
seamlessly integrate with the bare metal
platform but it also has fully
autonomous patching for security
purposes we're going to use the cloud
service to backup the database to the
Oracle cloud create a database from
backup use a sequel developer for
various migration jobs and perform
common DBA tasks with the Oracle
database cloud service Oracle offers
general purpose and high memory compute
shapes to provide the full power of the
Oracle database in the cloud for any
type of application you can use all
standard network connections and have
administrative control Oracle gives you
the ability to control storage compute
scaling through web console or REST API
and you can leverage all Oracle database
defense in in-depth security
capabilities for complete data security
use patching automation tools built into
the web console again or use the REST
API for easy application of database
patches use simple migration processes
to validate upgrades scheduled backup
automation to fast local storage using
the Oracle cloud
let's take let's take a look at the
hands-on overview in lab 100 you'll
learn how to set up create and access a
database cloud instance in that lab
you're going to backup the database to
the cloud restore the database the
backup in the cloud to it to a cloud
instance explore that database in the
cloud and access the console
in lab 200 you'll explore some common
use cases for moving your data to the
cloud your data from on-premise to the
cloud and we'll look at migration with
pluggable databases migration using
Oracle data pump at the schema level
migration at the tablespace level and
finally just simple copying of data
between instances using database links
in lab 300 you'll perform some common
DBA tasks such as setting up security
access and scaling out your instance and
through the in that lab we'll look at
just a basic creation instance creation
exercise will look at maintaining
security scaling up an instance and
adding SSH keys and in lab 400 you're
going to preview simple get and put
commands to monitor and control the
database cloud service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
