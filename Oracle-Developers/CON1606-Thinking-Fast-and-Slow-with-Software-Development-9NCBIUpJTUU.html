and Slow we saw for development my name
is Daniel Bryant apologies if I am
looking a little bit Haggard it's
because Oracle master schedule all three
of my talks a job one one after the
other today so I've literally done two
talks already I'm you know coasting on
caffeine basically so I should do my
best anyway so and yes so today we're
going to look at thinking more
deliberately yeah we're gonna see that
are as human beings our decision-making
can often be flawed yeah and it's all of
us doesn't matter who you are kind of
thing we're going to look at applying
processor models as appropriate to
overcome some of those issues we're
going to be looking at collaborating
more because I think software is
inherently a collaborative event you
know but more for not some people shy
away from that and we're going to be
looking at using the scientific method
plan-do-check-act build measure learn
all that good stuff because I think this
is really important what I see in my
day-to-day work as a consultant so I
work for a company called open credo but
based over in the UK we'd also work in
Europe and in the US as well and I do a
lot of technical digital transformations
all that good stuff
fundamentally I am a Java developer one
of you guys is all good and I love love
Java work with the open JDK welcome the
dots Jess our crew really happy to see
Java you know continuing onwards
strength the strength and like JDK 8 I
also work a lot with that golang did all
the micro services work containers and
nature of my work I'm based in we do a
lot of that kind of thing and I though
I've got no psychology background I
would happen with you know we talk about
psychology here I'm only into pop
psychology I do have a PhD in artificial
intelligence that's kind of my love of
like AI and all this kind of thing and
empathy associated with AI has come from
my days as an academic but they were
like 10 or 15 years ago and now I'm also
remember the OJC
London Java a user group and have a
great time they're met so many cool
people and there's so many cool things
over the years so if you're not a member
of a jug I strongly recommend you do
find your local jug or form1 if you
haven't got one it's an amazing
opportunity to learn more from
like-minded people so let's dive
straight in Thinking Fast and Slow who's
actually read the book are brilliant so
about 10% the audience read the book
good brilliant is an amazing book by
Daniel Kahneman and it fundamentally
talks about the heuristics and biases we
we use and we have and making decisions
as humans yeah so I think a lot of us is
you know I'm gonna assume the room is
Moe
we developers QA ops type people I think
a lot of us look at our managers ala
Dilbert and think decision-making
sometimes appears a bit crazy doesn't it
yeah you know it's like I've done all
this stuff and here at leadership in the
like what you know that's your job kind
of thing but fundamentally all of us are
subject to this and you're all leaders
yeah wherever you are in an organization
you are a leader to some degree so this
is you know this talk is aimed at
everyone in the organization and the
thing from the book the book introduces
a model in the way that we think and
make decisions and the model consists of
system 1 and system 2 yeah this is not
my work I say Daniel Kahneman amazing
work won a Nobel Prize for it it's great
stuff
but I'm gonna borrow some this stuff and
system one is fast instinctive emotional
and subconscious it's the limbic part of
your brain near the brainstem back here
and it's the one that's developed like
early on in evolution senses so back in
the Sahara running away from Tigers and
things like that
it was the bit of the brain that's going
Tigers face run that kind of stuff yeah
system 2 is the neocortex which is
developed over the time and it's the bit
you identify as you yeah slower more
deliberate responsible for reasoning
okay so system one system two I'll
hopefully demonstrate the concept now to
use what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna flash
up two calculations on the screen in
relatively quick succession and try and
do the calculation in your mind it'd be
a simple arithmetic calculation and
watch try and watch what you're doing as
you make the calculation that makes
sense do the calculation try and watch
what you're doing first calculation
second calculation and then the answers
now fundamentally in the answers are
both the same but I bet the first one
you thought - best - like that since
kindergarten since primary school where
from fundamental that is drilled into us
2+2 4 that's a system one event there
was no hardly any effort involved in
that decision yeah
you like before no worries the other one
you like woah 24 / - yeah that's like 12
probably most of you thought I'm not
even going to bother the guys gonna tell
me what it is anyway fair enough okay
and I am but do you as a system one like
that system - you need to kick it into
gear have to mix mess on a biological
level your blood pressure goes up a
little bit pupils dilate all this good
stuff and anyone how hard problem is now
isn't a hard problem but think about in
terms of
we make as developers we make some
pretty complex decisions yeah every day
next little example is an optical
illusion two things the same size and
you might see a face-to-face it's where
you might see a force yeah one appetite
like instantly you'll see one thing the
vols the two phases now I've explained
there two things you can see both system
one system two I don't know if you've
seen this before but and I'm gonna say
two now gonna give you three options who
thinks the top line is bigger who thinks
the bottom line is bigger and who think
said the same so who thinks the top that
is bigger lovely about 10% who thinks
the bottom line is bigger no one and who
thinks they're both the same size see
one of our Chen is tricked your system
one this is that you've seen this over
for yeah so it's the EULA I know he's
gonna trick me again bad luck one final
one so Bob is a single male in his
twenties who's bright quiet like science
fiction and fantasy and avoid
interacting with people in the real
world what do we think is more probable
is Bob Bob site a programmer or a
programmer and who plays the massively
online games who thinks is more probable
at bob bob is a programmer I'm gonna say
20% who thinks bob is a program at and
place the online games who's not playing
anymore
yeah what it is its conjunction fallacy
it's much more likely that bob is a
programmer
yeah I've given you actual information
but fundamentally there are more
programmers and there are people that
play more games and you've got the
conjunction of the two of them even less
likely that make sense so fundamentally
system 1 and system 2 system 1 is rapid
it's associative and it has systemic
errors back in the days of escaping from
Tigers that's not a problem you lose or
some leaves on the ground you thought
they were tigers space you're running
false positive no big deal yeah much
better than rather hanging around in it
being a real tiger yeah the problem is
we see Tigers everywhere now we see
Tigers you know at home was he Tigers at
work was he Titus crossing the street
lots of systemic errors that our brain
kind of jumps into our system to is lazy
its causal and it's not statistical you
know we transmit knowledge to the ages
by stories we don't say that you know
13.7 percent of magic beans are not real
we talk about Jack and the Beanstalk yet
yeah it's also that the laziness is a
key thing we have to kick it into gear
and this is something I'm going to touch
on quite a bit threat today in terms of
how we're gonna look at some heuristics
and biases that affect
our software developers and architects
and no QA of people as well and
fundamentally I don't think we kick kick
system doing - assistant - into gear
enough so we're gonna look about four or
five different heuristics and biases the
first one is the availability heuristic
and it says if something can be recalled
it must be important
yeah so whatever you hear a lot ticking
in that elections going on now and all
that kind of stuff whatever you hear if
people think is more important it's kind
of that this virtuous or vicious cycle
of reinforcement and I think an IT where
we kind of suffer from this hip
psoriasis hopefully that translates over
the pond in the UK we say you're a
hipster if you're on the latest most
available things excuse me
it's talking too much for the day so and
what I'm gonna say is like one thing I'm
gonna point out here is what do we think
the best architectural style is if I was
to say to you today greenfield project
you can go any architectural style you
like what's that was someone shout out
what I think they want to use to build
it Oh Springs give that steel say like
it's microservices in terms of
architecture style yeah micro services
are everywhere I'm guilty as charged I
love microservices and Lascar thing
current flavor of the month very
available in all the media you only look
at I'm guilty I've done that one film
ready on on mic receivers but job one
this year docker
micro service communities everywhere
yeah they're available so it's this
virtuous vicious you know kind of cycle
of like people see it like who I want to
learn about I want to talk about it all
this good stuff it creates what's called
the bandwagon effect you know that's
have you heard so the the adoption curve
you get the early adopters the majority
late majority DAC I think people jump on
the bandwagon because they think it's
popular I think it's going places micro
services docker they are amazing
architectural styles docker is an
amazing tool but it is just that it's
not a way of mind necessarily it is kind
of a tool to be used yet so I hope we
stand happy found the Silver Bullet the
answer is pretty much know anyone who's
read Fred Brooks classical mythical
man-month knows that the reason they've
Silver Bullet in the IT industry I work
in the industry now for like 15 years
and I've seen like classical server I've
seen core burr so you know other things
and there isn't really a silver bullet
often like things get reinvented Corbis
OA micro services and they're all great
but they all have a context behind them
as well the problem is whenever things
are available it's like whenever we have
is a hammer everything looks like a nail
makes sense when all you have is a
cellar everything looks like a service
please do not create the two-string
service yeah it's the mythical two
strings sir I never seen it in the wild
yet but the mythical two string service
when all you have is a Jenkins I often
find people put everything in a Jenkins
job yeah
and I've seen like alt perm so ETL
processes put in Jenkins I've seen all
that crazy things going to Jenkins
Jenkins is a great build tool but it is
not a panacea to all our all our needs
and wants and quite a thing yeah like to
balance stuff I've been doing a lot of
spring love today like in my zone
stalker I love spring boot
awesome framework but want to balance it
a little bit when all you have is a
spring framework everything tends to
look like an abstract singlet and proxy
factory I love the spring but if you
looked in the guts of spring there is
some crazy thing so some of it makes
sense some of it doesn't and we've all
done it you've all done that crazy
factories that thing but think
professionally yeah this is what I'm
trying to say to your few times a day
stop and engage system - it does take
effort but it's well worth it in the
right context spike the prototype
experiment evaluate the reason I got
into IT is because it constantly changes
I love learning I'm sure many of you do
too
but please do do it in a systematic way
constant learning is bundle of despite
emetic fundamental finding trusted
mentors is really valuable I know they
can be like wherever you are work
jug's even in this room as lots of
people at potential mentors they can be
people junior to you people senior to
you there's lots of things to learn from
all types of people I've learned the
most from people who are junior to me
actually they've taught me some really
valuable lessons and do cultivate blogs
great stuff lots you know keep up next
hype and stuff but read the classics now
I do a lot of job interview Severn and
the UK for my company and also for the
companies we work with and all too often
I say how do you keep up to date with
knowledge and everyone rolls out some
vlogs they're gonna look at info cue new
stack all this good stuff and then off
and wind it back and I say what's the
last book you read because for me books
capture a different kind of knowledge no
any tech books but also books that maybe
outside your comfort zone I think
they're really valuable books are still
valuable you know it doesn't matter if
you're reading electronically or on
paper or whatever you want but I think
blogs are really valuable for new
information fundamentals good principles
to build on books are really valuable
some plain monomers I'd like to
recommend this is a book heavy
presentation the slides are already
online if you go to my SlideShare
account you'll see that and also up this
M I'll put this one out later on tonight
as well and on my SEM Twitter much last
year I'm gonna recommend stacks of books
and there's a reason for it at the end
I'll explain but effective Java awesome
book your Java dope and I haven't read
it please do it's like an amazing book
and the art of UNIX programming is a bit
of a random one but you're doing
microservices the principles in that
book are amazing yeah a lot of good
stuff in that book about just good
programming practices . srp cohesion
coupling and lastly for microsoft's is
that's my recommended book architecture
bit of a dry read I wouldn't recommend a
bedtime reading but it's a really good
book yeah it sounded like fundamentals
of what architecture is risk management
all that good stuff
for getting into your DevOps so I highly
recommend the UNIX and Linux
administration handbook and if you're
doing transformations I'm doing more
more this lately where I'm from bringing
new tech bringing new practices into
organizations these two books are
awesome
agile idea organization design new book
by and one of the thought workers and
and also leave their Lisa is its own
Linda rising Linda rising to awesome
I've seen the present many times more
fearless change
it's basically a pattern book so anyone
who's familiar with design patterns will
instantly get it's about patterns of
change brown bag lunches how you drive
you know early adoption all this kind of
stuff it's a fantastic book so read the
fundamentals as much as the blocks get
rid of that bear variability kind of
bias now in terms of evaluation I want
to share with you a little question
which I find really quite nice
evaluation is evaluating things be it
frameworks get text whatever is really
valuable yeah and it says I'll postpone
using this shiny new framework until my
peers have validated the proposed
benefits with rigorous scientific
experiments now this was of course set
by no programmer ever because we just
don't do it doing guilty as charged yeah
I'm not gonna stand up in saying I'm
bear I'm certainly not what I find
useful is rables comparison matrix
matter able awesome guy fellow into the
cue editor and he can't this matrix a 5
or more years ago now comparing web
frameworks so he's got his web
frameworks along this sort of x axis at
the top and the y is the property he's
comparing does it have good
documentation is it easy to install is
the operational overhead low or high mmm
what you can do then you can pass this
around your team and score appropriately
obviously it still
objective to some degree you are giving
a score on zero to one or whatever but
you your team can kind of go I value
this more whatever and you can wait
certain things it's a really nice way to
as a team evaluate all the options clear
caveat here is you must know the
properties you are evaluating now
shatter Tutera cabbage our bow whose an
one of my colleagues at open credo he
made this point really clearly like when
you're evaluating say languages or or
like in spring and Java EE we often know
as developers what we're looking for and
what we often find is people are
bringing in containers and
micro-services they don't know what
they're looking for and that's where
this technique does fall down because
you don't know how to score things but
given that you think you know the domain
really well or relatively well this is a
really valuable tool for kind of
providing some framework amongst your
team and the real bonus is it gives you
documentation as to why you've chosen
things yeah so but often I walk into
organizations or I see you're using the
play framework I see you're using Mongo
why is that and nine times out of ten
the answer is not sure it looked cool we
know we've got it working really quickly
that kind of thing yeah all great
answers in the right context but is it
the right context yeah there's no
documentation to people to back up why
they've made choices and say the project
changes or technology changes how do we
compare our choice given what we know
now what window but when you then this
is really valuable some form of this
framework really manually next bias is
the optimistic bias I think you know
people tend to be overconfident
certainly am yeah believing that we have
substantial control in our lives I think
that's very obvious for me it's like I
see this a lot I know what the customer
wants how could I possibly be wrong yeah
well I've only worked in a few projects
that came in on time and on budget I
think probably the majority would come
out as well there's four factors of
optimistic bias is the desired end state
we like to think of good things
basically yeah self enhancement kind of
make sense in that you know we want to
we don't visualize bad things because
then you know that doesn't make sense
but we had these cognitive mechanisms
called representatives heuristics hard
to say after two talks and and singular
target focused in that we stereotype
things and we get locked into things
very
the human mind can only comprehend so
many things we use little tricks all the
time sometimes these tricks are quite
damaging you know optimistic past years
is one of them
and we have a lot more information about
ourselves then our target often sitting
if you were a team lead it's very easy
to project your feelings on the other
people thinking they think and are the
same and they're not I'm not saying
everyone's a snowflake but everyone
thinks about things differently
fundamentally we are all unique in our
own special way yeah so you've got to
think about that you know more about
yourself it has some empathy basically
you're talking to someone when you're
leading a team think about this kind of
thing and that you don't don't over
project your optimism if someone's being
a bit negative listen to it it might be
a good their idea about why we might
worry more pessimistic here might be
really valuable and the overall mood is
massively important I don't know a lot
of developers I interact with like to
think they're very logical creatures I
think I'm the same to be honest but
we're all you know fundamentally not
logical yeah we're logical to some
degree but there's just moods you had a
fight with your spouse or someone cut
you up in traffic these massively impact
decisions you make I see it for example
when people get financing they get like
a big series a loads of cash they make
some crazy architectural decisions
because they're all excited and happy
but just like good and bad mood really
affects your decisions and your team so
be aware of that I think again it's
empathy I'm gonna keep banging this drum
empathy for me is a really valuable
concept think professionally with
optimism is to find and share clear
goals
yeah and it's build measure learn lean
lean start on our thing it's that
constant scientific method of iterating
towards a target condition you think is
the right condition it might not be you
might want to pivot and change away from
it but it's that that sort of scientific
approach too often I see people just got
a go for stuff it fails they walk away
go for something else it fails in walks
way build incrementally not always
appropriate but quite a lot of times
it's more beneficial to do that kind of
thing and you don't have to throw away
all your work you can kind of
incrementally build
remove uncertainty early dan knows that
Dan loss has an awesome speaker
hopefully many of you seen down north
but and if you haven't please check out
stuff and he's got this presentation
called
patterns of effective delivery it's a
kind of software development pattern
thing again and he talks about the
dancing skeleton
ginger cake all funny names but all
presented as kind of patterns you know
given the context how do you apply them
what problems they solve these kind of
things
removing uncertainty early in a project
when you know the least about the
project is really fundamental yeah
software is inherently collaborative as
well and we've definitely got a lot
better as an industry I think over the
last five years hold em up stuff at Java
spits you know to some degree agile bit
about project management fest but it has
allowed us to kind of you know do
somethings better as well but I already
got into pair programming pair
programming is awesome I think in terms
of you know it's collaboration on design
collaboration on thinking we have a lot
of bias and optimism is one of them
which can be diffused to some degree by
collaborating well with other people
throughout the business and for me Lila
I'm going to give you three sort of
areas where I use this like a little
trick first one is the three amigos
people heard of the three amigos yes so
that's the BDD concept so behavior
driven design whenever you're designing
your feature you have your stakeholder
your user you also have a QA tester and
a developer because we've all got
different approaches to the problem yeah
the business person knows what they won
hopefully and the QA person might be
thinking of edge cases your testing
conditions and the developers thinking
about how tricky it's going to be to
implement given the scenario and he and
she can offer an advice on that kind of
thing
I found this technique really valuable
and BDD in general I think is really
valuable and the actual output of
automated tests for regression and
assets and stuff is really good but for
me the communication is the most
important point of behavior driven
design once once you've got your kind of
design going on it's all about the
programming yeah and for me it used to
be like mop pair programming and I think
pair programming is awesome like you
most of um show up so at least know of
pair programming if you haven't tried it
I highly recommend you do it takes a bit
of getting used to
liked again and I some things I still
just want to code on my own because I
find it really hot it's hard to
articulate things and stuff but pair
programming is a really valuable tool
for building yeah well architected
systems mob programming takes it to the
next level I saw this at a conference in
in the UK um few months ago now but it's
been going for several years woodie's
well as their behind it and it literally
is like them and unruly and rule eco
over in the UK
they're global actually practice this
really well and I know the M broody guys
and girls quite well and they do some
amazing work mob bro giving is one
person driving and up to nine others
navigating now that sounds a bit crazy
than that that's what I thought and yeah
it's not right for every context hands
up now and obviously but I actually did
some mob programming at this conference
agile on the beach the conference is
called in UK fantastic conference and
there's a company called blue fruit who
do in bed it hardware and but it's a
software and they they were really their
massive multi programming fans and they
invited a load of us into like more
program with them and it is bizarre I'm
not gonna lie this sat there one person
the person actually driving shouldn't be
doing much thinking in terms of code
they're more like the person just typing
but you rotate very quickly yeah five
ten minutes rotate around the team and
you mustn't undo with without good
reason what the previous person's done
so you're just going to go out pops
messed it up can't do that that's not
cool but it's really interesting because
what I find that as a consultant but we
have these sessions but not we're
actually building it yeah so everyone's
got an opinion yeah we're developers
we've all got opinions yeah five
developers in the room and ten opinions
yeah the problem is that when you're
doing this when the codes been cut the
codes been written it's really hard to
change yeah I'm sure many of you had
these kind of conversations so why'd you
architect it like that why don't you do
that why'd you use that library wouldn't
but mob programming these happen at the
time it's actually occurring not for
everyone
I just want milites days I'm gonna dump
at loads of ideas those books those
things to get you thinking I'm not
saying you know definitely consultant
there's a lot of it depends that's more
my favorite answers like clients don't
like it but it's not very billable but
it's members in there but its context
here context this king or queen it's
really important think about these
things but I think mob programming is
quick tit it's easy to dismiss it but
it's a really powerful technique
the final bit you've got your
programming done it's all about the
DevOps in my mind yeah and we've been
banging all about DevOps now for several
years and you know DevOps is just a
label I think like Diane Marshall did
great talk with Netflix yes they awesome
talk and she was saying basically what
is DevOps
but for me it's about culture and
developers working with QA with ops that
kind of thing and fundamentally it's
about sharing the pain yet and the
analogy I like to use is it's like the
safety culture you as a developer don't
feel any pain for your mistakes you're
going to keep doing the same things yeah
only make sense then
soon as I I'm moved into company we were
getting paged at 3:00 in the morning
when our Cove is breaking I learned to
write better code simple as that yeah
and the Netflix and Google talked about
it and it's very easy to think their
uniforms but a lot of real companies are
doing this kind of thing these days when
you know when you're actually at a
developer who experiences the pain you
just get a more you actually empathize
more with your operations team see the
kind of things they're seeing you start
writing your logging statements better
you start monitoring a lot more things I
found and I started being a lot more
defensive in my programming using like
try caches appropriately and using like
things like hystrix circuit breakers all
this good stuff and but it's this conk
like that the naturality is it's bear
with me it's a slightly strange napkin
strange analogy but it's like air bags
yeah they are fantastic invention
they've saved countless thousands
millions of lives but there's an
argument that it's safety culture they
cause people to drive more recklessly if
you know you're going to be tailgating
someone 80 miles an hour down the
motorway or whatever cut them up and if
you do have a crash the safety record
sees there's a really good airbag
deploys you're probably gonna be okay
there was an argument that causes you to
drive and behave more recklessly the
interesting thing some people are saying
we need to put a spike on the dashboard
instead of an airbag yeah and the thing
is imagine you're tailgating someone
down the most or so it's down the
freeway I stay over here there's a
freeway you know 80 miles an hour over
and you got a big spike there you're
gonna think twice about hitting that
brake on you you're all gonna think
twice about cutting up someone it's
trivial sort of like you realized
analogy but I think it's really key for
me this notion of dev on call yeah okay
an occasional spike of the head is a
good thing metaphorically speaking my
legal team have put them metaphorically
speaking in there you are not allowed to
spike your developers in the head I find
that said Jeremy not cool but no in all
seriousness this stuff is really
valuable yeah and it's the whole concept
of Amazon CTO Verna Vogel was talked
about this several years ago you build
it you run it you write it you run it
and the meters are professional that
just makes sense yeah I'm writing code I
are want to be responsible for my code
if it breaks it's not someone else's
problem it's my problem yeah I think
that's it I think no but my colleagues
and other people I've learned this from
my mentors and so forth it just makes
sense I like to think of myself and I
aspire to be a professional software
craftsmanship put whatever you like on
it but I aspire to be professional and
for me it's about being responsible I
want the freedom but I want
accountability as well it's only fair I
think get bit preachy down I'll bark
Darb a minute but for me that you billet
you run it shared responsibility in
collaboration again communication it's
really that's what DevOps is in my mind
it's more about the culture it's more
about working breaking down the silos
than it is about the tech the text cool
and easy to get to the yeah into but the
DevOps thing is more about sharing
showing you this kind stuff
dynamaxx second removing and limiting
uncertainty some books I'm gonna
recommend you hear impact mapping
awesome book if you're looking to do
like sort of you know what's the impact
you're trying to cause fee for your
business drive sales increase conversion
all that kind of stuff the Lean Startup
and the Lean Enterprise talked about how
to do these things in startups or
Enterprise it's like the lean in twice
an amazing book like I read it in the
summer I think was and yeah it was just
one his books I've been reading a lot of
stuff over the last few years and it
basically encapsulates all the stuff
I've been reading into one very
manageable volume it's really good if
you work in an enterprise and wanna
drive change wanna drive DevOps wanna
drive good testing when I Drive
continuous to get integration and
delivery it is a fantastic book to read
some business model ones extreme
programming throws where they pair
programming type stuff comes from like
that book is written I think in 97 is
still a fantastic book by Kent Beck it
talks about the real cause of XP and
that for me is agile done right yeah
it's not just about project management
agile is fantastic approach to
management
I'm not ragging on it but it became a
project management fest we didn't do the
technical practices behind that job
really gamestorming is really cool in
terms of like lots of little tips and
tricks about that kind of creating games
get everyone in a creative mood and do
some car things that on how to do you
want limit uncertainty and increased
collaboration as well so like they're
really good books final bit for this
section of the talk is check the hippo
I'm not sure if anyone's heard of the
hippo but hippo stands for highest paid
person's opinion all too often I go into
companies and we do the sensible stuff
and then the SVP or someone will come
along and veto all the changes that I'm
the highest paid person I know best and
that I think is like rubbish nine times
that attend to be honest but really be
careful of this that all the way down
through the stack when you're doing
transformations in particular I see this
and and you know what kept my clients
mini-me names but the same thing with
like there's a joke here so that using a
be testing don't just go in your gut or
don't just go on the gut of someone
who's highly paint
test staff via scientific method a plan
finally check Act build measure learn
that kind of good stuff on the next one
the planning fallacy and is a phenomena
in which predictions about how much time
will be needed to complete a future task
we'll just lay an optimistic bias so
kind of relate to optimism again and
again as I've already hinted when was
your last project compete it on time and
on budget it's quite often not that
doesn't happen does it
I t's track record is not great I'll be
honest and so Sainsbury's supply chain
management system cost like five hundred
million dollars we're just as bad in the
UK NHS was kind of like ten million ten
billion so a project that was gonna make
all our met bit like healthcare.gov type
things gonna make all our health care
records and nationalized that kind of
fail it's been rolled out regionally now
but it costs but yeah ten billion and
healthcare.gov I'm sure don't many of
you I don't need to talk about hello
girl for you you know the deal
yeah it kind of worked it eventually but
like it's crazy what can going on I've
found I've sort of checked people I know
what went on behind the scenes it's
makes a fast named talks the first thing
reading the most common factors of
failure are by the I Triple E they're
very well established very interesting
organization most common factors of
failure in IT projects are listed here
and I think these ones in particular are
ones we as developers cuarón architects
couldn't do something about yeah poor
communication useful immature technology
hands up on that one and in the ministry
handle products context a sloppy
development practices and often I see
value or we're agile agile is not sloppy
yeah I'll just say that so if you often
say like you know agile isn't excuses
it's not clearly these I think are we
not within our control as developers to
change and for me like that the starter
projects about what I call feedback and
Federation I've borrowed this investor
people mary popping deck and few others
it's the backswing plan-do-check-act
and showcasing as early as you can along
the way to make sure what you're
building is the right thing
improving estimation is really key I'll
talk a little bit about no estimates in
a minute which I'm finding quite
interesting but estimation is often like
you know some companies over we have to
estimate and it's really hard yes I'll
give you some tips about that in a
minute
dividing and conquering seems like a
very good way to do things so slower
micro-services modules it's all
fundamentally the same idea you divide
things down it's easier to reason about
things micro-services as James Lewis
fundamental said is it back software
that fits in your head you can
understand what goes on many
monoliths I've worked with I just can't
understand because they're just so
complex and so big
whereas micro-services the dream is they
were allowable to reason about subsets
of the application
this also Maps the teams as well so many
of you I'm sure heard like Spotify and
there were their squads guilds and
chapters and it really is valuable this
is like Spotify have a whole heart they
stole missamma Spotify I've tried this
on a few companies and worked a few
didn't work in others but if you're
developing micro services and developing
around kind of across functional areas
you probably need cross-functional teams
yeah best spot if I have the notion of a
tribe so that might be a tribe
responsible for increasing conversion I
try responsible for the player that kind
of thing and they have this product
owner cross-functional teams that front
end back end QA etc except architect
chapters are where their line managed
across the size that might be the QA
chapter like that that person might be
the leader of the QA chapter in that
tribe that bus might be the leader of
the architecture chapter say and the way
it's sort of done is it's very loosely
aligned it says they have this notion of
guilds as well and guilds might be like
a leadership guild
it can even span across the tribes quash
the glow glow and it's kind of people
come together they run on unconferences
they like to have newsletters all this
kind of things so it's it's kind of all
it's like a reverse of a hierarchy to
some degree there's like notions of very
tightly aligned cross-functional teams
building stuff based on a KPI so your
KPI is to increase conversion that kind
of thing but there's also this notion of
support like the chapters you know the
people that line managed are not also
responsible for your performance in a
specific thing you're doing which is
quite nice so Spotify that they've been
doing this few years it is an advanced
pattern but if you're interested read
more about Spotify online this notion of
if you're doing micro services like
micro teams kind of make sense in my
mind yeah and I've got to get the buzz
word in there it's kind of Conway's law
anyone said Conway's law and micro
services I've worked the industry long
enough I'm sure many do you have
the way you organisation is set out
clearly impacts the way software is
delivered and developed yeah so a side
note even if you're upfront planning is
good things inevitably go wrong yeah and
it's often people involved in the melee
when it goes wrong you want to be this
guy yeah you want to be kicking back
with a beer know what's going on
basically
it's all about people like more and more
I work in initially the more I realize
the tech is kind of like a sideshow
already gonna call it tech is clearly
massively important but for example in
like this educator mouth care.gov Mikey
Dixon went in from Google and a few
other snoring of cannon a few others
went in and helped healthcare.gov kind
of you know and come back online that
this story behind how big of was
allegedly no one thought it was actually
gonna succeed I was a typical government
project normally cared about it of
course President Obama based his whole
EO reelection on that kind of stuff so
it was really important but but when and
when Michael Dixon and Mikey's Nixon
walked into healthcare.gov into the dev
team he was like going and right so I
see that the site's broken yet no it's
come back out was broken right first
thing we do is we need to monitor the
situation how do you guys monitor
healthcare.gov is working and someone
pointed to a TV in the corner of the
room with CNN on and they said we look
at CNN when they focus on healthcare.gov
being down we know it's down and I heard
that my cues were like that's crazy but
that was the reacting situation they
didn't even have based monitoring no one
was accountable for monitoring so it
didn't get built as simple as that yet
so first thing Mikey do's and his team
norian and the people they put in basic
monitoring health checks always a good
stuff it just makes good technical sense
but then it was all about the way things
were handled yeah Incident Response
post-mortems everyone was very quick to
kind of run away point the finger at
someone else and Mikey was all about a
culture of kind of like that shared
responsibility yet once you've got the
basic technology in place whatever it is
in this case it's monitoring
think about the people it's really
important yeah do things like game days
and you know disaster recovery testing
all those guys that's really important
so anything from the micro macro to
micro other books are recommending user
stories really good if you want to
improve estimation that's great book
their architecture is really fundamental
Simon Brown stuff on the right their
software architects for developers is
really fundamental first learning about
these things and then in terms of like
drifting into failure fascinating books
they're by Adrian Cockcroft
recommendation if you let the little
things slide you can often drift into
bad areas so great book so this is kind
of it's a fun read it's not a techy read
thinking in systems is the classic thing
if you are going to break things down
into micro services you've got to think
of the big picture as well yeah so as
much as easier to real and to think
about localized areas and clearly
think about the bigger you know what's
actually happening and that's systems
thinking it can be formalized there's
mathematics behind it if you're
interested if you're not it's fine as
well but it's just a really nice book
about how to break things down and how
to build them back up and how to reason
about complex behaviors that emerge is
definitely in micro service systems you
get some emergent behavior it's
sometimes evolution kind of behavior so
it's a great book to sort of your prime
you on that if you're looking to build
interesting teams I highly recommend
laszlo box book he works at Google and
and he's talked about how Google hire
how they train how they retain people
and yeah Google are again slightly
unicorny I think that's true and fair to
say but they are they do some stuff
really well and I love that Janet the
Google people I learned so much from
them and as those codified what he knows
he's like the VP I think off of them
people resources or HR kind of thing and
he's got some great tips for how to
train your people all this good stuff so
really good book final thing on the
planning stuff is do accept the unknown
unknowns here there's always going to be
stuff as unknown it's the nature of the
game and don't worry about it yeah like
you can try and think like a manager and
fix problems where you find them but in
reality that's not going to happen so
don't worry about it do your best you
can but again have some empathy for
yourself and your team I think finally a
sunk cost fallacy so it's any pass cost
that has already been and paid and
cannot be it's like Peyton can't be
recovered should not figure in the
decision-making process yeah say again
say any pass cost has already been sunk
been paid should cannot be recovered
should not figure into the ongoing
decision-making process fasik is when
did you last remove a framework or
library we don't like doing it do we we
kind of you know we sunk the cost if we
reverse it even we don't like it but our
managers definitely don't like it or
what paid for that development I'm not
gonna pave you to take stuff out that
kind of thing fundamentally I think it's
about the fact we don't like being wrong
as humans yeah you know we like to think
we're doing best we can and I love a lot
of people I work with are doing the best
they can given the scenario and the
knowledge they have at the given time
they're making decisions but it's fine
to admit you didn't have the information
like because it can solve unfrequently I
roll in somewhere fix stuff and only
later find out why that's you know cause
it's like nothing you're always
operating on the information you have
existing effect yeah FOP is wasted in
India Holman effect when we own
something be it you know physical things
albeit code we endow like we put special
meaning onto it if I was to pick up like
a mug off yeah smash it on the floor you
probably think I is a bit crazy but not
too much about it if I was to give one
of your mug
take it away and throw it on the floor
it'd be more disheartening yeah because
I've given something to you it's been in
doubt you aspire more value to it so def
definitely once you own a bit of code
that's why I like shared ownership of
code the endowment effect is weakened
this kind of shared at code ownership is
really quite powerful a lot of famously
loss aversion is twice as powerful
psychologically as game sorry yes games
so have a look in the book for the proof
pine map but it kind of makes sense when
you win stuff it's often good but say if
you open up your wallet and a hundred
dollars just flies out of your wallet
that really hurts yeah your money is
just gone do you other mean but if you
win stuff it's good but loss aversion is
really powerful that's what we reluctant
to you know to admit we're wrong bottom
line this is likens consultancy 101 try
not to sink costs it's the obvious like
solution to this but it's really hard I
find that you dilute it's quite useful
like Adrian Cockroft talks about this a
lot it's about sort of it's another form
of plan-do-check-act
build measure learn it's about realizing
where you are what your options are and
then feeding back when you take an
option in that kind of thing it comes
from John Boyd who's a u.s. fighter
pilot actually and he's done some
amazing work on this kind of notion in
terms it wasn't originally designed to
and how to disrupt fighter pilots
thinking process in the sky so he say
you get into the enemies you dilute and
you're faster than you you know even if
you haven't got the best plane you may
still win the dogfight to that kind of
thing it's a fantastic read about how he
came up with it John Boyd is Colonel
John Boyd frame person an agent
Cockcroft talks about you to loop quite
a lot on me I started reading more bad
air and I said ah yes that's how
feedback systems work really quite
interesting Rick respecting regularly is
really good agile a lot of us retrospect
yeah you know we do our beauty
retrospectives to meet you
bi-weekly retrospectives I'm gonna say
random now ready but nine times at 10
organizations I walk into and I see and
I say can I sit in on a retrospective
and they go around the room and they go
so how was your week
what how's your week all around the room
yeah it was like you know I've initially
become one company like we saw that it
was almost at fist fights between
developers yeah that crazy stuff go heat
my passion but it was a bit like too
much that's all and then we went a
retrospective in it's like so I was
thinking this is gonna be a juicy
retrospective yeah and they're like go
now yeah I think we need up great
Jenkins looks like Jenkins is not your
problem dude like you need punched him
in the face you got to be honest yeah
like deal with the real issues it's hard
like a particular you know a lot of us
like don't like Dino to dive dive into
our motions at work and stuff and yeah
there's a boundary there somewhere but
you've got to think about your stuff
yeah we're all human bottom line do you
make the right choice retrospect on that
when was the last responsible moment and
the last responsible moment is the
moment where if you do not make a
decision one is implicitly made for you
yeah so if you can find this last
responsible moment which comes from the
lean software journalist stuff it's
really powerful it's like just you know
JIT like just in time compilation type
stuff you make the decision
just in time you've got as much
information as you can you make decision
that's something to aspire to it's very
hard I'm not gonna lie on that one and
you need to do lots of learning needs to
be a cultural thing as well think about
how we can get better as a team
if you have just punched your colleague
in the face they're pouring against
therapy you might be a better book that
kind of thing yeah you don't just ignore
this kind of stuff it's really we've got
it as a team is inherently collaborative
software development in degree is
inherently collaborative gotta work
through the issues be they technical be
they social be their cultural yeah think
this is final so you're anchoring bus so
we have a common tendency to rely too
heavily on the first piece of
information offered when making
decisions this is classic you've been an
auction and someone goes skiing at
$2,000 you're kind of anchored on that
mm you might think that products only
worth a thousand but because someone's
anchored you on to you go all one 1,500
they go 1,000 750 that kind of thing we
get anchored on figures and but for me
what I see lies how does your manager
asked for estimates yeah
is it an unbiased question or is it more
like this yes this application will be
ready in two weeks right anchoring you
on the two weeks yeah see it all too
often and then developers the new
developers are I've been there you'll
reluctant to fight back yeah well my
managers is it two weeks you probably
knows better than I do or if I don't say
yes I might get fired kind of thing
you've got to learn to say no but do it
profession
don't just say no way that's gonna get
you fired probably not good provide
explanations and alternatives is a key
thing it's about learning how to you I
call upward what many people call
upwards they manage got owner be
realistic when I started saying no and
explaining things in my career I've got
a lot more respect than people didn't
dump stuff on me quite much which is
kind of cool it's about making sure it
so the goals and the stories are well
defined and it comes back that
collaboration and that feedback thing
regulates really really important if you
absolutely must do estimates there's
something called the pert technique it's
also called the try point estimate
technique Uncle Bob talks about a lot
with big Uncle Bob fan and it's
basically you say the best case the
nominal case and the worst case and you
can some kind of statistical variance if
you know if you're adding things
together compounding them if you just
give one estimate it's very hard to know
the variation yeah well if you do this
try point estimate you get some notion
of like best cases like this worst case
schemes like this we think the normal
case like this I find it quite useful
and to be honest though getting more and
more into this no estimates thing it's
quite a new thing I think I don't know
it was like in the stage so I think it's
pretty popular in the agile community
anyway and I've only been exposed at
recently it's quite cool and and it's
saying that like what is the value of
estimating if you if you create your
stories correctly you know what most
what but one point forty points 100
points like what does that really mean
and I definitely better part I've
definitely been now I'm like haha looks
complex is it a 40s at 100 I don't know
and my four to your hundred is gonna
clearly be different than each one of
your 1400s yeah it's kind of crazy when
you think about it and I'm sure many of
you that I've done this kind of like
they're planning cards money with
playing cards like stuff well then no
estimates planning cards are much
simpler it's one two flippin big and no
flipping clue
I like any kind of it's not perfect in
some places we're still have to estimate
but fundamentally like and is an
argument what's our the really trivial
stuff and things it's a whole bunch
stuff you can pull it apart and now I'm
not the person to argue this cuz I've
sort of adopted it from someone else
woody and a few other people on Twitter
are happy to debate you all these things
and they've written some amazing blog
posts I put a link actually on the
bottom there Ron Jeffries actually
talked about it to give you more I'm
just gonna introducing this today I'm
not gonna you know preach about it but I
think it's really interesting I've seen
a couple of talks one at software circus
over in Amsterdam where they were giving
him some statistical supposedly
statistical proof of how they've done
two projects very similar and there was
really no difference in the ultimate
kind of delivery time but the estimates
were wildly different using this
technique it forced the developers to
break things down more appropriately and
all this kind of thing so just putting
it out there I think is interesting yeah
so finally reading your way to tech
leadership and I think like an I
mentioned at the start we're all tech
leaders to some degree yeah wherever you
are in the organization within your jug
just you know in life in general you're
all leaders so at some point yet you can
all inspire other people and for me it's
like developing those skills like tech
skills or one thing's inspirational
skills like leadership skills some of
its may be innate like people some
people say it's innate but I think you
can learn heck of a lot yeah you know
definitely people where is a classic
book by Tim mister and the guys and I'm
really kind of John Maxwell I'm not sure
like John Mac sauce in the States as a
u.s. pasta and like he's written like
hundreds of books an epic author and and
but his books are for me are amazing
they're kind of you know some of them
are like he talks about his work as a
pastor but it's not preachy or any mean
and somebody's like the way he writes as
for me as a development architect like I
he braced with a three-year
compartmentalize very kind of feel
cohesive his writing and I just get it
and I find that book so useful I like
them more more leadership through teams
through companies and all this stuff
Crucial Conversations as a consultant
that is my go-to book yeah so a crucial
conversation is one where you know the
stakes have been raised you have them
all the time yeah
with your space again you know with your
team lead with your CEO whatever there's
a time when you're having a conversation
and suddenly the hair like something
shoots up and back your neck or you
still might open this is a hard
conversation as I can saw when I get
that a lot you know initially it's all
friendly friendly I'll start making
recommendations and people suddenly
don't like
and it's fair that's how it should be it
should be pushed back but I've learned a
lot I've learned when to recognize a
conversation has turned crucial so you
behave differently I'm fortunate laughs
and a few people's faces so I thought
they were being silly and they weren't
and that's embarrassing and I happen to
see other day actually lie so it's well
there's things you don't always read the
situation right but luckily it was
managed to save that situation this book
is just a really valuable book for
detecting when conversations are going
crucial and how to deal with those as
well
management like management and
leadership are different in my mind
management is kind of like and making
sure the right thing is as amazing
making sure the thing is done right and
leadership is doing the right thing but
management is but those two books there
are techie inspired like Jurgen is
really cool guy and the pragmatic
programmers are always a good books they
can be some tips on how to manage
projects and people again leadership
whole different thing yeah but they give
you some foundations on which to build
upon and the Safa craftsman big fan of
Sandro over in London Sandra Mancuso
he's kind of like our uncle Bob a super
cool guy great book and he talks about
his journey as a craftsman both my
social cultural and technical point of
view and it's really good if you aspire
to be a tech lead an architect or
whatever these skills that the empathy
again and all this kind of good stuff on
my mind essential so let's wrap this up
so I put this slide in recently actually
this next slide coming up I've been
ragging on system one a lot I'm saying
to you system to think engage all this
good stuff but a system one is seriously
awesome we would not be here today in
this room and less system one existed
yeah it kept us safe from the Tigers it
provides certain drives that we clearly
need as a species to survive I find it
very valuable in certain situations and
the gut feel ticking around dealing with
people I mention that crucial
conversation thing now I listen to my
gut heck of a lot more with people if I
saw that funny if I don't take on
something that's sick and so on I go to
a company I get introduced to Bob and I
hate mommy and I get kind of a funny
feeling I don't instantly label Bob as a
troublemaker but I make mental notes
yeah I'm like cool people were acting
different around Bob I've got a funny
feeling there I learned to trust my at
least register and trust my instincts
yeah and again when things are going
wrong you like in one of those three
a.m. crisis things system one is really
useful but system one relies on
expertise yeah
you can only automate and the brain is
incredible but like some of the
solutions like I've seen my colleagues
and friends come up with under pressure
are amazing but the reason they've come
up with those solutions is because
they've been exposed to so many things
over the years they can recognize
patterns they can bring solutions to
their mind this kind of thing system one
from a technical point of view is not so
good when you're new to an area if
you're new to ops new to go programming
I find it really hard I'm not gonna go
by any means so I don't recognize when
things are going wrong and go sometimes
where's Java I get that gut feel all I
need to do a stat trace anything you
know what I mean like system one is
seriously awesome but it does need to be
primed with experience and deliberate
learning may call it Kathy Sierra I
mentioned a minute deliberate learning
is really key are the reason I'm some
talk - I see too much system 190 I see
too much kind of like you know gut feel
and oh we'll just use docker because
it's cool type thing and again docker
love it but it's not shouldn't be pulled
off the rack and I think if you're
looking for it more lighthearted read @y
system one is awesome a blink ready to
get on the flight over to the San Felice
ago actually blink is an awesome book
Malcolm Gladwell is an amazing author
and he talks about and why you should
trust your gut basically a lot of things
and it's just a fantastic read yes it's
all anecdotal but there's some really
good evidence I can relate to in terms
of yes there are certain situations
particularly I find with people and with
things I'm an expert about well I do
trust my gut a lot more than I do system
- initially and then I'll use system to
to kind of you know hopefully backup or
or if you do what I've thought nudge is
also really cool merge talks about using
subtle system one hints like I did my
little joke at the start about tricking
you guys like nudge gives you subtle
hints on how to nudge people for good or
for evil heads up here use your
superpowers for good and that is a
really good book for like nudging people
in the right direction to do things key
topic hope you the talk you protect
you've taken away is empathy we all make
mistakes yeah we are not logical I don't
generally guess like Spock should be
there
yeah and data I'm quite a Star Trek geek
so and we are not logical you know that
we are at times sometimes we're not yeah
we are not robots we're not a Thomas a
year so respect that respect then
yourself respect that and other people
yeah we're all sort of beautifully
flawed as I've had people say which I
think makes a lot of sense yeah we don't
always make complete logical sense we
tend to work better in groups we are
social animals yeah and I see this like
an IT so much more pair programming more
programming three amigos all that great
stuff is really
valuable you know use your team to kind
of prop up your weaknesses and vice
versa that kind of thing
build a toolbox I said this in my other
talks today like weeds are docker and
stuff in micro services but building the
toolbox so I'm building sort of patterns
to recommend some things going wrong and
what things you can do to apply to make
them right is really valuable and that's
something as a consultant I guess I I do
quite a lot because I get to see same
scenarios over and over again so I get
to kind of build this toolbox and then
apply you know by the actual solutions
it's really valuable bare those things
in mind yeah also fundamental is have a
little empathy mention this before yeah
I love this quote so brutal they're so
true yeah you know you have to empathy
for your pet a human being yet
so final bit of talk and I put a lot of
books F obviously yeah I love I love
reading I thought over the last couple
years I've had a real long commute I
primarily work in the UK but quite long
commute and Charlie tremendous Jones the
motivational speaker over in the US here
and he says you'll be the same person in
five years as you are today except for
the people you meet and the books you
read obviously that's a bit nuanced that
fundamentally I like it yeah it makes
sense this is why I come to awesome
conferences to meet awesome people and
I'm sure many of you have made that
choice already I'd like to see more
people reading books yeah I think you
know we're moving away from it as an
industry but I think fundamentals art
and fighting important for me these are
four books that really influenced my IT
career and Thinking Fast and Slow
obvious one I've ripped off of the talk
kind of thing a passionate programmer by
Chad Fowler was an amazing book it talks
about how to develop your career I read
that like when it was published like
quite four years ago and I was sort of
changing my career at the time from an
academic to being a IT person and it's
just a really cool book forgiving me
tools and stuff like on how to you know
shake my career see it Kathy Sierra is
awesome like I love Kathy iris that
she's in quite late but she's finally
come out with bad ass that's quite a new
one it's more about UX and stuff but
it's about deliberate learning which I
think we can all really benefit from so
Kathy Sierra is like any of the
catalysts cierra stuff is generally good
she's also behind the head first books
I'm sure many of you would've known the
head first books and and to me the
pragmatic books in particular this one
is a little
Jen and not many people know that and
pragmatic thinking learning refactor
your wetware and that book I've not done
this this is in the book itself and
talks about how it's gained experience
better how to manage focus how to travel
from a novice to an expert and debugging
your mind well it's a really good book
but it's a pragmatic book so it's M very
much treatment of pragmatic programmer
book so it's very much written from a
programmers mentality Andy hunt is it
nobody good developer so I found this
really useful for thinking more about
their thinking because I've gone through
my career I realized technology comes
and goes the people and the
methodologies and stuff like they're
they're the foundational stuff so yeah
definitely that that books are highly
recommended so to properly put the cap
on it summary it's apply process and
models as appropriate or is that caveat
as appropriate listen system one is
there for a good reason
but engage system to more often I think
yeah collaborate more and better
software is inherently collaborative be
it from the design beer from the build
beer from the test and definitely the
operations we are seeing these movements
spring up agile lean DevOps all for good
reasons all about collaboration learn do
retrospect repeat is that so build
measure learn scientific kind of
feedback besides with method feedback
loop and for me I thought the reason I
do these talks is it really forces me to
think about the concepts I'm talking
about and I like I like writing a lot so
I don't write for him folk you and stuff
and in order to write I'll teach about
something you have to really understand
it so I and then you get awesome
feedback from people like yourself as
well this talk about based on over a
year now started in Jay focus in Sweden
and the talk has evolved so much over
the year from a great feedback have you
heard of that book have you read this
blog post have you heard of this method
of pathology and it's just awesome yes
that continual cycle of getting better
that identifying stuff to learn learning
it sharing it with your community with
your friends you know and the bigger
community as well bottom line is think
more deliberately think about thinking
don't just fall into and habits have
it's a really powerful at the right time
but ask any smoker
habits are also really destructive as
well so think about thinking on that
