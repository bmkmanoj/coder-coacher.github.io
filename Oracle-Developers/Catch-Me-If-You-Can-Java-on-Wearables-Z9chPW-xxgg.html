so it's a Angela and myself working for
oracle as a job evangelist and we will
tell you about some experience as we
wait with java on on wearable devices
and as you can see we both wear
something wearable well first of all i
have to say you won't see a lot of java
code or something in it because running
java on that device it's very easy it
was not worth putting code in there it's
so easy to to understand i have a few
slides with code but most of the stuff
is related to hardware and how to
assemble all that and find the right way
to do it so but because we are working
for oracle we have to show you this nice
slide so i'll give you some time to read
it and yeah i think it's time enough
you're ready right so where are words
what is it all about this is a little
definition I found it's a miniature
electronic device which is usually one
under with on top of clothing and it
needs more computational support than
hardware logic right so that means you
know all that watches that you can find
on other things and some examples are
for example ear plugs that are smart or
glasses you know the glasses right then
watches clothing in general and insoles
for shoes to be honest that looks really
professional compared to the stuff that
we did but we tried our best to make it
really wearable so and there are many
more things you can find come on so if
you build a wearable of your if we are
talking about where we're wearable you
need some meat some requirements that is
first of all form factor it should be
small you don't want to wear some Sun
like the first laptops right like yeah
it's variable but it's not really a
wearable then it should be smart power
management
and connectivity is one big point in the
whole story and there is something like
lifeproof I will explain these points in
a minute so that you will see what it
means form factor is the easiest one
right its small size and lightweight
right this is the most important thing
and yeah my approach it works it's I
have it in this hole so that i'm wearing
it's the whole system here's my mobile
phone and i use the mobile phone for the
connection and here's the rest but i
will explain it what it is a smart power
management means you need low power
consumption right so this is the most
important thing at all because it should
run on batteries so then it should be
good if you have some kind of a sleep
mode strategy means if you don't do
something just really don't do something
and don't use the battery and something
some simple things like auto shutdown
mode you really have to think about that
if you don't use it it should really
shut itself down which is not not
forgiven if you build something by
yourself then it needs a rechargeable or
replaceable battery and it should be
something that really can support the
the device with power for some hours
that would be great then connectivity is
need the next point you can connect
connected by a cables sure but we won't
like to do that then we have Bluetooth
and plus zigbee z-wave there are other
protocols that you can use or
technologies then there's pure Wi-Fi the
stuff that you need from home and you
can use cellular sure use your mobile
phone or something or technology like
this to connect to the internet this is
if you would like to be connected there
are also devices that track the data and
then you can just plug plug it in your
pc and then you can see what happens
what your it was recorded but our
approach was a little bit different so i
would like to be online and at this
point I really don't cover that point
but with my wearable but it should be
waterproof that would be great drop
proof sure you if it drops on the
found it shouldn't break dustproof and
it should be sweat proof right if you
use it for sports then make sure that
because sweat it it's salty and that
means it's very aggressive to the
material so all these points are very
important if you work with variables and
if you buy a cheap one and I did that
and I put it in the gym and after two
weeks it looked very ugly so because of
the sweat so that's really that's
important that you take that you keep
that in mind so this is all the standard
stuff what is if you would like to do
something special because I had
something on my mind that is not
available today and you will find
different kind of variables right you
will find for example the google wear or
whatever it is other other stuff like
Apple watch and so on but the problem is
all these things are not connected to
each other they use their own protocols
and their own way to communicate and I
had some ideas and I couldn't do
anything with the with the stuff that is
available in the store so I decided do
it yourself right so that was the
beginning of the whole thing and the
idea that I got was Jai Radha yeah so
that was an idea originally from last
year when I talked to some guys and also
to Angela we had the same idea so the
idea is to track someone that is running
somewhere and it will collect data and
you can live track it that was the main
idea and the things that it should do
was it should read the GPS data like
latitude longitude altitude and other
values like speed and bearing then heart
rate of course temperature pressure
acceleration accelerometer data all that
stuff it should read then my idea was
and that's maybe a little bit special
but you see I have earplugs here my idea
was I would like to be able to contact
the runner somehow so my device will
speak to me and it uses text to speech
that means i can send from my computer i
can send a message wherever the runner
is and then
the computer that I where we'll talk to
me and tell me the message translated
from the message itself to speech and
that is something that is not available
on Adam variable I found so then i use
MQTT to publish the data and then i can
subscribe with whatever i like to do
that and i have also a vibration motor
in here so that I get some haptic
feedback so for example if the message
arrives it big it begins to buzz and
then it says incoming message and then
it reads the message so that i know
because outside it might be a little bit
noisy so then I feel something's coming
in and yeah and I need a power switch I
have it here so I can switch it on and
it will shut down automatically so that
is also something that was really needed
and at least it can monitor its battery
state which is important because if I
wear it I have no idea what is about the
battery is it still filled up or is it
empty and if it got to empty it should
shut down itself all these things you
have to keep in mind when you build
something like that so the platform that
I use is a raspberry pi what else but I
built two different versions and we come
to that in a minute so the Raspberry Pi
uses in my case oracle java SE 8
embedded who is that somebody uses the
pie with java just a few come on you
should use it it's fun it's really great
so I'm to track the location i use for
for sure gps sensor and i found this
very nice device it's a enough spark and
this one does not only do gps it also
has a temperature sensor invert it has a
pressure sensor it has an accelerometer
and it's really small and it's around 50
bucks so you can order it from taiwan
and yeah that that is the the thing i
use for for gps and it has update rates
up to 50 hertz so that's really a nice
fast device and it's more so I hooked it
up to the pie and you know this thingy
here pi for j who knows pie for j so if
you use java with the pie
you have to use this to connect to the
hardware right so this is for example
how I connect to the serial port because
Papa J also can hook up to the serial
port and you just say serial open then
the default comport and about rate and
then you just add a listener and it
because it's just strings that coming in
from the GPS sensor I really have just
to pass the street and then so put the
data out of it so that's what I do right
so that's very very simple and it
supports the the standards like GGA vtg
STI is a very special one that's the one
that contains the data like
accelerometer temperature and so on it's
a special for that device that's not a
gps standard protocol the SDS STI
sentence so for the heart rate if you
take a look on the web you will find
different sensors that are available and
I decided to go with this one it's from
polar and there is another one that
Simon users which is in the computer
that calculates the heartbeat the heart
rate right so in this one just gives you
a pilot's for each beat so you have to
calculate it by yourself that's not that
accurate but this is really small it's
really just a very tiny board and that
you have just connected to a GPIO pin
and then it just gets on high every
pilots it gets so very easy to use that
one ok to access that is this is now 5 4
j code again it's very easy you have
something like a GPIO factory you get
the instance of that and then I just you
hook up this digital input pin you tell
it what pin it is it has a pulldown
resistance and then i have some special
class which is a heart rate monitor and
this class then calculates the heartbeat
and i found some formulas on the web
where I just with every beat I call this
method and then I think I averaged over
10 10 values or something so it's
accurate enough so it's not as good as
the the other polar thing which does it
in hardware but it works alright so I
can get my heartbeat from the from the
software back into my whatever I use
then I would
you well this is the really big problem
when building a wearable that should be
connected to the internet its
connectivity that because connectivity
means it that that is really heavy
lifting right so whoever that somebody
played around with the wearable or try
to build one yeah so this is really the
hard part that was the hardest part for
me not to get it running but battery
life in combination with Internet
connectivity that's the hard part all
right so for me that was really the
stuff that takes the most effort so the
harbor that I tested was first of all
this one it is it's a USB 3g stick and
the advantages it has high data rate so
it's really fast so that's that's good
and it can automatically connect to the
internet as soon as it gets power so
that was also nice the drawback was that
it was really tricky to set it up on the
pie so it took nearly a week to get it
really running reliable and because I
started not with the modern model B plus
that I'd showed but I started with the
older ones and there you don't get
enough power from the USB port so you
need some y cable but the really big
battery and so that was really tricky to
set it up so the power consumption is
quite high of this device and yeah you
need a really big battery so with this
device I had the best battery of 13,000
milliamps and it was three hours and the
thing was empty so that that's really a
lot right so and the batteries like that
size and really heavy so that was not
the really good approach and the form
factor it sticks out of the pie like
that lang so that's not really usable so
the next thing that I used was the other
fruit phone which is a complete
telephone just without the keyboard
microphone and the speakers and all that
but that's smaller and yeah it's a full
mobile phone so you could even maybe do
phone calls but that would be possible
it's very flexible because it you can
hook it up to the pie and then you can
send SMS messages or whatever you like
the problem is the power consumption is
again a little bit high and it hasn't
come
with additional battery so you have a
extra battery just for that board and
that was form factors was not so good so
I needed also an additional battery to
power the pie then so in the end that
was also not the way that I choose to go
with so the next one and that that's a
really interesting device who knows that
that's a portable 3g hotspot and the
good thing is it has also an inbuilt
power pack of five thousand two hundred
milliamps so that's really nice and in
combination with a very small Wi-Fi
stick on the pie you have your own Wi-Fi
network and this thing is connected to
the internet using LTE for example so
that's really nice and you can power the
pie from that thing that means the only
thing you need is that device a cable to
the pie and then you have a wearable
device that's it's quite nice so it has
high data rate and it can automatically
connect to the internet no problem at
all the pie can be used can use the
power bank so you can power the pie from
that device and the heavy lifting is
done by the ride this device so
connecting to the internet right you
don't have to do it on the pie itself
the problem is the form factor but it
might not be really a problem so this is
that's the thing that's all right that's
okay it's a battery and it's the
connectivity thing that we need do you
need right so that's that's okay it runs
the pie for around four to five hour to
hour so it depends it depends also on
how often do you use the network how's
the network connectivity and so on and
the power consumption is around that
this is for Wi-Fi light this is the
power consumption for Wi-Fi plus the six
hundred or more milliamp that the pie
really drains from the from the battery
so that was fine but then the next thing
I tried out was this combination I just
used my phone with bluetooth tethering
and then use just on pi a Bluetooth
stick because the phones are made for
Internet connectivity these days
have powerful batteries so they can be
on the web quite long and then the
drawback would be that I need an
additional battery to power the part
right that's the only thing that I need
them but we come to that point in a
minute so I have a fast connection it's
reliable it can connect to the network
automatically it has 3g or LTE whatever
phone you use and the power consumption
is ok this is the Bluetooth connection
right which is really a Bluetooth Low
Energy that means it's 16 millions maybe
this is what the Bluetooth connection
takes for the for the pie and the heavy
lifting going to the Internet is done by
the by the phone so drawback is the pie
meets somehow power some are you have to
power the pie and this is not so easy
like it sounds because the pie has no
charge circuit on the pie itself and you
can't really don't easily connect a
leech and polymeric a battery for
example to the part that's not possible
without additional circuits so given
this different things I test it now we
come to the communication part which i
use MQTT to communicate the data from my
device to the internet who knows what it
is MQTT ok who heard of it ok well
that's enough so it's let me tell you
it's a nice protocol because it's binary
it's very small it's lightweight it was
built for this kind of devices there are
also other protocols that you can use
but I went with this one and there's a
the Eclipse paho project which is open
source and free and you can use it
easily with Java that's really nice so
and the whole thing is published and
subscribe and this is a perfect kind of
working with wearables because the
wearer will just publish the data to a
broker and then whatever I would like to
subscribe to that topics can do whatever
likes with the data right so I can hook
up many many clients that listen to this
device and that makes it a perfect
choice for for this kind of
wearables so that's the way it works so
this is the device that i wear with me
and it publishes for example something
to this topic J runner and then the
client can subscribe to that topic and
to talk to this device I used the same
approach so it means the client can
simply send a message where the this
device is listening for and then it can
I can interact with it right so that
that makes it very easy and that's how
it then in the end works in my setup so
that means I have the Raspberry Pi that
uses Bluetooth going to the phone and
then use the cellular cellular
connection from the phone to use an MQTT
publish message to my broker and as a
broker I use again an embedded device
which is oldroyd you three running more
schedule and then on the other hand I
can hook up a desktop another mobile
phone a smart watch and my database at
home all these are collecting the data
subscribing to that channel so and you
see out so i hook up a MongoDB that
collects all the data so that means Matt
my pie that aware with me doesn't have
to store all the data it just published
the stuff and then the database listen
to it and store it so that's the idea
and then i can analyze it later on i can
also analyze it live with another tool
so this is no problem and now we come to
the really interesting part it's the
hardware itself so the first version
that i built was this one that's a
raspberry pi model b plus and i use this
slice of pie board hooked up the GPS
sensor and here you see the heart rate
sensor so the whole thing was smaller
than I thought I could be and then I put
it in this case which is also very thin
so that everything was fine and I use
the Wi-Fi stick here and you know the
the Raspberry Pi the b+ has a better or
less cause power consumption than a
model be so that was the reason why I
choose that and in the beginning I
thought I need more USB ports but in the
end I just needed one but the good thing
is the USB port is quite stable on the
b+ so you can pull out the Wi-Fi stick
bluetooth stick and it doesn't reboot
like the old version so that's the good
thing about it the bad thing is the form
factor it's a little bit clunky so it
fits in here but it looked like 30 so
that was not really nice yeah the
problem that I face then was a power
supply how should I power that thing
right and the solution I told you
already is this this thing here's the
data of it so that's really a really
nice device so and in like I said it can
you can use it as a Wi-Fi hotspot and
charge the pipe from it at the same time
and I made test and it runs for four to
five hours and that was really nice the
drawback is the pie has no idea when the
battery is empty so you really have to
take care about that otherwise suddenly
it's empty and then shut down the pie
and then your SD card get wrong and all
its that's a mess so that was it works
but it's not really the best choice ok
so that was version 1 very nice I made
some tested it and it worked in March
somewhere so that was ok then I decided
yeah i expanded already so it's Wi-Fi
it's really the big problem right the
Wi-Fi it drains the battery like hell
and that was okay but not really that
the stuff I need so then the next thing
I came up with was this one that's the
B+ and that's the old or w who knows
that board that's a pie the same thing
just smaller and unfortunately it's not
available anymore but it was for a month
or something like that and i order two
of them but you see the the difference
in size and it has no headers when it
comes it has no headers on top so you
can decide what you would like to put on
it and the only thing i put on was this
header and the USB for the bluetooth
stick so that makes it very small and it
comes with additional features like it
has a circuit that charges lychee and
polymer battery and it has a connector
for
battery and has a connector for
real-time clock it has a real time clock
on board and it has an ADC a 12-bit ADC
converter so that is a really nice
device and it like i said it's
everything fits in this thing here i
have a photo of that so you might be
able to get some because they they
created one charge and said if this is
gone we can't produce it anymore because
broadcom won't deliver the soc anymore
to them so this is a little bit of a
drawback but the bot is it's awesome and
that's my whole setup so you see
everything fits in this it's a little
box I have it here because it's running
at the moment and I'd use the same bored
and just put it on the pie or on the old
droid and here's the battery here's the
real time clock battery i also have a
vibration motor in there it's on that
position it's not on the photo and it's
7 by 4 centimeters the box 7 by 4 by 3
so it it's not really as small as a
Apple watch right and it looks not that
good but it's small and you can wear it
so it's okay let me see and I combine it
with the phone and you see also created
a little app so that I can remote
control it and the advantage is sure
because i use bluetooth low energy for
the connection with the battery that i
use i can run it for seven hours from
from battery so that that's really
something that is usable right and to
monitor that i created a little desktop
app and let me see if it works because
it might be better to show it life than
just the screen shot but may fail yeah
maybe first i show you the features you
see here what i did was it can track the
location where you are then you see
burying this is it should be if you
press that button it will show you on
the map where you are at the moment then
i can send a message so if i press that
button over there text field will open i
can type something and then it will
translate that send it to the pie and
then i have text to speech man it will
talk to me
then I can record tracks and I can mark
points of interest so for example i can
run here someone in Germany can then see
where I'm running and say oh that's an
interesting spot and market in the day
and then what it does is it just saves
the points in the database all right so
that's all then I have the scaling here
this is a vet view in javafx and I use
openstreetmap then it shows the heart
rate with an indication the color shows
if it's hide and thread if it's low then
it's blue something like that I see the
height the speed distance temperature
pressure and this is the battery state
that I monito because the old road w is
able to monitor the state of the battery
so i can get the state so i know okay
better is going down so it can react to
that i get weather information for that
location that means for example if you
are running somewhere and you can see on
the desktop web oh the runner is getting
into bad weather i can send them a
message you know bad weather ahead or
something like that and then on top we
see have a calendar pika where i can a
date picker where i can see and i can
show to you they recorded dates so i can
select some and then show it on the map
the tracks and have a chart for this is
for attitude and for a heartbeat and
this is just to indicate if we have a
connection to the internet or not and
then on this side you see this little
icon that's another feature that are
built in it's a who knows own tracks
yeah that's a really really nice tool
and if you don't know it it's free it
uses MQTT and you can get it for android
and wireless and it's something like
Google Latitude was but you can decide
because you can set up your own broker
and then it you have your own google
attitude you can track your own
locations or with friends I don't know
and my idea was that is assume you have
a runner running around on a marathon or
something and you have teammates that
stand at different positions during the
track along the track then they can hook
up this own tracks and say I'm here and
then it will show up on the map and as
soon as the runner comes close to this
other guy the runner will get a message
that someone's coming maybe 500 meters
direction north something like that it
will tell you so that was the idea right
and then and the the guy it uses this
device on this iphone or whatever he
gets also push notification when it's
been a runner as close then every 100
meters it he gets a notification okay
the runners coming from that direction
so that this it was a toy but it works
quite well so let me show you I hope it
still works because I made some tests
the original idea was have someone
running around in San Francisco during
this session but yeah the problem was I
made some distance on Sunday and with
all these high buildings I don't get a
really reliable GPS signal here and I
never tested that he is so that was my
my problem and because we are in here
you see we don't have really a location
at the moment but you see my heart rate
is in the lower left corner if it will
be updated so i hope so and then you can
see here that would be sending a message
i can type that and that i will get the
message in my ear it's gone okay that
connection is gone you see it just lost
the connection aw damn it yeah that
happened it's because of the internet
connection but i can show you because i
have this one i have recorded one in in
germany so here is one track that i
recorded and unfortunately it doesn't
really fit online I didn't know that the
resolution is so bad on these screens so
the app is bigger than the screen but
you see I can mark even with the device
I can mark spots points of interest and
then if I go to this point they will
show me okay that was on the twenty
eighth of august and was around eight
o'clock and you see the track and the
track will be colored with my heart rate
dependent on the heart rate so that
means i can see if it's going red then
the heart rate was increasing and it's
blue then it's going down again and if i
click on the track wherever i click it
will show me at that position the beats
per minute and the height because this
is a relation
shipwright so this is something that i
found was quite quite useful and on the
other side I think we won't get better
information here here you see because we
are not but I have the graph I record
the altitude and the and the heartbeat
so this was a three hour ride that I did
in my car so it was just to check if it
works yeah you know Jay driver was
originally well it was just to see how
long will the battery lasts so and in
the beginning when it picks up the
signal takes some time until it picks it
really that the GPS signal the next step
would be to add on a battery to the GPS
sensor that it stores the location it
can do that but it was an additional
thing I have to put into this tiny box
and even the vibration motor tooks me
one and a half hour to take it apart and
then put it somewhere and put it back in
so yeah but the battery would make this
better because it stores the last
location and the next time the GPS will
be switched on and it will try to figure
out the satellites at the last location
okay so this is my desktop app so we are
good in time ok perfect so that's the
desktop app and of course I have more
see here we go i also created mobile
apps because it kind of measurement i
start i can switch it on but i would
like to see okay what's my current heart
rate or where I am right stuff like that
so I created for example for a
SmartWatch like this one it runs Android
so I created a javafx app that you can
see here it shows the heart rate it
shows the battery state it shows the
indicator if the heart rate is too high
or low enough the distance and the
duration of the rom and if it will also
be able to load a static map so this is
not really an dynamic map so you can say
at this location if you press that
button there and it will show you the
map and you have an idea where you are
just to make sure
and it shows you the coordinates and
then if you swipe with a finger you will
get this menu where you can either mark
a spot that will just send the message
this spot is of interest just stored in
the database you can start recording a
track or reset the track or then this is
something which is I called an alert
message so if for example you have an
accident somewhere you can press that
one and every connected device or the or
the other devices that I hooked up will
get this message oh there the runner has
a problem at that position right so I
created that also for the iOS four for
the iphone off on an other Android phone
so I can use whatever device have with
me and it works in parallel so I can use
my phone for the connection and I coos
can also use the the app and parallel to
check my heart rate mark spots or
whatever it is so yes and on this watch
the same thing and it's the same code
running on all these devices so the iOS
app is the same exactly same code I
compile it from the same code base as
the Android version for the galaxy what
i use and also for the watch alright so
it's not three projects it's one project
just say compile it for the watch
compile it for the iphone compile it for
the galaxy so that means my setup looks
like this the one thing that i didn't
mention is this one that's a little
audio amplifier because if you use the
PI that's okay but do droid you have it
doesn't have an audio out so i have to
hook it up to the pins directly and then
you only get the plane signal so that
means you really have to amplify it a
bit and I have a little it's it's in
here it's a little amplifier and then it
you can adjust the volume to make it
louder or not so that that's that's
quite useful that's the one with the
Wi-Fi and the other is this one so yeah
so it's possible to build that kind of
thing and I'm also tried running with
this and it's okay so it's really not
heavy and that is my approach and now
Angela left the room I don't know why
because now it's
to her but the future improvements are i
ordered this board which is a really
nice one it's called wap board it has
the I'm x6 processor with 1 gigahertz it
has a Wi-Fi on onboard it has bluetooth
low energy on board it has an
accelerometer magnetometer and you see
it's really tiny right so unfortunately
it didn't make it on time because they
said they will deliver it I don't know
start delivering August 25 but didn't
really work out so I don't have the
board right now but this will be the
next step and yeah so it will be I will
continue to build the next version which
should be even smaller than this one but
now I have to yeah I don't know she left
the room what happened so i'm done with
myself let me see if i have something to
yeah well one other thing it's not on
the slide yet but which I would like to
use Java ME eight embedded in the future
which I'm not sure it will run on the on
imx6 but you know that's the idea
because this is even smaller on the pie
it's powerful enough you know and you
have enough memory the CPU in principle
is much too powerful for that kind of
things 700 megahertz to just collect the
heartbeat and the location is it's a lot
but you know with this kind of thing you
can do this text to speech translation
and i bought a voice to do that so it
sits on my on my macbook i have a copy
of that but this is not connected to the
audio out it's a really high quality
voice its twenty nine euros or something
from the company's cepstral and there
you can buy a voice that is really
professional recorded for a text to
speech translation so that's what I use
so it's really good you can type
something and you can really understand
it because the open source stuff that is
available it doesn't really work
especially if you are outside then it's
so noisy but this voice is really nice
so here you are again I introduced you
already it's your partner yes let me
just give us two seconds we can switch
right
three it's this one is it all ok
everybody is it on yes so thank you so
much for coming today again my name is
Angelica said oh and I wanted to take it
a little bit on a different direction so
we both have the idea of wearable but
yeah communication sensors it's all good
but how do I interact with my wearable
how do I interact with my application
and that's what I come to the idea to
make my own wearable so I'm connected
with full of wires and everything have
my detail audio and everything's I'm
going to talk a little bit about the
experience of building my own wearable
again I do not have a single line of
code because it's it's so simple I mean
the code if I want to talk about it is
LEDs so yes go to a GPIO turn it on turn
it off what's the big deal so the
pulling things together is what really
took most of the time and I have to
admit my husband was all the time you
still swing it is still so when are you
going to do programa de easy part that's
a seaport so most of the time I was just
putting the pieces together so the idea
was to have a jacket and the jacket so
we have a heart rate monitor but I want
to see it I want to see my heart
blinking and I don't know later on
Garrett can actually help us to lower a
little bit d'lai so we can see my heart
linking I don't know if we can see it
from the back is too bright so we will
lower the lights a little bit at the end
a pedometer so as I walk you know how
you will have the wristbands and if
actually tell you the activity during
the day I actually have a funny story
about those because I've been trying to
exercise and all that and yeah you see
them going up and up
nap a nap but when I burn more calories
with folding clothes because in my
wristband so I'm doing this the whole
time so it went up I'm like okay I'm not
really exercising so anyway so for for
really measuring the activity during the
day what I wonder was like what if I
have a pedometer what if I have
something in my shoe that tell me how
many steps i'm doing and i have like a
goal of how many steps i did i do a day
and then this graph is going to show me
how I'm doing toward that goal okay gps
so we know we have gps our connectivity
with the gps is so it's simple we have
previous session that use gps if you
want to have a look at the code i just
wanted to show you for this particular
presentation the gps i actually turn it
off the only reason for that was
probably wouldn't work indoors and
second i run out of pins i have to
connect so many things that even with
the b+ that has a lot of gpios i
actually ended up one running out of of
pins hmm and then if i'm going to run
hmm what about listen music what about
if i can actually control the music from
my jacket okay and what about email so
we have a way to get not name so Gary to
talk about it how to get a notification
so how can they actually say it to you
right on Java code so what about getting
my email while i'm running ok so those
sort of things that i was kind of
interested in to how can i actually
incorporate some wearable that allow me
to control my raspberry pi ok what did I
use so i went for the raspberry pi b
plus just because it has more gpios I
needed a bunch of them i use almost all
of them conductive fabric the wooden
conductive fabric so i use it for my
panel so i'm going to talk a little bit
more about that pressure-sensitive
conductive it was for the pedometer
so make sure I have this whenever I step
in the pressure change and then the
resistor value change and also i can
actually get that volume leds of course
we love light a project without light is
not a good project so we have to have
lights so a lot of lights
very tricky there are tiny they're
really really tiny so interesting I've
I've bored so with all these so i was
getting i was building all this on my
car how I'm gonna know if I'm getting
the signal if I press play how would I
know if it actually got it right I
probably I didn't have the screen with
me by the time so I include a buzzer so
over here I have a buzzer should be
should be visible so whenever I actually
touch something if I did get it I'm
gonna bust so I'm like oh I know it's
not gonna electrocute me or anything I
just feel like a little buzzing in there
then they say okay it did get my signal
if it did and I just try it again okay
conductive thread so for conducted tribe
is actually very easy so we just have to
zoo right so you just take it like a
normal soon we have a handsome lab this
morning and it was actually about
wearables and it was really interesting
to see everybody trying to say with this
so there is great because it's so easy
you just need a needle and basically
just connect the two components that you
want to connect extremely easily no
soldiering require the problem is
remember is still a wire so when you
make a knot it tend to run to loosen up
very easily okay so there is a trick for
that and I talked about it and then I'm
missing one image there is like a ribbon
with cables inside so it actually allow
me to connect or everything back to my
raspberry pi that is in my pocket more
serious stuff so we have the heart rate
monitor when I went out actually I was
going to put some water because i was
super dry so i think i couldn't get any
signal we have for tomorrow session i
also have an rfid reader so i can
actually undetected and connect new
components so what I'm going to have is
an RFID reader on my hand so again it's
very easy plug-and-play whatever
component you want it still gpios so
very simple glasses so those are the
glasses that I actually I always wanted
to
create my own google glasses what there
has to be a way to create my own version
of it so I found this one they are very
they cover up completed your vision so I
wanted to take them apart and just build
a little bit and I talked a little bit
more about it actually what pretty well
GPS and also on analog to digital
converter so some signals are analog and
remember the GP the Raspberry Pi that
does not have an analog input so it's
all digital so we needed that for
example for the pedometer okay oh okay
it's not a wearable is the microphone so
it's good so good now the real hard work
so I bet at least one of those you have
never used it before so suing a lot of
suing iron so up to put clothes together
so there's the material that you can
actually iron and it just melted is like
kind of plastics I kind of melt and put
the too close together very useful so
avoid a lot of suing nail polish it was
I never used some money time my nail
polish as building this project so every
time you do a nut with a conductive
thread right away start losing up put a
little bit of nail polish let it dry
heaven so trick that I learned it really
works and get the thin conductive thread
unless you really need a big one but the
thinner the easier is to manipulate the
thicker the harder it gets so nail
polish is really really required in your
project so how do I put everything
together so for example the heart icon
so just drive so my first obtained was
going to put the LED straight into my
arm it was impossible to sue with this
space I mean is like impossible to do a
design so what I ended up doing it is
getting a separate piece of clothes make
my design distribute the LEDs to the
diagram and just wire them with the
conductive thread so all positives
together all negative together make sure
they actually work
cover it up and I have like an icon and
that icon is the one that I just put on
my jacket so I just make like separate
components make sure they work and then
I apply to my jacket that was AC way I
found it otherwise there was no way I
was going to do anything within this
leaf on my of my jacket for the bar it
was a little bit tricky because if you
think about again these are tiny tiny
tiny LEDs and I wanted to do a bar so I
wanted to have blue green all different
colors but I wanted to be a bar so they
have to be close together right but i
don't wanna a negative close to a
positive so i needed to kind of overlap
them so i kind of protect them a little
bit as you can see in the second picture
and then overlap them a little bit so
that was it is a lot of work believe it
or not putting together again making
sure it works before you cover once you
cover you ended up with having one
conductive thread that goes to the GPIO
ok now the panel so I wanted to have
self buttons so the moment that the user
click it I wanted to simulate a switch
but with you know with self material so
i use the conductive material and the
idea was to have two pieces of
conductive material when they touch it
when they are open the circuit is open
so the switch is open when they touch
the circuit is closed so I needed to
simulate that kind of behavior so I know
when it's actually open or closed like a
normal switch so I needed to have two
pieces of conductive material and
something in between the separate them
so I found it very useful to get a piece
of clothes that actually have squares so
i can actually make the diagram of what
i'm going to do make sure you don't get
any stretchy fabric because it's crazy
and then just just use the conductive
thread to what i'm going to do so that's
simulating all the icons that i have
here there you can see the long threat
is to be able to hook up at the end the
conductive thread that goes outside
ok so the upper part is the switch and
the lower part will be a common ground
ok so very simple is switch go to a GPIO
and they all share the common ground to
be able to have that layer in between
the switches i use i don't know if i
pronounce it correctly nail print the
suit that the divers use right that is
thick enough but it's still soft so i
put a piece of mail print in between
those two layers and i make a hole
whenever I wanted the connection to be
so there are like a bunch of holes here
for each icon i have a whole so whenever
I put my finger in I'm the two pieces of
conductive material will close and
that's a switch ok I still needed as a
normal switch to have a resistor so that
was kind of huh no very nice i couldn't
find any resistance that was wearable so
I just ended up just rolling the ends so
I make like a hoop and then I'm doubt i
can actually use my conductive wire just
making a knot then my husband didn't say
anything but he fell everything looks
ugly until you close it and everything
is beautiful right so you close it up
and then you decorate it and all you
have is threads and then the icons ok
and then finally so again I did the
piece that the components and then I put
it into the jacket so once i have it
complete i can put it into this leaf of
my jacket ok so that's what i ended up
to it first requirement again feedback i
didn't know if i was getting the signals
right how would I know how would I know
that I won't touch it like three times
and get something like that so i use the
first one with the buzzer very simple to
use this one is wearable so it can be
washed and everything the good thing
about this one it already have a
built-in resistor so all i have to apply
this voltage so i have two connection
voltage and brown very simple again to
connect to a GPIO so whenever I read
something from the switches I bus and i
know that i did get the signal very very
simple then it wasn't enough right so i
wanted to have
wait to see what was happening and
that's what that my own version of
google glass came into picture the
resolution is of this particular device
is 320 x 240 and it's actually pretty
good i mean and gary just saw it today
and he was surprised we were able to we
were actually getting some packages and
I was actually able to completely read
from the screen so it's actually very
very easy we try our best to take a
picture so you can see the raspberry
icon on top so it's actually better than
then then you can imagine these are the
glasses as you can see they're very
they're covering the entire face the
entire eyes I didn't want that it's very
easy you can actually take them take
them apart and pretty much you have two
little screens I only wanted one side so
I just removed the other side and they
have like control panel where you
actually connect to the Raspberry Pi
cables were really tiny and short so I
need to unsold her then I make it long
it was kind of a tricky because the
connection was really really tiny so you
need a good soldiering machine it was
kind of a little tricky I thought I was
not going to be able to put it back
together but I was it does work audience
oh I wanted to have audio but again the
Java effects version the runs of the
Raspberry Pi does not have the media so
I couldn't then you know as all of you
are familiar with the restriction in the
format that we can play on Java i
actually just google it and I found a
library it's called J el guey music
player it's actually quite old and it
worked perfectly i just downloaded use
it no problem at all play the music and
able to seek the music paul said stop
everything from the raspberry pi b and b
plus they change the composite video
port so they don't we don't have more
that yellow port on the pie we have now
the analog the jack that shares or audio
and video
so I thought oh my god I'm going to be
able to use the glasses the glasses
actually has the audio connected to it
the kids think so I asked my husband
honey you know before Java one is so
crazy we don't have time we don't asleep
anything I Makka honey can you go to the
store and get me i need this connector
from the comp aside to one of these jack
and i forgot to say to tell him that it
was for a wearable solution he brought
me a cable is like 50 meters long I'm
like honey so yeah if you see something
big in my body's just the whole cable
that my husband brought it's just going
around and around and around like okay
honey next time it just need an adapter
that would be good so I did just didn't
have time to serve for something smaller
so that cable is I think the biggest
piece in my entire wearable solution so
what else did I learned I have to say
that at this I did this jacket twice so
I did their icons and now it was it was
time to put everything together back to
the pie so I needed some ribbon that
take everything easy right so first I
used a conductive thread ribbon cable
pretty much there are three threats for
each cable it did there are four lines
and each line is is made by three
threads three conducted threats but
there are just threat so it really
depends what sort of connection you're
doing when you try to connect to it and
it I find out that because of the length
it actually introduce a big resistance
so I was not getting signal good enough
at the end of the sleeve to power my
system so i have to unwire everything
and get the fabric ribbon wire that is
actually four wires it's a real wire so
I get perfect clear signal at the end of
my sleeve there are completely sold out
I normally go to Adafruit get it they
have like five I got all of them I've
been asking when are you gonna risk talk
I got the message that they have it back
on the stock and I jump up they got one
how much seriously so I still have a few
of the older cable
and are very flaky but with the new ones
it works perfectly for the mem for the
conductive thread so either i prefer the
thin one is easier to manipulate again
if you don't have like a big demand for
a voltage or anything like that i think
it works way better they're not doesn't
undo that easily and stuff like that
rfid reader everything about it tomorrow
the magic show and what did we learn I
learned that I do not I didn't need to
create this complicated panel after I
finish there are such a things like a
capacitive touch censored break out so
it allow me if this particular one has
eight pins that I can actually hook up
things so when I touch it it will detect
so what i can do is really have this
conductive material each of them
connected by a conductive wire to one of
those ports and then i can very easily
read when somebody torture or not use is
square c familiar for us etc and the
last piece before we kind of do a demo
is i really want to be able to interact
so one of the things that i'm looking
into is de mayo it is actually a very
nice wristband that control is actually
able to read your hands movements so
your if your gestures with hands so i
can actually detect gestures and we
don't control my UI so i would be great
to say next screen or I want these or
neck so things like that so I think that
would be my next step and let's see if
we can get some music and you can can
you help me here how we going to do let
me see first so first I'm going to try
to play some music oh can you turn can
you got anybody in the back turn off the
lights a little bit see if we can see
the heart blinking
of of can you see a hard blinking yes it
is invisible so that's my heart Oh way
better so that's every time my heart
blinks and then if I want to play music
I have some buzzer and hopefully let me
check the screen yes how can we do you
have a see it's very is there but it I
thought we gonna capture with it with a
microphone but we didn't this may be too
sure
not able to can you hear it so it is
their eyes and I can change the music so
i can go next and it boss and it change
the music so if you want to try it or
you can pause it a buzz me and it's
actually controlling everything so again
I can see everything on the screen is is
very clear and again there is a lot of
things that I want to change beside
cables controls everything so we're
definitely doing a jacket 2.0 version
will be a morocco in a month so plenty
of work for the next month and with that
