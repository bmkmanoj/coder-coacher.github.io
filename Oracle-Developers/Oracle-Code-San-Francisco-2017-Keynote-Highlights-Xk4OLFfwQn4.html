cannot only be about database or
JavaScript this is about developer
community not about a network of
technologies the way these to build
applications before and how we build now
is night and day there's a thousand apps
out there some of them are
out-of-the-box solutions some of them
are also customizable and configurable
but I now think this is kind of unified
product between apiary and API platform
that covers not only prototyping and
designing api's but also running them in
production announcing set of
capabilities specifically around
container centric development you can
integrate any identity stored whether
it's on frame or in the cloud and
integrate it in your application with a

to build a chatbot this was built in
less than 45 minutes so shout out the
fishbowl solutions and/or a player for
doing this hopper is actually one
channel configured with the chat bot
platform is that a good deal it may be a

different services is the essence of
server less and our new team name and
identity is Oracle developer communities
and we engage with you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
