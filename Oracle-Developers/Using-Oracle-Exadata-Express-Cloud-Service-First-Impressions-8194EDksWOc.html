see you Jim hi Laura how are you do this
every year it seems we always have a
blast doing this I know every year I
know this is great I love this it's good
so Jim you've got a little bit of
information and a little bit of time
that you spent with the exadata cloud
over the last few months
yes actually Express service yes and in
the cloud
fantastic so first let's start with the
important thing the important thing is
that you have written a book
well I've co-authored a book with you
hear about it Devi Gomez and Bert Scalzo
Devi is the youngest everything from
Guatemala by the way this is the book
it's at the Oracle press store and I'm
signing this tomorrow at lunchtime
whatever that means
great there we go I've got it in the
ring focus there and yes so stop by if
you can
you know I think you know Beach in 12
and one and lower here's your copy
really oh this is for me okay yes base
12c release to testing tools and
techniques for performance and
scalability yes I actually also do you
like that one what a grass behind that
should really you know that should
probably get me pretty excited about
things right
we actually just also I self-published
another book with Charles Kim from
viscosity North America that one's a
little bit less shall we say aggressive
and it's called PDB me to the cloud and
it's the only book you'll own that has
two oracle ace directors holding a
bottle of beer each
on the back cover so that's I need
contribution to the Oracle panoply but
it's just it's a it's a short
self-published title that we put
together it's a part of the iug
masterclass series that we're doing
together between the company that I'm
working for called rely on I was with
another organization but I've pretty
much like the guy that's helping them
build out their new Oracle practice it's
an really engaging exciting
thing to do from the ground up and so
I'm speaking in a lot of regional user
groups and you know of course speaking
here and wow it's not easy building an
Oracle practice that's what I found
anyway so that's what I've been up to
yes you know it wasn't too long ago
maybe a couple weeks ago where you gave
me a call and said hey I'm forgot I've
been playing with this cloud instance
now I want to talk about what I'm saying
yeah it is really really interesting I
had looked at Exadata Express cloud I
hope I've got that term right I know
we're talking about all kinds of things
here but next they did Express I'm
working on an X 50 I am instance and I
looked at it about actually about a year
ago and I was playing with it a bit and
I'm like you know this is still kind of
primitive and then I got a chance to
play with it again and I'm like this
ain't primitive anymore this is pretty
well developed pretty well sophisticated
some of the things I really like about
it is first off you don't need to be a
DBA to do this thing it's essentially
for my DBA friends not to be frightened
it's a PDB inside a container database
right when you don't have to start the
instance up it's on so you have to start
it up you don't have to turn it off it's
always on ok so it's really cool in that
respect it's extremely easy to connect
to with sequel method or on TNS names
that are very easy to set up or easy
connected like DBA talk a little bit
here again but very easy to connect to
nice and robust there have been several
new features that would have just been
announced I loaded about it loaded about
20 gigabytes worth of raw data and
created indexes and or indices and
created all the statistics in about four
hours
which ain't too bad would you think
that's not the size the shape that you
were working with and we were playing
with TPC d s the TPC D s schema which is
actually what we played with in our book
too yes so we just ramp that up to a 20
gigabyte image right and I was like all
excited I was gonna tell you hey while I
was working on the X 50 I am and it's
the larger and then I go to the Oracle
ace directors briefing and find out now
there's an X 1
thousand image and I'm like okay now
what I got to do is go figure out how
big I can make that but that's gonna be
in the terabyte range oh sure right so I
mean this is really exciting yeah but
the coolest thing is you know you can do
database as a schema writer database as
a service in the Oracle public cloud
it's still there if you want to go do it
I've been working with a Tod backer and
some of the other folks and asking them
questions about wow this is really cool
but how is it different is it gonna be
around for a bit and from what I'm
hearing they're both gonna coexist for
some time but if you are just you know
somebody that needs a really robust
database environment by the way with
everything all ready to go with database
in-memory already on with all the bells
and whistles turned on and you don't
have a DBA handy why wouldn't you look
at this right now cuz it's fully hosted
right we're doing all that searching all
the ups and ships and yes and write them
and there are new features that were
just announced a few days ago you're
gonna be actually able to export a
schema directly from the Exadata Express
environment into another platform right
so presumably it's be very easily not
presumably you can move it directly into
database as a service right via export
and there's more things that are coming
and I I was talking with Todd and you
know when we talked a little bit back
and going forth it what are you gonna be
able to do this what are you gonna be
able to do that all of this right so
let's talk a little bit about just
exactly what you did last week where you
were uploading your removing stuff back
and forth and and what you were looking
for were you looking for performance
were you looking for accessibility of
the data what were what were you
hammering this instance all about the
short answer is yes I was looking for
all of that definitely to see how
quickly data could load right definitely
to see how easy it was the accessing for
starters but now I'm ramping up I'm just
starting to ramp up some of my heftier
tests with the TPC DS workload generator
which Dominic Giles and I built into
swing bench really Dominic did all a lot
of the coding but I did a lot of the
sequel some of the nastiest look and
queries you have
scene I mean they are ugly queries there
are some that if you didn't have
database in memory likely they would not
finish Wow and so on you throw that into
you run that through swing bench and let
that kind of stuff happen and it first
of all they'll finish and you'll get a
chance to see you know the big challenge
with database and memory is people are
going well it's it's a separate you know
I'm gonna have to say the l word
licensing right every site it's extra
cost licensing the beautiful thing about
by the way exadata Express is it's all
bundled in there's now that's really
encouraging you know I'm not gonna incur
that cost just a mess with any of that
stuff right but to come back to my point
right we'll database in memory make a
difference for your environment right so
you know 20 gigabytes that's a pretty
reasonably sized database I think my
first Oracle database I ever created
Laura was about 30 gigabytes in size you
know and that was our production
database and we ran a whole company of
275 people on that you know so I mean
this is a nicely sized instance you know
you've got enough space in there and
more than enough to certainly plumb the
depths of that with either a subset of
your data you know if you're talking
petabyte range okay no you might have to
do the X 1000 is of course but but yeah
so yeah yeah but but still the
performance of it how things work how
are things gonna work differently and
again if you ever you know I was joking
in my presentation on 12c released to
database in memory yesterday that the
thing I'm trying to avoid is a user
going it's running slow because that's
just an app emma2 a DBA because then the
heart starts going faster and you're
like oh my god what did I do wrong and
then you start playing around with all
this other stuff and we'll wait a minute
wouldn't you like to know that ahead of
time rather you like to know what to
look for and then when you do decide to
adopt database in memory for example in
production now you know what to look for
already right you can you've already can
you can pre tune your databases let's
talk a little bit about the tuning sure
so you know if I'm using the exis
database Exadata database table it's
fully hosted right fully hosted you know
when you talk
tuning and maybe my data is not you know
my queries aren't working so well I mean
where would you point somebody who is
saying gosh that Exadata cloud that's
really slow hmm I see your point
this your point would you would you tell
us hey wait a minute clean up your SQL
your sequel or would you say clean up
your applications or where would you hit
the performance that's a great question
the first thing I would probably do is
you know I had this blog called
generally it depends and that's the
answer I'm gonna give you generally it
depends right here's here's the thing
that I like about exadata Express right
now you can eliminate essentially
instances I'm sorry scratch that
instance parameters right you can
eliminate that because it's been set
optimally for you there's a very little
that you can change so that's out of the
mix right io is most likely out of the
mix because it's hosted in the cloud and
it's gonna be reliable so then you can
concentrate on essentially what you're
saying is its equal right you know is
its equal is my sequel scalable is it
well-written is it been written to
standard what does the execution plan of
my statements say right and again this
is a fully hosted instance really a
fully hosted PDB there's nothing to stop
me from earning a sh analytics against
it or run an aw our report against it
you know is my colleague Clark
Shellhammer says you know a sh is that
one of the coolest things is like taking
a snapshot after snapshot but imagine
you're taking a snapshot on a
second-by-second basis and you can drill
into this any different way from
literally n-dimensional to figure out
where the problem is and you can make
sense yeah it does and you can do that
even when you're in you know on our
cloud absolutely absolutely that's the
whole thing the tools don't change
nothing changes when you move to the
cloud where I get it in fact it gets
gooder
it just gets gooder to use a technical
term right and oh by the way based on
the things that mr. Ellison revealed
yesterday about other things it's more
likely to be cheaper especially at the
outset then something else that starts
with an A and has an S at the other end
and then has a W in the middle and they
sell blur and see yeah
yes on it too yes among other things yes
but anyway among other things but you
know I mean that's part of the kind of
Throwdown that Larry did yesterday is
hey we're gonna guarantee you it's gonna
be half the price right right and it's
gonna be faster and it's in the contract
I mean you usually hear that from a you
know your your CIO or you don't cheat
chief owner of the company you know on
national TV you know anyway well that
yeah that was a very exciting yeah you
know he had a lot of drunk jawed right
that's hard to say dropping dropping yes
yes so your recommendation to the client
when it comes to exadata expresses I've
definitely investigated you know again
there are some narrow realms that it
will fit inside understand what you can
and can't do with it I'm hopefully gonna
be working on an article for you a blog
post thing on this right and that's kind
of got my initial impressions and I went
through and said here's what we do with
database-as-a-service here's what you
can do with exadata yes yes no yes no no
yes yes yes and just try to keep it as
simple as possible and did that work
yeah I would think so that's what I
would like to know yeah so we'll
definitely be working together on that
well I'm gonna do this one more time
okay I feel like I'm on John's at like
like on Trevor Noah and The Daily Show
you know grateful I've read it I
couldn't I couldn't fall asleep says
Laura actually except Laura's saying I I
had trouble staying I had no trouble
falling asleep probably for this and
nothing else is definitely the book with
the most compelling title yes that's
certainly the longest title of the
season yes but accurate I know it's
great seeing you too always good to see
you thank you so much take care take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
