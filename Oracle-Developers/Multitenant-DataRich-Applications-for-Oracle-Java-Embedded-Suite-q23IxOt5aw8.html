for coming I'm not not sure why they
chose this room out of all the Joff one
rooms for for this talk because it was
never going to be am you know a large
crowd at this talk but welcome and
welcome to the folks over here who are
sitting next to the door ready for a
fast getaway so we're here to talk about
Joffrey bedded suite which is a
phenomenal product for Internet of
Things gateways and I'm an archetype or
I'm an architect in the ok
okay let's try that I am an architect in
the embedded group at embedded Java
group at Oracle and I've been working on
focusing on the Internet of Things for
quite some time now and this is Rick
hello gasps my colleague and Rick is
very much involved in the Apache Derby
project one of the architects there and
is the leader of the Java DB team at
Oracle okay so here is the health
warning which has to be at the start of
every presentation and I'll say no more
so basically we're going to look at talk
a little bit about security and the
Internet of Things I'll talk a little
bit about about Java embedded sweet as a
gateway platform and then we're going to
get as quickly as we can into issues and
multi-tenancy and data how you secure
persistent data in a multi-tenancy
situation on IOT gateways ok so the
Internet of Things is not a new thing it
wasn't just invented by Oracle people
have been talking about the Internet of
Things for I'm for a long time obviously
a number of a number of trends are
coming together and making the Internet
of Things much more possible and you
know we've all seen concept videos of
smart homes and smart vehicles and smart
you know electricity networks and things
like that over the years we're getting
to the point now where you know the
power and the cost of hardware the
complexity of software that we have
different communications protocols all
of these that you know low power
hardware all these things are coming too
gather and really making the Internet of
Things able to to scale at this point
there are clearly a lot of different
things that have to be in place in order
to for the intent of things to really
reach the kind of scale that people are
talking about I've seen a lot of
different estimates and those you know
50 billion devices by the year twenty
twenty is at the low end of those
estimates and that's a mind-blowing
number of connected devices and even if
you start to think about okay how do you
ship all those devices and actually get
them physically installed some place in
that kind of time period you know I
think half the population is going to be
working you know doing IOT stuff if if
those estimates are you know even even
close to being accurate obviously one of
the important things about the Internet
of Things will be security and I guess
at a high level I'd I'd simply say if
you're thinking about the Internet of
Things and you're not worried about
security and you're not scared you it
probably just means the UH thought
enough about it yet and you know to
start off with let's just think about
some of the things that happen in the
physical world and then think about how
those might map to the the electronic
world the world of the Internet of
Things so recently there was you know
there was a house that was due to be
demolished and the owner of the house
was you know was not happy that their
house is going to be demolished and so
they switched the street numbers with
their neighbor guess which house got
demolished the next day when the
demolition crew turned up so in fact two
houses got demolished that day because
obviously the mistake was realized
pretty quickly and they also demolished
the the right house but you know that's
not the kind of mistake that you can
easily fix so think about how does that
map
you know how do you know that you're
talking about the right you know the
right and you know number three apricot
street how do you know that you can
trust the identification that you can
trust that address you can trust that
location you know there's all kinds of
issues that again has to be solved using
existing technology and in some cases
extending existing technology if we're
going to make this work and I think the
in order for the Internet of Things to
have mass consumer success then people
have to be able to unconsciously trust
the the devices and the networks mean
not that probably none of us write
actual letters anymore very much but
when you do mail something I'm sure that
none of you like stand in front of the
mailbox or 30 minutes agonizing over
whether to put that letter into the
mailbox you know worrying about all how
many people are going to read this how
long is it really going to take two days
to get there and whatever you open the
mailbox you put left written close it
and you're done because you you really
don't worry about is does the mail
system work and we really need to reach
you know that kind of unconscious trust
of the Internet of Things if people are
going to allow their their houses to be
totally connected and controllable and
especially if they're going to allow
things to be controllable from outside
so that you can actually coordinate
activities across different houses you
know in an area or something so trust is
very very important and part of that is
trusting that you any data that you're
inputting into the Internet of Things
all that's being generated about you is
secure and private so you may have you
know stuff that it and you know an
application running on your home gateway
from your medical insurance provider you
that's clearly going to have information
in it that you really don't want going
in any other place you may have some
home health one
thing going on and obviously you really
don't want and it's not so much that the
data about pulse rate or whatever it is
is that important on its own it's the
linkage between the identity of the
person and the data that's really really
important to both maintain and protect
so we have to be able to protect data
excuse me both at rest and in motion and
what I mean by that is while it's stored
and while it's in transit between
different systems with we're going to
focus today on data security primarily
at rest on an Internet of Things gateway
and we have there's a session tomorrow
called trust me i'm an m2m device which
is at 130 over on the other side and the
one of the smaller holes i think and
that's going to be a presentation much
more about you know abroad a broader
look at security and the Internet of
Things so one of the things that are
local is is announcing this week is the
you know that we are you know we're
publishing an initial version of our of
a reference architecture for the
Internet of Things we're not saying that
it's a finished work and we're not
saying that you know this is Oracle
trying to dictate to the industry how
things will be we're looking to work
with customers and partners in order to
evolve this into something that can can
be something we can all use and it what
it is is a set of functional building
blocks for creating end-to-end Internet
of Things solutions it's focused
primarily on the application and the
data layers and I think one of the most
important things is that we're
approaching this from from an open
standards point of view so you define
the different pieces of functionality
that need to be there really in almost
all Internet of Things solutions
regardless of what which industry or
vertical you're talking about and what
we're trying to do is to say let's
define a platform
which the industry can use in order to
build repeatable solutions today there
are obviously there are Internet of
Things solutions out there today that
people are using problem is that they're
mostly one-offs there aren't the plant
there isn't the horizontal platform in
existence yet that enables this to to
work and to be able to build reuse or
reusable components and so on it's not
vendor specific and obviously it has to
be customizable for specific solutions
so what we got here is the is the
conceptual architecture so this is just
a you know an initial picture of of how
we think most Internet of Things
solutions will end up looking and so
let's start off over here on the left
hand side isn't it funny how we always
put devices on the left hand side and in
the beer back end on the right hand side
so we have some sensors sitting out over
here at the top here we got what we what
we call the smart sensor so that's
something which you know is we'll have
our other things connected into it we've
got we've shown you know a truck there
so you can think of all kinds of sensors
on a truck doing sensor fusion on some
sort of smart sensor platform there and
then that will have a long you know a
long-range connection of some sort which
enables it to talk back to your
enterprise infrastructure then you've
got both wired and wireless sensors and
every place that I use the word sensor
then I also mean sensor or actuator you
know sensors are important because they
let you see what's happening in the
world actuators are also important
because they let you change what's
happening in the world so it just gets a
bit clumsy if I say actually say since
or actuator every single time so just
understand that so we've got these
sensors here some sensors are wired some
you know increasingly sensors are
wireless and for a lot there are a lot
of reasons why these
sirs may not be able to talk directly to
the backend and there are lot of reasons
why you don't necessarily want them to
talk to the directory to the back end
either and that's why this gateway piece
comes in here so depending on the
technology that you used in the
protocols involved then those sense at
the edge device sensors that you got
there simply may not support an IP
protocol and the right connectivity to
talk directly to a back-end and there
are a lot of spec there's a lot of
specialized work being done on very very
low power hardware building sensors that
have you know 5 10 year battery life
rather than 5 weak battery life a lot of
these devices are going to be
inaccessible in places in a production
line where you can't afford to go to go
to the sensor on a frequent basis
because you can't afford to shut the
production line down for example so the
gateway piece here is responsible for
taking the information from those
sensors or actuators and it can do both
local processing of that information so
that you get to make decisions based on
all this information you're gathering
here and so you can do event processing
you can do aggregation of data you can
you can do all kinds of processing here
and you know the Gateway is really an
applications platform but eventually
then you're going to be forwarding data
results of processing alarms alerts etc
back to the back end now then the next
piece here which would most of which
would sit out in the dmz of your
corporate network is a device
communications management piece so this
is something which this this manages the
interaction between your core network
and your and all of your gateways and
devices and you need this because there
are a whole range of different protocols
that you need to be able to deal with a
lot of these devices out here are not
going to be accessible the whole time
because they need to turn
our ad off most of the time in order to
have to say a battery life for example
so if you want to talk to one of those
devices you have to have some place in
the network where you can leave stuff
ready for it to be picked up whenever
the device is ready to talk to you and
act on that so that's the kind of thing
that happens here and then behind that
then you've got the essentially the
management and the security pieces to
allow you to authorize access to your
network manage you know create
identities for the different devices
manage policy on behalf of all those
devices obviously you know large-scale
networks like this have to be centrally
managed you know man with USB stick in
pocket is that is not the the management
model for the Internet of Things so and
then a lot of the you know the stuff
back here is just you know traditional
one once the data is is into the right
kind of persistent store then the rest
of this is traditional enterprise
application development by and large so
this is what we're showing you here is a
conceptual architecture it's not a
product diagram and it's not a complete
solution brief it's not a set of best
practices or anything like that yet but
this will be you know we we have you
know we're working both internally and
with partners we have a more detailed
version of this that we've been through
in other other presentations here don't
have the time to go into the the more
detailed slice right now unfortunately
but they say this is something that you
lease be seeing a lot of from Oracle and
this is something that we're very very
interested in partnering with getting
feedback on and trying to turn this into
something that the industry can really
gather around as a way of speeding up
the adoption of the Internet of Things
so having talked about the Internet of
Things and how that can be built we're
now going to talk about the gate Wayne's
in
ethics and I'm going to talk about Java
embedded sweet there we are press the
button twice so Java embedded sweet is
an Oracle product for building gateways
it is essentially a set of middleware
for building IOT gateways you'll hear
the acronym IOT everywhere this week so
to me for years and years and then
interoperability testing but now it
means Internet of Things I heard that
some people want is cool he call it the
internet of stuff but unfortunately that
the tle for that was already taken so
this runs on top of java SE embedded
which is an embedded optimized version
of java SE gives you the full full
access to all of your the well-known
java SE language and library features
and it provides a secure but dynamic
environment for gateways so you need to
be able to support multiple applications
and services and to be able to update
those deploy new services a lot of the
hardware that is that will be deployed
as part of the Internet of Things will
be there for years or decades so it has
to be manageable and updateable you can
host and use use restful web services
very easily and today we're going to be
talking about java DB for structured
storage and there's a buff later today
at five thirty which will where will be
demonstrations of using java embedded
sweet on a raspberry pi and so any of
you that are interested in that I've
been seeing it then I'd refer you to
that buff so one of the things that that
exists on a jazz gateway is a management
agent that is really the conduit by
which the the Gateway joins the rest of
the network and becomes a manageable
device so this that's the place where
you know everything gets secured
registration new devices that
if you've got a home gate when you just
bought that shiny new roof connected
refrigerator how do what is the thing
that controls you know connecting that
into your your home gateway and making
that accessible from and securing access
to that from any other places that you
want to allow that's the management
agent sorry I must've pressed a key on
here by mistake so device registration
software installation and update and
creating credentials for all kinds of
different entities that are associated
with the Gateway so the device itself
different tenants on there that are you
know tenant could be home depot
deploying applications onto your home
gateway for example different
applications and then the different edge
devices that the gateways is
communicating with okay so Rick I think
it's over to you now to talk about
multi-tenancy and data and that's the
laser pointer with the red star ething
on it
can you hear me okay back there yep
great alright so I'm going to talk about
how you the issues that you might need
to consider and the features that are
available to you if you plan to host
multiple data rich applications on a
gateway device using Java DB as as the
database so many of the issues that
you're going to face here are the same
kind of issues that you would face if
you were trying to deploy multi-tenant
applications on a commercial enterprise
caliber database in the cloud there are
certain general principles apply in
general if you have fewer databases then
you're going to have more efficient
resource use you're going to use fewer
resources you're going to have more
efficient data sharing between your
applications the queries will will run
faster however this will come at the
cost of there being a lower firewall
between the applications now there's a
significant difference between using an
embedded database like Java DB on
gateway device and using a commercial
enterprise caliber database in the cloud
and that is that resource consumption by
java DB is generally far lower than the
sort of resources that are consumed by a
commercial database so this means that
in situations where you would not
consider using multiple databases if
you're using a commercial enterprise
caliper database because the
the disk usage because of the background
processes that are created and issues
like that but you might consider using
multiple databases if you're using Java
d be the simplest architecture that you
would consider is where all of the
applications from all the vendors that
are supplying applications for your
gateway device are hosted in the same
Java DB database if you do this there's
only going to be one copy of the system
catalogs there's going to be only one
page cache holding the data and if you
do need to join data across applications
if you're sharing the sort of data that
needs to be joined then the optimizer is
going to have a global view of all the
data and is going to be able to come up
with an optimal query plan but it may
turn out that you are working with
vendors who don't trust one another and
they may want to run in an architecture
where each vendor gets its own database
now you could imagine in a situation
like this every application is
represented as its own user in the
vendors database and you can imagine
that there are in in the previous
scenario you might do the same thing but
you might also create vendor specific
roles within when those roles would be
granted to the applications that are
produced by that vendor you probably
wouldn't need to do that in this
situation even if you are running
different vendors applications in
different databases you can still share
data between the databases you can still
join data between the databases is you
need to what all that has to happen is
that one the second vendor has to permit
a credential connection to be made to it
from the other vendors applications
and what you do then is you use a
feature of Java d be called table
functions table functions are a way of
making external data appear to Java DB
as though it is local data in the local
database the downside of this kind of
joint is that the optimizers cost model
for table functions is fairly limited
compared to the optimizers cost model
for real based tables so this means that
if you if you are sharing data this way
via table functions connecting databases
to one another you you raise the risk
that the optimizer is going to choose an
inefficient query plan and finally the
the most secure way that you can run
your different applications on the
gateway device is a separate application
in each database and here you can build
the highest thickest firewalls between
the databases here again if you need to
share data you can use table functions
to do that all right now I want to talk
a little bit about the firewalls that
are available in Java dB at a high level
these are the kind of firewalls is the
kind of protections that are available
to you your first line of defense would
be Java permissions these are the
permissions you're familiar with from
the Java security manager that are
managed by policy file the second line
of defense would be encryption database
encryption an entire database can be
encrypted and when the data is on disk
it's obscure it's only decrypted when
it's read into the page cache your third
line of defense would be the
fine-grained grant revoke permissions
which which restrict access to your
tables to your data to your other schema
objects
and your fourth line of defense would be
would be credentialed connections to the
databases themselves and now I want to
talk about what the little more in a
little more detail about the actual Java
DB mechanisms which deliver those
firewalls so in that Java DB it runs
under a Java security manager if you run
it under a Java security manager you're
going to need to grant the Derby jar
file that's the jar file that contains
the Java DB code you're going to need to
grant it various permissions and you're
going to need to grant various
permissions to your applications the
sort of point of permissions from the
point of view of the security manager is
actually to prevent you from trampling
other applications with with the
operations that you're performing here's
a snippet of this is the these are the
actual permissions that you'll need to
grant to the Derby jar file in order to
run Java DB some of these permissions
are optional for instance to get
protection domain and call abort
permissions are optional depending on
what features you're using in the
database even the file permissions are
optional if what you're doing is running
your you're running in an in-memory
database that never hits disc however in
general you're going to need to grant
the database the opportunity to create
class loaders and to read various system
properties so that it can configure
itself as I said your second line of
defense is going to be database
encryption database encryption in Java
DB is pluggable you can rely on the
encryption provider that comes with the
JRE or you can plug in your own
encryption provider the way it works is
you protect the database with a with a a
encryption password or
scription key as I said when the data is
on disk it's encrypted when it's read
into the page cache it is decrypted if
what you're doing is a read intensive
application then once that data cache
has been warmed up you're not going to
incur any decryption overhead but if you
do have a right intensive application
you will incur a encryption tax whenever
log records are written and whenever
that page cache is check pointed to disk
it is possible to take a database that
wasn't encrypted and to add encryption
to it it's also possible to take an
encrypted database and to give it
another encryption key if the previous
encryption key has been compromised
setting up encryption it's pretty simple
generally people in setup encryption at
database creation time and that is done
by putting some extra attributes on the
connection URL you set the attribute
data encryption equals true and you set
either a boot password or a encryption
key attribute to be the the secret
character sequence that unlocks your
database the first application or user
who boots the database who create who
grates the first connection to the
database is responsible for supplying
the encryption key once the database has
been booted anybody else who has valid
credentials in that database can then
connect the last line on this slide
shows how you re encrypt a database with
a different encryption key in the event
that your or your previous encryption
key was compromised first you have to
bring the database down to cry asset and
then you reboot it specifying the old
encryption password and then you specify
a new one
so that I think one use case for that
may be and we're talking about devices
that can be very very long-lived so you
know five years five years ten years
from from now maybe the the encryption
scheme that you started with is that no
longer seems quite as secure as it did
right now so with Java then you can
deploy into the the JRE a new encryption
scheme and then you can because Java DB
just lives on the the encryption that's
provided by the JRE then you can deploy
a new provider that has your new better
wizard crypto and you can then update
your database to use that new crypto so
this is important in the context of
long-lived devices and be able to keep
them secure over long periods of time
this is not like you know this where
it's you know kind of the norm is you
keep this for two years and then you
replace it it's not you know we're
talking about much much longer live
devices right that's absolutely true
that's a very good point all right your
third line of defense is fine grained
grant revoke permissions so this permits
you to decide which applications which
users are allowed to write to your
tables read your tables which
applications are allowed to execute your
application specific functions and
procedures which applications are
allowed to use your application specific
sequence counters user-defined data
types and user-defined aggregates in
addition to supporting a concept of
users Java DB also supports the concept
of roles roles are essentially
collections of permissions which can be
granted to users or can be granted to
other roles and using roles makes it
very easy to write a very compact
streamlined declaration of who is
allowed to access your objects in your
data so as I said a situation may end up
being where a where you are modeling
applications as users and your modeling
vendors as roles all right and here's
just what one of these one of these
grant statements looks like the idea
here is that you have a vendor who
produces two applications of pulse
oximeter application at a blood pressure
reader application and both of these
applications need to write heartbeat
information to the heartbeat table and
they need to siphon data out of the
heartbeat table and forward it to a some
sort of back end at some point for for
for aggregate processing so both of
these applications need to be granted
the power to insert into and select from
that heartbeat table all right finally
your last line of defense is is putting
credentials on your connections to
prevent only 22 to make sure the only
authorized users are allowed to connect
to your database jovi DB supports
several kinds of authentication one
model what one kind the authentication
that is used in server environments is
to plug in a external ldap server this
is probably not what you're going to do
on a device it is also possible to write
a your own implementation of a very thin
interface called user Authenticator to
wrap your device specific authentication
scheme and it's also possible to use the
native authentication that comes with
Java DB itself with native
authentication the credentials are
stored in in the database so native
authentication gives the database owner
the ability to create drop users the
ability to reset passwords which have
been compromised it gives individual
applications the ability to change their
own password and this is how you use
native authentication you turn it on by
creating an account for the database
owner that using the CCS create user
database procedure it's important that
the very first accounts you create is
the database owner if you try to create
an account for someone else that will
fail once you have created an account
for the database owner you bring down
the database and bring it back up native
authentication will be enabled and it
will be enabled from then on you cannot
turn it off and you cannot drop the
database owner so here we have an
example of creating an account for the
database owner and then creating
separate accounts for the pulse oximeter
and blood pressure reader applications
alright and that's what I had to say
back to you know
so we're happy to take oops we're happy
to take questions if if you have any
please yep
sure I agree completely with you and I
think the important point is that the
Gateway can be you know the gateway
gives you a place where you can do that
processing and really the Internet of
Things is in general it's about
distributed processing of all of the
data in the commands so it's about
having different places where sometimes
you you know so for example we're
working with a company who are a
hardware provider to utility companies
and they're very interested in doing
event processing at the gateway level
because the latency difference between
doing processing there and sending
everything back to the cloud for
processing makes the difference between
your street just lost power and that
whole side of town just lost power so it
very much depends on the use case where
where you need to do what and and are
you real even if you're doing processing
of the data on the gateway that doesn't
necessarily mean that you're that you're
filtering the data and not not actually
passing everything on so I think it's
very very it's going to be very use case
specific and we need to make sure that
what we build is it's flexible enough to
deal with all of those use cases
oh and I think there are i mean we
showed one one single gateway in that
conceptual picture i think that in real
systems that may well be multiple levels
a gateway as well
so we're in but you know we are in
active discussions with those partners
in order to in order to work out that
you know they aren't the answer to that
I you know I know the folks are
processed well and what we're doing it
you know what we sketched out here and
the more detailed version of it is
absolutely not in conflict with what
with what protests are doing I can
answer that specifically and so we we
think that osgi makes a very good you
know framework for gateways and it seems
that a lot of people in the industry
agree with that we think that it you
know because of the the the
manageability and the dynamic
characteristics that it gives you it
makes a a very good solution is it
perfect absolutely not it's but it's
certainly the the best thing that we
have there is so the Oracle is a member
of osgi we're on the board of osgi so we
are we are involved you know processed
is very is very involved in in osgi
there are at least at least three
working groups at osgi that actually
move move the tank that the
specifications and the reference
implementation forward there's the core
working group there's a residential
expert group and there's an enterprise
expert group and so the residential
expert group is actually chaired by
someone from processed so there you know
we work closely with processed and there
is mean I I subscribe to all the
relevant mailing lists and there is a
lot of activity so osgi is not is not a
legacy spec it's very much being pushed
forward and you know pushed in
directions of how do you start to
integrate many different kinds of device
different protocol
and so on at the gateway level and then
the road there are other things being
done in terms of OS gr I mean osgi has
been widely adopted at the enterprise
level for enterprise applications as
well and there are a lot you know
there's a lot of traffic on that mailing
list at the moment too so I think just
just to kind of emphasize that you know
what we're doing with the reference
architecture is not kind of bringing
something out and say I'm trying to say
this is how the world will be we are
what we're doing is essentially thinking
out loud if you like and saying the
industry really needs a platform in
order to allow us to build many
different solutions and build them
quickly and not have to mean if you go
and talk to a company like Deutsche
Telekom then you know they do I OT
business already they build solutions
for different customers that come to
them and they they will they run the
networks and so on and they they they
will tell you that there is way too much
building you know that every solution is
essentially its own thing and so that
you know there are a number of folks who
are very much in favor of building
defining a high level horizontal
platform like this so that we can we can
kind of focus on the heart the harder
issues rather than rather than you know
redoing the plumbing again and again and
again that you know we we may well do
that I mean I think it's too early at
this point to talk specifics about that
but we we don't see it as something that
is you know that that has to belong to
Oracle and the Oracle you know certain
our Oracle proprietary as I said what
we're doing is taking functional blocks
and work trying to work out with people
okay what what exactly do those blocks
do is this the right collection of
blocks what have we missed in thinking
about this that from your experience you
know you know needs to be there
and then we can talk about what are the
protocols the right protocols to use for
the different interconnects and in many
cases it's it's not going to be a
question of this is the one right answer
so we have to we have to have something
that's flexible enough to to deal with a
lot of different data representations
different different protocols and so on
but so far we've had a very good
response to this and to the whole idea
that one of the things we're missing is
this you know big picture architecture
so we're so we look we're looking at
areas like home gateway homer to home
automation automotive you know
automotive in telematics smart energy
you know factory automation I you know I
can reel off a number where we are where
we are being active in terms of talking
of partners and talking with customers
right now I don't think I don't think
that any of them would be a huge
surprise to you
Rick Oh sings there's a database
questioner so the the question was you
know we show there was a session
yesterday where we showed real time
updating of restful webservices sitting
on a gateway and to what extent does
that same principle apply to to java DB
in terms of being able to dynamically
change the schema and things like that
is not the question yeah well what I can
say about that is that Java DB does
support schema evolution commands I
think something we would need to fold
this into some kind of osgi framework or
something to package it up but the
capabilities are there absolutely yeah
so I think they aren't so the answer
there was the the ingredients are there
there's not there's not an end and
end-to-end solution for doing that yet
okay and just to go back to the
reference architecture then you know
we're not saying that you know Oracle
has this complete solution already we
don't but obviously we're where we have
products that we're working on and
obviously where we're building those
products bearing in mind this reference
architecture but we very much want
feedback from people and to work with
with partners and other other players in
the industry to to refine the reference
architecture and make it something that
that we can all use and that can help to
make us all more successful more quickly
okay well thank you very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
