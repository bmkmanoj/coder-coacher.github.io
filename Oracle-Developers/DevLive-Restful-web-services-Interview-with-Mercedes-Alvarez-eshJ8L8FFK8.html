code that life here in Seoul host Javed
Mohammed and I have as my guest today
Mercedes Alvarez who is the CTO of our
WT technology yes aha and product EVP
yes nice to meet you thank you very much
so this your first time in Seoul yes
it's my first time in Seoul and that is
the first time that I came to Asha I am
coming from Guatemala that is in Central
America Oh a few far away Wow right yes
I travel where 33 hours yes I thought my
flight from San Francisco was long but
but Francisco from here yes so you have
a presentation you're talking about what
a few things talk about that's exactly
so give us a little a preview you don't
have to go through your whole
presentation but give us a little of
preview to into your talk okay when we
develop and things in the cloud for our
clients can be our smartphone on a
website can consume information we
developed something called Web Services
right and in the past it was really
famous use soap services that were based
in XML technologies but it's a few
complicated consume this one which could
have a hight protocol and you need to
use XML and XML that can be a few
biggest and transport a lot information
that you don't need in the other hand
rest services are based in HTTP methods
that you can consume that like a get or
put and it's just a new RL and the
information that you want to send so are
a few more faster to consume then in the
client side and you are a transporting
less if
Meishan so this is about my job develop
this rest service for using any client
and its development them using a
technology that is called play framework
what is a play is a framework they say
so frameworks are usually I a wall of
tools that you can use for me
development for example in the world of
Java EE is a set of libraries and tools
that you can configure your project use
and maybe you said Gradle for use them
but you need meet all your
configurations from zero right and the
frameworks may all those configurations
for you and provide an environment of
development and make things more easy
and that is precisely play framework
right it's a way that yes using jax-rs
for male web services they have tools
for make database connections and in
that they have their own observer so I
don't need to config things like an
Apache or a tomcat or a glassfish for
run my weapon my web application or my
services and in the other hand exists
other thing that maybe developers would
understand good when they are working in
Java EE is when we are making deployment
of our project so we need to generate I
will write war then run our app servers
and deploying that observing our world
and playing through the I J Breville
behavior for that and they have the own
akka server or a yes so what I'm
thinking when you're talking about
configuration of thing in my mind I'm
thinking of DevOps and chef and puppet
does that kind of tight so if there's
like if so people want to learn more
about your presentation so when is your
presentation today
Lisa II said the last schedule I think
okay so anyone who's here you're gonna
be coming here please do check out
Mercedes presentation I need the other
you think there are good resources that
if people want to learn more oh yes we
exist a lot of documentation in the way
another interesting thing about play is
that you can choose between use Java or
Scala its color is one of this
programming language that were on oral
the java virtual machine and play is
based on a scholar so we can choose
between use one or the other one and in
the other hand I will talk to other two
subjects in my talk that is use Jason's
and JSON web tokens JSON web token is a
way to make up tenth occasion in our
systems and don't use anymore sessions
that is if you are in the past and use
this special token there are encrypted
for sending information so you have a
key in your Klein a key in your server
and that makes more secure the
information that you are sending between
the two parts okay looks like it's going
to be a great session and we wish you
all the best one last note not relating
to your presentation but about Guatemala
about which most of us know very little
so if someone is gonna go if someone was
to go to Guatemala
what is one place or one kind of food
you would recommend for people to well
something good in Guatemala is coffee
coffee yes in there I was talking with
the guys they know that but we are lands
of a coffee product yes and as usually
when I travel I see that internationally
they drink toasted dark coffee and for
me this is born at coffee this is born
at coffee brewed coffee yes almost the
dark is born at coffee and we have many
many flavours in that if you go to some
especially coffee shops you can choose
between the different sides of the
country because the altitude of the when
you produce the coffee provided
different flavors someone are more acid
or worse
older ones have more sugar other ones
have a chocolate flavor so when you go
to in debt to a starburst you can choose
between these different things then for
food this is complicated because it's
not to go to a restaurant if not if we
have this street vendors the exact
and we have a something that is called
tamales well yes tamales we have
something that is like a soup no way
when you you make a chicken uh-huh yes
like a pro brother exactly but we call
that Carlos because it's like a sauce
because it's a few I don't know how to
say espresso yes we have many of these
one we have cake for example that is for
chicken yes we have other variety that
is too Cheetos rain it does rain it's
all based on banana banana and hot
chocolate with the spices inside the
banana is like the rings out as I have
this well we have to stop us well so
you've got a lot of things there I don't
know if it's lunch time but you got me
to see you talking about cloud I hope
you check out the article cloud demo
cloud coffee demo oh yes the coffee may
not be as good as but do check it out
yes so thank you so much and do tune in
for more deaf life presentations here at
Oracle code so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
