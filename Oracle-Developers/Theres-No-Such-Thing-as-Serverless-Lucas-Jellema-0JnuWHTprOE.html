Clearly there is no such thing as serverless computing.
However there is such a thing as dedicated serverless computing.
That means that there's no server constantly dedicated to your
application.
You don't need to have a web server that's constantly running,
waiting for requests to come in.
The new paradigm of serverless,
that's what I urge you to take a close look at.
With serverless, you implement functions that can take requests,
that can respond to events,
but are only started up once an event or
request needs to be dealt with.
That means, in terms of compute resources, you don't have any dedicated resources,
but those resources are made available when processing the events or the requests,
firing up if there is a big load, and
completely letting go of all compute
resources if there isn't any load.
Serverless doesn't mean there's no server.
There's a server somewhere.
There's this big server pool in a cloud vendor's pool of compute resources,
and we only pay for the actual compute we're using,
typically a combination of the memory used by our functions while executing in the time they take to execute.
It's a true pay-per-use model.
In terms of technology to use for this,
Oracle offers a managed serverless cloud service
that will run using an open-source platform, the FN platform.
With the ebb and flow functionality, it
allows us to create and implement functions
in various languages such as Java,
JavaScript, Python, and Go,
and we can string these functions together, having one function publish events or publish
output that can be piped into another
function.
Like I said, I urge you to
take a look at these functions to be
able to benefit from the serverless
architecture that's going to be crucial
to the future of IT and computing.
Was that a good tip?
&quot;This is like a dream I've had!&quot;
We want your opinion!
Thanks for watching, and stay tuned!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
