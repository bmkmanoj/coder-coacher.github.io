session you guys are coming to my
session but actually I need your help
more than you need my help because I'm
going to be confessing and I have I have
a lot of things which I need your
forgiveness for so hopefully hopefully
you guys learn a little bit for my
mistakes and you know if you could just
you know pray for my sins I would
appreciate it because they're there
numerous ones my buddy here Keith who
runs my jug he can he can attest to the
nameless company which is where I did a
lot of this stuff we've been co-workers
for quite a while but I figured you know
just to lighten things up i'm gonna i'm
going to tell the story with lego action
figures and star wars right like those
those two things geeks right yeah okay
so this is a little bit about my story
ins how I've been doing agile stuff over
the years and you know I used to be like
a really happy hacker I would work on my
own little skunk works projects and I
you know if I could I would still be
doing this I wouldn't actually like like
have a job but you know it was ok doing
when I was single but then I got married
and I really needed a job and then I had
kids and I'm a corporate slave now
entirely
but you know at least I have some really
good co-workers and I made a lot of good
friends over the years so like I'm kind
of happy that I moved out of my shell
and actually like had been forced to
socialize with people it's been it's
been a change for the better and you
know you brides probably have great
teams and people you work with who you
really like how many how many folks here
like their boss okay so everyone else
yeah so my my first boss was he was he
was he was taller than me he didn't have
to stand on a chair he was pretty scary
actually you know now I'm good friends
with them we hang on have barbecues and
you know we bound to all our ideas off
each other but yeah so when I first
moved out here and I I had my first boss
it was it was a little scary but so he
was my boss for all of three weeks when
he went on vacation and never came back
so yeah that's that's that's what bosses
do you sometimes and so it was you know
me a whole bunch of other people he
hired in other people he hired who
hadn't even joined yet and I got left
holding the banana
I'm sure this has happened anyone here
end up going down like a management type
path okay a couple of you I'm sure at
one point you felt like you know I'd
rather not be doing this but if I don't
you know the whole team suffered so
let's just get it done make things
better and the way I looked at it if I
was at least helping my my co-workers
and making things better than it was it
was worth you know me sitting and doing
spreadsheets and reports and all the
dirty work which um none of us really
want to do so we embarked on our
adventure and we decided to go with
extreme programming yeah yeah okay so we
got a few we got a few XP fans so you
know this even today I mean this this
used to be like a like an
all-encompassing methodology people
would just do but even today a lot of
agile people look to extreme programming
for the best development practices I
mean you know Ron and the guys on the TV
c3 project they got a lot of this stuff
right really early on so they were all
part of the the founding of the agile
movement so you know it was it's served
as well we were a small team we were
kind of like a little agile ghetto
getting our stuff done we did some pair
of programming all right people like
pair programming a little bit this is
one of the more controversial things
it's like you either like it or you
don't we also did some unit testing
we actually started with a reasonable
unit test suite and we added to it and
made sure that we extended it and kept
it up I think this is this is probably
the biggest thing like if you have one
takeaway from the presentation here if
you're not doing unit testing there's
something wrong just do unit testing and
we worked at a sustainable pace so
actually like one of our favorite things
in the in the office we had a co-worker
who broaden like a yoga mat and we
converted my office into like the
official team hangout room and it turned
into like a afternoon nap place and
there's no shame in napping like if you
take half an hour to nap and then you
feel refreshed and you're more
productive in the afternoon that is that
is worth it regardless of what the
social ramifications of sleeping on the
job might be in modern society so via be
a rebel take your nap in the afternoon
if you need one I probably need one
after this session and just do it
because you'll feel refreshed and your
co-workers will thank you and you'll be
extremely productive you'll have a lot
of fun just don't be the guy with the
rabbit ears so that was that was like
really it was a good initial experience
to agile we just you know he picked up
the book we checked out the blogs and
sites and we kind of did it on her own
but I decided you know we were
successful and I decided to join the the
Empire right that's what all good clone
troopers do they want to grow up and
work for Darth Vader so um you know I
set out it was a little little daunting
a lot more like formal and structured
and rigid you know it's a big change
going from a small company to a larger
one probably a lot of you flip-flopped
between the two and you're in your
career is but you give up a lot of you
know direction and individual
flexibility for achieving bigger
corporate you know
maximizing shareholder value but we had
good team so I like the people I was
working with some of the people I was
working with you know you can't pick and
choose and you know one day the big boss
called and he's like well I heard you
know something about this agile stuff
let's let's get to it let's make the
Empire agile so you know previously I
did the agile ghetto thing that was like
you know grassroots kind of builds the
teams and then work within the system
this was was more of an agile
transformation so you had to like
convert the organization and you had to
like figure out how you were going to
roll out on a whole bunch of different
teams standardize on practices but we
had some good help so we got some help
from one of the elites Ron Jeffries who
he really does have have a lot of a lot
of you know Brian Marek so he's also one
of the agile manifesto authors and this
guy this guy for being how like
intelligent and smart he is he was
really humble he would he would sneak
around the office and he'd finds that
the people who are doing the work and
he'd sit with them teach them something
and then he'd have them spread it out
among the rest the organization so he
was like a little virus in the
organization and also Israel gap Israel
is kind of like one of those those big
thinker types but but again like one of
those smart people where you just he
just kind of moles and
and then something brilliant comes out
which I can't do I think Ron's favorite
trait I liked was um he would always
have no cards he pulled him out of his
pocket and he just be jotting notes down
I mean you know John more notes down and
just be thinking and occasionally like
something brilliant would come out and
it would upset our managers his reports
were horrible they would always upset
the managers but he was a he was a all
these guys were like um change agents
like you bring them in and they force
change on your organization because
you're just they come up with ideas and
things which you would never ever be
able to to think of and we had some good
hyper performing teams things were good
so
now we went for the rolling out some new
development practices across the
organization getting creative and you
guys do what do we call them hackathons
hackathons for your organization's okay
I see a bunch of hands coming up there's
another good thing to try out with your
your organization or your team um so
usually by my experience with doing a
bunch of different agile methodologies
like scrum and con bond and the whole
set is it's very easy to get on a
treadmill where you're going so quickly
you don't have time to like get creative
or think about things or experiment with
things you could possibly do to improve
and everybody in the team has ideas but
when you're on the treadmill you're just
pulling cards and you're doing the next
task and you're not really um innovating
so hackathons are a good way where you
just you stop for like a week or a
sprint or whatever it is let everybody
work on a project of their own you know
his small teams of their own creation
and then they at the end they present
and they show what the arils create and
more often than not you know you you
think that the projects wouldn't really
be something which you could sell but we
used to do these ends the CEO would
watch it and guess what the roadmap for
quarter one would be for all of our
teams he would see like the 20 projects
could be like oh that one we're doing
that we can sell that that 10 they were
telling me that was too hard that was
going to take a year to accomplish how
did you get it done in a week and then
suddenly all that stuff made our roadmap
for the for the first quarter and then
it was back to business so something
else to try out but a few dissenters
you know you have that you know that one
guy who's just not there not into it
they don't like the way the new things
do but you know a few heads rolling it's
all good it actually it turned out in
our case the the people you would most
expect to like were most seasoned and
most established and most resistant to
change once they they got some of the
stuff we were doing they actually were
the biggest supporters it was some of
the people who did half-heartedly who
are the hardest to deal with like the
people who just kind of go along but in
the back their passive aggressive and
they don't really like it the people who
actually said they didn't like it were
the best supporters later on so and it
was a you know big success but like any
organization we kept growing I think you
know part of success is you acquire more
companies who you get acquired and you
get bigger and you get multinational how
many folks work and distributor
organizations where you have more than
one yeah okay almost everyone so like
this is the reality of most large
corporations as you um you're very wide
spread and you have to you have to send
out the troops on the big ships to get
stuff done so this was this was a lot of
a lot of me and my buddy Keith traveling
around and trying to roll out stuff on
teams kind of spread some of the agile
knowledge we learned by rolling it out
with a smaller organization two
different teams in the u.s. we had a big
organization in India but when you're
working at scale that big a lot of
things are different you know when you
work with teams and developers you're
familiar with you make some assumptions
and then you start rolling out things at
a bigger scale and suddenly you spend a
lot of time in meetings trying to figure
stuff out
a lot of processes some are more painful
than others but I think in general
processes they institute a lot of fear
in the organization and then of course
you have big meetings to plan your
invasion your release is where you're
actually going to to coordinate across
your entire company and this is this is
also something which is incredibly hard
to organize because rather than working
at a like an individual contributor
level where everybody is incentivized to
get stuff done you now have like product
managers and sales and executives all in
the mix trying to put their stamp and
edge each other out and and get stuff
done those guys unlike unlike us where
we're actually getting done where we get
rewarded for working together and set
executives rarely get rewarded for being
cooperative with other executives I
don't think that's part of their own
part of their reviews at the end of the
year were you nice to your Co executives
that doesn't qualify so lots of internal
conflicts it was a lot of work I think
we were successful in some things I will
confess what we were not successful but
um yeah so I escaped I took off on my on
my little ship and escaped from the
Empire just a normal guy now just doing
my thing most this stuff I do is like
hacking speaking and writing able
conferences that sort of stuff so it's a
good change from from having to be
responsible for um large swathes the
teams and developers who own you can
only guide with general advice and some
pushing but you can't actually be on the
ground getting stuff done some more of a
doer okay so some things which I learned
which you guys might be able to to take
away from this this experience
agile manifesto you guys familiar with
this yeah okay this is this is like
brilliant it's been around forever but
the basic tenets of the agile manifesto
are still like a hundred percent true
these guys really nailed it early on
when they were looking across all the
different agile development styles that
were present at the time and they had
some big thinkers in the room then kind
of worked through it ends this is still
a good guideline for if you look at your
the way you're doing agile if it's not
focused on individuals and working
software and customer collaboration and
responding to change then you're
probably doing something wrong but I'm
going to i'm going to introduce an
anti-pattern to this we're going to
we're going to introduce the agile
industry manifesto all right and this is
this is where if you're if you're an
agile guru I'm going to start getting
you upset hopefully so if you look at
the the industry which is developed
around agile sometimes you'll be given
expert advice / just doing continuous
improvement and kind of learning from
experience I would argue that you want
the ladder over the former in a lot of
cases you'll be you'll be steered
towards a specific methodology rather
than working on like getting software
craftsmanship and working on some of the
skills which actually make it possible
to make that methodology successful I I
failed on this one I think when we were
rowing at agile so I think the latter
the craftsmanship is really what's
important metrics over clean code it's
very it's very tempting to try to to
force and focus on metrics because
that's what your gauged on in any large
agile organization there's going to be a
large set of metrics which are gauged on
and compared to other teams seeing how
the project is going etc and if you're
not focused on having clean maintainable
good code then no matter what the
metrics say you're still going to fail
on the end there will be decay over time
and the last one is um you know tooling
over in person collaboration there's
just so we had I think to at least about
ten development centers we were working
with and if we spent the money we spent
on tooling licenses and simply having
people meet face-to-face that would have
been a much much better value rather
than buying expensive tooling okay and
you can you can feel free to to disagree
with me all the time at the end for you
to shout out and tell me what I'm what
I'm getting wrong so you know these guys
I got Kent Beck might be it all these
are all on agile manifesto authors
probably like me if these guys are in
the room you just go like this and it's
very tempting to take what they say as
as gospel rather than applying your
experience and like what you've learned
in your teams so I think one thing you
know these guys they're all they're all
humans I've hung out quite a bit with
with Ron met all these guys at a bunch
of agile conferences where we've been
doing stuff together I think yeah so for
brains I think Alastair wins he's just
like a genius but these guys are all
really smart but they might not know
exactly what your situation is and
sometimes trying to apply blanket advice
from them for your org is just not gonna
not going to work a few books as well
how many how many Hatchell books do you
guys have on your bookshelves so one of
my one of my favorite things is we'd go
into meetings and like we be chatting
about like how we're going to do the
retrospective or like the sprint lands
or stuff like that and somebody would
pull up like a really old scrum book and
say oh on this page of this this this
book in this chapter Kent Beck said this
and that's that's cool that's good but
taken out of context you can do a lot
more damage than good if you're simply
trying to pull Road advice at a book so
it's a good foundation but it's not
it's not a substitute for for experience
this is this is how we you know viruses
work they they know they try lots of
things to kill us and get a sick and
they're quite successful because they
keep evolving then I think this is this
is the most important thing when you're
focused on your team's is if you're
continually improving and changing and
making things better than you're much
better than trying to to apply advice
from the latest latest conference or
some random speaker speaker who you
heard something from so focus on your
team's first ok how do you know things
have gone wrong according to blah blah
blah blah blah blah some book we should
do this so if you hear people saying
that a meeting then then probably you
should take a look at your team and not
be paying so much attention to the book
anyone heard of like hyper performing
teams this used to be like a buzzword
who is it who go around saying this like
it was Sutherland yeah Jeff sutherlin he
had this big stick about hyper
performing teams and he'd like go and
he'd present and he he'd show how
awesome his teams were and like how this
sprint burn down charts went into like
the stratosphere that's that's cute but
you know not everybody can do three
hours Prince with continuous deployment
with etcetera etc etc like a lot of us
actually have to like make working
software for our business domains so I'm
don't get caught up in the hype and try
to try to emulate what they're doing all
the time and then I think this is a
really easy one to track like if you
have the same retrospective issue coming
up again again again again probably
probably there's a problem and you need
to fix it all right so Keith Keith in
the front he's the official heckler for
this session he asked what if you don't
have retrospectives all right so yeah
perhaps perhaps that's I think that's a
different introductory actual tuck that
we should have all right so Mike my
confessions I have a lot of trouble
disagreeing with like Ron I don't know
what it is like when he says stuff and
like we're chatting over lunch and stuff
he has like the big beard he's got like
this this this aura to him and I just I
agree with everything he says I'm
horrible I think it's really easy to get
caught up in this like when you're when
you're talking to somebody who you
respect it's very easy to fall in the
trap of just agreeing and not critically
thinking about what they're saying so
always always question other folks even
if you even if they're smarter than you
or they appear to be smarter than you
yeah and this was I was the guy who who
forced all of our teams the company to
have matching sprint lights sorry this
was a Dean Leffingwell idea it it was
great for our metrics it made really
nice graphs and pretty charts perhaps it
didn't work for all the teams in the
company for the majority of teams it
worked great for a couple teams like
having a longer shorter Sprint's
probably would have helped them and I
hate retrospectives there's just like
it's like um it's like doing the laundry
so I'd rather be coding but I know you
had to do them so you know if it was up
to me there wouldn't be in here at
respective sorry cute okay craftsmanship
over methodologies so there's a lot of
methodologies you can pick you can take
your pick how many folks are doing
extreme programming okay well that's
that's apparently dead
it was funny I was one was it like I met
Ron must have been like a while back at
least at least I'm showing my age at
least half a decade ago and I was
chatting with him in a conference and
I'm like what are you up to these days
yeah doing scrum training so the last
thing I expected was to see the big X
key guy doing doing scrum training
sessions but apparently that's very
profitable and a lot of the guys who run
the agile manifesto who I who I hang
around with them they would tell me that
um one thing they figured out over time
was that they're really good
practitioners there perhaps not the best
business people and consultants so I
think that's that's a good oh you have
to kind of reflect on what you're good
at and those guys are good at one thing
not all of them are good at turning that
into a successful business model well
apparently scrum is that's a that's a
great business model anyway when doing
scrum okay yeah that's I think that's
like the number one methodology in the
world besides con bond anyone come on
okay quite a few now this is where i was
saying treadmill now my feeling if you
look at scrubbers combo we converted
some of our teams to conv on but it it
really it really feels like you're on a
that's working great it really feels
like you're on a treadmill the whole
time and I thought this was kind of
funny that there's actually guys who
paragraph on a treadmill because the
thing with con bond is you're constantly
doing additional work and you finish
your work you're pulling a new car
there's like no little break and you're
constantly being introspective on stuff
so if you're doing con but not even more
strongly encourage you to do some sort
of hackathon or have a cognitive break
from simply pulling cards and doing
additional work from the from the board
so what what makes projects fail usually
it's not the methodology and this is
more often than not especially when we
were working with a whole bunch of teams
with different experience levels you
would be surprised at the
sort of things which we which we found
teams just did not get right some people
thought that having one machine in the
office which could build the code was a
build server so hopefully you think
that's funny because if it's not happy
why you might be doing this I was I was
I was a guest we'd finished rolling out
scrum we had teams doing like sprints
and planning days like oh yeah well you
know I want to check out and build the
code wait where's this jar file where's
that oh wait it's on his machine oh no
there's parts on his machine really okay
unit tests unit tests which you have to
manually run or not unit tests having
main methods for you kick it off and you
have to run it or not unit tests and
also having unit tests without
assertions was something else I saw a
lot of so this is this is really basic
stuff and again like like we spent all
this time rolling out scrum and agile on
teams and then went back and we realized
oh my god none of this stuff was even
right you can't be successful at a
higher level if you don't even have the
basics right and then just in general I
this is Amanda recurring theme on every
team I've worked with is the getting the
QA dev relationship right is just really
hard it's really hard to do the cases
where it's worked out best have been
having the testers and the team
integrated but there's a lot of types of
products and a lot of organizations
where it's very difficult to get that
level of integration between dev and QA
and over time the other issue you have
when you have a fully integrated dev QA
team is that the kind of the
responsibility and the standards for
quality gets shifted and unless your QA
person is very disciplined sometimes
they get pulled into the way of thinking
of the development team which is happy
path so you have to have a QA person who
actually is very critical thinking
they're always trying to catch the
corner cases the edge cases it can can
steer the development team towards that
ideally what you'd like is all the mem
the team tree quality is something which
they own and then they're actually
focused on that individually and
everything they do and I think you know
Ron Jeffrey's opinion on this was always
QA what do we need those guys for every
developer should be their own Qi in
practice it doesn't actually work but
Ron's an idealist okay software quality
that's what those guys do over there
very common and then my confessions so I
am my check in binaries pretty often
don't do it but I have this habit of
checking in bed big fat binaries I would
argue though that checking your jars and
your binaries and with your code is
better than not checking them in and
having the mud somebody's computer but
get a get a proper artifact management
solution use like you know maven or
Gradle or something and just get that
done yeah second one we did a lot a lot
of scrum training and high level what I
would call the methodology level
training we should have just been
sitting there reviewing code checking
their unit tests working on their build
infrastructure getting the foundation
right because without that all of the
methodology was wasted they were simply
putting a veneer on top of what was kind
of a crafty underlying business you know
development process and the last one is
well this is even a Kurd confession all
the agile talks I've given in the past
and present have always been on
methodologies not on development
practices I'm sorry I've been focusing
all you guys on methodology is not on
doing the real hacking but fortunately
there's lots of good technical sessions
at javaone so you should attend some of
those and actually get some good
practices all right so metrics who likes
metrics okay we have it we have few
statistics tish ins in the in the room
it's kind of this like love/hate thing
right you need you need good metrics in
order to justify like the progress and
what you're doing but at the same time
if you over focus on metrics you lose
sight of what you should be doing now
and you're probably you know you're
probably sitting in your office working
hard on your team or you know leading
your scrum team and you're like you know
you think you're you think you're alone
but now there's a whole team of guys
like you know looking over your shoulder
they know exactly what you're doing
they're tracing all your metrics they're
watching the all of the online check-ins
into the scrum burn down to all because
we we know exactly what you're doing oh
you know check-ins for the past week are
you on vacation oh you're at a
conference okay you get off the hook
yeah so you can you can go a little
overboard on the metrics I certainly
have in the past when do you know you're
a metric junkie so anyone anyone log
into the agile tool this week while
you're at the conference come on come on
don't be shy all right all right we got
a few people okay yeah but we have these
wonderful online tools for watching our
agile projects so you know you got to
check in and make sure that you're
actually doing stuff how about how about
your um your point value system have you
noticed that trending upwards we're like
estimates get slightly bigger and bigger
and bigger that's that's the secret to
hyper performing teams which jeff
doesn't want you to know and you know
when we are talking about code coverage
who who has a hundred percent code
coverage target anyone all right very
brave man very brave
usually you don't actually need to hit a
hundred percent to have good quality
code if you're doing like one of those
scripting languages like Ruby or Ruby
you probably do need a hundred percent
but for java and compile static
languages there's a whole lot of stuff
the compiler just kind of checks for you
that you can write you to test for but
it's it's a little bit tedious there's
good frameworks to help you with but
it's a little tedious to get to one
hundred percent and if your QA team is
pushing back when your code coverage
drops below ninety eight percent and
they're probably testing the wrong stuff
so my confessions yeah so I spent a lot
of time in Excel when I was doing Lee
agile the agile methodology role I
probably should have spent more time
coding especially on those teams without
unit tests they needed my help they
actually have made a second issue to it
was like it went together whatever you
saw like missing unit tests you saw lots
of copy pasted code so I think the fact
that you have to write unit tests
actually sometimes encourages you did
not copy and paste because it's more
work to write additional tests for the
copy pasted code code coverage I can do
that no assertions hundred percent code
coverage i will call every method once
it's actually it's really hard to get
good tools which which really tell you
what your code coverage is or what's
your real test coverage is so sometimes
rather than locate the metrics which you
really want to be looking at is the
development practices and like how much
the the QA person on the team is
assisting and developing good test cases
where the test cases actually um test
the right things test the corner cases
the edge cases and i've i've killed off
projects with pie charts to very easy to
do so don't be don't be one of those
people who pulls to pull statistics and
then and that makes a whole bunch of
people unhappy yeah very sad
okay and tooling most of you guys
probably have a tooling license or two
or three no tooling licenses very good
good man yeah so you don't you don't
actually need expensive tools to get
your job done regardless of what the
large trilling vendors would like you to
would like you to think and there's a
lot of tools to use yeah the one the one
that's really fuzzy that's um that's my
fault sorry we even have we have lots of
cool devices to you don't even need to
you don't even need to meet your team
members in person you can just use a
little camera do a little voice chat and
you're set you have a team over across
the world you can buy expensive video
conferencing software you can have rooms
where you're like a mirror talking to
each other but there's really there's
really no substitute for in-person
collaboration so one of the things which
I i would encourage it's costly but it's
definitely worth it even though you
probably don't have the tool the budget
to send people around the world
constantly to meet each other in person
I think an initial face-to-face meeting
goes a long way like if you can get
people to at least once meet
face-to-face then the rest of the
interactions of the communication beyond
that just go like it goes a hundred
percent better there's you know rather
than that being that voice on the other
end of the phone or that guy I see in
like you know video chat every now and
then it's actually like a person you've
had drinks with or you've chatted about
like yours what you like with sports or
teams or things and you can you can have
a relationship you can build on from
there the worst feeling is like well
that's I think it's on this slide as
well yeah for the last point the worst
feeling is like you meet people for the
first time and they're just not who you
expect
so does this has happened to me a lot
where I've just I've worked with people
for like a full like year and you
finally meet them face to face and
you're like saying hi to them like oh
what's your name oh oh how are you doing
let's introduce ourselves again so it
gets really awkward when you just
haven't had those um initial
interactions to get things started um
I've been I've been guilty of this as
well writing stories in the planning
meeting with the scrum master who's
entering them in the tool rather than
actually playing the teamwork and right
stuff and actually get things on cards
and contribute to it that's very easy to
do and the tooling makes it so easy to
do now you just you have everything
online on web pages and you enter stuff
and you do it you know why do you even
need a planning meeting you just enter
the data in the tool and tell everyone
here's your work here's your work go
yeah and then having the QA guy wanting
us to fix the coffee machine what would
I say yeah so it's a very there's a big
tendency to have everything filed as a
bug rather than talking about it like
having everything go through a bug
tracking system and a lot of cases if
you're working in a team with people
right next to each other you'd much
rather have the conversations like the
QA guy if you sitting next door he can
say hey look at this when you do this
this this it does this the developers
like oh yeah no I've seen that before
and they fix it bug squash right having
the QA guy go through the scenario take
screenshots write it out like two hours
later he says oh there's a jogger ticket
and the developers like oh well I worked
on that before and on time to work on
that this this sprint so it gets
postponed till like three Sprint's later
by the time it gets picked up the
developers looking at old code trying to
figure out what happens so simply like
having that interaction with the QA
department makes a huge difference even
if it doesn't make your boss happy that
the jira statistics aren't what he
expected them to be all right and some
of my confessions so I was I was one of
those scrum masters I would sit there in
the meeting and i would type it in
because i typed fast enough that i
thought i could just do it and that's
not a good idea don't do that yeah and I
probably estimates into it was faster
that way well you know I got good at the
guessing game like the team would all do
the cards and they'd say what the
estimates were and more often than not I
actually knew what number was going to
come up so I just kind of like to start
entering them in before they watch yes
yeah I'm quite bad fortunately I moved
out of the scrum master role pretty
quickly so people like Keith actually
got to do it the right way I would teach
people to do it the right way even if I
didn't do it the right way yes and I I
built my own tooling I even well I open
sourced it so I kind of a leash it on
the world it was like some big agile
portfolio planning tooling and even
though you probably have never used it
how many how many folks here use rallies
software for okay so a bunch of folks on
the team yeah so their enterprise agile
portfolio management system that was
based on my tool a lot of the ideas from
that came out of the the prototyping
work I did for that tool and then later
on my buddy Jim helped them out with
porting it over so I'm sorry I apologize
for unleashing that in the world my
condolences so I think the most
important thing if you guys learn one
thing from taking away from this
presentation is you have to focus on
what you do well individually and I
hopefully I figured this out for myself
so hacking you know I'm a reasonable
programmer and I I'm especially good at
picking up random things and making them
work by digging in the guts and figuring
out
how they work so I like doing it and I
can do it well I figured out that i'm
pretty good at doing video on the fly
recording stuff so I've been doing a lot
of streaming and video stuff just for my
own purposes and presentations and it's
a good break from the hacking right I
get to play with toys and of course you
know here right you have it if you have
one thing you're good at drinking beer
that's not too bad right alright so I
want to thank you guys very much for
listening to my confessions thank you
alright so I'm going to give you guys a
couple minutes if you want to ask me
questions or challenge things which I've
said or just share experiences or you
can simply give your own confession to
the audience and we will we will all
forgive you so let's let's to make it
reasonable for folks who are hopping to
another session let's just limit it to
the first three people who want to who
want to say something so just raise your
hand or shout it out yeah yeah go ahead
so all large organizations do to process
okay so the question is are all large
organizations do them to process and
heavy up front control so in my in my
limited experience which is the company
I worked for and then like I worked a
lot with Dean and agile Dean Leffingwell
in Israel or Dean Leffingwell in Israel
gap who they both do the enterprise
agile rollouts where they um they mostly
work with either like CEOs CTOs board of
director types and then roll down and
from that experience yes your dooms
although what I would say is that
there's still a lot of opportunities at
an individual level if you have a good
team and you have good supportive
leadership to actually do some like
transformational stuff at a smaller
level but like one of the one of the
problems with the game the big agile
game is a lot of the a lot of these
things you get its scale require
processes and institutionalization which
take away from things you get in a small
team so it's kind of a give a give take
in some way sorry all right so preacher
distributed workforces working or even
okay so question was is a distributed
workplace worth it first and then
avoidable ok so I'll answer those as two
separate questions so if I were starting
my own company it would not be worth it
like I would just have everyone
co-located even if it was more costly
even if there were relocation expenses
involved but that's that's at a scale
where like you know that works to about
100 people develop an organization any
larger than that and it no longer
becomes possible you you end up with
distribution naturally so the second sir
your second question avoidable it's not
if you look at the way most modern
enterprises most large enterprises are
built up it's it's through acquisition
it's through like getting talent in the
fields especially if you're doing
something specialized and technology's
made it such that you can actually be
fairly productive at a distance if you
are disciplined and you're willing to
take a loss on productivity and
interactions so I think any ends what
you end up with is it's actually not
avoidable and so you have to make do
with what you have so one of the things
we tried to do was um we made sure the
scrum teams were mostly co-located and
we switch people between our teams to
such that people who are working on one
project were physically together but we
would still have geographical
distribution of teams and occasionally
like a product owner or a business
person who wasn't co-located and I think
that was the that wasn't good like that
didn't actually work having a product
owner who was remote
see we had proxy product meant we had
proxy product owners who are local for
the product managers were remote that
worked out better having somebody
responsible for the team when you had a
product manager who was trying to be a
product owner for a remote team that
pretty much failed consistently that was
a good failure pattern okay and i will
give you the last did I answer your
question yeah okay I'll give you the
last question okay so question is I'll
repeated exactly because it was funny
have you seen test-driven development be
more than resume fodder or is it
actually a unicorn yeah okay so I think
that's actually the right hint sirsa
what keith said is if you're working
with me it works and when i pair
programmed with ron it worked great it
was awesome everyone who were program
with rod and brian and like people who
are really good at it it was jill
feeling like it was like it was like
crack am I allowed to say that anyway
it's fine he was awesome and then when
you took two random developers and you
said thou shalt TDD it was pretty
miserable it was just it just slowed
them down and it like it didn't really
it didn't really like hook so I I think
I think like if you look at the
progression like no unit tests test
writing unit tests and then doing TDD
like if your if your summer between unit
tests and tdd you're probably doing good
if you're somewhere between 0 unit tests
and trying to get unit tests then you're
not doing too good so the magical like I
write every single thing with TDD and I
have this green red bar I can flip back
and forth magically every 30 seconds
that that's really cool like kudos to
you for like you know being a process
guru but it doesn't really matter
okay so thank you guys and enjoy the
