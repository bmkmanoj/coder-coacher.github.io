the second session here after lunch
and I have a new host Javed Mohammad and
we have as our guest today swen
Bernhardt so son welcome and thank you
for accepting on a short notice so it
looks like we got a pretty busy day
today you'd had one presentation before
lunch and now one right after this
exactly okay so where are you from spent
with city i'm from cologne from cologne
yeah you have to fly here did you have
to take a train or yeah I arrived by
train this morning I started my day
started and I think it what about 3 3
a.m.
exactly oh my goodness you know I don't
see any red eyes how far is cologne from
here
oh it's about it's nearly about 6:00 on
a kilometer 600 kilometers here wouldn't
it be easy to fly
yeah but that's what it was too
expensive ok all right
you know if you take the train you can
work for for the time you ok ok that's
really cool all right ok well excellent
well thank you for making the time can
you share with it a little bit you had
so you had a presentation about api's
before lunch
what can you tell us what the theme of
that was yeah my critique and me were
talking about a add value which api add
to 208 for companies today because with
api's you can create new digital
economies and it's very important to
thrive the digital transformation and to
create new business models right and
what we did in our presentation we we
showed a use case from within obits
consulting which we implemented um
because we have a monolithic application
which is our our key system to track our
projects to do HR things to do
financials
to do our time management for our for
our employees and also to continue
management and all that kind of stuff so
it's really everything we do we do in
this system so on what what we try to do
is to do I to create a more modern
architecture so that we are more
flexible and can also start driving
innovation from within of its consulting
so it so this is so this is we talk
about the whole API first which was
spoken about in the keynote this morning
is example referring to ages and just
the shift from developing monolithic to
micro services exactly exactly and what
what we did is we created a micro
service so we we extracted one specific
functionality to continue on our core
system and then we expose api's on top
of that micro service we expose to no
js' micro service exposed the API for
different client applications so for
Android app for native iOS and also for
a web app for the back office where you
can do all the content management which
is necessary ok just kind of stepping
back a little bit I know like whether it
was anything like micro services and
containers that all the rage you know
everyone but other do you feel that are
instances where perhaps micro services
and and that whole architecture does not
make sense and one on the big does so or
we could reverse the question say when
do micro services as an architecture
make more sense when you're designing an
application or software yeah from my
point of view if you want to do arm if
you wanted to check if something new
especially in the innovation area if
this works out for your business and
help
business to further evolve then it may
be the right approach to create a more
flexible architecture based on a
microservice approach you know right so
that you also can throw everything away
if it completely doesn't make any sense
for a business right but if you need
some robust functionality which doesn't
need to be changed that often maybe it's
also fine to have this monolithic
approach because I think everything
which was done before in software
development today isn't bad by default
because I think it depends on the
context where you are working we also
have this to start discussion so I
versus micro-services from my point of
view there is no vs. because I think the
two approaches solve different problems
and they are both needed in coexistence
so the point of view but I was thank you
for sharing that one so you have a
presentation after in a show what's
what's not going to be about this is
about test-driven integration cloud
development so you know if you have
integration project even if it's in the
cloud or on-premise testing is always
something which is put in the very the
latter ages exactly uh-huh and this is a
problem because you know requirements
are changing you have different things
which should discover while building
this integration so you need to change
and if you don't have a valid testing
base then it's gonna be a nightmare
maybe and it slows down your development
so you are not able to deliver things
and that's a key problem we were also
taking at the customer side and in these
presentations we will also talk about
the problems we have in our customer
and then how we solved it using a
consistent test-driven approach isn't
that what all the whole DevOps
methodology is about exactly in
conjunction with Oracle developer cloud
service and all the kind of stuff so how
to consistently implement a DevOps
approach also an integration project
because today in in Java or in micro
services development test-driven
development and all the depth of stuff
is mandatory it's a default there but in
the integration space it isn't so if we
integration guys talk to some Java
developers or - yeah - no JIT developers
or whatever they are laughing about this
because it's not rocket science today so
what I hear from you is I think
obviously like DevOps obviously it deals
with a whole lot but against the focus
is still on either the dev part or the
deployment part and I think what you're
highlighting is the testing part of it
exact which is obviously a very critical
part of that process guys it's very
essential to to get this quick feedback
from a build server if you change things
in your integration if the integration
is still valid after the change right
and this could be at least by having a
automated testing approach so if you
commit your changes to your source code
management system afterwards it should
be checked out by the server build the
test should be executed and then you
should be aware if everything is fine or
not and if it's not fine then you need
to change something okay well it sounds
like at a very exciting presentation is
that what 3 o clock what time is it uh
yeah 5 minutes pass we're five minutes
past 3:00 so please check it out and
really appreciate you coming down and
sharing with us and all the best thank
you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
