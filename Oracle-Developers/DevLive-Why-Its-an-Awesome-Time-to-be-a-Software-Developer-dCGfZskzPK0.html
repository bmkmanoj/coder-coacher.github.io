technology Network coming to you live
from Oracle code in Toronto with another
in a series of interviews with session
speakers from today's event and in this
particular case I have one of the
keynote speakers Deepak Patil Deepak
thanks for stopping by absolutely happy
to be here describe for me your role at
work I'm a vice president of engineering
and development at Oracle I work in the
engineering team that is responsible for
delivering our infrastructure service
platform and because infrastructure as a
service platform is the foundational
investment for Oracle in terms of how
the rest of the cloud platform is built
I also engage with a variety of teams
inside Oracle who are billing platform
capabilities I engage with our customers
or partners in terms of unloading them
onto our platform I work very closely
with that field on enabling them to take
our platform to the customers so given
the fact that the entire industry is
going through a generational
transformation around cloud computing
and Oracle is going through a
generational transformation itself in in
delivering its cloud capabilities it's
been a fun job and I'm enjoying myself
your keynote address this morning
touched on a lot of various factors that
are affecting the state of software
development and the state of the overall
environment for software developers now
can you kind of encapsulate your entire
one-hour keynote session into say a
hundred and twenty seconds sounds great
sounds good so I talked about three
things in my keynote today in the first
section I talked about why this is the
best time ever to be a software
developer in the second section I talked
about what we are doing with respect to
our platform developments and
capabilities and innovations to further
accelerate the capabilities that are
being put at the disposal for developers
and in the third section I'd
about I made some announcements with
respect to the partnerships real we are
building with various technology
companies as well as some of the work we
are doing for developers in terms of
free offers and and and our venue
developer portal and things like that so
I truly believe that and having been an
engineer and having been in technology
business I prior to joining Oracle about
a year and a half ago I worked for
Microsoft for 16 years and I was in
various engineering leadership roles
there having been in this business
business for this long I can I do truly
believe that this is just the best time
ever to be a software developer for
multiple reasons technology is being
democratized for developers at an
unprecedented speed a lot of bottlenecks
that got in the way of engineering
agility and development velocity are
being eliminated at a very fast pace the
aspects of social developments and
development communities are evolving
very fast and it is easier than ever
especially because of the cloud it is
easier than ever for developers to
develop globally and develop at a very
large scale and all of those elements
together combine for a phenomenal
opportunity for developers to number one
innovate at a very fast pace
number two focus on things that they
want to focus on they like to focus and
not worry about a lot of things that
they traditionally had to worry about
and number 3 leverage the power the
global power of tools technologies and
developer communities better than ever
before that's why I believe that it's
it's just an awesome time to be a
software developer having said that is
it possible that life for developers
will get so easy that the skills that
define them as developers will lose
value
I want you to lose value they will
change and they will evolve like they
always do I mean in back in the 90s I
was a I was a C++ in Visual Basic and
Oracle developer and then of course the
way the developers work work today has
is significantly different from then and
and now we worry about and talk about
BOTS and micro services and the DevOps
models and containers and so on and so
forth so one thing is always true and
will remain true that if you're a
developer you have to keep up you have
to evolve with the technologies you have
to evolve with the with whether just the
general technology and the industry is
going that's it one very interesting
thing I feel is happening it is around
the evolution of a role of developers
there is this of course low code
developers as we call them and then
there's high code developers who can
kind of do more complex programming and
more system level development and I
think both of those roles are evolving
faster than ever
another element of that is I kind of
used to call them to our developers to
day developers and to week developers to
our developers of the developers who
essentially want to build something
quick going to fail fast and and build
something within two hours today
developers are a little more kind of
involved than that and build something
more slightly less caffeinated it's
slightly less caffeinated and build
something deeper than that and two-week
developers kind of want to build up a
more functionally functional module and
with the advent of cloud on demand
capacity pay-as-you-go try before you
buy models availability of globally
available fully dynamic instantly
scalable alas just-in-time elastic
resources support for open source
technologies and hundreds of essentially
different programming frameworks
the life of all of these developer
personas is going to continue to
significantly get better easier and
evolve at the same time you spent as you
mentioned 16 years at Microsoft
we've been at work off for a little over
a year what most surprised you about the
transition there are a lot of really
similar things between Microsoft and
Oracle both companies focus on deep
innovation and engineering essentially
created by two geniuses in Bill Gates
and Larry the talent level in both the
places is phenomenal track record of
essentially identifying trends and and
never letting up until kind of we win is
going to similar in both the places I
have been impressed inside Oracle I've
been impressed with a couple of things
more so than I was
prior to joining Oracle number one is
I've been very impressed with the pace
at which the company moves forward I
mean we we take this Oracle code event
as an example I mean we six months ago
we were talking about how we really need
to create a forum that allows us to
interact and take our ideas and
innovations to developers one-on-one and
how we want to create a forum that
allows developers to come together and
exchange ideas and thoughts and within
six months we are here enjoying fifth of
a twenty City developer Roadshow at a
pretty grand scale and I've been very
impressed with this with the speed at
which things get executed and move
forward in Oracle thank goodness for
caffeine absolutely so our Java which
company has the better cafeteria that's
a tricky question really really tricky
question cop-out though
I work in Seattle so CLO Oracle office
doesn't have a cafeteria I must say
every time I go down
headquarters and it was shows I do look
forward to go into the cafeteria so
what's next on your calendar are you
doing more events like okay yes I'm on a
flight in a few hours to London we have
a next Oracle code event in London on
Thursday
I'm keynoting there as well I'm looking
forward to that event I'm talking to a
bunch of our development development
partners customers and I expect that to
be a similarly successful and enriching
event and I'm looking forward to that
I'll have a safe flight and good luck in
London thank you very much if you'd like
to attend upcoming Oracle code events
please visit developer Oracle code
developer oracle.com slash code I'll get
it right there you'll find plenty of
information on upcoming Oracle code
events along with information on how you
can submit your own proposal to deliver
a session of your own at an Oracle code
of met for the Oracle technology Network
I'm Bob rube art thanks for watching and
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
