welcome back to Oracle dev life Heather
man Kira we're doing an interview with
JCB spec leaves exciting topic yeah for
me I love the spec leads they do such a
great job for the JCP and the Java
community overall and largely unrewarded
job at times but I think one of the
great times we have at JavaOne is to
acknowledge the efforts of spec leads
right and especially this year at
JavaOne we've got two major Java
releases coming out Java EE 8 as well as
Java SE 9 and today we've got three Java
EE spec leads here with us on the stage
thanks for joining us why don't I just
ask each of you to introduce yourself
you know who you are
well he worked for and what data stars
you've been leading just start us off
okay so I'm Antoine Sabu's y'all I'm
walking for reddit and I've been the CDI
to spec him that was a release in spring
and that's it all right
it's on just get a little closer
specification leads for the Java EE 8
platform jsr hi I'm ed burns and I was
especially for JSF and servlet and
participate in lots of other jsr s I
consider myself like a JCP lifer I'm
with it and I've always enjoyed doing it
and I believe it's an incredibly
successful way to evolve the Java
platform all right I agree I appreciate
all of you I think you're all excellent
spec leads and actually as I mentioned
Java ones a great time to highlight and
recognize the work of spec leads and the
Jo stars that are being recognized at
Antwan last night at the JCB party was
actually recognized with the annual JCP
outstanding speckly Award for 2017
congratulations
means a lot for me yeah yeah well I
think you've been one of the leaders in
terms of being open and transparent and
really bringing in the community
participation maybe you want to
highlight some of the efforts in CDI to
expert group in particular that was
helpful in terms of bringing the jsr to
completion yeah in fact we tried to be
the more inclusive possible to accept
command from the community so it gave us
a lot of work but it gave us also some
good insights from user that probably
would not have come to the to the speck
in a more formal way I think well so we
can also be proud of our openness and
TCK which is one of the first that is
open source and the link that we built
between the TCK and the speck document
to help people to learn the
specification by the test right that's a
nice yeah that's nice and add as well I
think Edie with JSF spec I know you've
led more than the JSF spec you're doing
servlet as well this time but some of
the work that you've done with the JSF
expert group and working with the
community has also been one of the
Trailblazers and examples for other spec
leads to follow you want to share a
little bit about work but I want to also
start out with the technical level and
say that the CDI Specht the bean
validation spec and the JSF spec have a
long history of being close together
when we did JSF 2.0 we added support for
bean validation and bean validation is
also used in CDI right yeah so I want to
give a special shout out to go to our
Ling who did a great job with that spec
and his expert group as well but the web
tier and unifying on CDI that's one of
the themes we had in JSF 2.3 which is a
part of Java EE we made CI the official
model solution because we had our own
thing called managed beans which was a
simpler solution that didn't use dynamic
proxying something
still liked it for its simplicity but
you know it doesn't take you as far it
doesn't have producers and all the great
stuff they have in CDI so for Java
evening 8 we actually did deprecated the
JSF managed beans and to do that we had
to introduce more broad-based CDI
support so the JSF spec for Java EE 8
has a very good level of CDI support in
it yeah I just want to say that since
its start with CDI 1o CDI has been a
great aid and simplifying the platform
and has been a great framework for
integration with our other jsr so we've
tried to leverage it as much as possible
to support ease of development but I
also want to give a good shout out about
Antoine's work in leading the CDI expert
group as as platform spec lead part of
my job is to monitor what goes on in
other expert groups and I have to say I
was very very impressed with a degree of
transparency that you fostered the
amount of traffic on the mailing list
both from expert group members and from
members of the community for all the
interaction that you've had and hangouts
and so on I think it was truly a great
job so thank you congratulations that
was well-deserved yeah kudos to you on
that oh yeah and speaking of you know
shoutouts to the communities so also
last night at the JCB party we had the
most significant jsr award and again a
Java EE eight spec was awarded that it
was actually the security API so we
don't have the spec League for that one
here today but Linda do you want to
share a little bit about the
significance of the security API yes
this one took a little bit to get off
the ground but I have to say you know
our speckly did a great job Archon x who
kicked in as an expert group member and
helped write some of the specification I
think the the collaborative work in this
expert group and the amount of progress
they were able to make in a short period
of time was really impressive and I
think of all the new jsr is the - the
several new jsr that we
that this was certainly well deserving
of an award so again congratulations to
jsr 375 great job yeah I was happy to
see that recognition and Edie you were
nominated as well I think even being
nominated is significant being
recognized I did win many years ago in
the Sunday's Award winner yeah so yeah
maybe show everybody if people haven't
been to Java when they don't know that
about the ribbons that we have for the
JCP did you show those ribbons oh there
we go yeah what do you have there you
have star speckly that's the one I'm
most proud of because I you know a nice
trophy and it had a trophy yeah it comes
with I mean it's a real thing this is a
real community with real people in it
and one of the things that I have to say
that the JCP has given to me in my life
is the ability to feel like I'm working
on something that other people are
building on and developing prosperity
from and it's you know a real important
thing like people have built companies
around the stuff that we've done and
they're they're feeding families they're
making lives and that's a real thing
when you move into the cloud where the
motivation is cutting cost and reducing
headcount it's not the same satisfaction
in fact it's quite the opposite so what
I've got from JCP is a sense of reward
like okay I'm making things better
rather than accelerating the race to the
bottom that's nice anything you want to
share with us Linda I of course
appreciate that I mean obviously clearly
I've built my career working with the
Java developer community going on 17
years now so they must be doing
something good for me in terms of
motivating me and making it feel like
you know we can make a difference in
terms of changing the future so
definitely I guess I'm another lifer so
I would support that oh yeah since the
very beginning of the JCP way back when
you and what's it meant for your career
to be involved with the community and
working on java like it's it's something
that makes you share things feedback and
usually good feedback sometimes bad but
it's very rewarding to have people
coming back to you and saying thank you
for watching on I use your stuff every
day and it's great and that's that's the
best reward we can have you can feedback
coming from the community I mean any
feedback is good I mean I think the bad
feedback that you might perceive as
negative is actually a growth
opportunity right so I know that it's
enabled me to be able to take more
feedback in and learn how to you know
process it and how to turn it in the
direction that will be positive for
growth moving forward and resolving
differences that there will always exist
within the community so that's an
important skill for anybody but
particularly these days for developers
because increasingly you're working with
people in different parts of the world
you're working with people in different
companies I mean the whole moto
development has changed from closed to
open and more collaboration so all of
these skills are going to help you as
you grow your career as a developer so I
think the feedback thing is you know
haters gonna hate
right so I've as the speckly for JSF
we've been quite a punching bag and also
egb has gotten some of that to grab
opportunities taking the lessons and
we've applied it and everyone's like oh
yeah tirado is much better and EJB is
even you know gotten better over the
years you know yeah I would say that one
of the exercises I went through when we
were launching AJ b3o which was the
great simplification of EJB was to
actually go through and read all the
criticisms that I could find of EJB all
the counter examples all the nasty
things that have been said and published
about us and it was a good learning
experience because if you look at that
objectively then you can say well what's
the truth here and what do we really
need to address
yeah you're right ad that's true yeah I
just wanted to add about negative
feedback in fact the few feature that we
added to CDI to come from negative
feedback and one of the achievement as I
was most proud of is having someone
something something a bit nasty or with
aggressive and stop the discussion and
like the people create a ticket for the
feature and complete the feature and go
back to Gaia say okay we listen to you
know chime this feature will be included
in next next release it's a great yeah I
think that's the whole idea right so we
want the developer community to share
their feedback we have the JCP and the
mechanisms put in place in order to
enable that community transparency
participation feedback so we really do
want to encourage more of that even if
it's not going to be positive feedback
to share feedback of how you're using
the technology and what we can do to
improve it so I really appreciate
hearing from you spec leads today thanks
for making your time I know that during
Java 1 you're so busy so many things so
many people want to talk to you but
thanks for sharing some of your say
enjoy the rest of your Java 1 thanks for
the opportunity yeah thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
