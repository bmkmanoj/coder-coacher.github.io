this talk it's about text of
applications it's very encouraging to
see so many faces in a time when web
apps are a thing yeah they're all the
rage I'm excelled Reese and this is
Andres I'll be right a little bit about
us we are Mexicans so that's probably
the accent you're hearing but we live in
Switzerland and we love chocolate we
love chocolate engines we work in
commune which is as a context mortgage
company we have another candle in the
audience and recovers we are all over
the world probably have heard that the
joke last year that this conference
should be renamed to canoe one just
because we happen to have so many talks
within the surf you can even have
sixteen talks just for people from can
you that's great and of course we work
with Java based technologies that's what
we hear we also love the groovy and we
work in other open source projects as
much as we can we participate in helping
communities and one of the reasons why
we here is that we want to talk about
the great from favor for which we bought
both work together in for a couple of
years now and we believe this is a good
choice for you guys to test out and see
how you can create tests of applications
in this case targeting job effects
explicitly so is it safe to assume that
most of you guys have working experience
which are effects yes who is new to Jai
effects
oh great well this is the place where
you can learn to have not just is talked
about so many different things in this
conference you find many many thank you
many talks related to this particular
topic all right well well big put the
beginning with which kind of view I talk
you do you choose from I don't know what
you know but besides swing and jaw
effects we have more choices and the
pain of the choice that you take you
will go in one path that will take you
perhaps it will be a fun path perhaps it
will be a very unproductive path so if
you like SWT and dealing with the OSGi
and doing the guacamole play with
finding the right plugin just go with
that one I'm not trying to watch the
clips it just it is what it is it's very
hard to configure plugins so to do there
your bidding if you're just starting
Linux then just go with GDK or you want
to use something that looks like the
effects in the old days you might
remember they all got they are the guys
that have son before Jeff x1 and
JavaScript people looks a little bit
like that but it's dead for that DSL it
uses XML so people that love XML will
find this toolkit to be a really nice
thing people like ourselves that really
don't fancy XML too much we try to stay
away from this thing and of course swing
and Qt but say that you pick one of
these toolkits what other problems are
will be facing well first of all the one
that I am with me a lot it was there
wasn't that directory structure
sometimes we have problems with our
building tools sometimes the next herb
application were unresponsive because we
were we were not working
the UI thread we were doing all our
computations in that in there so we kept
that lacking effect exactly so how did
you pick us so what do you do how do you
do build one of these applications if
you were building a web app well do you
pick one of those very famous web
frameworks and they just follow the
instructions but how many desktop
applications frameworks are out there
not that many if you if you use our CP
applications well you can say well I
follow the NetBeans platform do
Netherlands a NetBeans RCP or you go
with Eclipse our CP Howard you go with
nothing more that's the point so if you
had to build your own desktop in from
the from the star from from the get-go
you have to pick the bill to sit and is
it maven is it Gradle this is something
else or then later
what stick the application is structure
they use something that makes sense for
your project and when you never go to
the next project what do you do you copy
over do you restart and do something
completely different how do you find
yourself around in a particular desktop
project how do you test these things you
just use unit testing is there some kind
of unique functional testing support for
the toolkit that you chose how do you
deploy these things how many people are
actually deployed using applets no no no
hands no hands years ago how many people
deploy with web start only a few hands
yeah and do you like working with a jnlp
syntax kind of right how do you package
this thing did you do again do you
deploy it just as an airplane web start
or you use RPN Debian dmg and Universal
installer so there are many choices but
every choice has is responsibilities you
have to know how to configure the tool
there are no sensible defaults you have
to learn the documentation sometimes
it's good sometimes it's bad and
and in the end again how do you applaud
once you have packaged this thing how do
you deliver this tune to your customers
it's just a simple sit drop or see there
are many choices so I want to show
something we would W be back in history
let's go back 11 years and there's this
language that appear in the scene called
Ruby who Harrison has worked with Ruby
before okay a few hands I know you guys
love it
because otherwise you wouldn't have
raised your hand groobie is perfect well
can be perfect it's perfect able it's
enjoyable Ruby and the reason why we
talk about groovy is it is because a
group a developer said we can do better
than just a static Java Java is very
very posed there are other languages out
there that can do better things like
closures we finally got close just in
JDK 8 perhaps too late
you killed your squash using groovy
since 2003 11 years ago inside the JVM
but that's besides the point
you could do crazy stuff and really
dynamic stuff with groovy okay
so fast-forward and what you see here is
an example of something that we like to
call builders so on the top side we have
something that looks like a DSL for
those of you guys that remember
JavaScript one this is kind of the stuff
that we used to do with JavaScript
it is a DSL allows you to define nodes
and widgets and components with
properties and they layout and the
hierarchy structure within components is
right there upper into your eyes if you
do this without a DSL like you would
regularly do with planes effects too or
swing you got getters and setters and
you get lost in complexity just making
sure that one component can be added to
another container so the DSL right there
creates the dialogue in the bottom and
you can see there is a top component
called panel and Miglia out the best
layout that is ever thank you very much
Michael
and about a panel and some other
components
right so not that difficult and we can
do the same thing with JavaFX as a
matter of fact there exists a project
called groovy effects uses groovy s at
yourself and you can apply to any jar
effects note so just substitute names
instead of panel it will probably be
border pain for creating the border pain
from John effects
they'll be label and text field and
password field that makes sense for J
effects too so very easy to move around
so this is a really good idea because we
are having a small compact code base
it's very expressive but it's not enough
I mean this is swing pad it's really
nice for doing quick prototypes
you cannot go better than this but we
want to go a little further right you
can start creating on UI using a DSL and
yeah it shows up a nice setup and a nice
layout boot once you start adding
behavior when you start adding
customizations like CSS and whatnot a
simple DSL is not enough you need more
and as I said before this is around 2003
2005 2005 the JVM space had a huge
earthquake this guy happened
Javad offers found a way to create web
applications in a different way in a
much much fun way and a much productive
way it so happens that you cannot use
java with this bad boy you had to learn
Ruby so they started a huge migration of
Java people going into the Ruby space
because it made sense somehow they
provide structure and repeatable way of
doing things that improve our experience
so it was a good idea and so some people
thought what if we can have those things
back inside the JVM space well there is
groovy remember the language that is
very close to Ruby why can't we create a
web framework that does the same thing
and they decided to create Rails and now
some of you that know Grails is really
big it's being used by a hundred
fourteen hundred companies the company
that the Wonder
topmast uses it for his music store if
you guys didn't know that so we're
talking about web frameworks but the top
is also about desktop applications what
if we could well that's too fast what if
we could apply the same ideas behind
rails and grills but for desktop
applications sake invention of a
configuration test support
out-of-the-box
command-line to plug-in frameworks and
whatnot this is what Griffin is this is
what we have done since 2008 so Griffin
is not that new it's it's already mature
but there is one thing that we're going
to say in just a moment about this
particular framework we decided to go
with Griffin just because many of the
projects in the groovy echo system used
AGR to name their projects and with our
well Griffin's of house a mythical
creature somehow related to the
Arthurian meters and well why are 30
meters because we've grown closer to
Grails okay that was a bad pun in the
old days in the Griffin one which is
freely available since last release 1/5
since the beginning of the year you had
to download it configure a path variable
and use a command the Griffin command
right with the latest releases that we
have made we're pushing the next release
- oh very soon you can use Gradle or you
can use maven so we are not imposing a
specific build environment to do now you
are free to choose whatever is best why
is this good because if you have a
Griffin application that consumes other
libraries but next to your project you
might want to create a multi build
project this takes away the problem of
dealing with a snapshot dependencies
doesn't matter which built on you use it
doesn't matter if it's built and/or
Gradle it's natural dependencies are
always a problem to deal with but if you
use a multi project build you can use
that with maven which kind of works with
the reactor
and and we can say personally that
working with multi-project bills in
grill works
lividly much much better it's not a
silver bullet it doesn't solve all
problems but it definitely was much
better than maybe that's our experience
yes we now can support maven in Gradle
in a very friendly way and a little bit
another thing we would like to mention
is that we're working with lazybones
it's another project from from the Guru
because it's yes so I guess the guys
that work with maven how do you
initialize with projects you copy and
paste for an existing one that already
works or they use maven archetypes we
probably should be using maven
archetypes but first how do you find the
correct archetype there are so many
other and how do you need slice them and
once you initialize a project with maven
archetypes the archetype goes away your
project has been fully initialized what
did you need to create further artifacts
for example a new controller or a new
GSP page something like that the
archetype is already gone
has no tie to the project lazybones is
different in this respect that it will
allow you to bootstrap any kind of
project could be Gradle
could be maven could be anything it's
completely agnostic and once it does it
also has this feature called generators
which allows you to create additional
files or additional artifacts somehow
try to delete original variables that
you used to create the project so is
this additional it made a data that goes
along so yeah and I'm going to show you
what we mean by this and it's a great
thing because we in the past with the
previous version of Gryphon
we again we're having like kind of like
a monolithic build and now we're fully
open if you want to use maybe archetypes
to work with Griffin you can do it or if
you wanna use lazybones you can do it or
if you want to create an application by
copy and pasting from an existing one
because what you can do it
convention over configuration but we're
no we're open to anything that you're
working with we don't want to impose
anything okay
so the big announcement is that we have
released Griffin to today it's finally
available and you can use it right now
if you want to and we are about to show
you how you can make use of these things
so this took us 15 minutes so I have a
challenge for undress and that's what
he's going to show you
he has 45 minutes or less to create our
running desktop application at the end
of the session so yes so how many -
Marisa said I could create a desktop
application in 40 minutes
Wow let's see how can I do that well the
first thing is I'm going to rely on
these other tools that we were
mentioning lazybones Gradle maybe and
whatnot you have to install them somehow
you have to get an in your system the
way that we recommend to install
lazybones and Grails is to use another
smallish project called GBM this guy
installs this is referring to the groovy
environment manager I I think we have
Network so let's see the homepage for
this thing is called GBM tool dotnet
okay and you can install all these
projects all these projects rely on a
command line based tool you can see
there is Griffin there this is actually
grid from one we are going to use lazy
bones and Gradle for Griffin - so that
there is no confusion and this is Joe a
simple shell script it works in pretty
much every major platform yes even on
Windows if you see Qin because otherwise
what we for others showed you will be
using on Windows it is not cygwin
yeah well baboon is a different
combination of cygwin but yeah you
regard something that is sane and posix
say that you already have GBM stone the
next step will be do GBM install
lazybones and this will query the lazy
the GBM server see if you have the
latest version if not then it will
download it and what is interesting
about GBM it will probably tell me that
i already have the latest version
installed no actually let's grade to the
latest one let's pray to the demo gods
that this works ok yeah so I can do
lazybones version I think no c'mon help
please help no info is for a template if
item is taken yeah
so I had to supply attic but anyway this
should be the latest one let me try a
last one now GBM list lazybones let's
use GBM alright there we go
this character the showcases that this
is the version that I currently have
selected I only have this to install so
this is a nice thing gbn allows you to
switch between versions if you don't
have something installed it will
download it for you and put it and
configure I can do the same thing for
Gradle let's see which version of Gradle
I already have there are so many
versions out there and I currently have
Gradle too let's select Grail two one
GBM use Gradle two one there we go
so now we're using this one so what we
the next step let's create an
application lazy bones create Gryphon
before I do that how how can we tell
which applications can we create we need
some kind of templates
let's ask lazybones think is lazy bones
list okay so these are the different
templates that I can apply to create
different projects but these are the
ones that I had configured for the
Griffon lazy bones templates so I have
combinations I can create a full Java
version that targets JavaFX or I can use
groovy or Lanterna or people to swing so
we support for different toolkits by
out-of-the-box let's go with jar effects
because that's the whole point of this
talk lazy bones create the name of the
template - effects let's make it Java
and you say to do I will name it J let's
put it to do okay so this will ask me a
few questions this is exactly the same
as you will figure out if you're using
maven archetypes we supply some sensible
defaults so we're going through the
motions and alright it's done it tells
us that this is the application
structure this is interesting because
even though this Griffin - does not use
the stand the previous build to that we
have follows the same structure so if
you have created a group of wine
application before migrating to Griffin
- is easy the documentation that sticks
out there for Griffin - also applies to
most of the stuff that probably from one
also applies for most stuff that you see
in Griffin - so remember that we said
something about application
structure we have here a common
instruction if you know where your
models if you have models in your in
your application then should go into the
models directory controllers take care
charge of the logic so they go right
there same goes for the views services
and any other can of artifacts so let's
do see this thing in motion you said
that I was tasked with creating an app
desktop application in less than 45
minutes well so happens that I just did
I can do Gradle run and using the
sensible defaults this will compile
package the application and launch it I
see that in a moment I think that the
yeah just resolve the dependencies
networks a little bit flaky and there we
go
it's definitely not in not a very
impressive application plain Java Java
effects you can tell Michael we're not
using Miglia for this one we should yeah
but if you click here there is some text
changing right we're I'm going to show
the calc here we're using binding
because that's the whole point of java
effects alright let's look at the code
let's make this thing big everything
lives inside here the Griffin
app directory not that's the yes that
will change the text size once we see
this okay for example the model
creating jfx properties in java is
halibut verbose we know we have to is
come like javabeans conventions getters
and setters a fire event creating a jfx
property requires you to create
something that extends from the property
super type and then have a getter and a
setter that takes the plane value and
wrap it around the property and the
property initializer this is very
important what whether you initialize
the property directly here and class
loading are you using in lazy mode just
be careful when you do it in lazy mode
that should happen within the UI thread
because it doesn't happen in that way
bad things might happen standard Java we
use jsr 330 all over the place when it's
needed so we can inject interesting
things here let's look at the controller
it's another archetype and an artifact
in this case desire of type controller
and here we have the action for this
thing we will see in a moment what this
thing means actually with this trading
application because when we are updating
things inside the white thread or
outside UI thread we have to pay
attention
finally the view the view is where we
find most of the code this is the Java
safe stuff we have F F F XML so we can
inject stuff you were reading F XML
standard Java effects classes and here
we load here somewhere we load the F XML
we grab the stuff and can you see where
we make the connection with the button
let's show the effects ml inside the
resources notice the name of this class
is org example to do view and somehow it
matches to or example to do F XML so we
use convention over configuration if you
want to use a different effects ml file
in a different location
then you explicitly tell it during the
alotta from f xml call otherwise this
thing knows up I know what the
convention is so I'm going to try to
find the effects ml in the right place
in the class but if it's found it will
load it and do whatever is needed to the
effects of a loader so in this sample we
see there are indeed there is indeed a
great pain again should have been a
meekly out pain with two children notes
one is the label and another is a button
and we use a special naming conventions
here with this ID that you see right
there if you name a button or any other
clickable object or actionable object
following the suffix action target then
the griffon runtime can connect this
thing use the names see this thing is
click here it will go back to the
controller this what happens at the name
of the action is also click and in the
view the only thing that we need to do
here is just connect those actions if we
do not use these conventions what you
will usually have to do in Java effects
is grab a reference to the button grab a
reference to the controller and match
these things together in F XML you can
also say I want to use a particular
controller here and in the action
property use a special notation that
tries to match a public method on that
controller but what what what happens if
you do this what happens with reading it
may go wrong because if you click the
button the action that you link directly
in this controller will be booked in
which you thread it will be the UI trail
and if this button you are opening a
connection to the network or a
connection to the database that is a big
no-no we should not run computational
logic inside the right thread yeah we
don't worry too much in Griffin because
by default every action that you run in
the controller or is tied to a
controller is wrong outside of the UI
thread
you don't have to do anything this
particular use case we are just updating
a model property and pushing the value
directory to the label so this is very
simple and we are reading a body from
the UI and sending back their value
again into the UI so in this case it
makes sense to have this action wrong
inside the UI thread there are four
values that you can configure for this
annotation run inside the I trade in a
synchronous mode this is the default or
run inside synchronous mode this kind of
like swing utilities in bulk and weight
or run outside of the white thread or
simply escape if you do a skip it will
just use the same thread as they embark
in this case will be the UI thread
because you're reacting to a push on the
button so far so good okay so this
application is quite simple and I've run
it again okay let's run it again so what
do you want to do well in Griffin what
about five we had this well it was also
briefed on two we have support for the
icons and the main you yeah sadly a
person something is not well done with a
default way that we run Java effects
here this should be an icon here and
this should be the proper name of the
application when you run with standard
Java effects without packaging you find
that it's something else but this is
just during development so don't worry
too much about the icon or the name of
the menu it will be the right thing
during the run it will be the right
thing during deployment age okay how
many lines of code do we have here
because we use Gradle then we have
access to different plugins there
happens to be a plugin called stats that
can give you this kind of stuff so
roughly nine lines of nine files with a
hundred I define slice of code for the
Java version let me show you what
happens if we run the groovy version
so let's initialize a project called
reusing lazybones create Griffin JavaFX
groobie this would be this will be the
cool one okay just because without
groovy
notice that the default will be kind of
the same thing we're gonna change the
name of the application here of the same
class so that we can compare apples to
apples and let's change it to cool one
and do great or run and download
additional artifacts that were needed
and boom there we go
so same application right same behavior
that's does that's the right thing to
say
but if I showed you the code this will
be a groovy code and there's a model the
model how many lines of code that we had
to create an observable properties
effects how many ways do we have to
exclude us and should you ourselves in
the food trying to create up property
effects too many but in case of groovy
we have access to something called the
ast transformation framework that allows
you to generate byte code at compile
time this annotation called add effects
observable generates bytecode at the end
of the day once you compile this thing
this of several property will be exactly
the same as if you have written
everything by hand then we look at the
controller again shorter more concise
there is a lot of brevity what I we like
about groovy is that the essence of the
code is right there Java we love Java
but it's very verbose in some areas
groovy makes it easier to understand
what we're doing here
is quite remarkable and I mean what
that's one of the reasons I they're
pushing like the benefits of lambda in
Java 8 because it's well and it's true I
mean we can see it we have it for some
years now in Java because you can invoke
groovy code from Java well we can go
into that discussion if you want about
groovy Java and how to be happy in your
work but the point here is that we are
very expressive in a few lines of code
so it's easy to write code and later ok
because as you remember for the
technical keynotes more important to
read code and sometimes it's important
for our machine to understand the code
and run it but it's more important for
us developers to read the code and
understand it and be able to change it
so finally let me show you the view you
remember that the Java FX version we use
FX ml to use some kind of declarative UI
well here we use groovy effects and we
used it this DSL that remember what I
told you in the beginning so at the top
level there is an application node that
will perhaps result to a stage or
something else so the the griffon
runtime can shield you from if you're
running in an applet mode or you're
running western mode the standard mode
the application node knows exactly what
to do you can set the same standard
properties on a stage as you would do in
this node and then you see the scene
same properties found in the Java acts
scene scene object and then the grid
pane and because that DSL we open the
braces and everything that is inside the
Gripen will become the children
components of the grid pane the Gripen
will be the container we can do binding
the standard affix binding and another
great thing here again the conventions
the griffon runtime is you run in the
groovy mode knows that if you have an
action of whatever name in the
controller let's look that one the name
is click it can create an object whose
name is click action and you can bind it
to the button or
or the total bottom whatever is needed
and the bottom will then configure
itself so one thing that is missing from
the JFX API is that we believe is
definitely missing is an action
abstraction you will find this option
extraction in controls effects it's an
an open source project that lives
outside of the JDK you will also find an
action obstruction in groovy effects so
there we see this this missing piece and
we take charge now and we reuse this
abstraction and you can use it right
here in a DSL finally let's see how many
lines of code we have so remember the
Java version 185 nine files same
behavior but in this case we have
skinned the fat a little bit a hundred
and twelve lines of code so laser
paucity more readability and
interestingly enough what we do here in
Griffin 2 is we don't push you to use
groovy we don't force you to use groovy
in grid from 1 you will always have to
use the grief they group each are a drag
way around even if you do not use groovy
in Griffin too if you use the Java
version only the groovy jar is not added
so you get away with 7 megabytes of
dependencies that are not needed why do
we do this thing not just because we
don't want to first groovy if you don't
want to use it but also you can target
you know you can target Java FX
applications to run in embedded spaces
like raspberry pies if you're running in
an embedded device you really need to
care a lot about the deployment size
right if you have to drag alone 7
megabytes of groovy even you don't need
it well you have to pay the price but if
you're using Java only let's go back to
that example the name of the
applications to do let's do just Gradle
I think it's called this sip
we use the standard plugins that come
with Gradle and this generates a file
inside build distributions we got a zip
file with the name of the application
and the version so let's unzip this
thing let's go inside and do a tree
right there so the application the the
bill to has created for us a launcher
and all the jars are needed to run this
application it included the fxrt jar I
think it shouldn't be there so let's
remove that jfx rder and if we calculate
how much space we have here is just
around two megabytes if we do the same
thing for the groovy application which
will know it the cool one let's do
Gradle test sip well one second capital
C resolving the Pence's I think we
should have everything already network
yeah okay there we go now we change to
build distributions then unzip on zip
code one there we go
let's go inside cool one and do a tree
we definitely have much more
dependencies here let's remove J effects
our team because it's not needed and
that's not CD RM and how many space do
we have here ten megabytes that is
because of groovy but no you sure
this how do we do is to do this thing
well well if we look at the build file
here we're just looking at them at the
Gradle build file at the moment we get
many plugins that we believe are useful
for building applications applied
already by default and one of them I
think yeah this plug-in the Griffon
plugin applies orders by default which
one of them is the application plugin is
a standard Gradle this is the one that
creates the launch scripts and packages
all the libraries is to where to do this
in maven which we happen to have well
there's the information here why because
we're hiding a lot inside this master
pump we're using a master pump to
configure pretty much every single
plug-in that you can have access to by
default but I can show you how this
thing looks like inside made inside my
maven repository got it in locals of
code house with application master poem
this is the latest version okay okay so
this is a huge mailing file but in the
many things that it configures there are
so many plugins and dependencies that it
has access to it up it applies a profile
let me show you the profile shade where
is the run profile let's search for run
and well too many wrong configurations
here there is
right here the wrong profile you have to
use X SEC maven plugin with particular
version configure the main class ok and
in this case we're binding the whole
thing to a particular go so I can invoke
this thing easily with maven let's see
that maven exact Java and here we find
one thing that I don't like about maven
and its plug-in ecosystem sometimes some
plugins have no idea about the other
plugins it will be obvious to me that if
I want to run a class like this the
sources should have been compiled we
have seen this incredible I just simply
say great will run and because of the
dependencies it knows it has to compile
the code but you have to bind something
else right so you have to do extra
configuration whereas in the Gradle one
it knows that already so if I'd run the
maven exact Java it will fail because it
will first download all that Venice's
that needs and it'll says it fails
because it doesn't fire the code so what
you have to do usually in this case will
be ok
it's you will have to do something like
compile and then this this is why we use
in profiles because instead of waiting
for that just enable the run profile and
this knows exactly what to do yeah so
nice Ronnie how do you apply this thing
but you had to configure that they paint
the assembly plug-in most likely and I
think we have it yeah distribution right
here you configure the assembly plug-in
a set some descriptors you have to
create the launch scripts by yourself
because the assembly project plug-in
doesn't do this thing so it's very
powerful because you can pretty much
configure everything you want but
lacking and you have to configure
everything that you need Gradle has more
sensible defaults and
there's all sensible defense make no
sense to you you can't change them this
is why I believe using Gradle is a
little bit better because the default
gives you a long makes you a long way so
that's that's what we have at the moment
for maven it's not like we want to or we
need to bash on maven it's just that
well it's more verbose you have to
configure more things the application
plug-in in Gradle is somewhere of many
other conventions we're at the assembly
plugging in maven has no notion of the
bill helper or the exact Java so you
have to configure a few more things you
have to change to change these plugins
in a way which is possible to do so does
that that come answers a little bit
about deployment because we all do
packages sip but you can also configure
the easy pack plug-in or a debian or RPM
plugins body maven and Gradle and you
you're good to go
one thing we do for default in Gradle
it's config you're running on OSX it's
configure the dmg plugin for you so you
just have to do Gradle
create dmg and you will see an image in
just a moment let's see that takes is
taking longer than I expected
you can change all the settings for each
one of these tasks come on it's taking a
bit longer there we go finished there we
got a dmg okay so let's open that the
engine should be inside distributions
call one dmg there we go
we get this double-click and now you see
that it has the right name it has the
right icon on deployment and the
application works and it's Java fix much
much easier than before
ok
is there any other thing that we should
do testing yes we say something about
testing unfortunately the the project
that we selected for testing test
effects is still in flux
so we haven't added to the test support
that we have in Griffin let me show what
I let me show you what I mean by that
let's do let's remove the build and the
target directories for a moment if we do
a tree here in tests we say that we have
a unit test for our controller if we
want to test this application using a
functional style then we use test
effects because then we drive the UI
directly if I show you this test is just
for the logic it's actually very very
simple very base one
where's it here inside groovy we support
J unit or Spock this is a simple groovy
paste J unit test case because we're
unit testing you have to make sure that
the JavaFX
platform is initialized that's why we're
using that trick once this class is a
statically load it initializes the UI
toolkit by creating an instance of a
swing panel that's the simplest way to
do it
the other way that you have to do it is
create a java application and use the
standard load and launch mechanism this
is why we haven't really got test
effects added to the
Griffen support because they currently
rely on a very specific application
subclass and Griffin has to be
initialized in a different way so once
we reach this barrier you should be able
to create applique in this way let me
show you how a standard I effects test
cases test case is so this one anyone
here used fast with swing before we
believe that fast is the best way to
test swing applications maybe you have
seen Jamie Jamie is quite Burpo's try to
find components and making assertions on
components fast is definitely much it is
less verbose and it drives the essence
up to the surface test effects is also
it's kind of the same thing it's kinda
like the fest for Java effects so once
you have initialized the application in
this case and you know which node which
UI component you want to test you find
it using a simple DSL you can use CSS
selectors if you have added IDs and CSS
classes to your UI components which most
likely you would do and then make
assertions on them you can use hamcrest
matters or you can use j assert also and
the idea eventually will be that instead
of using get root note here you will you
just grab directly from the application
itself there will object will be the
scene or the text field or the pane on
which you are interested if I were to
show you the swing version here grip no
not Griffin lazybones version one create
Griffin
swing Java many names nothing
a quick one this with a quick project to
turn survey into quick do mate on this
thing let's change into the tests the
kind of test that we see here or Kosovo
Java will be functional equivalent to
what we saw before we use change unit
rules to bootstrap the application using
well you can inject marks if you want to
but interesting here he is in the
integration test this is what you will
see eventually enjoy effects with test
effects almost the same API a rule that
bootstraps the application with the
right components in this case you will
be a stage or a window that targets Java
effects and the DSL on which you can
find components and make assertions
instead of fast you will use test
effects this is our code so that once we
have this integration then you just have
to go into the command line and do
Gradle integration test and it will just
just run this particle test wrong name
camelcase
download whatever jars are needed and
you see that very quick let's run that
again Oh
why because this is one thing that I
like about Gradle the tests were agreed
the first time so I don't need to run it
again so let's clean that yeah what
happens with maven is that you tell it
to run the interior so Stacy will run
every single time in Gradle it's a smart
enough to figure out nothing has changed
so there's nothing else that I need to
do if you clean the results they you'll
see those tags being executed again so
what we see in here right now we swing
is possible to do with Jar effects is
your run test effects and again the
promise is that in the next release as
soon as we can we will make sure that
test effects is fully integrated with
the test framework with their framework
so that you can do this thing that we're
doing with swing but with Java fix all
right so this is pretty much what we
have for you guys I think it was
exciting enough so that you can give
Gryphon a try
as I said before is a very mature
framework it has close to seven years
now in the making
the latest release to our release today
almost life on stage and you have seen
that you can use both Gradle or maven
plugins they will be coming soon ah
there's one thing I should say and we
should mention is that what about
documentation yeah
good the griffon website is live we use
a ski duct to build this thing here's a
simple quick start as we saw today
configure JVM lazybones Gradle configure
the repository so you can find the
templates check that you can find the
template create an application run it as
we just did on this stage there is a new
section where you can find the different
announcements that we have made in the
past like Gryphon to release date
documentation I mentioned before there
is a book on Griffon one hopefully we
can have a deal for Griffon to in the
future the different versions of the
guide the Javadoc for the runtime api
and a pretty v version of this is just
java to java to HTML run on the sources
if you look at to the guide also built
with asciidoc it has many many things
that you can find we just scratched the
surface of what you can do with a
Griffin application if you want to know
more about the different toolkits that
we support this is the same application
written in swing jar effects Lanterna
and PBOT here are some scriptures of the
same behavior different UI toolkits you
want to know more about the DSL about
the years are bindings how to migrate
from Griffin 1 to Griffin to build tool
support you name it everything is here
as a side effect or supporting Gradle
and maven we no longer require an IDE
tool so you can use right now Griffin 2
with IntelliJ eclipse netbeans as long
as you have maven support or Gradle
support enable in this tool kit and this
idea is you're good to go
there's nothing else that is needed
alright so thank you very much
if you have any questions we'll be happy
to take them now yes
it is that Grif is a Gradle plugin call
stats is where is it right here this one
sadly there is no maven plug-in that
does did at the moment it will be
greatest somebody will create this this
plugin was born out of the codebase of
Griffin won and was ported to grade also
any grade of not just Griffin projects
can use this plugin and the layout that
you see will be different according to
that particular project we have some
Griffin stickers right here in front and
512 for t-shirts like this ones if you
want them they're large so any more
questions well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
