cool in Java 8 and new in Java 9 if we
have time at the end I'll show you a
couple of demos
if not we'll make do with all of the
content in the slide so standard
disclaimer when I talk about what's in 9
these are our current plans such subject
to change so it's not a promise it's
just the current plans ok don't write a
contract based on that about myself I'm
a director of product management with
the Java platform group with Oracle I've
been in charge of the JDK since joining
Oracle through the Senate position so I
was one of those guys that join bulk in
2010 before that I worked at Sun
Microsystems support management for in
the Java team as well not directly with
the JDK at the time and before that I
worked a little bit in Florida I got an
MBA from MIT and a systems engineering
degree from University aneema in case my
name didn't give it away it wasn't
really from here so first the first part
is Java 8 one of the biggest updates
ever to a major language at the time the
editor of dr. Dobbs this one is actually
the one thing that I'm most proud of
that was part of the team that came out
with JDK 8 now that's the current
version of the JDK and I'm going to give
you a very rich content how many people
here are developers good I'm in the
right conference so how many people here
are using Java 8 ok most seven
six five four three two don't be ashamed
there's one of you out there now okay so
for those of you that are used in Java 7
or later these will be new for the guys
that are using Java 8 I imagine you'll
see the part of eight anybody here has
tried JDK nine early access and why not
you first we'll go through it so let me
tell you a little bit about JDK 8 and
there's a lot more than this but you
know these are the most interesting
parts of it land expressions
default methods method references and a
little overview of the day time API and
then I'll just give you the eye chart X
for all of the other features so that
you can go and find more about it the
first part anybody here programs with
JavaScript or Ruby or Python ok so
you're familiar with lambda expressions
right the idea is that you can pass data
I'm sorry you can pass behavior around
as you can pass data so everybody's
familiar with the concept of I have a
variable I'm going to put a number in
there number is data the idea of lambda
expressions is I can do the same with
behavior not just data but behavior now
so as an example this is using the new
enhanced for-loop right if I wanted to
remove everybody in a collection that
it's greater than 18 and looking for you
know like only the people under 18 how
would I remove it using this construct
in the enhanced for-loop operator I do
not have any method for calling it out
so if I wanted to try this right this is
I'm just going to show you a little bit
how the lambda how lambdas change the
way we design API so if I wanted to do
this I would actually have to go and
switch back to the long form that was
available before JDK 5 where I use an
iterator and that's because I need the
iterators remove button so I just added
a lot of boilerplate in order to be able
to just remove some
for my collection right there's a better
way but until JDK 8 it was really hard
to do this the right way
ideally what we would like is for there
to be some sort of interface that would
allow me to pass on behavior and then
for the designers of the collections to
provide a virtual method called remove
if ok and remove a footwork by passing
in a collection and passing it the
predicate so what am I going to do and
it would magically go to the collection
and remove everybody now we could have
created this in JDK 7 but it would have
been very painful to use because the
only way for passing this behavior you
know here's the collection people a
bunch of people people and then I would
have to have written all of this
boilerplate to pass that functionality
and that's a lot of code for something
very simple so the reality is we didn't
the person that wrote the collection API
didn't feel that this was something that
everybody was going to use and therefore
the collection 80 I didn't have a remove
if now everything in green here it's
really boilerplate using lambdas you can
rewrite this I guess right remove people
then for every person here's the
operation right gauge greater than 18 so
if this is true and you're going to do
it for everybody
remove them from the collection right so
now you can pass behavior right what am
I going to do with each one of them as
before I could pass data now this is not
just about trying to make the code look
smaller let's show a little bit of a
more complicated example right anybody
what does this code do just by looking
at it quickly
it finds amongst the people in my
collection only from the male's the
highest weight it will throw away the
you know like the females right it takes
a little bit of you know reading to get
that right and if you notice I'm not
just telling you what to do I'm telling
you in which order to do it I'm telling
the collection iterate one person at a
time right get the gender get the way
get the max now we can do this using
lambdas something that looks a little
bit more like the problem statement
right get the list of people filter out
everybody you know just filter the male
and then map you have you heard the
expression Map Reduce this is the map
part right I've got a bunch of people I
need to map it to something and I'm
saying go and look at that wait in this
case I could have looked at the age
whatever right so that's the map part
and then I'm going to reduce it and say
at now instead of having a collection of
people I'm going to have a collection of
weights after the mapping I'm going to
reduce it by saying just give me the max
okay now it's prettier to look at but
the truth is if this was all we were
going to get out of lambda expressions
it was a lot of work to be done in here
we wouldn't have done it just for that
what makes it more interesting is what
happens if you want to rewrite this
because this is still going sequentially
one person at a time and do this
sequentially what if you want to write
this in parallel so that if you have a
bunch of different processors you could
have some processors handle half of the
collection on the other processor JDK 7
we introduced something called the fork
join framework which would pretty much
allow you to do that
you would get a problem you would say
I'm going to chunk it into smaller
pieces and I'm going to let each
processor or you know handle part of it
and what if I wanted to do this thing in
parallel using the for game framework
the fork joint framework
that you're not supposed to read that
it's just to show you the amount of
boilerplate the stuff in red is actually
how you solve the problem
everything else is the forging framework
now it's not always better to use
parallelism you will pay some price for
this so in many cases the question is
should I do it or not well you know try
it out measure the response and see
which one is better
how many people do you think are willing
to write all of this and we'll get it
right in order to discover that you know
what it was easier to do it sequentially
you know it's small enough of a
collection nobody right now if you go
back for a little example wouldn't it be
great if the people in that D api's
handled that for impart for you so let's
convert this one into the parallel
version done okay
rather than streams I did parallel
streams it may look by the way like this
is traversing through the collection
three times one for filtering one for
mapping one producing this is much
better than that you'll do it all in a
single pass so it's only hitting the
collection once it's very efficient so
that's a little bit of what lambda
expressions do for you we introduced
these in JDK 8 and it has changed the
way that we code quite a bit it also
introduced a couple of interesting
situations right so that was lambda
expressions now default methods have you
remember do you remember the API called
Nile it's called new IO right and that's
because we had an IO a new input output
interface and then somebody came up with
some improvements to it and we had then
to create a new set of api's for that
called new IO we had a bunch of
collections now we want to add this new
abilities like the remove f4h statement
how would you feel if we tell you yeah
here's a new set of collections
collections - right
because all the other collections they
didn't have these new capabilities and
you already code it for them and in in
Java we wouldn't let you modify a
collection by adding a new method right
that would have been a problem I really
didn't want to see another new
collections API so we introduced another
interesting concept called default
methods you see here we say stream right
collections that didn't have stream in
JDK 7 so how can collections have stream
now what if you've created your own
collections and you didn't implement
stream I'm not going to break your code
here's what we did when you define the
collection interface now you can pass a
default method and the beauty of this is
if you do implement the method right
what you've implemented will be what is
used but if somebody doesn't implement
the method they get one for free this is
like the public defender you know if you
cannot afford an implementation one will
be provided to you free of charge and
this allowed us to create some methods
on collections that already existed and
therefore you can continue using your
collections they magically get new
methods you don't have to choose for new
collections okay so that's major plus
for a decade we did it of course in the
API you can do it on your own code as
well
we also now allowed studying method in
interfaces okay so static methods you
can have zero or more static and another
one that I like is the method references
there's a bunch of lambda expressions
that look like this I'm going to get a
particular variable and I'm just going
to call one method in the variable right
so p-p get name we this is so common and
when we were doing JDK 8 we didn't just
create these new methods we went and we
use them in the jdk libraries itself so
before it even was Reese we had a major
use case with you know hundreds and
thousands of lines of code where we
thought oh let's use this method and we
discovered this was pretty common so
there's a shorthand for it now if you
see this little double column operator
it's the same thing right it's just go
and call to uppercase and that's Method
references you will see that probably
when you start looking into JDK 8 code
now you know what it is
right it's just shorthand for the second
one so in summary lambdas are just
functions these has allow us to create
new api's and now we can use functional
interfaces we've introduced default
methods and method references now that's
for the technical part for the practical
part you know I work with NetBeans most
I des have some sort of tool that will
allow you to automatically convert your
code so that it uses new land
expressions where for example you were
using anonymous inner classes so this is
what it looks like in that means if you
just here's an anonymous inner class and
I'll say use lambda expression poof
we'll convert it so if you're new to
these what I would recommend is go to
some code that you wrote and that you
understand let the tool find some
instances where it can convert what you
wrote to lambda expressions and then
look at it before next to the conversion
and at least it took me I don't know
three or four days of going through
these before it click and I started
writing lambdas myself directly rather
than using any tools to help me and it's
easier to do it with code that you are
familiar with so that you are not
wondering what is it doing and you just
look into the syntax and how it changes
so here's another one
use member references so you see this
one it looks a little bit like what I
explained that little member reference
and it turns it into get a real count so
many tools allow even for batch
refactoring so instead of just going one
file at a time you can just go and say
here's my project could you check the
syntax and make sure that it's using
everything in JDK format and it'll give
you a little before-and-after for each
one of them so that's pretty useful okay
I recommend that you don't just blindly
accept things understand them because
that's the whole point you want to write
these this way from now on okay so as I
said a rich content that's it for
lambdas now I'm going to talk about one
of my other favorite expressions daytime
API
these are 3:10 I believe Stephen Colburn
this is one of those api's that was not
developed by Oracle anybody here heard
of Java time right and before that Java
had its own set of API now there's
nothing wrong with the previous API but
they don't let you assume anything so a
couple of questions anybody knows
whether we're using the Gregorian or the
Julian calendar anybody
okay I'm not gonna put you in a spot
we're using the Gregorian calendar
nowadays next question what's the
difference between those two
Gregorian and Julian anybody yeah in the
Julian calendar the rule is every four
years you get a leap year okay that's
the old one the new one has a little
rule that says except in the years that
are divisible over 100 in which case
they're only live years if they're also
divisible over 400 and the final
question who thinks a developer should
know that before deciding which calendar
to use because the previous API sort of
assumed that you're going to have to
answer all these questions right it also
didn't let you get away with anything
like ignoring time zones if you wanted
to specify a time you would have to tell
me a time zone it wouldn't accept
anything by default and we humans
actually are much more comfortable with
a little leeway right and most of our
problems don't need that level of detail
so show the time and now this new date
and time it's much more intuitive it's
closer to the way we think about date
and times so here we go we replace date
calendar time zone and date format it's
now fluent in mutable thread-safe
and pretty easy to use if you've been
using Java time this will look very
familiar it's the same guy that did the
both of them you can look him up and
he'll explain why he thinks this is the
next level of evolution so there's some
tweaks that he didn't do any other time
that he pulled out in here strong typing
easy formatting and parsing and it's
interoperable so if we were using
calendar date you can just toggle back
and forth units fields and chronologies
he'll explain those and support some
regional calendars it has a bunch of
calendars built in if we have time I'll
give you a little demo of you know a
cool instance of that and it uses ISO
8601 and for those that don't care for
the numbers that's the normal calendar
that way but I use is nowadays so you
have a range of types dates consisting
of year month and day that's when
don't care about time right like local
date local time let's just the time and
if you combine them together there's
another type called local daytime which
looks pretty much like you join those
two together pretty convenient the time
zones are handled separately okay and
there's the instantaneous point in time
instants which is the closest thing that
we have to the previous java.util date
now choose the correct date and time
when designing an application okay local
date stores in year month date most of
these will use the Gregorian calendar
the one that we know one use most of the
time so things like birthdays start
these holiday days when somebody asks
you your birthday you usually follow up
with where in the world where you born
so that they can you know tell you happy
birthday at 7 p.m. because that's when
the times now you just care for the date
right local tanning just the time
there's no date in here so opening hours
on the laptop
wake me up at 6:30 which they every day
ok and the local daytime you just glue
them together you have instant the best
thing for login time cutting and then
you have time zones now the time zones
as you will know the world divided into
different time zones and it's not
mathematical we change the rules on when
you have daylight saving times and they
even change within the same country
based on rules made up by people on the
spot they change year over year so if
you can avoid them and work only with
local times and safe like that Europe
your life will be much simpler if you
can store everything say in universal
time and then convert them only to
output or input much simpler try to do
that we do have time zone information so
if you need these you have four classes
the song ID that's the one that has a
little text that you're familiar with in
the offset that tells you five - five
hours we're here - eight or - seven
depending on the time of the year and
some rules that will tell you when to
switch from one to another and Sunday
time is the one where you keep all of
this now calendar systems main classes
use the ISO calendar system which
matches the Gregorian one which is the
one that we use nowadays not
historically accurate I don't know if
you know that you know we switched from
the Julian calendar to the Gregorian and
different countries did it at different
times there was some offset so some
dates don't actually exist if you look
them up okay
and there's other calendars also
supported here app which is a lunar
calendar and actually one of my favorite
ones for a particular application that
I'll show in a minute
Japanese Mingo Thai Buddhist as far as I
can tell the big difference between
these last three is they're the same as
ours only they have a different year and
that's a gross oversimplification so
somebody can you know cares to educate
me later that's fine the hidden one is a
lot more interesting my mind that's a
lunar calendar okay and it only affects
dates not times of course you have
durations sometimes you don't want to
specify a start and end you just want to
say a duration so three minutes and I
don't want to say starting now and any
three minutes from now it's just three
minutes
you know without a beginning and end and
you have well the duration is you can
think of it as hours and minutes right
it's pre exact then you have the period
which is a little bit more complicated
that's that's remember when I said that
we people are very comfortable with a
little bit of ambiguity with dates and
times years month and day and my example
of this one is if I tell you it's one
month away how many days is that well
depends right it could be 28 30 or 31
and we're okay with that so if you know
if you're working at that level you can
use a period if you want more
granularity use the
this one right so for those of you
taking pictures this is the one that has
everything so local date local time both
of them together sewn day time at the
times on the instant duration and period
and as I promised that was a very
average content we have a lot of changes
in JDK 8 and you can go and find
information about any of these changes
and by the way this piece itself is a
shorter list right now what I've shown
you here you can find in a lot more
detail if you want to go into the Java 8
launch event so I hate URLs because
nobody remembers them so instead I'll
tell you what to look for if you go into
your search engine and type Java 8
launch you will find the expert that
worked on those libraries on those api's
on lamda explaining them in a lot more
detail than I ever could so if you want
to learn more these are the people to
look into right Brian gets to our marks
Steven Colver
now that's the summary for my favorite
features in JDK 8 now let's look a
little bit into the future coming in JDK
9 there's over 90 jep's Java and has
been proposals that are targeted and are
actually ready in the early access
builds of JDK 9 this is a public page
just search for open JDK 9 you will find
the schedule and down here the complete
list
now nobody that you know doesn't work on
this has ever read the complete listing
details so I'll just pick and choose
some of them and I've categorized them
into behind-the-scenes improvements new
features new standards housekeeping and
some stuff that it's gone no longer
available in JDK 9 so behind the scenes
these are the goodies that you get just
by moving to JDK 9 you don't have to
recompile your code you can just grab
your classes compiled on JDK 8 run them
on JDK 9 and you get some freebies write
some performance improvements less
memory etc
so I'm not going to go into a lot of
detail because the intention here is
I'll just give you a glimpse if you want
to know more and I failed to mention
that one here is the little URL thingy
just type the jet number here and you'll
get a lot more detail
okay so store in turn strings in CDs
archive short of it is you can have a
bunch of strings shared the same
representation memory so it uses less
memory saved a lot of memory from our
tests in Oracle products that manage a
lot of strings even better compacts
strings we realized that we could do
better than saving everything in in in
four bits we could do 16 bits I'm sorry
in 4 bytes we could do usually 16 bits
and if needed we can go larger but the
majority of strings take now about half
as much space okay now this one I love
it because it only took 20 years for
Java doc to get a little search box so
your documentation created with Java doc
will now have that search capability by
default and that's a pretty good search
if I do say so myself even though you
can search camelcase
and we'll do a smart hit it will not
just find everything alphabetically and
put it in there but it's uncanny how the
talk here is more likely than not the
one that you want it okay so that's what
you get for free we also have a bunch of
improvement that these are new tools and
capabilities that like most things right
if you don't use them you don't get the
value of it but they're available for
you if you're now calling again to JDK 9
these are the ones that are most likely
to be used by most developers there's a
bunch of other smaller ones that are
pretty obscure first one project Dixon
and I'm going to go into a little bit
more detail if anybody goes to any call
any session about JDK 9 this is what
you'll see
right we've modularized that platform
now most of the work was to modularize
the jdk itself but of course you can use
that to modularize your own applications
and this makes managing large code bases
much simpler okay there's another side
story this is a partial you know this is
just a zooming of the graph that
explains the module so you have the base
system depends you know then you have
modules that depend on base it's
actually here here's Mason ago I cannot
even read it here so with this
modularization allow us to create this
other one of my favorite tools j-link
the java linker so up to now the common
deployment mode model is every Java
program shares one GRE write so all
programs run on the same runtime and
that means that your GRE even though you
may want it to run only just a very
small program that doesn't use a lot of
the classes that are available in the
JRE that Jerry contains everything right
it contains core bar encryption and if
you want to do a little hello world why
do you want to have all of those
capabilities now it's a lot more common
to have an application include its own
runtime right
this model of let's all share a runtime
it comes from the time where 50
megabytes was a huge load and nobody
wanted to carry another 50 megabytes
right now how many of you have little
applications on your phone that are
measured in gigabytes so the idea of we
must all share a runtime to save a few
megabytes it's no longer the most
current one with j-link
we've introduced an optional
intermediate step which is you normally
we're compiling your code and then you
were running it right jaelyn you can
link it and you can also use it to
create a customized runtime so we'll
basically go and say what modules that
your application need oh it only needs
base
login and this other module okay rather
than having the whole thing in there let
me create a special image just for you
with those three modules and therefore
you'll be smaller a lot faster you can
include your own modules into this image
so I can then give you here's a runtime
and it has everything that you need to
run your Java program and it's a half or
a third of the size of a full GRE so if
you're creating a bunch of containers
and trying to create runtimes for a
particular application as opposed to
something that will run every
conceivable Java program you really need
to look into this okay enhance
deprecation anybody what said why do we
deprecated API we thought of something
better than that one there was something
wrong with the previous one we have to
get it out of there or the style wasn't
right we actually use deprecation for
many things and it was very confusing
because to me the important thing about
the application is are you going to
throw this API away because if you're
going to remove it I want to know about
it
right there are other cases on which
something new and better is available
which means if I'm coding a new program
I should use that but if I have an old
program that works fine I don't need to
go and refactor it right it's going to
work fine since we were overloading the
term deprecation to mean any of those it
was very useful with JDK 9 we've added
an annotation and the important one here
is condemned equals true and the idea is
to tell you we intend to remove this API
in the next version so if you're using
an API that has condemned equals true
you know today that it is not likely
going to work in the next version of the
JDK ok even though the next version of
the JDK hasn't even started you already
know that now you can get a warning when
you compile but we also provide you a
tool that's the set up the red bullet at
the second one it's called Jade upper
scan you can run it on
any code and will tell you whether it's
using any deprecated API and you can
pass it a parameter and say just show me
the ones that are about to be removed so
that's very useful you don't need to
have the source code you can just run it
on the microf who here has created small
collections right it's even worse if
you're trying to create something that's
immutable because I don't know if you
discover how to do it you have to first
create it then populate it one at a time
and then convert it to immutable that's
a little bit too much molar plate for
something that small with this one you
can do it in a single go so most of them
they have an overload so I think it's up
to ten elements yes so you can do up to
ten elements with these factory
collections okay
pretty nice J shell anybody knows this
guy rebel other languages have had these
tools for a while so if you want to
explore an API right now what do you do
you fire up NetBeans or tapes you create
a little scaffolding right because if I
want to know how an API works I'm going
to need to create a method that uses
that API right so I'm going to have to
use one of those you know main that
calls this little thing just to discover
how the API works that's way too much
trouble
so IDs actually have integrated this
tool into itself I said I use NetBeans
there's an early access build of
NetBeans that works with JDK 9 and if we
finish quickly I'll show you a little
example of how to use this rebel tool to
play around you can just open a command
line you can type it has code completion
it's a little bit simplified you don't
have to put the semicolon at the end of
every statement you can export you can
you know have a little Java interface
come up and you can edit what you've
used so it's pretty useful for
exploratory code and once you understood
how it works you can just go ahead and
write the write API without having to
play around with it
something that I wish we had before move
to release jar files so what happens
when we come up with a great new idea in
JDK 9 but you want your same code to
work on JDK 9 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;amp; 7 you're pretty much
stuck because you know what I cannot use
this new API because what happens when
somebody tries to run it on JDK 8 it's
going to blow up in their face and
therefore there are some things that
don't get adopted as quickly as they
could be because developers have this
concern about I don't want to have to
create a version for aid and a version
for 9 I want a single version that works
across both of them now here's how this
looks like JDK 8 and if you're running
this particular jar in JDK 8 or below
these are the classes ABCD if you're
running it in JDK 9 it's going to
override a and it's going to use this
one instead and B this one instead so
these two classes a class and B class
down here can use nine only API the a
and B class is up here those are the
ones that you write for eight and below
and the idea is that as we move forward
and you have this available you can have
different classes and say this one is
four eight nine and ten this one is
roughly and you can have in a single jar
a program that runs in different
versions of Java okay some new standards
these are things that we didn't invent
they're just we're grabbing what's
available elsewhere Unicode eight so you
can see every version of Java adopts new
versions of Unicode I beat you have a
seven launched with unicode six so
there's about 10,000 new symbols anybody
care to guess what the vast majority of
those are emoji cyclists alike but if
you were dying to write Navajo in lower
case you're going to need Unicode 8
because that's where it was introduced
before that you were always screaming
when you're writing in Navajo I had to
look that up because you can write your
your property files now you can use
utf-8 so when you pair it with the other
one you can have a property file that's
all ammaji
if you know you are so inclined okay you
before that you could do it but you have
to encode them now you can actually use
utf-8 so that's pretty nice OC speed all
CSP stapling for pls that's a mouthful
that's one of my favorite features it's
pretty technical but I love it here
anybody knows what that is good I get to
show off right now when you go on you
ping a server right imagine that you try
to connect to an API that says I'm going
to connect to I don't know Microsoft the
way it works is you go and you connect
to Microsoft and Microsoft replies and
says HTTP here's a certificate issued by
Verisign that says I am Microsoft so
what does your computer do it says when
was the last time that we check the
certificates that were revoked from
Verisign was it more than an hour ago
no it's less than an hour okay let me go
check that list yeah that certificate is
not there we're good if it's more than
one hour of this is the first thing you
check you have to go on Ping very time
and say has that certificate been
revoked right and that means that a lot
of people are paying in first Microsoft
and then Verisign there's even a
theoretical denial of service attack
where you use a certificate that has
been revoked and you block the person
from being in Verisign right and most
browsers now they assume that if they
cannot think very sad you know there's
connection problems everything is
probably okay very good let's just rest
it right it also allows you to leak a
little information Verisign has an idea
so how many people are visiting
Microsoft because they're getting
pinging so how does this work
Microsoft once an hour things very
silences could you give me a signed note
saying that I'm not expired and rather
than every client having to being very
time remember how you were going to
trust the answer for a sign for one hour
this is no different the only difference
is now Microsoft says here's my
certificate and here's a recent
signature less than one hour old saying
that I'm not expired you don't have to
check anything else pretty neat huh
new hash algorithms
who here has kept abreast of all the
news about md5 and sha-1 they're all
getting hacked that means you need new
ones so you know we're going to continue
in this little hamster wheel for as long
as I can think I don't see any answer
now so they'll keep cracking and we'll
keep adding html5 Java doc just looks
better so here's another one HTTP - so
this is protocol it's you know very used
nowadays it makes things appear to load
faster there's a whole set of tricks
that they use - even though it's sending
them as same amount of information
things appear to load quicker now this
one also allows me to introduce
something new called incubator modules
now what is that you may ask how about a
nest oh no come on play with me what is
that so incubator modules is when we
define an API and we put it in this
standard the minute that we put it out
there somebody goes and builds a huge
system on it and then we cannot change
it ever again so whenever there is
something that we're not quite sure if
the API is ready we always have this
problem right we try to ask for feedback
but until it's actually in the JDK most
people don't get feedback incubator
modules are it's a set of modules that
pretty much guarantees that that API
will not be there in the next version ok
so you can go and play with it but it
comes with a warning
you shall not build something on top of
these that you intend to use in
production for the long run
because it will not be there in the next
version hopefully it will help as though
by getting some more feedback and we can
make sure that the API when it gets into
this standard is the right API okay now
housekeeping we've set up some future
improvements and we reduce some
complexity this one is the one that's
going to get the most news we've
encapsulated most internal API now I can
find you on 1998 web page you can look
in the you know Internet Archive with
Sun Microsystems telling its develop
first do not use the internal API
they're not part of the specification
that's what we use internally to
implement the specification so stay away
from those they may change the may
disappear and you know it's if you're
using some other vendors implementation
of Java they may not be there now when
we did this we of course have access to
the same open source repository that
everybody has we went a look to a bunch
of commonly used libraries how many
people think you know that less than
half of them but you know about half of
them use this internal API
half of them anybody know 60 80 90
percent how many do you think actually
use internal API is even though we told
them not to try a hundred percent okay
every non-trivial API that we defined
they use some of these internal API that
makes your code brittle and it makes
those internal API you know we cannot
really evolve them so we really can and
we're finally going to encapsulate them
they're not going to be there by default
okay
now that means that those common
libraries that I was talking about
there's going to be a new version of
them that doesn't use those internal API
there's also escape clause there is a
command line that you can pass to expose
one of these api's back if you need it
please don't do that unless you're
planning to rewrite your code and this
is just a temporary step okay there's a
handful of API that when we went looking
we decided you know what these are not
just convenient things these actually do
important things and there is no actual
real you know supporting API part of the
specification that can do what these
things do so for the ones listed there
and only those they will remain enabled
by default you don't have to pass
anything those will remain there we're
working very hard to provide some api
that are part of the spec that do the
things that these guys did
in a supportive way until we do they
remain available this is not we've
turned them into part of the
specification and now that now they're
there forever
hopefully in JDK 10 or JDK 11 or as soon
as we can app with a new replacement
those will disappear but for nine don't
they need to use them if you have to
okay there is a tool that's available
since JDK 8 called Java dependencies J
depth that you can run against by code
and it will tell you whether you're
using this API so I would recommend that
you go ahead and run it against your
code and when I mean when I say your
code I don't mean just the step you
wrote but also the libraries that you
rely on okay because I expect that most
people will have to at least get the
next version of their login utility or
framework etcetera modular application
packaging remember that I said that
there's the J link that creates a
special runtime we have a tool that will
create a package so that it looks like a
native application we have with JDK 8
but it bundles the whole jury with JDK 9
it uses this daily link tool to create a
smaller runtime just for your
application new version string have you
okay which version of Java is the
current one 8 update what 120 something
right and if you do a Java - version
string what do you get one dot 8.0 you
something right what's that one dot
what's that zero all of that there's
very good reasons why those were there
to begin with
but they're gone in JDK 9 so the version
string for 9 is 9 not 1.9 and it's got
semantic versioning so there's no you
know news and there is more than one
digit to read so if you were parsing the
version string we've seen code that
looks at the version string discards the
first digit and starts looking at the
second one that won't work ok
ahead of time compilation if you don't
want to compile a winter Bureau on your
jet you want to create a compilation
ahead of running available in the next
one md5 string concatenation I love this
one I had to you know look up what that
meant as I mentioned we've introduced
invoke dynamic in 7 or 8 getting market
in 7 JDK 7 and this means that rather
than the compiler figuring out the code
it can say you know figure it out at
runtime now what this will allow us to
do is anything compiled after we do this
right now we're the same but if we think
of a better way of doing a string
concatenation in the future
we can make it so that code compiled
with 9 and above takes advantage of
those benefits you don't have to
recompile it so this is what I call you
know housekeeping this is just looking
forward when we come up with a better
idea
you won't have to recompile to get that
advantage unified average collation
login and we're switching the default
garbage collector okay now anybody here
cares about which garbage collector in
your application uses if you do I'm
guessing that you have a parameter
telling the operator the the runtime
which one to use so you will not be
affected these will only affect people
that don't specify a default okay
project coin you're familiar with that
one came with JDK 7 we did some minor
changes to the language we're doing some
further improvements ok
this one I like filter incoming
serialization data now this one I have
here because this one is actually now
available in versions 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 so it's a
mechanism by which you can tell don't
just accept any data here's a set of
rules my application only expect this
type of data to be serialize anything
else
kick it out okay and this is as I said
the only feature I can think of that's
started in 9 and has already been back
board and it's available in current
releases a bunch of garbage collection
combinations where deprecating in 8 can
you tell which ones are red that's
visible right so these guys right here
in red those were deprecated in JDK 8
and we have not been testing them so I
don't have the work probably well
they're going to be gone in JDK 9 now
what does that mean as a general rule if
you're running your JDK now and you're
getting warnings things like this thing
right if you set parmgen size in JDK 8
it tells you I'm ignoring this I remove
that you know this is this is we remove
this in JDK 8 in JDK 9 that same option
will error out so don't just ignore
those warnings they're there for a
reason
please and I know people are going to
call me and complain about this when we
go live and I cherry-pick the ones I
liked as I said there's about 90 of them
and there you can go and read about any
one of them in a lot more detail than
anybody you know could do in a single
session okay
so now for my call to action download
the JDK and early access build I think I
left it here just search for get ek9
you'll find it we change the build
number periodically so don't just grab
one and test forever
you know check every time we've already
reached feature complete so if you were
waiting for these to have all of the
features before you start a testing
you're not to wait anymore you can do it
today okay and there's a summary of
changes on every build next one
join the conversation for every one of
those jabs if you look for the
discussion field it'll tell you which
one of these areas you can ask questions
about that people that know most about
these particular enhancements monitor
their in those discussions you can go
ahead join if you have any questions or
suggestions please review the archive
because we've got lots of questions and
nobody enjoys answering questions that
were answered six months ago but if you
have any suggestions so you find any
problems you could ping me and then I
would pick them or you can just cut me
out of the loop and go straight to them
okay download some idea of your flavor
like your favorite might taste NetBeans
they offer now capabilities same thing
they're working to provide support for
the new features at GA like us they also
need feedback please get back to them
and tell them what they're doing right
and what they're doing wrong that Jade
EPS tool that I mentioned it's available
in JDK 8 you're better off using the one
in JDK 9 when you find something that
you're not supposed to be using you'll
actually tell you when we know which
supported API you should be using
instead okay so please run that it'll
make your transition to JDK 9 much
simpler this is a little bit like
planning for retirement you do not want
to wait until you have to go to JDK 9 to
do this if you do it now and do it
incrementally this will be easy
and as I said there is this very
convoluted set of here ad exports this
is what will allow you to we remove that
restriction and have those internal
api's reappear for your program okay so
that's it with the slide deck and I
think we do have a few more minutes
before I forget the guy that just came
before we started Bruno reminded me to
remind you that there is a reception
we're going to have beer wine and that
kind of stuff where we had the food so
after this session
don't just bowl to your cars you can
kill some time there and wait for the
traffic to die and is there any
questions from what I show or does
anybody care to see a little demo of J
shell and perhaps some sample code
yeah let's let's try that and I haven't
prayed to the demo gods so you're going
to have to bear with me my computer's
also very slow can anybody read that
first of all because this is not going
to be fun can we change the resolution
is that beatable yeah okay so this is
JDK 9 I think I'm a couple of versions
back and as I said my computer super
slow here we go
156 I'm going to show you J she'll
remember that I mentioned that there is
this tool the repple tool that will
allow you to explore a little code so
one of my favorite here we go so haven't
done anything I can do simple things
like hello it's string right dot soup
I'm going to tap here and it tells me
what are the methods that are available
for that string let's say substring now
I'm going to do a shift tab and it tells
me what are the possible right methods
that I could be using there it's
overloaded so it could be the beginning
the trend and I can say let's say from 2
to 4 and it creates this pseudo variable
1 which is the 1 1 and also you can get
if you don't want have access to the IDE
you can do this
the example that I want to show is
anybody ever try to compute the phases
of the Moon right you want to know
whether it's full moon or waxing moon or
wining moon etc etc you can do very
complicated math to do it and I'm sure
somebody at NASA would love to tell you
how to do it but I'm just going to cheat
and I'm going to simply convert the date
that you want into a date in a lunar
calendar and the beauty of lunar
calendars is all of the months go
between one to either 29 or 30 and those
dates match exactly the day of the moon
so that's all a blue right there is a
calendar that supported here by default
in JDK it's the historic calendar now
it's where let's let's just do it again
I could type date dot time every single
time but I could just do an import date
time I'm sorry
Java dot time here I'm going to need a
couple of others let's get the time dot
chrono and import any case you don't
remember Java that I can do the tap
thing and it will tell me so it's it's
got the completion let's try this
temporal chrono-field there so now if I
just wanted to get the current date I
can just they say something and say
local and I'm using that code completion
because I just can type local date dot
now that's a current date okay if I
would like to know the same since I
imported I'm going to show you by the
way list it is all that I've typed okay
I can do a help if I want to know
everything I can do but let's get the
current date in a lunar format and
that's called cifra date dot now there
I'm just going to look at the day Oh -
since the moon starts at 0 0 new moon
we're pretty much new moon there is no
moon today out ok and you can do as you
can see pretty simple I don't have to go
and write code that does it I didn't
even put the semicolon I can do even the
dollar 6 it creates that variable for me
dot get
chrono-field dot
day of month there you go so you can see
here how can quickly do a function if I
want to create a date rather than using
now I say local date dot and I can say
off and look it's a 2017 Oh 304 he'll
create dates like that so as you can see
creating new dates and times it's pretty
straightforward that's one of the
beauties of the new days hire 310 you
don't have to do the whole let me create
a calendar let me set the month and by
the way in this calendar January is one
guess what January was in the previous
calendar zero you know we're developers
we start counting so current month went
from zero to 11 go figure
here's what it looks like my little
completed class right here I'm going to
get the day form a year month day so if
I say okay here's a date from local
daytime year-month-day this will accept
a year month day and it will return that
lunar day if you will okay now that
lunar day is based on a particular city
on in the Middle East so it's not very
accurate but I'm just gonna you know
fat-finger it and say okay if the value
is greater than four or less than twelve
you're in the first quarter between 13
and 17 year on full moon between 18 and
26 you're in third quarter and
everything else that's one two three and
27 to 30 that's New Moon okay now I
could just run this but let's make it a
little bit more interesting I would like
to put this in the my Oracle cloud
account because of course we have to put
it in a cloud so that just means I have
to create a little function that reads
write whatever you pass and spit it out
so
here it is I'm using spark to not have
to code anything of that because you
know I'd not really want to go into the
nitty gritties of listening to a board I
I can pass the poll as a parameter if it
doesn't work I'll use a DAT and here it
says when I get a request just to check
that it's alive you know if I don't pass
anything I'll reply with it's alive
and if I pass moon and I pass a
parameter with date I can pass any date
and I'll just return the date and time
so here's this is I went to my Oracle
application cloud and I just loaded this
thing now here's the exact same can you
read that can I write and just to see
that I'm not cheating and adjusting in
hard code a couple of them here's the
moon phases for here California in 2017
and I just Google this one right so
let's try full moon October 5 of 2017 so
what we're going to say is
there you go full moon you want to try
first quarter let's say April 3rd
aygul so it's up and running working
literally about here this is it
including the part where I listen to the
poor word and do everything so pretty
straightforward please give it a try and
you know as you can see this is I had
already logged in I can show you a
little bit about the project just
because all of your developers so it
just requires there's a little tool here
that will grab all of the dependencies
put it in a single jar file include a
little file that says how do I want to
run it command Java - jar this is the
name of the project right this is the
jar puts all of this into that zip file
and literally to run this in the Oracle
cloud all I had to do was upload that
zip file and this is what you have
running here so if you have more
questions about this particular part
about putting it on the cloud there's a
guy called Shawn Smith on the room right
next door to this one that will be
probably having beers in the next few
minutes on the next session I can point
them to you if you want that's it thank
you for coming
if you have a questions right
okay what's the module and the module
system sure okay so the idea of the
module system as I said is instead of
having one monolithic project for run
the JDK we've separated the libraries
into different modules now what does
this mean to you in practice if you do
not care for modules it means nothing
right so your programs will continue to
run you do not have to switch to a
module system right everything they did
it before will continue to work so it
will impact us at the JDK level except
for the fact that if you were using
internal API a side-effect is their
healing now because of the module system
right and as I said that could probably
be a full one-hour session right at a
high level is we've grouped a collection
of api's if you think of a bunch of
packages all of the ones that have to do
with security into one module whole ones
have to do for managing the desktop into
one module it's it's a different it's
it's it as I said it's a collection of
api's it's built into every module that
has some dependencies to every to two
different modules as I should probably
show you the module system image
right so we have modularized the JDK us
a developer can mimic that and do that
to your own code and separate your code
instead of just having you know the
package level you can have different
modules and the idea is that modules
will be self-contained
they will only you know they'll create a
dependency graph so it'll be easy to
update on module at a time now you don't
have to do any of this but you could
right my point is as I said yeah you
could say the JDK before was one
gigantic module right you if you didn't
want to exclude any module you're pretty
much in the same place where you were
before I said okay let me put a pin on
that one come up here because as I said
we can spend a lot more than five
minutes that's not a three minute
conversation that's more like a thirty
minute conversation and I'll be happy to
have it right here right now just not
with everybody else here okay so see you
guys at the refreshment table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
