a developer evangelist with Twilio and
the author of a site called full stack
Python which helps developers to build
deploy and operate their Python
applications over 90,000 developers a
month read full stack Python to build
deploy and operate their their Python
applications and I primarily program in
Python and Swift ecosystems these are
sort of my two primary programming
languages and the reason why I just
bring that up up front is it would be
somewhat presumptuous of me to tell you
in your ecosystem how you exactly should
deploy and operate your applications
because the way that I build employ and
operate applications in Python is very
different than the way I build mobile
applications and iOS so this talk is
going to take up just a notch in the in
sort of the abstraction of DevOps and
ask some questions so we can be
introspective about the tools that we
are selecting because I can't give for
example if you're working in Ruby I
can't give you exactly the tool chain
that you should be using because I don't
work in the Ruby ecosystem if you want
to dive into the details especially
Python in Swift I'm happy to do that
after this talk we can talk all about
the specific tools that I use I started
out as a Java developer many years ago
and as a Java developer I got my first
taste of DevOps before it was even
called DevOps I came across a concept
which should be familiar to most of us
now but at the time was just completely
mind-blowing to me because you know I
studied computer science I never came
across it in any my computer science
classes it wasn't until I was getting my
first taste of professional Java
experience back in what I consider to be
my own Dark Ages of software development
now I know chances are half the room is
going to be like 2004 that wasn't that
long ago that's not the dark ages and
some people are going to be like wow man
you're really old so let's just call
this my personal software development
dark ages where I knew absolutely
nothing and I came across a concept
known as source control now also known
as version control and many of us
really think of source control as being
something as a part of a DevOps tool
chain but it really is the foundational
layer for anything that we want to do on
top of that when we're working with our
applications and nowadays we've got
these beautiful web application front
ends that show us dips of our code we
have distributed version control systems
and great ways to backup our code but it
hasn't always been like this and so I
still know some developers working in
some fortune 500 environments that are
not using version control and so I will
say that the first step is to at least
use some sort of way to version your
files version your code in order to get
into the DevOps space so the first thing
I will say is if you are using source
control you should give yourself a pat
on the back this is not actually a Jif
it won't actually a gift it won't
actually start but give yourself a pat
on the back if you are using source
control now I personally use git I won't
make a whole lot of hard recommendations
for what tools you should be
specifically using if you're using
mercurial or you're still on SVN like
that's totally cool I personally have
been using git for the past eight years
and I still learn a lot about it and I
still love using git it is sort of the
source control that I use across all the
programming languages that I work with
now this brings up some questions I have
a dozen questions today to sort of be
introspective about the tools that we
are selecting and and I've specifically
used a phrase build deploy and operate
when referencing DevOps for a reason and
that is because often people jump to
certain conclusions when you say the
term DevOps they say oh that means like
docker or something
well no DevOps is like the entire its
development and operations it goes
across the entire lifecycle of a project
and so a lot of these questions are just
introspective ways of looking at our
team our processes our company culture
and that helps us to decide what tools
we should be using so the first question
that I had is if you are considering a
tool do you know a developer that you
trust that
has been using a tool for four plus
years and strongly recommends it and I
used four plus years it's sort of a
placeholder obviously there are many
tools that have not been around for four
years when my favorite calls from a
recruiter was like do you know who do
bleed somebody with five years of duping
and this is like few years ago and I was
like the dupe has only been open source
for like three years so unless you're
going to hire the Creator like I don't I
don't know what to tell you
so four plus years is kind of a
placeholder here but the idea is there
are certain tools that developers use
that they still are like after several
years they know all the warts they know
all the pain points they're still like I
love this tool this is a fantastic tool
so for me like git is one of those tools
and if you don't use git that's totally
cool but I personally strongly recommend
it along with a few other tools like
Django and Pelican because I'm in the
Python ecosystem so I think that it's
it's sort of common sense if you know
somebody sort of social proofing your
decision if you know a developer you
trust and you ask them like what you
know I'm thinking about using X tool do
you know anybody who's used it it's like
if they still recommend it after all
this time and knowing all the downsides
to it that's probably a strong
indication that's a good tool for us to
choose a second question is does anyone
know the difference between a concept
and implementation so it's kind of
switching gears from the social proof
into a slightly different way of looking
at the way that we select tools so the
difference here and this is often
something I will I will ask to kind of
tease out whether someone's a more
junior developer or more senior
developer is like what what's the
difference between a concept and an
implementation well a concept is like a
conceptual idea source control is a
conceptual idea and it has many
different implementations git is one
implementation with its own philosophy a
distributed version control system and
there are other like SPNs centralized
version control system but knowing the
difference between a concept and an
implementation is incredibly important
for picking the right tools because
oftentimes I see developers jump on to
the next thing I got to go use react
because that's what everybody's using in
San Francisco I got to use docker
because everybody is using that but I'll
say all of what like what what
conceptual idea does that
implement okay a JavaScript MVC
framework okay for it for react what are
the other ones how are they implementing
them what's kind of the philosophy
behind them and also with docker it's
like there's an entire company a unicorn
company a billion dollar plus company
that is that it's kind of driving the
hype cycle behind docker docker is a
great tool
what's the conceptual idea of containers
behind that and what you often find is
once you dig into the concept it will
break away a lot of the hype behind a
specific tool and you can select the
right concept that will solve the
problem that you're currently facing so
I often try to separate you know if I
hear about some great new tool whatwhat
conceptual ideas are really implementing
and that helped me to kind of get away
from that that that hype okay all right
so say we've got it took us a little
while to get here but we've got you know
some of our foundational layer we've got
our source control our version control
we've got some way to look at our source
code and you know you know in some
places this this is actually like all
that they they really get to write like
you're building your code you're
checking it in and that's it and you
know you're doing manual integration and
and I mean there's there's a whole
spectrum of leading-edge organizations
and ones that are still trying to adopt
some of the ways we've been doing we've
been writing and and working with code
over the past 15 years and so there's
things that you you kind of need this to
build on top of it so this kind of
starts once you have that in place it
starts to lead to other questions and so
this the third question about selecting
tools is like on a scale of like giving
us giving yourself and then do it in
your head sort of an objective honest
assessment on a scale of like zero being
the lowest and ten being the highest how
amenable is your organization and also
your team to improving your technical
environment this isn't like an arbitrary
question like I have been a staff
engineer I have been in consulting
engagements and what I found is that
there are many organizations where what
I can accomplish when this is a nine is
completely different than what I can
even contemplate accomplishing if this
is a three so just being honest with
your own assessment because I think one
of the lessons I've learned becoming of
you've been in this industry for a while
it's like it's not my it's not my
responsibility to solve every single
problem that the company has especially
if the company doesn't actually want to
solve their their own problems and so
being honest with yourself about how
much you can actually take on what tools
you can adopt is really important for
just your own sanity and your own career
lifespan so if you are you know if your
if your organization is a ten that means
you're probably going to be able to
adopt more tools you're gonna be able to
think about you know what is the
spectrum of things we can do versus you
know if you're on a it's on a 1 ok well
we're probably going to have to focus on
one concept one tool at a time I spend
six months expand our political capital
and educate people in order to get that
adopted right so the second the third up
what builds on the third question which
is the fourth question is how many
people about your team get really like
stove really excited about making
incremental fixes to your technical
environment so it's very similar to the
previous question but this is very very
and we've got them we've got the folks
in the room who are who are those who
are those people but if you are a tech
lead or aspiring tech lead I actually
think that this is a really great
question to figure out like if you've
got ten people and ten developers on
your team like is it seven of them is it
three of them like that's going to
determine and then sort of the other
side is you know who are the people that
are like constantly like we got to
rewrite this whole thing we're not gonna
be able to improve this environment or
they're just like we got to do a Big
Bang refactor not even a refactor just
whole rewrite just knowing how many
people on your team are going to be
willing to make those incremental
improvements it's going to help you
determine how its bandwidth you have
we're actually implementing certain
concepts and adopting certain tools okay
so again once you have the source
control in place then you can start to
actually do something with your code
taking us probably too long to get us
here but really this is where the a lot
more of the power comes in as far as
knowing whether our code actually works
and so continuous integration automated
testing dependencies now we can start to
get our source source code out of the
source
repository and start working with it in
some sort of automated fashion and this
is often the own like this is where a
lot of organizations actually just like
kind of stop right there's nothing
beyond this and and and it's certainly
much better than then if you didn't do
this I'll tell you from my personal
experiences working with a very large
organization fortune 100 company and
they had stopped at the first level they
had source control we're using rational
clearcase it was something it was it was
something to work with question for
rational clearcase and it then we tried
to convince the the technical leadership
like the architect team that like we
needed to use like jenkins to do you
know continuous integration because what
we were finding was we've reached these
deadlines and we'd say okay we're going
to deploy a test environment and you
know we knew that that night was like
the first time that we were integrating
like three teams code and we were all
going to be staying until the next day
like it was just how it was so we were
like you know if we do continuous
integration we're constantly testing
this and we will kind of smooth things
along but that wasn't like acceptable in
that organization like it was it was
actually a position of power to be able
to push the deploy the build and deploy
button in the IDE to go get that to
build the jar files to produce the war
file up here in the Java environment and
then actually put that copy and paste
like over FTP into the application
server like that was a position of power
that no one wanted to give up and so if
you're trying to work in that order if
trying to work in that organization and
try to produce some technical change
that's the you know that's just a very
difficult situation to get past so you
know sometimes that's really you only
get to the first step and then you're
trying to work on these on these next
things okay so with continuous
integration kind of the decision splits
between do you host your own tools do
you use some sort of hosted solution so
on the open source side often people
work with Jenkins go continuous delivery
Strider CI
there are many tools out there in Python
there's also build BOTS and Python and
then there's the hosted solution circle
CI Travis code build I you know I kind
of am sort of 50/50 on this
I think if you're working like in an all
AWS environment or you're working in an
all cloud environment and they have CI
tools built-in it's probably worth worth
testing that out but I find that I spent
so much time configuring even a hosted
tool that I often I'm just like I should
just be hosting this myself on my own
server somewhere so that's kind of how I
think about continuous integration
sometimes it's a no-brainer like if
someone was like hey I've got a hosted
source control system and it is
proprietary I'd be like no way why would
I use that I have I get I can back that
up on you know whatever cloud service I
want it's an open-source source control
system the proprietary continuous
integration server services can be okay
in other cases in other areas of DevOps
it may make more sense to invest your
money in that in those places in a
hosted solution okay so you finally set
up continuous integration and really the
power in continuous integration is not
like the fact that you can check out
your code it's in the fact that you can
check you can test your code in an
automated fashion so the concepts here
are like what how are you running your
tests like what's your test Runner and
code coverage is for you know displaying
to the developers hey we've written
these unit tests we've written these
integration tests here is our yardstick
for what we're actually covering and
what we're not and and mocking as well
it's kind of in that ballpark where
you're not necessarily testing the
system end-to-end you're doing a lot of
unit testing where you need to to mock
things out where you're not actually
testing the whatever call you're making
to another another bit of your code in
the Python world we use things like unit
tests PI tests nose mock coverage these
are the tools that we use to implement
this so again teasing away the concept
the conceptual idea from the
implementations this is how I look at it
in the Python space and there are
equivalents in Java world Ruby those
sorts of ecosystems ok so now you've got
your code you know continuously checked
out and built if if you're in Java
or.net and you're actually doing
compilation and other ecosystems
obviously it's mostly interpreted so you
don't worry as much about that you're
doing some tests you're doing your
testing you've got your code coverage
now what you want to do is you want to
kind of like I mean
you want to you want to put that on a
running system right like the running
executing code is the most powerful
thing that we as developers can produce
it's not the design documents that are
stuck in a Word document somewhere
it is like the living breathing code not
only the code that is checked into a
version control system but the one that
is executing somewhere so I was on a
project in in the defense space where we
had great test coverage great continuous
integration we're using cruise control
at the time which was sort of like I
don't post pre Jenkins or Hudson but
it's kind of it's got all old-school but
it all still worked it was great and so
they said hey we want to get our you
know tested code onto a server somewhere
well this was before a lot of the the
newer tools came out so I wrote that was
in the lines of batch scripts and it
worked great as long as I was the only
person who thought we touched it like we
could deploy it to any environment we
could kind of punch in the IP address
that we deploy all over code awesome
but bash scripts are very very brittle
and you know this was like 12 years ago
so that was the best that we could do
but I kept like I kept getting excited I
was like deploying codes pretty fun I
wonder like what tools are out there
that I can do this better and so when I
started really working in the Python
space came across a tool called fabric
the conceptual idea here is an SSH
wrapper it's some way for you to handle
setting up pairing down SSH connections
and running commands on a remote server
somewhere one or more remote servers
implemented by fabric in the Python
space and I so I basically rewrote bash
scripts that were a little bit less
brittle in fabric wasn't a perfect
solution but it certainly worked better
than just straight-up bash scripts
because bash scripts just have a
tendency to have one character removed
and nothing works and you get no good
error messages at least we've got some
good error messages out of this and then
when the newer tools started coming
around so we're talking about like
configuration management tools
I picked up ansible back in the fairly
early days of ansible and was created by
a guy Michael de Haan did a great job
based off of a lot of his experience
writing configuration management tools
and it's almost like a higher level like
SSH wrapper because it
all just goes through SSH there's no
sort of master master/slave relationship
among nodes it's really just working off
like a peer-to-peer SSH connection and
so this allows you to sort of get into
the next level once you start automating
your deployments which is just sort of
configuration management tools automated
deployments automated deployments to
many different environments whether that
is dev tests and hopefully production as
well and in the configuration management
space I already talked about ansible of
course chef puppet saltstack fall into
this area I personally have only had a
significant amount of experience with
ansible we use chef a ton internally at
Twilio but ansible is kind of like my
favorite child out of out of the bunch
but these are fantastic for kind of
bringing up the level of abstraction
when you're doing your deployment and
and what I mean by that is like if
you're doing a bash script and you need
to run a command on Linux let's say you
want to install a couple of packages and
you're using the the aptitude package
manager and you say you know super user
do apt install Python dev and supervisor
so these are slim like development
libraries for Python and supervisor
which is it's kind of like a nicer
version of cron for running system tasks
well that command you know is fine but
if you're just writing that atbash
script it can be fairly brittle and and
and what something like ansible does is
it allows you to write in yamo which I
wasn't really that big of a fan of it
first but I kind of it's kind of grown
on me but you can write your commands in
a way that at first looked pretty much
the same but there's a lot more power
here which is install the Python dev and
supervisor packages with the apt command
but you you sit you specify state
present and what this allows you to do
is a concept notice item potency meaning
you can rerun this command over and over
again and it will know that the command
may give you different output like the
first time you run that top command if
you're trying to check your in your bash
script like hey I want to make sure that
this actually installed there weren't
any errors well you then have to have
like
if then huge conditional statement like
what if they're already installed what
if one of them is installed and the
other one is not like what if you have a
whole list like you basically have to
come up with this entire state machine
to manage whether your packages are
installed or not which is not really
what as developers we really like to be
doing
so what ansible and many other
configuration management tools is you
can run this command and it will handle
all that stuff behind the scenes for you
and then you worry just about the
overall scale of the deployment rather
than writing your specific commands in
bash okay so this brings up some further
questions and one of them is to just be
as completely honest with yourself as
possible which is how many times a day
does your team deploy to test and how
many times do production so this is a
you know often something where people
sort of maybe hem and haw a little bit
just on average you know giving yourself
on average do you deploy at the end of
every sprint you just deploy just
whenever there is new code because you
have a significant test suite but this
kind of just gives you a yardstick and
then the next question is how many times
a day do you really want to deploy to
test or production the whole idea is
like you've got sort of your current
objective yardstick and then sort of
your vision for where where you want to
go and most people don't really like
have really an answer to that which is
which is kind of funny to me because if
you're in if you're looking at DevOps
tools this kind of drives like a lot of
your decision-making like how much time
are you investing in in understanding
the way that you're doing your
deployments understanding your testing
because if you only need to deploy at
the end of every sprint like you may not
need to worry about doing daily or what
we do like often dozens of times a day
deployments so this kind of gives you a
little bit of a measurement stick for
like how much do you really want to
invest and just sort of understanding
the area and understanding the tooling
now then we switch to what are the top I
just picked arbitrarily five top five
and pediments two completely automating
your deployments because oftentimes you
know we'll have some sort of manual
check maybe there's a manual button to
deploy to production before you can
actually get into a production
environment maybe there's some sort of
in very large environment some sort of
sign-off that needs to happen maybe
to coordinate with other teams there's
all sorts of impediments that can exist
and being specific about what those
impediments are to actually getting
those automation automation in place for
your deployments will help you then to
decide like who who can actually go and
and start to solve these problems on
your team and this is a specific skill
set I find so who on your team gets
excited about continuous delivery now
I'll tell you I ran when I was living in
Washington DC I ran a meetup group
called DC continuous delivery and there
is a certain subset of developers that
gets really really stoked about shipping
about the process of shipping code as
opposed to the actual creation of
application features so if you tell a
developer who is really stoked about
creating application features like hey
you're gonna you're gonna work on a
deployment pipeline and you're going to
hear an answer deployment pipeline like
they may not actually be all that
excited about that so again it comes
back to a little bit of like the word
that many of our development teams are
not that great at which is empathy
empathy and understanding what our
developers want to be working on and
there is a specific you know type of
developer that gets really excited about
about this area and that's why I think
just knowing who those people on your
team are and the people that are
actually responsible for that like who
is responsible for making these
improvements maybe it's one specific
person maybe it is a rotating position
just being honest with yourself about
who on our teams is actually working on
this problem is just really important I
find that when when people would come to
our meetup that that they get they get
really excited about the topics we talk
about sure we talk a lot about tooling
talk about configuration management
tools they'll talk about cultural change
because a lot of company cultures are
not really supportive of sort of the
moving much faster even if they say they
want to be agile like they won't really
invest in the tooling and so just like
knowing who on your team is excited
about that like the people that come to
that meetup obviously are very excited
about that
versus the people that go to just a you
know a fairly standard language meetup
this helps you to prioritize who is
going to be working on on what in your
team
so I've done a lot of work with django
Django is one of my all-time favorite
libraries just I cannot say enough good
things about Django I've been using it
since 0.96 it is close to 2.0 release so
about about almost 10 not let's say 9
years now with Django still highly
recommended so if you're thinking of
using Django it's a web application
framework in Python I I strongly
recommend Django but I was working on a
consulting engagement a few years ago
and they had built this entire system in
Django and one of the issues they were
using Python 2 in Python 2 Unicode is a
tricky Beast it's a lot better in Python
3 but it was always really terrible not
always really terrible but it was sort
of a patch job in Python 2 so it was
pretty tricky now this this organization
had a very international audience and so
any characters that they wanted to
display on their Django site you know
they're going to use Unicode and so what
they found though or what I found when I
came in when we started talking about
what they wanted to accomplish was that
any time they served up a Unicode
character it would actually display an
error message on their page
now it wasn't hitting it was it was a
Django error that was happening behind
the scenes was happening thousands of
times a week no one knew it because they
were looking at the Google Analytics
traffic Google Analytics was still being
served up they were still you know it
looked to Google Analytics like people
reviewing the pages yeah the time on
page was kind of short but you know
shorter than they would have expected
but that's just kind of they didn't
really worry too much about it when we
dug into the the logs we discovered that
every page was basically 500 erroring
out in this django application whenever
there was a Unicode character displayed
or was attempting to be displayed and
the only reason we really found out
about this was because we had some
monitoring place and I was able to look
through the error logs and so this kind
of brings up sort of the next step which
is you know it's great to get your
deployment in place it's great to do
some
manual smoke testing or whatever have
you but if you don't have the monitoring
the lagering logging measuring this is
often what people sort of gravitate
towards in deployments I'm sorry in
DevOps is once they've got some of this
other stuff in place this is really
where a lot of the the power comes in
because you can you can then move really
fast by seeing what the issues are that
come up but make sure that if you are
you know you have your monitoring in
place that you like look at it because
it should feedback into how you were
building your application how you were
planning your Sprint's so like what
metrics are do you collect that feed
into every single sprint and this can
kind of help you choose which tools you
want to implement because you know if
for example one of your metrics is how
many errors are we getting in production
each day or each week and you want to
bring that down to a reasonable level or
you want to make sure that those errors
are classified into maybe only four or
four errors as opposed to 500 errors
then that's just that just you know
using monitoring tools can be really
powerful for like actually making sure
that the work being done in each sprint
is is driven by some sort of data that
is being collected by by your
environments okay now another question
that kind of comes up is especially
around monitoring but you know in
monitoring especially because it's a
part of your live running production
application it's how many days would it
take to put a new code library into
production in your environment in some
cases this is going to be well it's just
a code change we can do it the same day
or at the end of our sprint and then
we'll deploy it great if if not then you
know just being honest with yourself
about well how long is it going to take
us to improve our environment just
something important to sort of know when
you're picking tools maybe there's a
readi one that your that another team is
using so you can get into production
faster because really there's no value
to like a monitoring or a logging tool
until you actually like get it into
production like it doesn't do anything
for you until you actually get it in
there and you're looking at real live
data now in some environments this is a
graph from Julio's conference we do
signal conference each year this year's
at May 24th
25th in San Francisco we are incredibly
fortunate in that we report every single
year at our conference like the number
of production deployments we did in the
previous year so this is actually we get
6643 production deployments in 2015 I
really can't wait to get the new number
I don't know off the top of my head with
it what the exact new number for 2016 is
but what this shows you is in some
environments getting into production is
a matter of like the next you know a few
minutes away and there is certainly a
process in place for new tools and
things like that but if you're thinking
about what can we actually accomplish in
our environment and what tools can we
pick there are certain organizations
that are going to be more amenable to
like just shipping like that is a big
part of our company culture and
something that I did not see it a lot of
other places where I was a staff
engineers like ship we ship that is the
measure by which we deliver value to the
people that are using our product and so
that kind of informs your decision as to
what kind of tools you can adopt again
sometimes it is only a single tool that
you're going to be able to get into
production in six months in other
organizations it's going to be whenever
you want as long as you know you've gone
through whatever process it is to get it
in there but going to production is not
a big deal so I also just you know
another question that kind of comes up
is just monitoring is and I talked about
this with continuous integration I was
kind of on the fence about hosting it
yourself
hosted solutions but I think the
monitoring is actually one of the areas
in which there's been a significant
amount of investment I've seen in our
production environment we use a few
different posted solutions and they work
really well for us so I think if any
area of DevOps right now that you can
just kind of drop something in
instrument your back-end code instrument
your front-end code and just kind of be
up and running and collecting metrics
this is probably the area in which you
want to spend money if you have money to
spend rather than building some of your
own solutions now there are fantastic
open source solutions like stats D and
graphite and Nagios that you can use but
I also think that like setting those
up in your own environment can be kind
of a pain so I will say that if you have
money to put towards something it's
probably going to be in the monitoring
space so when you look at sort of the
the stack of where you can invest in
DevOps I mean this is like a really
broad topic which is part of the reason
why it was very difficult to talk about
this in a language agnostic way because
I really just wanted to talk about like
here's how we do it in Python or here's
how we do in Swift but there are a lot
of different areas in which you can
invest in tooling and I kind of wanted
to just bring up like those dozen
questions because those are things that
I thought about like as a tech lead as a
developer for where we should be
investing as far as the tooling and then
how we go about selecting those tools so
anyway this is the first time that I've
given this talk so if you all could do
me a huge favor and send a text message
pull out your phones and send a text
message to this Twilio phone number it
is a four one five two hundred thirty
nine eighty four and on a scale of one
to ten how likely are you recommend this
talk to a friend or a colleague this
will help me to determine how I should
be improving this talk over time since
this is the first time that I've given
this talk so if you just send a text
message with like zero or ten or any
number in between this got helps me to
get a feel for how this talk base is
benchmarked against some of my other
talks which tend to be much more like in
the in the weeds as opposed to like sort
of a high level overview of sort of the
DevOps space so if you're like hey you
really should have dug into monitoring
more or something like that this is a
great opportunity I will read every
single every single comment my favorite
comment that I ever got as I'm leaving
this up on a technical talk it was all
live coded talk and I was on WebSockets
and I got three and the guy said it
wasn't anything I couldn't learn on the
internet which i was like wow if I give
a talk and it's not anything you can you
have it has to be something that you
can't learn on the Internet I'd be like
totally screwed but hopefully you have
some sort of constructive feedback that
I can take to improve this talk over
time so anyway my name is Matt Makai I'm
a developer evangelist with Twilio the
author of full stack Python comm you can
find me on github or you can shoot me an
email
at Tulio calm thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
