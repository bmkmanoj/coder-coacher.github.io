session agri Phil and we are about to
demonstrate you how Java place in a very
important role in farm first I want to
introduce ourselves this is my wife eff
insta and she works at lime tree as a
trainer we get all kinds of educational
sessions sessions for a wide range from
very young students children from h10 to
range of adult farmers educating them in
farming and technology in general and
she's the head of education at line 3 my
name is Tim on planes nah I'm a Java
developer at the lime tree and I develop
some stuff and you move to make
something about our company it's a
fairly new company we exist for a little
over a year now and what we do is we
create smart IT solutions for
agriculture and we use Java to do this
and this is fairly unique in
agricultural sector because there's a
lot of very classic development classic
embedded development in c and c++ and i
think we are one of the only players in
the field that that's using java in
agriculture right for embedded as well
as the software we make we have two
offices well actually we have a lot of
offices because every every house is an
office in our company the majority of
the developers are located in running in
the netherlands and we also have some
people in Madrid in Spain we are the the
maintainer and the inventor so you can
speak of agri sense which is the first
world's first and only open source farm
analysis system and which one at Dukes
Choice Award in 2012 so this was the
first time we
we go to Jaffa one in 2012 and we are
also participating in some European
projects one of them is called five
space which is about business
collaboration and it looks to be very
promising so maybe next year I can show
you something about that would be quite
interesting as well I think all right
briefly the content of this session
first I will explain you some concepts
of precision agriculture because it
plays quite an important role in in this
session so without basic knowledge of
what precision agriculture is it would
be hard time to place all the concepts
and give it context then we will tell
you something about our educational
program and something about a cuisines
and how it connects the two things
together and finally we have our Lego
tractor demo so precision agriculture
what is it really well as as to say it
has something to do with agriculture and
it has something to do with precision so
traditionally a farmer treats his entire
field as one object so it's one object
you you put some fertilizer honest you
apply the same dose on the entire field
if you want to spray something you spray
it in same dose on the entire field and
what you do is a farm and you always
want to be on the safe side so if you
have a disease at a certain spot on your
field you treat the entire field with
pesticides or fungicides whatever the
disease is just to be sure because you
cannot apply any variations so this is
where precision agriculture steps in we
allow management on the square
centimeter or square inch depending on
where you're located on the globe and it
allows you to apply only the sickness so
the bad parts of the field you spray
with herbicides or pesticides and you
control can control the disease and use
much less pesticides which is much
much better for the environment because
less of the pesticides will end up in
the water and in water it will end up in
the entire ecosystem and it affects all
the plants and the growth and you get
all Jesus in your in your water and all
kinds of bad things will happen and
another one is the the farm is a mullet
because pesticides are really really
expensive so the less you can use them
the better it is for your world so
another thing what's beneficial for the
farm is that precision agriculture
allows for automated data extraction so
we can real-time connect with the
tractor we can extract all the data of
what the farmer is doing all the tasks
that he executes it and we can apply it
in our management software and any also
as a record of what he has been doing
and that he can show to the local
authorities which you need to maintain
your farming license you need to say
okay this is the day i sprayed
pesticides I checked all the weather
conditions it was not too dry it was not
too hot it was not to win the etc etc
have to mention I suppose yeah and one
important part of this is I suppose who
if you are familiar with the canvas in
in cars oh I will explain it briefly
then it's it's like a gateway internally
in a car and it connects all the
components of the car together so the
transmission box with the dashboard with
the engine and it allows for
communication between those systems and
it saves this was a real innovation in
car automotive industry because it saves
you a tons of wires the wiring system
becomes much more easy because you only
have to connect your device to the
gateway and you don't have to connect
all the devices directly together so it
was a real innovation in automated
industry and in agriculture they have
extended this concept and this is called
the I service and it allows you
for a plug-and-play system with the
tractor so you can add the terminal and
connect it to the I service you can add
GPS on the roof connected to the I
service you can your implement is
connected to the I service and all the
sensors and that this allows you to
collect sensor data on your terminal and
combining it with the GPS data which is
also published on the only I suppose
combine it together and store it in the
form of or send it to some serve for
this place quite important part in
allowing farmers to fly appreciation
aggregate oh yes so in short what's the
farm in doing or as simple as something
called the Deming cycle or it during
circle so you will in short it is
creating a plan executing the plan
checking what you have done act upon it
and it's very simple it's very similar
to what you do in programming you create
your code you'll execute your coat or
debug your code you check what it's
doing if it meets your expectations or
you run your tests and then you fix it
and then you repeat the cycle over and
over again so it's very intuitive way of
people to work and most people work like
this but in farming strangely enough
most farmers don't don't do it like this
they don't explicitly check what they
are doing that's because the span
between the X and you take and the
results you have it can be over a year
or at least a season so by the time they
are harvesting they forgot what exactly
all the actions they took and combined
with complexity of the weather system
and the soil system the farmer gets lost
he cannot manage this all this data in
its in his mind so if you apply the
Deming circle to a small piece of code
it's fairly simple that some line of
code you change will affect the result
but in farming is much much more more
complex because if you apply more
fertilizer you might actually end up
having less harvest
and well is it related to more
fertilizer or what is related to bad
weather conditions it's very hard to
tell so this is an example of how we
collect data and this is sensors which
are connected to the spraying booms as
you can see on the left picture and well
this is not you cannot see the beams
coming from the sensor actually so but
what it does it basically it takes a
picture of the soil beneath and it
doesn't use a normal visual bandwidth
that you use infrared and near-infrared
and by using applying a formula on those
two readings you can determine the index
for the vegetation that's really that's
called the vegetation index and the
vegetation index which is a number
between zero and one says something
about the amount of vegetation that's
beneath the sensor so if it the number
is zero there is no vegetation at all so
you're probably writing in the desert or
on the highway or something similar like
and like this and if it's one the entire
bandwidth is saturated with vegetation
so there's vegetation all over the all
over the place all over the picture so
in in practice on the early stages of
the crop it will nearing 20 and on the
end stages of the crop it will nearing
to 21 so this is something you can use
by combining the sensor reading with the
GPS location of the sensor at that time
you can create a picture which could
like look like this so as you see this
is like a bird few of some fields it's a
little bit manipulated so it's fast yeah
it's a little bit the bit crooked but it
gives you a way of showing it in an
augment reality kind of way so you add
extra data extra information to the
official picture in this case just the
same what
you doing in for the you can vary see
very good and see the variations in the
field so you on the left side you see
your red spot on the on the left side
you see a red spot as well and this is
the place where the tractor is making
its turns and by making the turns it
will drive up the same spot a lot of the
time so the soil gets compact and when
the soil is compact the plants have
really difficult is to grow because the
roots cannot enter the soil so that
that's why the places are rat on the
left on the right into in the middle
there's a large portion of green but
even in the green portions you see a
variation in how good the crop is
growing so the dark green areas are
growing very well and the light green
areas are slightly less so you see in
the southern part there's more light
green and less dark green in the
northern part there's more dark green
and s5 coupe so this is a clear
indication that something going on in
the bottom part of the field so now you
and the next step would be to wonder why
is it and what can I do about it because
I want everything to be dark green
because the darker the green the more
yield I have from my field but this
information alone is not enough because
it only gives you an indication that
something might be wrong so you need to
combine this information with more day
even more data so you need the soil map
so maybe there is a breaking a line
between two different types of soil or
maybe there was a different crop on the
on the southern part in the year before
that which might affect the current crop
so you need to make overlays of all
kinds of information that might be
relevant and make calculations that
cross through all the layers so on the
right side you see all the layers that
you can combine in different grid sizes
and some have polygons some have grits
so all different kinds of types we
compress them together you can apply a
calculation and then you get something
like it's shown on the left which is
actually actually a screenshot of
of agri sense and now you can apply this
to do an execution plan so you have
executed your plan you've sewn your
seeds and then you have checked what's
the result by measuring it with sensor
data now you have analyzed what might be
the cause of the differentiation and now
it's time to act so the chart on the
left is creating a plan and then you can
apply it to a dosage of fertilized for
example so you can say okay light green
or vintage after I I'm gonna women have
more names for course than than I so i
will say green and orange and red so we
can say Amen clear maybe if i can help
you with the names if you're really
interested in okay so you could say okay
Rhett I will apply 100 milliliters of
fertilizer per square meter the green
part 150 and the orange part 200 and
then you can export this chart or map
into a machine-readable format which is
again you can import into the tractor
and then the driver will go on the field
and because all of the implements are
connected to the I suppose the tractor
knows where it is so the terminal also
knows where it is which is called the
toss controller the task controller was
able to read the map so it can check on
a map what's the current location where
am I on the net and what dosage applies
to this location and then it will send
this information to the spraying
implement which is on the back and it
will say okay you have to apply 100
milliliters per square meter at this
point or maybe the left section should
spray 100 milliliter and the right
section of 110 50 and because the iso
base is so fast you can really execute
the plan as you do it without the drive
for the farmer or it can be an unskilled
worker even having to manually
pull all kinds of Labor's to adjust the
dosage so you can execute plan
automatically so something about
education which hotel you yes we do want
to tell you something about education
because in well I stand here because
otherwise have two microphones you can
sit here that's not a problem the well
as you may be sensed the precision
agriculture is a little bit complex and
most of the farmers in Holland and even
in Europe that is the average age is
like 50 so we want to encourage farmers
to continue to be to farm so we want to
educate them how to use our product of
course and we think it's fun to start at
the bottom so with kids and we start at
the age of 10 and we continue to do it
in college and high school and well
every age we do have a farmer courses
and well that's more explicit of course
but we do want to tell you something
about what we do with what H because we
start at the front part the programming
the Lego everybody thinks that's fun so
we start with that at the at the age of
10 and we give programming tutorials and
we use the Lego and a raspberry pi they
have to do all constructing things and
even make them program we do not use a
green food or anything we just use Java
right yeah I'm the educational type I
don't do the Java thing but okay and
it's a great way for the kids to get
them to think about how to solve a
problem and to make them aware of where
food comes from that milk doesn't come
from a factory or anything so we combine
all this and have a fun lesson actually
when they get a bit older and get to
high school we do projects that take a
bit longer because the other one said
just for a few hours but the project
take like six to eight weeks and school
gives us we have to provide the school
with real life business get use cases
and in Holland we have something it's
called technetium it's like gymnasium I
don't know I think gymnasium is
everywhere right it's about languages
but this one is about technique so it's
really cool and the kids learn all stuff
about technique and they have to do and
everything with the engineering part
they have to build they have to make
drawings and what they do want to know
is how to learn anything about the food
security so where if there's a problem
they can look at the whole range what
was I saying food cute so if for example
if we are not so long ago in Europe we
at this pace of a bacteria ending up in
the food chain and people were panicking
all the way and at some point and
somebody said well it might be on the
cucumbers so everybody stopped eating
cucumbers and millions and millions of
cucumbers but just waste it because
nobody wanted them anymore and it just
was just based on the rumor nobody had
any facts about it so what we're not
doing is we are linking the entire food
chain so that you can actually trace the
cucumber that's being sold to the field
where it's being run so if some problem
ends up at some way of the food chain
you can always trace it back to the
origin and you can check all the steps
and then you can say okay it wasn't the
cucumber because in the end it wasn't
like you come it was I think what the
little sofa or for something like this
but ok kids can trace it we use a crow
sense in this and they
can trace the produce through the supply
chain and when they get all that they go
to college and it's more precise so we
go to university that's more towards the
agricultural thing and we go to ite
university so it's more of a different
thing we do include both of the things
because in our case it's it's connected
and because we have the Lego tractor
it's a nice way of course Sharon still
like the Legos yeah well not even the
students teachers is room yeah and in
this this way we can easy include the
small-scale experimentation and the Lego
makes it tangible so it's it's a fun way
of teaching we did do a special practice
and in the school of our son it was
really funny it took only two hours but
they did create and we have good results
we made three groups one group was
creating an agile tractor so it had to
be steerable the next was making well
writing code actually and they had to
make the sensor to create a respond and
give it commands so we'll demonstrate
later I you did me see do the sticky
tape thing so that's where we were very
demonstrated and one group was making a
field path so they give commands we had
like blue was to the rights yellow was
to the left we had slowed for words fast
forward and stop very important and well
here you see them in action really they
had to make a drawing about how to
create the steerable thing and then
build it this was actually more
difficult than the coding for the kids
it was it was some kind of a struggle I
think it's at some point we tipped from
being creators in the physical world to
being creators in the digital world so
the kids were I think if you go back
maybe 10 years ago
then the kids would have rocked the the
Lego part and who would have a real
difficulty with the programming part but
at at what we realized is that they have
more troubles with placing the real
objects and forming the images in their
head and translating it to something you
do with your hands so that was real it
was a struggle but fun it was fun yeah
and well this is actually a Timo's
brother teaching them how to program and
well even the girls liked it very much
that's always a good thing to see the
the women in the profession yeah they
did well and this was a me creating a
path where the kids you see a blue slow
forward green is fast forward red is
turned to the right yellow is turning to
the left and well here we don't have the
stopping sign but it's black and well it
was more difficult than they thought it
was because it's sirable but not that's
durable that they can make a u-turn so
it was something to think about and the
results were well like this I was
terrible Indiana Dunes dear well we
didn't just have had enough time it is
to drive forwards and backwards based on
the color its sense so I think that was
for only two hours it was already quite
an achievement yeah and this was
actually the beginning of this this is
our prototype we just we learn something
about it ourselves I can show you video
you can sell something about it yeah
this is one of our first prototypes you
see Omar and dining table as you can see
there are no wires there are a lot of
life as you can see but they are not
connected to to the pc so it's driving
on its own and it's trying to do
something with the sensors but as you
can see we are now using the sticky tape
not now you can see why because it
creates quite a mess but it stayed on a
table and it was very much fun to play
with yeah are you see our construction
team they are creating the Lego tractor
and they had quite some fun we didn't
pay them for that so it's not like
illegal no we involved our our kids now
this is the these are the kids from one
of our co-workers so our kids got me
involved at some point I think that's
one of the benefits of having parents
with their own company you get to do
some work as well if you like it or not
yeah no choice if you want food you have
to work the father has a big farm we
provides he provides for the food all
right slides nice
alright architecture want to go back up
okay um how Madison
I cannot click and talk at the same time
so for me to be up here alright so I
want to tell you something about about
the architecture because it's quite a
complex complex system so this is a
simplified version of the architecture
we're on the lower left you have the
tractor which is the actual tractor so
it's not necessarily our Lego tracker
but it can also be a real word tractor
which is connected to a manufacturer
surface so what one point about the
agricultural sector is that the
companies involved in agriculture are
really conservative and they do not
allow for much access to their devices
because they're scared shitless that
somebody will hack it and make the
gigantic machinery and go among which
could cost quite some damage yeah there
are there can be quite big agricultural
machinery so what I do it but they
realize that they are coming from this
real shielded environments where
everything is closed all their
management software is closed it's
running only on a machine all the
tractors are closed you cannot access it
and they are more starting to realize
that this is not the way of the future
it's internet of things so they have to
think but not yet the internet soured
issue they are now starting to realize
that they should put the things in the
internet so I'm but we are helping them
with it so most manufacturers starting
to create their own services they have
their own proprietary connection string
between the manufacturer reserves and
the tractor and what we do is we call
those services and we have to create
specific connection because well they
have some standards in agriculture but
of course when its innovative there is
no standards yet so everybody does what
it likes so every API is different and
we don't want to bother the clients with
all these api so what we do is we create
connectors for all the API
we get all this data into the Agricenter
surfer and can make it visible in the in
the client so what manufacturer serves
what I do standardized that all their
API SAR rest so at least they learn
something what we use for our connection
between the server and the backend is
open dolphin it's open source library
which allows for River a real-time
connections between client and server
which is real nice and well between the
tractor and manufacturer service is
usually some some GPS or g3 based
solution but it differs some some have
also Wi-Fi support so if you are in
range of the Wi-Fi you can use Wi-Fi so
but the little Bowl which was equal
sense in the other one it's actually a
little bit more complex and I'm showing
you this because if my laptop's start to
run slowly then you know why in a while
because i installed everything on my
local server but we have a very similar
approach to gaming because gaming you
can learn a lot from gaming if you look
at the architecture from games that's
what all guys say yeah so so i need to
play some games otherwise so it's good
to play games all right but usually when
you log into one gaming server we first
you have to log in and then you see your
account so you're in your account and
you see all the world's you can play and
how many characters you have on them and
you can select ok I want to play on this
world and then you enter the world and
at that point the client starts to
connect with that specific world so in
essence we are doing exactly the same so
first the client connects to the
universe the universe contains all the
worlds it's perfectly fits together it
uses the authentication server to
authorize the connection between the
client and the universe and then if its
standard allows surfer now
in a bit more details about and then
when you select the world you see only
the world's you have access to you
select the world and at that point
authenticated secure connection between
the client and the world is established
so what these are some names I'm not
going to mention they know all what we
are using yeah thanks all right so these
are some manufacturers we work together
with john deere well i think john deere
is the most old tractor in the united
states most people from the US will be
familiar with john deere you can visit
their API as well it's on developable
cheer comp it's not been there for for a
long time I think only in a year now and
they're really opening up and starting
to realize that they should embrace
developers so there are more giving us
then Danny all the way around it used to
be they used to be so close that at one
point one of the developers got so angry
that he left the company any published
all the code they're all the api's so
then people start to heck oh they're all
there for months and start to hack all
that files and but I don't think they
were very much pleased about it but
maybe that was maybe it also helped to
for them to open up with at some point
they realized maybe we should not keep
everything a secret with open up to the
world to live and the other one is echo
it's not selling so much attracted it's
a it's an american-based company
somewhere in the Midwest I don't know
exactly where but it's most mainly
selling in in Southern America South
America and in Europe it has brands like
Messi Ferguson and a whole bunch of
other brands and we were working with
them for a long time
and the third one is an implement
manufacturer it circled crinoline and
they were recently acquired by a
Japanese company called kubota which is
they're also making the the forklift
trucks orange ones and I think there are
after toyota the second manufacturer of
diesel motors in the world so they are
quite big and we are currently
developing the api together with them so
that's very useful so they can do it the
right way and once with that and
something about our tracker so what's in
it this is somewhat of a shopping and
shopping list you can speak it contains
the raspberry pi because we needed the
brain so we chose the raspberry pi as a
brain because ignorant Java is really
affordable accessible there are tons of
other demonstrations about the raspberry
pi on the other line I don't get it out
no I'll leave it in yes I leave it in
but then we need to connect the
Raspberry Pi to Lego so there is
something called the brake line which is
a board which you can attach attach to
the possible point and it contains the
Lego Mindstorms connectors so you can
use regular lego motors and their cables
I think they look like regular cables
only the switch the you know the little
thingy that that keeps the connector in
place like this yeah but they moved us
from the left to the right so it looks
like a standard connector rj12 of thing
but it is actually a custom Lego
connector which is you have to buy the
cables from Lego other vices don't work
yeah for this from their spare
perspective it's really smart with
anyway not good for our use we need a
9-volt battery unfortunately because
they are really a pain in years to work
with mainly because they lost very not
long yeah
and they can be empty in about about 10
minutes so I think this is one maybe the
hundredth of a 9-volt battery we're
using so all the environmental stuff
you're saving with the precision
agriculture we're not spending on
batteries so maybe at some point we find
a retractable solution for this and we
have the Raspberry Pi needs power as
well because the nine volts is only to
power the motor and we use the mobile
phone battery this one yeah it's this
one it's it's brit is fairly light and
it lasts a few hours so it's very useful
ettore are common to acquire you can
reach arches so it's better for the
environment than the nine volt current
solution so with this I think this is
very a nice way to power a raspberry pi
we saw some other other projects having
trouble with it and thank you most of
them use the same you use the same in
the drone right yeah and but for the
Lego we used standard Lego Mindstorms
motors and sensors Lego comes with a
color sensor it can sense up to six
colors well those co suc over there in
some sense and it will produce a value
between 0 and 5 and data indicating what
color this and motors which are some of
them are just playing motors and our
gift also feedback about how many
rotations they make which is quite nice
because you can then analyze how far
you're going far to the left or to the
right our Lego is a customized version
of the 8284 it's not you can buy it
anymore in stores because they only made
it for about a year with most models but
there are quite some some sites which
which sell them second handing you can
buy them for I think 30 30 euros so you
can have quite some funding for
quite a little money we need and we
build a customer spraying device because
all the index system we want to add some
well show it to it it's pretty cool
right okay good now we have to switch he
has to do the coding do i get the lego
over there yes very under what name okay
not a muscle or so let's switch to all
of our favorite ID
this is the imprint their commercials on
the old dream about net beach
did this myth just fill it before oh it
spits yeah yeah and like something on
the data
alright
so we have three pieces of software
basically one part is running on the PI
1 part is a server so we can access the
data and the other part is the GUI so we
can control the tractor so we can
simulate being and drive and so first it
the tractor let's hope is very slow all
right but what we used to send the
commands to the treacherous it's quite
the basic UDP solution so what we're
doing is just broadcasting commands what
we want to do to the lego tractor the
other part we are all saying using UDP
to retrieve the data back from the from
the tractor I think I think in the next
version we probably use MQTT for that
because it's it's a more reliable
solution but for sending the commands
you can't really use a queue because if
the queues get closer at some point you
get a delay in your in your steering it
and know it can be completely this quite
annoying i guess but annoying so I think
UDP is quite a good solution to just you
can just bombard the tractor with what
you want and it doesn't matter if some
packages get lost because the most
recent command is to do it and the one
you want to send anyway all right so we
define some commands like forward so
this is the the code that's running on
the pine and we just check what commands
get in what's command is being received
with the UDP listener and then we will
translate it to something the tractor
can understand so we set the we say that
the tractor estimate has to start
driving move to more the forward or
backwards left or right so this is the
steering and also
we named them this is the spraying arms
to extract them or get them back in and
the the other components is sort of a
component and we used just a simple rest
resource and so we hard-coded this this
particular vehicle but you can imagine
that it would be very trivial to add a
little database behind this and make the
pie register on the surface
automatically with its ID in the brand
and the model number and oh my it's just
someone happy coincidence between we are
using wildfly as server and the current
development name of our twice Kenny but
my brother is called Kenny as well so we
use it we use the name ken he's awesome
track you worked a little olive work on
the train and then well we have the
sister reasons
was assuming some rest annotations where
they cannot find him anymore
I don't know where he went all right are
they over there they must be there some
some upon all right so at this exposes
that get measurements and admeasurement
so the vehicle can add measurements to
the server and then ever since server
can pull all the measurements back from
the staff and the measurements is
something that the sensor is reading on
the ground so every now and then it will
read the current value of what's beneath
so hopefully it will be something like
what what's that over there and then it
will send back to the server the data
and then it will be published basically
all right so now it's time for the demo
yep all right well that's me from yahoo
oh yes I'll show you a video first yes
it's very very soon I have something
cool to show yeah so this is a young cop
this is the husband of my colleague
koneko so he's doing his daily work now
or riding on this tractor and because we
really want to emphasize so this is a
message for you from from echo and it
has all kinds of kinds of equipment
attached to it so on the front you have
the storage for the seeds then you have
something that prepares the length it
injects the seeds and on the end it will
close up the earth again so you have
four implements connected to the same
device and they are all interacting
together very very nicely it's only a
pizza you will go on forever all right
pinnacle I didn't do that now your
microcontroller tell me so now i am
going to this I've set up a local stock
that's a bit of an immaterial almost a
inator Jennifer the last weekend i know
i love that for any way you know ok
sorry brothers
ah now we're your finger look yeah can
you share the tractor everything oh I
have to lift it up you know just with
the camera so the people that are not
very close they can see the key alright
so now you can see that it's a real
traction if it life in screen it's very
nice app you can turn your your your
mobile phone into a wireless camera
which is quite brilliant nothing so
cheeky yes real 3d image you can see the
motor excuse for steering there maybe
you can show that the pilots inside oh
you can put the lid off you can keep it
off so here you see the battery it's
green so it's powered I'm not getting
the battery out because it doesn't get
in so you see here the rig by maybe you
can show it aside yeah how about that
looking inside apply so the bottom part
is the the pie and on top of it is the
the connector all right
so first let's start up all the surface
we want to start so i'll go to please so
i can show you what we have here is the
our authentication server which is the
key clock which which provides us with
the oauth2 back end we have the open
oven back end which basically this is a
world we have the same farm server which
is the one collecting all the data from
the tractor and publishing it and we
have the universe which will provide the
worlds will start now
all right we hope it drives smoothly
because of the high carpet we had it in
our hotel room and it was a bit of a
struggle so yeah garbage is providing a
lot of resistance and because you can
pull the lid off save some weight okay
wait actually we have to make holes in
the in the in the back because if the
implement got too heavy and the motors
has a real problem powering it up
alright so now I have to connect to the
to the PI by bail on
this one
who this bed odisha thank you it's kind
of connected is the Y fighter no no no
what's the what I'm doing this one
station no you said off
the apartment below
I'll pick up me nose done well maybe you
can maybe there are questions questions
something so far
that's the Wi-Fi here go to them my
question is how is ours the Wi-Fi
connected it's connected to a Wi-Fi USB
adapter have you got an idea no yo its
firing up so it's okay okay yes woohoo
anymore little lie anymore questions
quickly before the go I brought my own
wireless routers and so I don't have to
bother with the frelling network oracle
open network now it should connect
please
alright so here you can see now I can
run the script which basically starts at
the the lid UDP listener process
yeah so now it's listening it's
broadcasting the motor speed it's not
very interesting all right now I should
be able to show you the surfer people in
the back maybe you can come to the front
because I cannot show you how oh thank
you can come up again and other and
gather a bit that's not there's no
problem so here you see the rest offer
and that is producing the XML data and
here i have the method for the
measurements as you can see it's still
empty all right
so now I can start up let's first start
up the GUI
run forrest
now this is on my local local machine so
I started a little Jeff FX application
here you can see what it's white with
red skinnies awesome structure so I know
that it made the real-time connection
with the with the tractor and now I
should be able to yes that goes through
spraying arms sorry yeah he works all
right I can do it dance it's rice it's
not going for very fast because of the
carpet which is cereal it's nice for
your feet that not so nice for trekkers
yeah like this yeah oh yeah thanks Jim
so when it hits the the pink paper but
oh I have to start a sensor collection
so I have to say no no boss it doesn't
have an iso bus so you have to do it all
yourself and I had bosses like five
seconds and 20 start so now I'd well
yeah does it well no it's not moving
yes so now you can see the sensor is
lining up ok I can go to the center and
at the same time now we can look at the
measurements I should get some data
which I com something that should be
sensing blue Oh give me there
oh do you there's an error
I think now it's accumulating data you
can check it yeah here it goes so I see
the point where i'm simulating the
points it has to fail you 02 now so now
i'm driving again hurry to the other
spot
so now I parked the sensor on the yellow
spot and see here now here I have 20 dot
for value so which is different from the
front so this is the 02 is the blue the
zero dot one is the carpet and 0 does
for is the is the yellow spot so let's
see if the battery lasts long enough for
the circle
and see the sensor the light can see it
on the green oh sorry not not again you
know multitasking is not my strong point
it's getting slower so I know you
already see the batteries draining okay
Musa I'm saying once again because the
camera was off oh it works but now I'm
not spraying anymore now what's a spring
or collecting data oh alright oh I know
what happened hey you broke one oh no
it's off but it's okay all right that's
up and now we've collected quite some
data as you can see here and now I want
to show you something else which I find
pretty cool which is ever since
no five Anita ok if you have any
questions while while ever since
starting up any questions yeah in front
o the question is how I got interested
in farming well I one of my first
assignments when I was a program was for
the department of agriculture in the
Netherlands and we did a big project
about but manure fertilizer yeah because
of the european union said well there's
probably too much manure being produced
in the netherlands so we want to have
some regulation about this so you have
to move it from the south whereas
there's a lot of big farmers producing
 and in the North there's a lot of
arable farming so wheat corn stock stuff
like that so that's the thought well we
need a very complex regulation system to
move all the from the south to
north so so we spend about four year
program creating all this difficult law
implemented in software and support
farmers for years with a team of four
forty people i think and then after the
first year and we discovered that there
was not too much but it was too
little so we needed to import this
 so so after one there was a really
shitty project
actually the project was quite nice but
no so that was my first my first meeting
with agriculture and then my next
employee I got in contact by accident
maybe or faith with the agriculture as
well so you know and it's useful then I
met ya Niko was my colleague at my
previous company and she lives on a farm
heroes with this full-time farm and so
that really connected all the dots and
we decided well let's start our own
company and see what happens alright so
as you can see this is the geek locker
login this is a NetBeans platform
application it doesn't look like this
because this is not typically the first
thing you see in on that means
application it contains a pep you and
the really nice thing about gig log
because it can be a real hassle dealing
with OAuth when you have a rich client
application it can be really painting
yes the key club comes off the shell
with an insult adapter and you can load
it just as a jar as a dependency we just
had to do a very slight modification of
the class to make it work with javafx
the only thing we needed to do is
instead of opening a browser opening it
in a ref you which you can see here so
what you see here is actually a ref you
so now i can login it will connect to
the to the server and now it's loading
the next splash screen of the
application which is also jeff effects
and this is the result coming from the
universe server and universe help me ok
currently the only available world in
your universe is the local host which is
this one so i can click it and now it
will start up this secure connection
between the client and the locals
I think if it is busy now I hope it is
yeah are there any more questions before
we run out of time yes there yeah I know
because young bc it is
I also
if you haven't updated again know how
much
first question was are the farmers
resistance towards change and the second
one do you have enough data to see how
much of the changes first question is
really easy to answer the farmers are
not resistant towards change but they
are resistant towards anything which has
to do with computers because all they
want to do farming they want to sit on
the sector and ideally they stand up
from that eat something go to the
tractor spend the whole day on the
tractor then get off eat something go to
go to bed that's the ideal well for
similar to programs programs love to
program all day and all the other stuff
is just it's just you don't
want to deal with it you don't want to
register all your hours you work for the
client know that that's just nonsense
you don't want to do it so we realized
that farmers were in the same business
so what we want to do is is banned all
the computers from the side and that's
why we want to have the real-time
connection myths attracted so agronomist
who likes computers can collect all the
data from the farm instructor and upload
the new task to the tractor and that way
it becomes really easy for the farm and
it doesn't have to spend any time on a
computer so that that will eliminate all
the resistance because he would really
love to spend less fertilizer and less
pesticides because it's better for its
length and his land is his future all
the farmers want their children to
continue the farm so he thinks in terms
of of decades not in years so he's not
really interested in only profit for
this year's he's interested in creating
and sustainable business and I have to
be really quick yes and the second
question was oh what's what's it what
was the second place
no we don't yet I just started so that
that's why but in order to prove the
benefits of precision agriculture we
need to collect all the data and in
order to collect all the data we need to
lower the resistance of the farmers and
we can only do that by eliminating all
the software stuff so what I wanted to
show you is actually the tractor running
around on the map in a questions but I'm
fear i'll be running a little out of
time but i will try to to rush it in so
i have to make kinney
and this is actually around where we
live so the tractor is running around in
our own neighborhood here it is
so I can drag it onto the map and then
at some point I can should show
I also exported it in CSV which is that
the common sensor data formats we should
be able to load this one as well and any
more questions in the meantime yeah
cotton farmers in York
pieces
yeah exactly yeah
yes
and that's exactly that's exactly what
we want is saying well you're now
educating a new breed of foreigners and
that's exactly what we want to achieve
that we want to interest young people
into farming because I was at a program
or a meeting at some point he says why
are you in farming it's totally boring I
said do you really know how many
computers there are on a phone on a
machine there are so many computers and
screens everywhere it's like what i said
in the keynote this morning there's
robots everywhere a car is a robot so
that's enough for us to do and it's
really fun to enthusiasts all the the
young kids and see what it contains to
be a farmer and well there's future and
everybody needs farmers every country
does without promised we wouldn't be
here so it's it's it's a good cause I
think oh you see oh yeah so the colors
the colors can be a little different and
the location as well but with us because
I simulated the GPS coordinates because
we have no gps inside but the idea is
the same that you sense a location
actually you know this is this is an
upper street map but we built in some
map caching so now you can see that when
i zoom in too much then it doesn't have
any cash data so you will see no data
which is the caching part is quite nice
because you can work with it offline as
well I am totally offline and still have
a map which can move and interact and
which is open source as well so you can
if you look up a lime tree on a bit
bucket there is a map viewer which you
can use in your netbeans platform
applications which comes with tire cash
and and stuff like that what
are there any more questions or can we
thank you for coming mr. it's all right
okay we have to thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
