server initiatives at arm and today I'm
going to talk about the impact of data
consumption and how are we as an
industry scaling to be able to meet some
of the challenges that are presented by
the deluge of data that we will be
seeing so first of all how many of you
here have heard of arm I guess you're
here because you've heard of arm okay
for those of you how many of you have a
cell phone well you're an armed user so
arm is the microprocessor IP company
that develops processors that partners
like Samsung broadcom Marvel and others
use in their semiconductors into end
products like the samsung s4 is an
example and there are of course other
many other mobile platforms including
this surface tablet that I'm using to
present today so get the hang of this so
as I mentioned arm is one of the world's
leading semiconductor IP companies and
we actually ship 23 million our
partnership 23 million arm-based
processors every day so if you're doing
the math that's about 8.7 billion
processors that were shipped last year
and that's billion with a B and over the
last 20 years we've shipped over 40
billion processors and actually a bulk
of that 40 billion has happened over the
last four to five years in terms of
volumes and our growth rate you know has
been over twenty five percent compound
annual growth rate over the last five
years one of the key things about arm is
it's not just about arm but it's really
about our partners success and we have
over nine hundred and eighty different
processor licenses and there are
ends of developers and billions of users
you might actually be developing from
without even knowing it so clearly one
of the I mentioned you know it's not
just about innovation innovative
technology it's also about our
innovative business model so really our
whole focus is around partnership and
working with with the industry whether
it be you know end users or operators
OEMs silicon partners software partners
the entire value chain and we do we
develop the components that go into the
chips themselves not you know not the
overall SOC s and you can see to the top
left over there that picture you can see
that that diagram over there was
actually so many company logos on there
is about thousand partners that we have
in our partner ecosystem so we're kind
of into were five years into the third
era of mobile computing and what I mean
by that is if you think about the 60s
and the 70s it was the era of the
mainframe and the mini computer and then
excuse me the 90s and the early part of
the two thousand was really the pc
desktop internet connected user era and
then the last five years has really been
the mobile computing era and actually in
2011 we said that we would be fifty
percent of the mobile computing market
by 2015 it turns out we actually were
fifty percent of the computing market
this year so that was kind of
interesting so what's what's interesting
about that is that there's an ever
increasing data intensity so if you look
at it one minute of video is around 300
megabytes of data what a one-minute call
on skype is around 3 megabytes of
data and a voice call is only about
point O five megabytes of data is but it
all adds up and there's an ever
increasing data intensity but let's come
back to that in a few minutes so how
will the world change over the next five
to seven years you know we put 2020 as a
target in terms of thinking of our
thinking about things it's actually not
that far away the belief is that with
emerging economies and the growth of
population that we will there will be
about 1.1 billion extra consumers by the
year twenty twenty and that's really not
only is it going to cause stress in a
number of different areas it's also a
bigger market for a lot of our products
and our meaning the industry in general
but it also will cause stress on
healthcare people are living for longer
there are more chronic diseases being
identified and need to be managed in
healthcare it's a real strain on
healthcare another interesting area I
mean everyone's been hearing about the
Internet of Things and this year we
believe there are about 10 billion
internet-connected devices but in the
next seven years that's expected to
triple to 30 billion internet-connected
devices by the year twenty twenty so all
of this growth in infrastructure growth
and population is putting a significant
demand on global energy consumption so
what can we expect so in the year twenty
twenty it's expected that there will be
about eight billion people worldwide of
which six billion will have mobile
phones and interestingly enough there
are places in the world where they don't
have plumbing basic plumbing or
electricity but they do have a mobile
phone and there's been several studies
in a number of different areas where
they show that Internet connectivity or
a mobile phone actually increases
people's the economy in that region so
this year there or last year there
around a bill
our smartphones that were sold but in
2020 that number is expected to grow 5x
to about 5 billion smartphones and you
might think about who's going to be able
to afford a five-hundred-dollar phone
actually there are entry-level
smartphones that are coming out in the
forty to fifty dollar range and there
are target's specifically at developing
current countries in developing markets
so it's a real interesting growth trend
so what could you do by connecting these
billions of people and so you know
mobile connectivity is really changing
the way the world does things I Michigan
will skip ahead one slide so most
people's mobile phones are their primary
compute device a lot of people including
my eight-year-old daughter her first
source of computing is not to go to the
desktop that we have at home but or a
laptop it's really to go to my phone or
or her iPad so it really people's way of
looking at things sorry is different and
for most of the world's population their
mobile phone is their first compute
experience but what could you do with a
mobile for weather with a smart
connected world some great examples
there's examples of in Kenya for example
there's this empezo system where they
had a mobile payment system and they've
actually found that the the micro
economy of that region grew
significantly because they had people
conducting transactions with their
mobile phones and so that was kind of a
bartering system other interesting
applications nomadic farmers can get
maps of various drought ridden areas in
their region so that if they're as
they're they're going around with their
herds they can find places for water and
food there are examples in Bangladesh
where people are using smartphones to
treat patients remotely so basically
they have a remote station where the
where the x-ray is taken
and it gets sent to the doctor
smartphone and they're able to treat
people like that there are even some
cool things like there is a
microcontroller company called ambach
where they're actually the ingestible
for for health reasons for example so
people are looking at really small
microcontrollers that can be inserted
into the human eye and help with vision
and things like that so there's lots of
cool applications for this kind of
technology that's kind of being driven
out of out of the mobile world so let's
talk a little bit about it's going the
wrong way so let's talk a little bit
about how mobility is reshaping people's
behavior so it turns out probably not
new news to all of you but twenty-three
percent of all us adults consume news
from a mobile device and in China for
example in china mobile internet users
on their mobile device surpass desktop
users last year another interesting
statistic last year you know a lot of
these content providers are now
providing mobile apps and that's the
first place that people are consuming
their content and I'm sure you've seen
ads for people watching the Super Bowl
there or the latest NFL game and the
airport so these are kind of great
examples of things that are happening
but what's interesting is that the there
are there's a big trend of for example
paypal groove 5x and mobile transactions
from 2009 to 2012 and so there's a the
mobile app space is around a 10 billion
dollar market and it's growing a hundred
percent in revenue year-on-year so
that's a really interesting business
value proposition from just basic
connectivity moving to an actual
commerce transaction but the other
interesting trend is that there's a
consumerization of IT going on
everyone's heard of the BYOD trend will
people want to be able to bring their
latest and greatest devices
they want to be able to you know use
apps that are friendly to use on their
mobile phone and a lot of enterprises
are now trying to figure out ways that
they can help people have a better
work-life balance one could argue
whether the expectation of being able to
do your mail or do some kind of log in
and do some kind of work-related app
from your home at ten o'clock at night
is work balance but at least you're not
in the office so a lot of people are
looking at you know 70 there was a
survey by symantec that showed 71
percent of enterprises are planning to
create a corporate mobile store for some
of their applications so it's a real
interesting view so it's mobilities
reshaping consumer behavior but it's
also reshaping the data center so I
talked a little bit earlier about the
kind of data that's being generated by
mobile phones and other and other
devices so it's expected so this year
it's it's expected that the data being
created is going to go from about 2.6
seta bytes last year to about 35 Santa
bytes in the year 2020 and so again for
reference zettabyte is way over there
it's kind of an astounding figure
actually so all of these devices that
we've been talking about you know they
are creating they're creating a
tremendous burden on infrastructure so
not only is divided you know when you
make your phone is going through the
mobile network back into a cloud service
somewhere and it's creating a tremendous
burden on our infrastructure so if you
just look at the next five years there's
about 2.6 zettabytes of traffic that was
happening last year and over the next
five years expected to grow to about 90
bytes worth of data and interestingly
enough a lot of the new workloads that
are being developed are actually moving
into the cloud for servers as an
sample so how can we live in this kind
of a data deluge how can we meet the
demands that infrastructure and server
are are putting on our data centers so
many of us I think I mentioned the fact
that most of us are consuming content on
our mobile devices and and most of it is
is over-the-top kind of applications
like Netflix or other things a lot of us
post videos of our kids soccer games on
on shutterfly for our families to
consume so those kinds of digital
warehousing services can zoom nearly
about 30 billion watts which is about 30
nuclear power plants and data center of
power in 2012 alone grew by around
sixty-three percent but it's not just
about the power it's also about the
floor space so if you're in New York the
the floor space is at a premium that
goes to a significant cost adder as
you're trying to meet this demand but
the sad thing of it is most of the IT
infrastructure is underutilized even
with technologies like virtualization
for example the best that people can
hope to achieve in terms of efficiencies
around forty percent at best and so the
other sixty percent of the time the CPU
and other infrastructure is being
underutilized the traditional approach
to solving some of these challenges has
been to scale up by the way I took these
definitions from wiki didn't think it up
all by myself but eventually you can
what you can see is that traditionally
you can look at the gray bars there and
the approach to solving some of these
challenges was simply to scale up add
more and more horsepower to a processor
you know try and make the machines
bigger and bigger and bigger but
actually especially with cloud workloads
and other emerging workloads scaling out
parsing out the problem to smaller and
smaller processors actually turns out to
be more efficient and the benefits that
you get from that is you can also
integrate more functions into a given
SOC and when I see SOC I mean so a
system-on-chip I'm sure most of you are
familiar with that but i just thought i
would throw that out there so why are
based infrastructure and why now so as i
talked about a lot of these cloud guys
for example own their own software
assets they own their own they they're
basically doing a print and copy print
and copy so there is they're basically
running the same workloads over many
many different servers or equipment sets
so they would like to optimize solutions
for their given workload and
significantly significantly decrease
their total cost of ownership or
increase the value that they're getting
from that so one size doesn't really fit
everyone anymore and so they're looking
at how can they r ER katek their data
center infrastructure to be more
efficient and this is an area where arm
and partners can bring significant value
and we'll talk a little bit more about
that I talked about the fact that you
know historically there's the last left
call it 15 years has really only been
one architecture choice of course
there's been other niche high-end
architectures but for the volumes market
there's only been one choice and people
are looking at how can they leverage the
innovation in the pace of innovation
that's happening on the mobile side and
the consumer side because unlike 15 20
years ago where the desktop was kind of
the ecosystem engine of innovation
what's happened in the last five years
in this third era of computing is that
mobile has become the innovation engine
of the industry and so one of the other
challenges is that these cloud
infrastructures are going up so quickly
that they really want to have a faster
innovation cadence than they could have
with traditional equipment the other
part of it is that arm you know it's not
just about low power it's really about
mixing the right core with the
surrounding oops surrounding IP hope you
woke up after that so what's changed
again I talked about businesses where
the data center is the business so if
you're a cloud hosting service or you're
a like for example of Facebook or a
Google or someone like that you're
really looking to eek out every single
dollar per watt per cubic foot of
performance and and you know you really
need flexible systems that have more
scalable options i talked about scale
out and being able to add compute
resources dynamically the other area is
open source software so if you looked at
legacy infrastructures they were very
tied to a specific architecture because
it was all proprietary software and
applications but what's happened is that
open source has become the great
equalizer and we see that that's reduced
the barrier of entry for new
architecture so for example in the arm
community there's a very vibrant Linux
community around arm there's also a
great deal of developer I said we have
millions of developer that's an
intellectual asset that a lot of people
want to leverage the other interesting
area is that as I mentioned a lot of
these large cloud people own their own
software assets so for them since they
control their own software assets a lot
of it is based on open source it's easy
for them to port to an architecture like
arm and and get the best in terms of
efficiency for their given application I
think we've talked about that enough so
let's look think a little bit about data
center infrastructure today so you have
your traditional server your traditional
networking equipment but what we see
happening is that tomorrow one size
doesn't really fit all and there's also
a trend from networking with things like
software
networking and in the operator world
things like network function
virtualization where operators are
trying to deploy services faster and
faster historically to deploy a new
service you needed a truck roll with an
entire new equipment set and now they're
looking at how can they deploy services
faster and faster and so they're looking
for more flexible system so you kind of
see the networking world and the server
world kind of colliding in this new
world of software-defined X and X could
be hey I have you know i'm running a
workload that is trying to serve mobile
applications so i want to have that
processor or that system architecture
optimized to run a specific workload so
you know there's a lot in terms of
flexibility and scalability and really
it's about choice oops sorry I can't get
the hang of this thing here we go so
there are a lot of armed partners that
are participating in kind of the
infrastructure space and so you can see
some of the partners that are mentioned
here things driving me not sorry a lot
of the partners that are mentioned here
so there are several silicon players
well-known folks like AMD broadcom
calzada cavium LSI Marvel to mention a
few there are others on here as well
there are several software companies
like Red Hat citrix there are 0 am
companies like HP and Dell and of course
there are people like Facebook who are
participating in the arm ecosystem
through our Linux development community
linaro so let's talk about the arm
building blocks there we go ok so if you
think about you know kind of the focus
in terms of the enterprise and
infrastructure of tomorrow it's really
around how do you get more choice better
TCO how do you have grass and security
capabilities and so arm provides the
technology building blocks
the first generation we expect arm
technology to be seen in web cloud and
storage applications and over a period
of time as our processor technologies
grow and get more adopted we expect to
see them in traditional enterprise
applications as well so we have several
processors that you might hear about so
for example this cortex a9 that's shown
on the left there is actually in a
plethora of devices including the
surface tablet that I'm running this
application from and then we have
interconnect technology so we have a
bunch of different technology pieces
including our 64-bit architecture that
we announced last year our cortex a57
processor and there are several partners
that have cited the fact that they're
going to use this processor in
applications ranging from you know
mobile devices to TVs to set top box to
a whole different variety of different
applications so let's talk a little bit
about just to give you a feel for how
our technology scales because we provide
IP silicon partners can target it at
different applications and put
surrounding SOC infrastructure around it
to deliver a tailored solution for a
given market so I just mentioned the
cortex a9 it's a great study in terms of
diversity you can see the number of
players from a silicon perspective that
have developed associes using the cortex
a9 targeting primarily consumer
applications like mobile I talked about
the surface digital tvs a lot of those
devices go into that from a
entertainment system perspective you
probably have a cortex a9 in your car
running your infotainment system as well
and it also goes into a lot of
industrial control kind of applications
as well and then in the enterprise side
which is primarily what I'm focused on
kal Zeta for example has announced a
cortex a9 based device for servers
huawei uses our cortex a9 in their base
stations and so on and so forth so you
can see that there's a wide range of
applications that we can address with
our technology so I'm v8 is the way that
we refer to our 64-bit architecture and
it's fully software compatible with our
32-bit architecture obviously being
relatively late to the market we can
kind of leverage lessons learned from
past and we have designed our
architectures such that it supports both
the 32-bit instructions and 64-bit
instructions so from a software
migration perspective it's a great story
it's also a very efficient 64-bit
architecture and it's been designed for
modern programming languages like Java
and it's really designed such that
compiler developers and developers have
a great experience on the architecture
but we've always you know just because a
64-bit it doesn't have to be an energy
hog and clearly we go into a lot of
consumer devices where a battery life is
a key aspect and interestingly enough as
I was talking about earlier energy
efficiency has become a key aspect of
the enterprise world as well and so
we're very mindful of that and our
64-bit architecture has been designed
specifically around that so in terms of
the 64-bit architecture we had our first
public demonstration of arm v8 at Red
Hat summit with our partner applied
micros silicon and we demonstrated
Fedora running on the ARM architecture
so just talk a little bit about how this
works so we have several partners who
are developing a variety of silicon
solutions leveraging their expertise and
experience to bring more of
a kind of a diversity in the space so
let's talk a little bit about what
integration can do so you think about
that's a board sighs it's it's a typical
one you kind of a server board but a
partner like applied micro has been able
to reduce that into a very small form
factor allowing you to have dense
systems deployed and so really things
like open compute for example or another
way where the industry doesn't
necessarily rely on proprietary
technology from an OEM or it's really
opening up the market for everyone so
there is a large server ecosystem that's
developing we have arm 32 bit system
shipping we have 64-bit systems sampling
there are several Silicon partners and
OEM partners and and and and others and
we have partnerships with people like
Oracle Red Hat and others to ensure that
things like Java for example run on the
ARM architecture very well so what are
we doing in terms of commercial Java on
arms we announced a multi relationship
with Oracle where they talked about you
know they already support arm 32 bit
with their JVM today and they've even
announced support for the enterprise
edition of Java on our 32 bit and they
announced that they would be porting
Java over to arm v8 which is our 64-bit
in terms of open source we also there's
linaro I don't know how many of you have
heard of linaro heard of it okay so
basically a few years ago arm set up a
not-for-profit company with our partners
and it's basically an organization
dedicated to doing Linux development and
maintaining the toolchain the GCC
toolchain and other tool chains and and
and up streaming the Linux kernel you
know validated Linux kernel but we also
do things like develop open source java
so there's already an
v8 port under way there's the status
available and you can download the
slides and see where that is so in terms
of in terms of the server market we see
initial initial traction being in kind
of the web cloud space eventually we've
already had a public deployment on
storage earlier this year baidu
announced that they are going to or that
they are deploying an arm-based server
for storage in their data center and
analytics and of course as the world's
definition of a server is changing there
will be more and more applications where
our energy efficiency our integration
capabilities will will be a value so it
here are some of the examples of some of
the servers that are being deployed in
the industry so in summary there's
really you know innovative thinking
needed to scale you know arm technology
scale from i OT all the way to to the
cloud and we really are approached the
market is around innovation and choice
and it's an ecosystem investment in
terms of how we how the ecosystem
collaborates to make it a valuable
proposition for all so i should have
included more slides but i guess i'm
done early so if you have any questions
feel free to ask them thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
