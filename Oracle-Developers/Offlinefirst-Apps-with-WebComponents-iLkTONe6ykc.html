first like how if you are actually a
Java developers Java developers all
right so the others I assume non Java
developers like JavaScript developers
JavaScript or business or marketing
business what kind of business like oh
wow
alright that's interesting and how many
of you like doing like front-end
development at least okay interesting
yeah like I decided to tailor my
presentation a little bit to target Java
audience but my presentation is
basically for any audience regardless of
the language and also a more or less
interested on the front end but I'm
gonna like talk about front-end design
thinking in general
I kicked off the front-end side so not
not so deep into the coding side but so
deep into the architect and design side
yeah so maybe I should start so yeah
welcome again my name is Marty I work
for Vaadin as a developer advocate and
today I'm going to talk about the client
first design as well as web component
design so random questions how many of
you hear about running for one okay so
that's interesting
button is a company that is focused on
the front-end development we are doing a
lot of open source stuff we are based in
filament so I came all the way from
Finland actually but my presentation
today as I said is gonna be focused on
the divine stuff so talking about design
we will see a lots of announcements
cloud new Android devices getting it now
every now and then and leave about
specifications and stuff like that for
those of you who are very interested in
this might also be watching the latest
news about like this new specification
new Android device it's gonna come with
a lot of features and a lot of
specifications we usually see similar
specifications more or less and
effectively when we buy new Android
device we see huge specs coming inside
the device if we compare an iPhone
device with an Android device then this
is a proper way on how to draw an iPhone
device technical point of view
but the interesting question is if I go
randomly industry and I give a person
100 1000 watts and tell this person you
can use this money to buy a medicine
where do you think the mobile phone of
his or her choice gonna be most likely
going to be iPhone right now I'm not
trying to like say that iPhone is better
or anything actually technical point of
view Android is way better and advanced
but users don't care about technical
point of view so this is a design
thinking number one which is technical
specifications doesn't give any value to
the user the user just want something
that is usable that has good marketing
baby
that has good exposure
that looks nice those kind of things is
what interests they use but some of the
users that it's a quad-core processor
with huge amount of ram and memory and
speed and security update and all these
kind of things doesn't really interest
the user now another example out of the
context which is possible so maybe most
of you when you hear the word Amazon
because of work related things you think
about Amazon as a datacenter with a lot
of servers and deployment and cloud that
these kind of things but afford the rest
of you or the vast majority of us people
Amazon is basically a drone that deliver
things in front of their house right but
for us in for example and in mainly part
of the rest of the way
I wasn't actually mean very nice place
in Brazil so this is a matter of
perspective right the important part
here is to choose what kind of audience
you are targeted when you are building
an application so don't do I guess this
is a comparison between that content
producers like people who create
software create videos create documents
create photos these are content
producers right when you create an app
you are creating something this is a
percentage versus the rest of the
Internet users who do you want to target
they want to target this little orange
part when you build an app they want to
mention that you are very high technical
specification in your app and then only
target this sorry or target the rest of
the don't like as well as I said you are
framework oriented we are targeting
developers so we are only targeting this
little orange portion but if you want to
target bigger reduce you need to think
what is what is your conference they
want to stay with your familiar tools or
do you want to focus on your target
audience
not so fast well now that we are working
we're surrounded with geeks or nerds we
have laptops we are talking about
specifications and technical stuff and
cloud and infrastructure this our
familiar zone but when we are talking
about what we want to expose to the user
that's completely different
now the third example that I have for
you now is total so what is the
difference between those two Twitter
instances
Evil's that so I cannot hear you
no actually I'm running on Android
that's a good question yeah language
yeah division actually both of them are
running on the same exact device that's
awesome are running on Android I'm on a
drug user by the way sir
then don't get me on this iPhone think
the biggest difference is that one of
them is a native application and the
second one is the so-called progress a
web app and to make it safer for now
let's just call it a web application I
didn't close in the image I didn't cut
part of the image both of them are
exactly how they look on my device
exactly without any single modification
one of them is native which is this one
and when I say me it means now let's
let's think from user point of view a
user who bought a new mobile device and
want to use Twitter
they were basically install 24 megabyte
they need to download to the 4 megabyte
of data the app gonna ask for few
permissions I need permission to access
your files and camera and stuff like
that we say it's a new device so I need
water fill which doesn't happen so him
to sign up until your first name last
name password confirm password address
all these kind of things there's no
remember me so if after a Twitter
application you start to install
LinkedIn or Facebook or so on then you
cannot have a remember me you're going
to have to do
the same thing again and again across
all other apps and whenever there is a
new update for the app you need to
download some megabyte of data again and
the cost of development from developer
point of view is a lot because I need to
create this natively for Android
natively for iOS and hopefully also a
version that works online on the web so
the cost is high versus if you develop
for web application first of all opening
this page is approximately 250 kilobytes
so less than quarter of a one megabyte
now when I say 24 megabytes the numbers
sounded like a very small number right
it sounded like nothing but think about
it if I give you a web page and I tell
you this web page will not live till 24
megabyte of data gets downloaded are you
gonna wait most probably no it's too
much think about it if you have the low
conductivity think about it you don't
have connectivity at all
think about it if you are maybe like in
a week network or something like that
you will not wait that much so that's in
itself a huge difference and of course
out of the box since it's a progress
back then it means that it will
automatically ask me for a password for
camera access and file access and so on
so permissions are delayed till later to
engage with the app and out of the box
autofill because it's a web application
remember me if it's my first time then I
can just click remember me to remember
my information across devices and
guaranteed to always get the latest
version whenever I open the application
every time I open Twitter you get the
latest version since you are using the
platform it means that the cost is
lowered to the mean because you only
develop once and it works everywhere now
this sound to me like I'm telling you
hey let's build this hybrid
cross-platform applications right let's
let's assume that that's for instance
take a comparison between native
application development versus cross
multi platform deadlock many developers
many many of them don't like this cross
multi platform tools they say like they
are not native they don't feel nice they
are sluggish they are all over right
refer to develop beautifully but the
question is do you think the user care
if you if you give an application to a
user with a big banner I developed this
with objective-c you think the user
would care if you put a big banner I
developed this with assembly cool do you
mean user we can know so the user
doesn't really care about what
programming language you're using if
it's native or non-native then you only
care about one single problem experience
so if it's not sluggish if it's sleek as
fast feels native all these kind of
things the user will bite there was an
interesting discussion this is modified
pre-installed and you know the answer so
we have seen an immersion in the
technology like maybe 11 or 12 years ago
we have seen that the cloud is taking
over
nobody is developing from desktop
solutions anymore or very little or
developing desktop solutions
everyone is developing it on a cloud and
isn't the time to see the relevancy with
the mobile applications as well why we
still develop mobile native applications
when we have the cloud why you cannot
just develop it on the cloud and have
the same experience with all the
benefits latest application no no
versioning and all these kind of
experiences so the third design note
that I have for you today is fancy
technology versus user experience now
back to prior several web I mentioned
that basically the solution here is
progress of about but what is actually
progress about I will have you heard
about practicing web before to to only
give you an explanation is an acronym
that was originally invented by Google
but now it's a known and all major
vendors in the market major players in
the market I have to say are accepting
it and are working on it it's a standard
way of developing web applications that
gonna act like native I'm gonna promise
every understanding from the word profit
of these privacy understand division I
can give you a small example here so
obviously I'm not from here I'm a
tourist here and let's assume that I am
here I want to buy pizza for example so
what do you think I'm gonna do do you
think I'm gonna search in the App Store
for pizza in Boston or I'm gonna search
on
for Boston search engine right so
obviously the range is higher on the web
people will automatically search on the
web and if you have a web application
then you're gonna reach higher users
than on native apps now let's assume
that you made search on Google and it
told me hey there is a pizzeria app
download install it and then you're
gonna be able to use the pizza are you
ready the minute this slightly right
why would I end up with an app I just
want to search for kids area see
directions and maybe if I like I'm gonna
order online so this is progress and we
understand that the user don't provide a
native app as a first solution progress
if you understand the user the user want
the relocation want your reviews want to
see what is on the medium provide the
meaning now after providing the menu is
it that a good option to tell him ok now
maybe at your curve cart no I'm not
gonna do that
so first give me the menu I'm going to
choose the pizza I'm gonna put my
delivery address I'm gonna estimate the
cost I'm gonna see everything and then
at the end okay I want this I'm gonna
put my credit card information so
progressively ending with customer now
after I deliver the pizza I can sell the
customer and not vacation tell him hey
if you like us maybe next time you can
have this app to order easily so native
app is not necessarily coming anyway but
it can be the last option and for myself
as a tourist and we just dismissed this
email I tell them thank you but I'm not
from Austin so I don't need this app or
even from
invested I also believe this ad because
why should I be super kids area so this
is basically the solution progress every
map is first of all make an application
available on the web and make it
progresses but now we are clashing with
an important issue that I just discussed
the design how can we solve the design
problem of sluggish not feeling native
and so on so we will along with
Microsoft and Facebook and Porter and
many many players in the market and even
Apple nowadays they are working hard in
to solving this problem making an
application that qualifies as particle
app to act natively remember the Twitter
screenshot that I showed you a Tony it's
not cut there was no address bar
there was nothing right it was just full
screen application that's exactly our
progress ago Bob so do you need to learn
a new programming language or do you
need to learn a new framework the answer
is no there are some specs or I like to
call them check list of items that you
need to implement inside your
application to be processed so if you
have an application the good news
you might be already satisfying some of
your checklist what I'm going to show
you now is how to add extra things out
of this list I picked the my first
design so of course like for example web
notifications this is something that you
can have with service worker you can
make it fast
those are like also design thinking on
how to
it enhances the speed of your
application and so on but what I think
today is usage of slide first design as
well as web components so what therefore
what is web components anyone about web
components no one o as well okay the
same guy okay thank you
so web components what component is also
an interesting concept that emerged in
in the web platform recently again
vendors in the market agreed on some
specifications topics we normally see
specifications that are not standardized
on how to create component with
qualifies as a web component so whatever
item is it basically if we look at the
market we've we will find a big
segmentation of many devices and many
frameworks and each framework implement
their own components like angular for
example and your component jquery jquery
component even Vallon we created body
components and all over now those
components are nice and everything but
they are not reusable
I cannot invert am used angular
component I cannot in angular use one
component I cannot use a react component
in hangar and so on so it's just a
fragmentation in the market that's why
they decided to make standardized
standardized way of creating web
component which are specifications under
which you can create a component and use
it across platforms now if you think
about it from a framework user point of
view that's expanding the number of
component that you can use inside your
framing instead of only fit
only UI components created specifically
for you framework you can use any other
components and the other way around so
if you create a component can be used by
other framework vendors and this is
basically exactly what we did at model
so just to go Buster behind first what
is the definition of what component this
is the introduction this is basically
how I like to look at this picture
notice here that video so video time was
introduced in html5 few years ago now
standard and natively available in all
web browsers and if you think that it's
just a normal market you know market
that you can just put in the browser it
will work that's not actually if you
open it in the browser you can see that
that creates this video tab so if you
tagging itself is created by other
standard HTML elements now the power of
custom elements or web component is
providing the developers the ability to
create their own custom elements that
can be reused by other developers and
natively supported by the browser up
till here it was only has to go over
standardization process and all browsers
agree on it and implemented and so on
but now we don't need that anymore now
you as a developer you can create web
component and give it to other
developers to use it and that's
basically what we do at vada so we
created a set of open-source web
components that can be used basically
any framework with the New York a
JavaScript developer or a Java developer
or any other language
thinking of what component is a way of
reusability and object-oriented thinking
in science education encapsulation
inheritance and so on
now to give you a used case comparison
between what if limit for example before
what components our UI people we used to
have like well what if it weren't is
basically a framework for developing on
the UI using Java hundred-percent Java
know JavaScript and so on but we used to
have our own body components so called
body component so when we create about a
component it only worked with what
report and if you want to use a
component then you have to use one of
them available events and it's a little
bit challenging to modify test it's not
like easier schedule but after we moved
to web components the first thing is
that we get out of the box is the
standard standard means that it works
everywhere and basically or directly is
not limited to our own atoms only but
also we can take any web component that
was developed by anyone in the community
and now we have separation answer so
separation of what actually that will
continue I component that you are
building and what is the building block
so that's on the web component side now
for the client first why of my first is
most topic that interesting about
project echo box because it's the only
way to guarantee other person
experice so when we are saying that we
are going to develop a mobile web
application that is going to add even
faster than native application one of
the very important essential things to
have is that it works fine now let's
think about Twitter again now Twitter is
based on online Twitter doesn't does not
make any sense when offline right
because it's tweets but think about
those two new schists the first use case
is I'm in the airplane flying and I open
Twitter and it tells me oops I can flew
it and the second risk is I open Twitter
and it tells me ok you are offline you
can not read recent weeks but you can
tweet and the tweet gonna be post when
you get internet connection later you
can read recent tweets and you can
retweet them and then they're going to
be effective of technical internet
connection later it's gonna be you can
read a recent messages and so on so give
me unlimited yet effective
functionalities because I'm offline but
at least I'm gonna be a happy user
because I still can name is Peter so can
we use that inside our application the
answer is yes summary of what kind of
solutions that we can have cash
Leticia yep you should sue them can we
just do that so there are web
applications are web pages with images
and HTML and so on we just flash it
inside the browser and that's it what's
the problem with that any thoughts sorry
it's the storage of the cache well I
agree with you this is the storage gonna
expand but it will never exceed this
story juice by a native app folder so if
we compare this with a native app it can
never exceed the actual surgeries by
netball any other foods yes the data now
a solution for static application
perfect application right but if we're
talking about a very very simple
application like a contacts application
where I have to see a list of my
contacts and then when I click on one
contact I want to know the form with
first name last name email address
Twitter handle picture those kind of
things and I want to modify and interact
relational data I cannot do that with
caching I need some kind of database
inside my browser and that's likely
called a flash storage
luckily browsers nowaday provide clients
with the so called index dB yes it takes
us we use it it's very nice basically
just get a copy of your database put it
inside the browser and then the browser
version instead of dealing with the
reminder
but again that's the problem of this
is if I modified the data locally how
can i push back in a modification back
to a server so that's the interpretation
luckily there are again many solutions
available in the market and one biggest
highlighted maybe you biggest use these
five gates so firebase used to be an
independent company and got acquired by
Google almost one year ago actually two
years now I don't remember exactly but
yeah five days in the past used to be
only focusing on offline storage and
making these detailed applications and
everything nevertheless now has many
many other options with Google but what
I won't cover like fire is that it
provides you with a tool a library that
you can use inside the web application
and then ask it to store your data
inside the browser and load the data
from the browser without having to worry
about a little synchronization from the
browser to the server but what did the
problem again the problem first of all
it's hosted by Google which might be a
problem for some of you let's assume
anyone from working in no one so if you
develop something for Oracle maybe maybe
it's gonna be a problem to use firebase
because you cannot store Oracle I used
to be an X Oracle so I know that so you
cannot store these things at firebase so
there are some companies that have some
policy where we must use their own
Oracle cloud instead of Google cloud so
that's a big thing if this is not the
biggest issue
it's a condition that it forces you to
use firebase database and again in many
enterprises and many applications you
don't want to use firebase you want to
use MS sequel Oracle cloud Oracle
database or all these kind of things so
even though I love firebase it's a very
excellent solution but I prefer also
it's not free but I prefer the free
alternative open source which is
powerful so apart to me well there are
many many solutions available just I
have to say but my personal research
found that powers to be is one of the
best all to be is free open source
Pacha 2.0 own community driven
completely community driven and the best
of it is that it uses couch TV on the
back and more about that so what's our
to me
poverty be is a tool that provided by
direction the interpretation from the
client side to the server side so what
does what what is that effectively
effectively if we imagine that this
mobile device is your front end
application instead of limiting between
it upfront an application and the server
correctly redirect all your
communications to the power D B so all
database manipulation database get that
it is push databases are seeing all
these tell things direct them to party
and already be automatically without she
writing a single line of code gonna make
bidirectional reader a bi-directional
data application from your local storage
to your server
more about that I know yeah more about
that
so yeah now now what will happen is my
most perfection normally if if this
climate application is connected with
the server in the Hamas connection then
in this climate occasions gonna be
buggin but if I lost connection
I went offline nothing happened because
I'm still dealing with the pouch DB
database which is which is stored
locally so no problem its powers biggest
problem to synchronize the data and
manage things
so yeah open source available solutions
and the interesting thing about part to
me is that it uses something called
couch to be on the server live what what
that means effectively is that you don't
necessarily have to stick with one
specific solution like the case was
fired five weeks you can have MS sequel
or you can have my sequel but you can
have a vertical database or you can have
pasta recipes wherever what didn't is
you love to do on the server side you
just implemented a couch TV layer this
application and then you just link it to
power TV and then power CD will whenever
you are online gonna manage the data
replication whenever you're offline any
modifications on the client-side can be
stored inside the pouch daily and
synchronized
I have a table for you so this is a
screenshot of how I look like and
without going into too much code just
gonna show you how is there
so
so if you want my github a magic you're
gonna find a flat clear stop actually
those apps are basically the same
here I'm using the standard one and here
I'm using it with pure polymer and here
I'm using it is angular and if you go to
my research base is gonna find another
one that was a react
yeah I'm still experimenting but this is
the main one the main application if you
want to follow this application to see
the development and basically this is
the current version of the application
look like those words so I try to
summarize steps on how to migrate an
existing application to instead of using
direct connection to the server to use
flash storage into those steps those
steps are basically text reads could so
so here for example if I open this
you're gonna see the difference is good
what I did for example here instead of
defining money they would database that
is connecting to this database for
example modifying the gauges of function
I'm not using the chisel not connecting
to that server in here but instead
unloading everything from my remote TV
body so this is the
which is very realistic you can go over
that wall but I'm gonna versus highlight
the important this so this is principal
loading data from local storage
basically define a local variable and
add PowerDVD triplicate instead of
relying on 30 wouldn t be variable I'm
relying on everybody
and this is the most interesting thing
I'm trying to explicitly apply what I
showed you in the picture I'm trying to
apply it here
inside the application early dialect all
your communications to rely in power to
be and only positive and then positive
you will do the magic of redirection so
they're just about to be synchronized
between remote database which is
supposed to be my remote database and
local it's actually in the latest
version the substitution you're gonna
find in one of the branches that I'll
also use Oracle cloud because our other
wants me to try Oracle cloud which work
great actually
so I also showed how to use it with
Oracle cloud you can check it out
basically storing the actual application
actually inside a cloud Oracle cloud and
that synchronize this with the local
business this is actually the final
version of applications so this is a
final version of the application
just like contacts when I click on one
of them loads here I can define days
then it gets dated I can search actually
just to show off the application but the
actual ad is all about modification so
now even though this application works
well this looks work locally but maybe I
could try to open the mind
so now this is all my table the latest
version for example I can open it from
here make modifications that update but
now what will happen to fight we might
turn off Wi-Fi
refresh the page well that's a that's a
demo effect
oh it still works yeah there is
something actually but I can have about
this later but what I'm not to show you
is that even though I don't have network
I can still modify and still the
modification gets stored inside and here
it is with the modification that was
modified previously application
yeah so basically I don't know there is
something some glitch is my people but
you can see that after i refresh still
those limitations are still persisted
because they are still on my local
storage now if I go back online and I
turn Wi-Fi and then refresh you can see
that the data was synchronized back to
my Oracle cloud details
right so
just for your information this is a
project if you want to check it out how
I did it
those are the steps it's gold you will
find it under like attack at school it's
like that first
this is a link one more time now to go
to the interesting part that challenges
if these kind of development so so far I
showed you that it's sleek and straight
forward but what are the actual
challenges initial load of data so I
kind of showed you that maybe it's easy
to just grab your data base and push it
inside the browser but I mean if you
have enterprise database like one
terabyte of data you might need your
user to wait a little bit until one
terabyte of data gets downloaded inside
his device provided that the person has
one terabyte of available storage so
initially actually design architecture
to be able to session your data and
provide a snapshot of what needed to be
available for this specific user
you cannot just download everything and
expect that yeah so this is very
important design thinking you need to
provide some kind of an extra layer on
top of your server side to be able to
identify a user and decide what kind of
data to be provided a second problem is
your T of stored data now that it is no
longer only stored on the server side
but also stored inside the browser and
if if you go to developer tools inside a
browser you can easily see this data and
it's you
ability to make sure that these details
these are encrypted or wiped out with
the user allows us now think again about
Twitter or Facebook if I am on Facebook
and I'm model I'm signed in and then I I
give my laptop open to someone and this
person opens my facebook it's my
authority that I give this person to use
my faces so first I can not protect near
this point but if I click log out then
it's Facebook's responsibility to wipe
all the data and prevent the new user
from reading whatever I did on Facebook
so exactly the same thing if the
application is opened and your site then
your session everything then it's okay
somebody else come at season away since
it's a community-driven application then
there are many plugins that shows how to
provide authentication or provide
encryption for three-d-- the second part
is related to cross domain access again
this data is saved in the browser if
Facebook for example save some data in
the browser and then Twitter can twitter
read this data now it's beyond your
responsibility it's a responsibility of
the browser itself so Chrome Mozilla
Firefox Safari those kind of browsers
are responsible about protecting this
data prevent cross domain access to that
finally the race condition which
you just talked about so we're talking
about wine I opened the contacts
application and I started to make some
modifications when I am a fly and he is
online and he is flying but when I went
back a fine I'm fine now
let me put this scenario in a different
format what is warm light the same
program will happen PC and then a few
seconds later I click Save so same
problem will happen so this is not just
a new problem introduced for my first
design it's a an existing problem
when you're using of the possibility to
happen inside that's why you cannot just
dismiss it you need to take into
consideration very well cool design -
preference one way is power to be saw
has something called best guess merge
the tries to merge for example he
modified first name and I modifies last
name so maybe it's ok to work or if you
don't like this kind of guessing then
just provide a fallback explain to the
user asking the user there there is a
conflict they cannot merge this data
because it was modified when we were
flying what to do and this is most
likely the default option for many cases
you can see this might be many live
collaboration but units and live
collaboration application fancy
now since I said it's a little bit
tailored for Java
I would love to also show you some use
case on how to use what components from
one of the challenges again yes how was
it before we actually adopted web
components it was a little bit
challenging because our default default
component system is GWT based which
means that we need to make some hacks
and some implementation luckily there is
a nice article on de zone but how to do
that you can go over it and read it if
you like but if you want the conclusion
on bottom that come slash blog saying
that it's frustrated it just doesn't
work luckily after the new framework
that we have introduced which talked
about a tenant
it's as simple as just adding attack so
we ditched geometry we decided to focus
only on web components our main focus
now is on web components and they're
only supporting web components that's
why usage of web component is just
perfect and any web component design how
there can work in the kinda framework
this is hopefully some things that we
hope to see in all other framework
vendors as well such as angular and
react often react that's a big final
while I have for you today the fun one
which is practical tests so I've been
talking about design all the time but I
have this validation slide to tell you
if you're already doing good design the
first one is make sure that you are
following mobile first design which
means that when you have developed
don't test on your laptop please test on
your mobile device we know that we love
to test here on the screen we know that
we have this in later and browser format
and stuff like that they are all fools
they will not give you the actual
experience as much as you test here just
to get the device and test on it right
and if it works here I can guarantee you
that you're gonna work on desktop so you
don't need excitement but if it works
second thing is touch first design your
user has a big thumb up he cannot reach
this small little icon on the top right
corner of your screen
and we cannot distinguish between two
legs written under each other
and they cannot click on a drop-down
mini so please think about a big number
that is going over the application give
space give touch and finally what a lot
of code I came up with this concept
called coffee first design which is
basically give your tester the cup of
coffee one hand the application running
on the other hand and see if the user
will be able to use the application
fully without spitting the coffee on the
other on the device so the user should
be able to use everything with one only
heart if you don't really like this
coffee concept maybe you can give him a
car and see if you know don't do it yeah
so again I show it to you if you want to
read a little bit more progressive web
apps with Java and how to do them
together this is a nice article that I
wrote and with github again across
here we go yeah so this is an article
along with github application that shows
you how to progress it will have
checklists inside a java application
yeah that's pretty much have you any
questions
so 30 get this question he's saying that
you're using Oracle database on the back
end and on the phone and you're using
angular in node right yes so the
question is how often if it's in this
again it's a computer-driven luckily
there is a community plugin for our code
that is such a huge people came at us
business so there's a plugin that allows
you to connect with couch TV so Council
is a server lady you need a plugin for
the couch TV can use it for the fronton
stack I don't think you need to change
anything except that your rest fools
instead of going back to the web service
to go to after I think I'm running out
of time but in more questions no more
questions right so that's pretty much
everything thank you so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
