me first ask you who has heard already i
talked about micro services or
containers on java one so probably
everybody right it's around the 100 so
so so welcome to my session cloud native
microsoft's and containers in a
middleware world the good news is I I
will do it a little bit different than
the others and I will try to not repeat
a lot you probably already heard and
really focus a little bit on the
perspective from the middleware so who's
using middleware from you or at least
who knows what it is so most of them
okay i will also start at the beginning
a little bit but that's really the story
from from us and our customers really
how we move from the let's say legacy
world with the mono lids and with the
old stuff to this new modern concept and
that's what i want to also first tell
the story and don't also spend 20
minutes or so on live demo to show you
how we leverage things like cuban it is
and talk her cloud foundry console
spring cloud foundry a cloud conflict
all that stuff together with middleware
that's basically the goal of today and
so i think it will be a little bit
different than the other hundred talks
you heard about Microsoft's already to
travel one so my name is Kai vaina I
work for TEPCO as technology evangelist
and yeah I just want to begin with the
story in the end and 44 tibco and also
the other Middle where vendors like
software G or IBM and Oracle and their
products everybody talks there about
really mission-critical stuff in the
beginning and it's the complex
heavyweight enterprise service bus which
many people think about where we
integrate all the different systems and
that's basically what you see here in
the middle and which is the core systems
which is operated by the IT and you
cannot do changes easily because it's
very mission critical and also a lot of
work to change something and now we are
coming to another world where everything
has to be h island you have to adopt
changes quickly you have to be
innovative and that's what many call
edge so where you change the business
it's not just a car where the core
business runs but it's the edge right
you think about things like instead of
things and about mobile devices so a lot
of stuff you have to
also integrate and that's the important
thing so all these things have to
communicate with each other and also
together with the car in the in the
middle and for that what we see now is
really a completely different situation
than 10 years ago so in the meantime
everybody has to be h island and speed
with development and also of course
things like web scale and lower the
costs and all these kind of requirements
we all know today and also the
methodology changes so we all want to
fail fast in the meantime that's what
you hear and all the other talks about
micro services and DevOps and containers
and so on and with that I want to tell
you now the story from the middle world
perspective I will begin a little bit
with very shortly what is middleware
that we have all the same understanding
so what was it five years ago or ten
years ago and then we will move over to
micro services and to a cloud native
architecture and cloud native concepts
and then really see how that translate
to middleware so how do we today see a
middleware in a cloud native
microservices perspective so that will
maybe be 20 minutes or so theory and
then I will also spend 20 minutes really
on the life where demo where we'll show
you how we leverage these middle of our
technologies with dr. ku benitez cloud
foundry and all these kind of cloud
technologies right so I think that's
really goal of this session so did you
get a feeling about that because what's
also funny I talked to several people at
this conference already and when I tell
them well I've a 40-point this legacy is
beating right and so I always have to
tell the same story which i will tell
you today here towards everybody
understands that not all Middle where is
this 10 year old thing with et al and
pitch processing and the heavyweight
thing in the middle right so it's really
different as you will see today but
first let's begin from the history
perspective and explain what everybody
is the same understanding what is
middleware and here i took a definition
from wikipedia and that really says that
middleware in the end is a software clue
so it makes it easier for software
developers to concentrate on the
business logic and do not think so much
about the integration of the different
system
and that's basically the definition of
middleware to connect all the different
systems if we take a look at that from
the architecture perspective on the left
side in green you see application
integration that's the term I use here
so I do not use the bed where the ESB
which many people do not like for many
so our project failed several years ago
and so in the meantime you call it
application integration it's more a
general term for that and but here you
see and that's really one big term
nevertheless it's the application
integration part and you see it connects
to all the other systems like a CRM year
p system host mainframe in the meantime
also cloud services and much more and
the application integration the Middle
where is there to integrate all of that
with each other so that the CRM system
can also communicate with the host and
with many other systems so the
application integration does the
transformation the routing the mappings
and whatever you want to do inside this
integration platform on the right side
you also see other things like process
integration for example a business
process platform or streaming analytics
more and more dancing for sensor
analytics and these kind of things in
the end firmly the term of definition
this can also be part of middleware and
a lot of what I tell you today is also
true for that but for this talk I will
focus on the application integration
part as middleware right and what you
also see here it's important for the
beginning of the talk on the bottom you
see what I've written here its cloud
ready and that actually means you can
deploy it or usually deploy it on
premise but you can also deploy to a
cloud of course right but nevertheless
it's still the same application as
before and I will talk a lot about it
I'm during the talk but but it's
basically the term here and that's the
difference to cloud native which I will
take later a lot about and so they also
have put in a few lessons learn from our
projects in the last year's with the
customers and the first one here is
nevertheless on-premise will not die
right so not everything will go for it
to the cloud there's many reasons for
that we have a lot of huge
like telcos banks Airlines they have so
many infrastructure with mission
critical systems and there's no reason
to put that in the cloud and into my
trousseau so it's really the stuff is
running and it's working and it would
cost a lot of money to make ready to the
crowd and it has no need for that and
they at least a big companies and not
the startups which begin today they will
keep a lot of their systems on premise
and that's fine in my opinion so it's
okay to have that in their own data
centers and the second thing I'm also
about middleware you have a development
environment and they are in the meantime
in in a good middle where you have the
option so you can do things like zero
coding that's of course a marketing term
and you always have to do some kind of
coding or configuration so you have to
be a an integration specialist but you
can leverage visual coding so that you
can be more productive in the projects
so you can do things like visual mapping
and routing and configuration and you
have connectivity to all the different
adapters for ASAP systems and mainframes
and you simply don't have to write a
code for everything but you can do on
the other side so you can also call
everything or you can do anything in
between of these two that basically what
today's middle web development
environment allows you and that's in the
endless cycle lesson learned before I
move to the more modern stuff but that's
also a message I have to explain many
people especially at conferences with a
lot about coding like a Chava one and
these kind of conferences where people
say well ten years ago we had this whole
project and it failed that time and the
transformation I graphical mapping it
simply it did not work right and so for
that really the lesson learned is and
that's really true and change in the
meantime the visual coding works and
that's true for many of these kind of
vendors it's not just for the commercial
ones like tipco or IBM or oracle but
also for the open-source windows like
telenor muller soft so they also a very
powerful visual coding and for several
use cases where we have to do more
complex integrations that really helps a
lot in many years
alright and so that was basically um did
Blake whether they look backwards to a
middleware overview what do we talk
about in the last ten years about this
kind of thing and now we come to micro
services and I will not have a real
definition here because as we said we
already heard 100 or so at javaone
already and nevertheless one example
here and that's a great picture I like
from IBM where they simply show that
there is a lot of different independent
services which have a specific domain
for a specific function and you can
develop and deploy and operate each of
these micro services by themselves and
then you can also scale them by
themselves and you can you change us for
each one or maybe replacements for each
microservice by itself and that's the
key benefits of that and therefore also
when you see here that the green one
here it's the day I have to weigh myself
the update customer that's one which is
used more than others and so you have to
scale it out in another way than another
micro service which is used only a
little bit like the important green here
all right so that's basically
microservices and really benefits we see
at our customers with that is that you
have a higher flexibility and you can
scale it out easy and also scale it back
then if you do not need the pics anymore
and also you can replace small pieces
instead of the complete application and
that's the huge benefits of micro
services I'm really just talking about
Microsoft's all right now not about all
the other cloud concerts and therefore
if you take a look again at our
architecture so that's in the end the
next step from the big heavy weight fat
middleware in the middle the application
integration now we have three different
here at example so here we still do is
use the same tooling as before but now
we build microservices with that and
that's absolutely fine and that's
already a benefit right so we see many
customers which do not right now upgrade
all the things to a cloud into doctor
and so on
but they can still build microservices
with that and they are successful with
that so that's also some some internal
methodology change we had customers in
the beginning five to ten years ago they
built Bristol files with 200 operations
so that it's all central in one thing
and of course that's crazy and cannot
work for 10 years and therefore even if
you apply chasten microservice concept
to this kind of out aided dated middle
burden it's already some trust benefits
out of that because you can change
things easily then in just one operation
and you do not have to ration all
hundred operations but can take a look
at each one by itself so that's the
benefit of micro services and also what
we see now there's various forms of
micro services so from the middle by
perspective we come from come from the
service-oriented architecture and there
of course we build a lot of independent
services already and now we do deploy
them independently also if we want to
use micro services and we build some
kind of integration services if we have
to integrate more of them but also we
need another kind of services to
integrate monolid applications and
therefore also the monoliths allow you
to connect like service like so even a
IBM mainframe in the meantime supports
technologies like soap or rest so that
you can at least extract some features
of it as a service right even if it's
still a monolid you do a service call to
some part of it which nem simulates a
service I would say there's more and
more cloud services so I have not in a
single enterprise in the meantime which
does not use some kind of cloud service
like Salesforce or market host these
kind of things where you have no control
about the service so if they change the
Russian then you get six month and then
you have to upgrade again and you have
to update all this kind of stuff and
there are in contrary to your internal
services you have no option you have to
integrate that or migrate away from it
and there are other services like what I
certainly beginning about business
process management with human
action or streaming analytics or IOT
integration so you have a lot of
different kind of services and all of
them somehow have to communicate with
each other and of course there's still
with microservices is this kind of
concept with the smart pipes right and
so you can do that with only read
services and everybody communicates with
everyone but if you have a lot of them
it can get a mess and therefore
sometimes you still build integration
services and that's especially the
customers we have like banks and telcos
and airlines with a lot of different
systems and acquisitions with many
different technologies and there it
simply helps if you build explicit
integration services and also an API
management I will come back to that in a
minute is another part here because when
you have so many different microservices
you want to manage that somehow how can
others access these kind of services
that's also a key part in most
architectures in the meantime when you
have a lot of services with these micro
services there's a lot of new challenges
of course and the debts again will you
heard in many other talks at javaone so
I will not focus on data load and those
again and best practices to solve these
issues and so on but you have a lot of
different technologies you have a lot of
complexity through to be distributed
systems you have new concepts like
service discovery and resiliency
requirements client side load balancing
i think i've never heard of for a year
or so last year I heard you the first
time what it is for netflix does with
ribbon for example right because I the
past you did not have these kind of
things and then what would we also in
several other talks I went to each other
one is these kind of things you have to
challenge of so many micro services and
they have still to communicate with each
other and then what do you do when there
is a problem a failure you have to do
things like a redelivery or reroute if
the service does not work at all and you
have to call another one or you have to
use caching in the background to give
any response at all today to the service
consumer
and these kind of things or I've heard a
lot of best practices in other talks in
the end that's also a lot of enterprise
integration patterns so I really was
setting in a talk yesterday and thought
what's this kind of best practices the
other one is telling about Microsoft's I
know all of that because we are doing
some of these parts for twin heroes in
enterprise integration so it's not all
of the best practice of course but it's
part of it is simply integration
patterns right and therefore will be
aware that the challenges and costs are
as real as the benefits of micro
services I mean I think everybody here
knows this already and also there's a
lot of new patterns you have to learn
and a lot of new things like the sacred
breaker pattern which we again heard a
lot in other talks already in detail in
short it's really therefore prevent
cascading failure so that means if you
have different micro services and every
service calls another one and after 10
times when the service provider does not
work why do another hundred service
requests here so it doesn't make sense
and therefore you have some new kinds of
patterns which help you in this
distributed complex it here and there
for lesson learnt number three is Mike
reserves are not for free lunch so they
do not fit into every scenario so we see
a lot of projects that customer right
simply does not fit or does not make
sense at least with all of its concepts
as I said in the beginning it's fine to
implement application integration and
different services instead of the big
one but therefore you do not have to
apply all the other concepts like
service discovery and client-side load
balancing and so on and then the next
step however is of course with
microservices our idea of thinking is
changing so we are going away from the
legacy API I want to say here like
things like 80 fact or p2p communication
ftp i'm in the past and it's also true
for the middleware past we integrate a
lot of proprietary things and we had
predefined interfaces
and limited trusted partners and this is
absolutely going away up to open my eyes
so that we open it to everybody that he
can use it so it's a much more standard
base with wrist or any other kind of
messaging standards and everybody can in
the end use your AP is and that's really
also key we see for success for many
customers to any weight more and more
right so that you make your appt eaps
public of one part is internal to other
departments or to other partners then
but also to the public so that everybody
can use it so if you think about paypal
it's the best example for an open API in
the meantime for on every web shop you
can pay with paypal and they always earn
three percent for a transaction fees
alright and so that's just one example
or when you when you go to late to the
hilton website you can also order your
uber taxi instead of using a regular one
and with these kind of mashups all the
api's of different systems will be
integrated in the future and we see that
more and more it all our customers that
all the big ones the banks that telcos
the airline's all of them are investing
more and more money into api projects to
expose their api to the outside world
and this again of course a standard
middleware in the end it with
integration and with api management but
here again with the new patterns
emerging so one is the begins forefront
and patterns um where today we're now
you define your AP is and you have to
think about how do i expose them then
you have to expose them differently
depending on the use case on the
technology and so on and for example
here's is different examples that's a
great article i've referenced here where
it explains and how for example you
expose your api to your different
devices like to an android or to an
iphone or to an tablet or to the web
browser which still people use and
there's many different options which you
have to decide and which one you want to
use and it's again a lot of new
architectural concepts which cost you a
lot of time in your project to think
about to make it
a good way therefore the lesson on
number four for us in our customer
project is design microservice of open
API is in mind it's also a key
independent of middleware but for
middleware it's even more important as
saying that you make it really flexible
and easy to use for others so there was
no the story about micro services and
now let's move to the next step to cloud
native because and that's really warning
in the beginning and I really loved it
term for it which today and i loosed
used first like garden Forrester the
terror me is cloud washing so who knows
what cloud washing is so nobody heard it
before but probably you know what's
behind it so um what happened in the
past and I will be very honest I'm even
tip coded soundcloud washing a few years
ago because a few years ago and there
was a new trend of cloud but nobody of
the vendors like Oracle IBM typical or
the open-source one's head real cloud
native platforms to offer so what did
the windows through they put their own
premise product and put it on amazon web
services and sold it as cloud version
all right and that's in the end what's
described is cloud washed so you reprint
an old product and sell it as a service
but the difference is okay it's running
on amazon but it's still the same
application as on-premise and therefore
it's not cloud native it's not
supporting what it features you expect
when you really want to be in there in a
real cloud let's say so what do I mean
with that was real cloud or cloud native
is the term you find a lot of Google
when you search for articles for that
cloud native is really next step so it's
not just building independent
microservices which I explained before
right but you leverage a lot of features
in combination with that things like a
service discovery or client side load
balancing resiliency patterns like the
circuit breaker as implementation
there's a lot of things which you can
use or which we have to use if you want
to be really flexible if you want to
scale out easily and if you wanna mb am
resilient with your services so that if
one crashes that you can
to create another one and also then
route the service consumers the requests
of this one instead of to the crashed
one and all these kind of things it
first it sounds simple in theory but
it's a lot of new concepts which you
have to implement here and there for the
next lesson learned cloud native means
much more than a cloud washed
application deployed to a cloud provider
so using just your existing on-premise
application or mono late or whatever it
is and put it into Amazon or Microsoft
Azure that's not enough to get this
flexibility which you expect from the
cloud and therefore we go on with things
this is again one which you heard a lot
of travel one about already so I will I
will keep it short but the next step
then is to use containers there's really
the momentum so I also have Tucker here
very big by intention because it's the
one everybody is talking about today is
using it but there are other ones like
rocket bike or os or cloud foundry for
example is using its own ticket a no
technology under the hood it's called
garden so and they also partly support
doctor for some part but in the end a
runtime really that's that's garden
under the hood alright so but when we
talk about containers why do we use them
the key really is um that you can really
start it up easily you can scale it out
easily and because it's a much more
lightweight platform in contrary to a
virtual machine which almost every
Enterprise used before and now everybody
wants to use docker or containers in the
end you are also platform agnostic so
that you can try it out on your laptop
and deploy deploy exactly the same thing
with all dependencies then you to your
test environment to your production
environment and these kind of things
what's also important maybe is this the
last part here about standardization
which we will probably get some someone
and there's already a initiative for
that the open container initiative which
was started by this doctor and some
other companies but what's also
interesting what we could read in a blog
post in the last few weeks is a
discussion about for King talker or so
using the main open source project by
the docker company and for Qatar
different one and that's happening this
date is discussion because if you know
more about dr. so in the last release or
so they included swarm into docker into
the main talker project and of course a
lot of other companies which are selling
orchestration tools or creating
open-source frameworks they are not
happy that this is also part of the
docker product or framework which
everybody downloads because they want to
use and publish their own coca duration
frameworks and so I think everybody is
talking about dr. today I'm but
nevertheless we will see in 25 years if
it really will get that standard or if
it maybe we'll get a container standard
and there will be two curves that will
be rocket bike or OS and cloud one we
will you stay with garden and there may
be some new containers we will see so
the next lesson learned here is a true
services and containers are often used
together what absolutely makes sense but
they also work very well without each
other so I explain you in the beginning
about building microservices with an old
legacy application integration tools
that absolutely makes sense and you do
not need token for that and on the other
side it absolutely makes sense sometimes
to simply dhoka write something and that
can also be model it for example so
that's really key to understand because
I hear a lot of talks and articles where
these are always combined and everybody
should be aware that there's no need to
always combine them both concepts work
without each other also very well
sometimes nevertheless often make sense
to use them together and as we hear in
this talk want to move towards a cloud
native architecture we want to use
container of course because of all of
its benefits but nevertheless it's still
just a foundation for a cloud native
blood fam containers are great but
they're just the beginning so if we
begin just with docker and want to build
something cloud native there's a lot of
work you have to do around it right and
you can either do it by yourself or with
tools like serve arm which are part of
docker and talk a compose and all these
kind of frameworks or you simply use a
cloud native platform which already
implements
offers all of that stuff for you so when
you need a cloud native platform in the
end it's two parts it's the
infrastructure as a service part which
you see here on the left which is
something like Amazon Web Services or
Microsoft Azure which simply provides
you the infrastructure where your run
your systems are applications or
services own it can also be on premise
with aku steak or something like this
that doesn't matter but it's simply the
concepts behind this infrastructure as a
service end on top of that then here you
put your platform as a service where we
also had a lot of talks about Oprah
shift and about cloud foundry i'm here
at javaone and these in the end
implement all these requirements you
need for a cloud native architecture
like load balancing like service
registry and then a list of I don't know
how much it is right now what all of
these platforms implement for you and
therefore it makes you much easier to
implement cloud native microservices on
top of these platforms because they
build all of that for you they are also
available open source and you can use
them but you have a window behind if you
want to use a vendor for that so if we
see our customers when they really want
to build cloud native microservices
almost all of them you're some kind of
platform often with a window for support
and additional features but even if open
source but at least at the windows I
visited and talk to nobody of them
really just built their own cloud
platform with doctor or something like
this that's really use it just um it's
also used alone for example for
development on the only local laptop but
for the production deployment all of
them leverage some kind of platform
where they deploy it let's take a look
at two examples I already talked about
it the one is Cuban atis which is
getting a lot traction these days the
window behind it or let's say sauce that
is Google you can also run it easily
Google cloud platform Oprah shift is
also based on that that's the platform
as a service by redhead and you can also
run it somewhere else easily so for
example a lifetime i will show you later
we are running
amazon web services it doesn't matter in
the end koo Benitez is in the end the
orchestration platform for the
containers and one kind of platform as a
service offering and the other one is
cloud foundry that also open source and
here it's a little different
characteristics and so these two in the
end cubanita sand and cloud phone we
have different pros and cons and but
these are in the end the two ones we see
most on the market i would say and also
if you take a look at each other one
talks most of of the sessions were based
on one of these and then of course
depending on the vendor so I'm with
Cloud Foundry you have several windows
behind them I think it's ad or so but
but there are a few different platforms
also available and I think the key is
three platforms on a market are pivotal
IBM bluemix and SI p and that's in the
end is 31 at least I see most that
customers and also when you google for
it and look for articles that's in the
end the platforms which you can use if
you want to use a vendor platform for
that and so the next lesson learned and
by the way I have 10 in the end and then
I come to a live demo number seven is
that containers in the end are just a
lower level technology so the business
developer or the integration developer
for a middleware he does not have to
care about the container technology
under the hood he implements his
integration services or micro services
and deploys them to the platform and
what's running under the hood doesn't
matter that much therefore for example
both cubanita santoku shift or support
different container technologies already
so with coupon it is you can run pots in
docker but you can also run other ports
which use rocket for example all right
so I'm in the end it's it's just that
contain a technology under the hood an
infrastructure part and then we are
moving forward so there's a lot of other
concepts and technologies which are
coming out these days one is apache
mesos so called cloud operating system
so that's a little bit i would say even
more powerful and bigger thing as you
can see on the screen shot here you
really run missiles which in the end
release and operating
so you do not install it on linux or
windows also so it's it's own operating
system and kernel and you can run it
distribute it on many different cloud
providers and also on bare metal in your
data center and you can also combine all
of that and on top you can then again
run different clusters like a crew
benitez cluster but also a pet geo tube
or Apache spark or any other kind of
applications so that once again coming
from the tech giants and maybe in five
years or so more of the other
enterprises might leverage it I think
today many of them do not need it
already because we are all very early
states usually I'm right if you are not
a tech giant and there is other concepts
oops um another concept is container is
a service that's I think a great service
for almost every company where you can
simply deploy a container in the cloud
I'm ads on Asia or google and its really
treated as a container resource so you
do not care so much about able to a
machine under the hood but simply deploy
your container to the cloud I also use
that in the lifetime i will show you in
a minute and one step forward again and
that's what i would say is really cloud
native but again that for most
enterprises and bigger projects it might
take two or three more years until it
comes a standard surveillance computing
where you do not even care about
container because even that is done for
you by the infrastructure provider like
Amazon Google Microsoft so that you just
implement your application in Java or in
going or whatever language or maybe you
use a middleware tool for that if it's
lightweight enough and then you really
it just starts by every function request
and in create processes these instance
and then it shuts down and the key
benefit of that is that you have a one
hundred percent utilization right and
that's the only way you can really reach
that and that's pretty cool and I think
we will see more and more of that and
besides the cloud providers what's also
pretty cool is to open source projects
one is IBM bluemix open whisk even
though it's by IBM it's really complete
source and the other one is supported by
redhead it's called function I think
that's not s major or so it's open twist
so a little bit of smaller project but
for both of them the cool thing here
again you if you want you can even run
containers on that all right so you can
if you talk a container with any kind of
micro service and run it here in a
serverless mode so and why did I talk
also about this kind of services which
are available serverless and container
service what we see more and more is
that enterprises should be cloud
platform agnostic at least all the
customers I talked to and that's it
again mostly the bigger ones almost all
of them do not really have to have one
strategy that they will put all on Cloud
Foundry or all and Cooper natives most
of them are in early stage and they did
not decide yet on what they want to
focus or maybe they cannot focus on one
and we'll use this here and this they
are and then for really its key to be
cloud platform agnostic and that's of
course even more true for the middle of
our vendors like like like tipco or IBM
so they should also focus on not just
supporting one kind of platform but
though that you can deploy your services
everywhere so the demo I show you in a
minute I really built one micro serve is
once it's one military service and you
can deploy the same artifact everywhere
you can it run with docker you can
deploy to cloud foundry you can deploy
to Cuba natives and I will show you in a
minute how that works besides that um
the last point here is of course we
heard all of that a lot at javaone I'm
about DevOps maybe the key point here
really is that it's not just about the
technologies you see on the right side
for automation but it's also about a
cultural process you have to change a
lot in your enterprise and especially
the bigger enterprises that's the huge
efforts here and challenge so the
technology is not the challenge but
changing the processes and the culture
in the bigger companies that's I would
not say impossible but it's really tough
i would say
and therefore nevertheless this is a
lesson not nine without automation and
the cultural change behind DevOps well
Ken microservice is not cloud native I
take architecture be successful in the
future I don't know because if you have
so many services and things like service
discovery and all these kind of things
and load balancing you have failing
containers all the time and restarting
containers with different IP addresses
so if you do not automate all these
processes then it might be very tough to
be successful here so this was now a
long story around all of that now let's
take a look five minutes at cloud native
middle where microservices first here um
I want to introduce another term again
the session focuses on middleware so
this is a term you see here more and
more it's called hybrid integration
platform and you can read a lot of
analyst report by Dark Knight Forrester
and all these kind of companies a lot
and all of them are pretty sure that
hybrid integration platform is the new
default in most enterprises so what does
that mean that simply means that you
have different kind of middleware and
integration solutions for different kind
of use cases and scenarios so you still
have as you see here on the left side
the on-premise application integration
the ESP which already runs there for
mission-critical systems you will not
remove that because that really works
and for the core business and that's
absolutely fine but on the right side
you'll see a lot of other options and
which you need on which you might need I
would say one is the one I talked a lot
about here and I will show in the demo
that's application integration on a
platform as a service which you can also
run on-premise or in the cloud but here
you have to manage the infrastructure by
yourself usually if you run it on
premise or you can go to a cloud
provider of course which runs it for you
that's one option then there's also the
ipass and here I really use also the
garden and forest at terms because here
you find a lot about Google when you use
these terms with I pass that's silly and
very similar to and total a platform as
a service integration solution but this
one is completely hosted by the vendor
so if you go to a company like typical
IBM or redhead then they of an ipass for
you and you do not have to think about
operation you just deploy your middle
were there and run it and all the
operation is done by the vendor for you
that's the main difference between I
pass and the platform as a service and
therefore this one is also only cloud
native and only the public cloud because
the vendor hosted for you and then with
others we have Isis and which is for a
business user it's some very light wide
web you eyes for integration and for
very simple things for example
automation of importing Excel
information into Salesforce or something
like this and then of course at the edge
you have internet of things you have
here gateways which is another kind of
light white integration frameworks so a
lot of different things and that's in
the end the term hybrid integration
platform or architecture so finally the
last lesson learned here and that's
really what we see when I go to our
customers and that's the medium ones and
also the bigger ones they really are
asking for all these different kind of
components because line of business for
example which is also doing integration
in the meantime because also they have
to integrate different services like
Salesforce directly without going to
this slow IT in the core send bit data
center where it takes half a year until
you get infrastructure or so and
therefore they even want to do it by
themselves and they of course prefer
something like our a solution which is
hosted by the vendor and so we really
see the demand for that and so most
enterprises we see are moving to this
kind of hybrid solution with not just
one central ESP in the middle but with
many different options which you can use
where it makes sense so I now talked a
lot about a concept let's take an
example of few different vendors and
here with different really I mean
completely different offerings what I
want to show you three or five or so
before I come to a live demo the first
one and we've seen a lot of redhead here
at this conference is jboss middleware
services which is an open source
solution based on openshift so again on
cuban 80s and docker where they offer in
the end their integration middleware on
top of that
form that's really the focus is on
coding for them such a boss is not one
of these visual coding vendors where you
can do that so you should choose which a
buzz if you really want to focus on code
that's in the end the way it is it's
pros and cons everybody has to decide by
itself and they leverage apache camel
which i think is a pretty cool
integration framework which you can use
do not want to go into detail here but
in the end it's very easy if you want a
cop ID code it's very easy to integrate
many different technologies and services
with that framework another vendor is
wso2 that also open sores and they are
also offering a lot of products like ESP
and complex event processing again for
integration specialists it's not so much
coding but it's more configuration but
it's still a lot of where you have to do
the work by yourself instead of things
like visually coding the next one Dell
Boomi that's a completely different one
that's only available as I pass so only
available hosted by the vendor and
that's also only available for web ID so
you it's not really built for
integration specialist for two very
complex and I would say the most mission
critical things but this is therefore
also more easy to use and for some use
cases this might be the interesting tool
then tip code that's the company I work
for and we have different solutions so
we have that a very powerful ESB for the
core we have to contain an addition
that's the one I will show you in a
minute where we can deploy to talk her
to Coober natives to cloud foundry these
kind of things and we also have I pass
offerings so I'm in the end we have a
broad spectrum probably because we're
really we are a middleware when do we do
nothing else but i'm offering middleware
to our customers and then there's also
the ice ass so that's for the business
user that's very simple and often only
for personal integration with a very
easy web-based integration tooling and
that's really in the end usually for the
business user and where you can do very
simply clicks to do some kind of
integration only for simple use cases
but it helps the individual user often
to automate things instead of doing
things
really every week or every day so
examples your snap logic if this then
that it's an awesome name I think and
also typical simple as an option last
slide before the live demo i OT gateways
i also mentioned that these are really
very lightweight and connect to these
technologies like MQTT &amp;amp; Co app and
these are really at the edge right this
is not for a powerful ESP this is to be
deployed at the edge like in the smart
home or in the car or something like
this and there are things like a clip
scorer or IBM's no dread or tip code is
also having project logo it's actually
not available yet it will be published
in October under open source license so
here you also see a little bit a trend
that the vendors even vendors like IBM
or typical are offering many frameworks
is full open source so that everybody
can play around and use that in
production even without license costs if
you want I thought it's also a trend we
see it all the middle or vendors now
let's move on to the live demo from the
scenario perspective and what do I want
to show you um i have here in the end on
the left side you'll see i develop a
simple integration process that's one
example of an integration microservice i
call it here and then i simply want to
show you how you can deploy that to dr.
Cooper natus cloud foundry and also use
other cloud native frameworks like
console or spring cloud configuration
for example I will not focus so much
here on the DevOps part on the
automation part with things like maven
and Jenkins but that's of course here
also can be combined with the others but
the focus here is really know the cloud
not've employment and so let's move to
my Amazon image I arrived running this
already and we've unfortunately some
technical problems with that stuff so
we had it before where is the technical
expert so i'm not sure why it's not
showing up here so not showing any more
put it out and in so as backup I also
after this video so I kaput um so let me
try one more time hold on how do you
have kept go back to the other
configuration again because now we see
nothing
but now it's not detecting it
putting it out and nigga
so now I think no it's not detecting
anything
what's rachels 1280
so give us one more minute hopefully we
can get it so because I really wanted to
present that
wave if you have any questions in
between you all want to see the life
thing all right
really put it all in again
yes but but I solve the problem to do
you have the same problem
can we get a screen for this one I mean
I already have a dead chicken it then
please so that I already have two video
on youtube I mean so let's do that
that looks what I know the browser
hopefully you took short work on an
explorer no special thing in my video
you
so let's just google for typical kuba
maybe finds it already here it is so you
can also watch the video after once
again if you're interested I make pies
and sound oh and i will now it's of
course not the best situation but i will
guide you through this a little bit let
me make full screen and i hope it works
so in the end i wanna show you now three
things the first in the end very short
here let's develop the development
environment here use visual according to
create an integration process right so
you have to connect us to all the
different technologies and then you
build this kind of integration service
and what I have done here and I have
deployed a very simple process the goal
of that is really to demonstrate how to
deploy this service to the different
kind of platforms and what the service
does it simply returns to you they named
the region and the host name let's
engage the three parts um which I want
to use here and i always use swagger for
testing know that what we use for all of
our products in the meantime and we see
that in the end s de facto standard
forest definitions and testing like also
other vendors i think like like redhead
or IBM are also using that and so um the
first part where i want to show you here
is is let's begin with cloud foundry so
cloud foundry platform-as-a-service so
in the end what did we do here in the
end tipco here build its own bill pay
right so cloud foundry supports
different technologies i'm out of the
box things like java or ruby and you can
offer customized build pegs and so
typical offers its own bill pic so that
you can deploy our micro services to
cloud foundry and leverage then all of
these cloud native features together
with our built middle of our services
that's what you see here and
and here you see the webui of humanoid
cloud foundry where you can manage all
of that and here i have already now
deployed my services so they like i'm
sorry that i cannot show life guys the
key here really is that I built that the
Microsoft is once before with the IDE
and I use the same a micro service
employed everywhere without any changes
to it to the build which I did right so
the jar file is still the same
everywhere and here you see a few of
these examples running and if I now test
it again your speaker what you see here
I hope you can read it if the solution
but the key here is really that if i
refresh it in the live demo it changes
the hostname and that shows that I have
different in container instances running
in cloud foundry and when I do a refresh
and you get request is automatically
routed to different of these kind of
search service providers or containers
so that's one of these things which is
done for you by the cloud platform and
therefore that's one of these cloud
native parts but also another thing
which I can show you here is that I'm
leveraging things like Sanford
centralized configuration and here i
combine Cloud Foundry together with
spring cloud config so not sure if you
have heard other talks about the spring
cloud and frameworks at javaone but
basically Cloud Foundry works pretty
good with dead together of course
especially if you use it with pivotal
cloud foundry and therefore here I'm
what you also see is that a user name in
this get requests return sky github for
cloud foundry schooling spring cloud
conflict and what I did here in the
background I'm leveraging spring cloud
config
okay until you see it so far cloud
foundry if you am called CF marketplace
in the command line then you see here
different services that's also another
of these 12 factor apps which you may be
heard of for building cloud native
applications that you leverage this kind
of services as baking service and here a
pivotal cloud foundry offers different
services out of the box and one of them
is the spring cloud config server as a
baking service and I use it here from
the pivotal marketplace and then I have
also registered my I'm here it was um I
have registered my sample red sky which
is my micro service and I have
registered it with this cloud config
service all right so you configure it
once and then you can leverage this
baking service here and then if you go
on back to cloud foundry I'm you can see
here the configuration of the different
baking services so here i use for
example the spring cloud from thick but
i also use one which is called paper
trail paper trail oh no here first is
the cloud configuration the spring cloud
config spring cloud conflict by default
uses github in the back so I'm so that
you can also version control your
configuration right and so in the end
its key value configuration you see it
here at github I have simply configured
my username at my region and the
username here is exactly the one I read
you for you in a minute ago and that's
simply a text with cloud foundry and
spring cloud conflict so that you see
when you do the swagger call to the
pivotal Cloud Foundry instance that you
get exactly this return here all right
and also i want to show you I'm md the
paper trail again sorry for the it's not
as good here in screenshots but the idea
here is to show you also how you
leverage other baking services again
this is 12 factor eps and how you build
cloud native application and the same is
true for middleware like i do it here so
i'm here in the end i also used a paper
trail which is a lot analytics software
as a service so it's hosted by paper
trail it's also for free at least
specific I'm data right and you can use
this and again here I leverage Cloud
Foundry platform-as-a-service under the
hood which gives you all the locks of
the distributed microservices because
that's again another challenge you have
many dis distributed microservices but
you have to analyze it again and
therefore you have to centralize the
locks and therefore i use here the paper
trail logging service sorry that's it
kid you mean that I services I do not
know what is used in the background so
this is a proprietary service it's not
open source I think so what did use
under the hood I don't know okay um and
so this basically showed here to you how
you can build microservice with with the
middle bar and then deploy to cloud
foundry and also leverage to different
baking services and decentralized
configuration and then all this the best
practices you've heard in other talks
here about 12 factor eps and
microservices design patterns like the
circuit breaker you can leverage all of
that here with middleware at least an
hour middle at the same way as you can
do it with your own chava microservices
all right the second example now I'm I
want to run the same artifact I built in
my middle where I de with docker and
here i combine docker with console
console is another open source framework
I'm running here I'm running console in
a specific docker container locally on
my laptop here for testing and i also
created a docker container with a docker
image out of my middle bar microservice
i think i can showed it to you here so
here first you see console console is
again for centralized configuration and
for service registry and you can
leverage that with our military services
I'm like with any any other service tool
and here for example using docker images
and what we have we have here some
examples and at the bottom also you see
the console docker image so in the end
it's nothing special i use a console
topper image and i have also built my
tip core
image and here you also see the
dockerfile of my middle of our micro
service here it's very simple we use the
business works contain a distant base
image this is similar to cloud foundry
where we created a build peg that you
can leverage it with our technologies
and here for dr. we built on base image
tool and then I simply add my micro
service here which is the integration
service and I expose on part and then I
can it run it in docker with like any
other doctor container here and we use
also as I said I'm console in this
example with that and so here you see
how it runs as I said unfortunately and
you seem to not see life but i'm here at
the end it starts the application and in
three seconds or so and then you can do
again with swagger the testing to test
it here so here you see again now it's
the configuration is this time done in
console and so the name yourself I
talked her via console config and that's
exactly the key value our edit them to
console okay and then finally let's go
to cubanita screw benitez here is
running on amazon web services therefore
i also leverage and I matts own
container service I deployed my images
there you do not have not have to do
that but if you use cubanita so how much
will it make sense to deploy your images
also on amazon cloud what you don't have
to but here you see em the business
works and the console image deployed to
the Amazon repository and then you see
here cubanita switch is also running in
a cluster on Amazon here in this case
and here in the end what did I do and
here you see I have run in containers
and here now we see i deployed the same
microservices without doing any changes
and here you see one example of the
yamen file which is a configuration file
for KU benitez and here in this case
what do i do i simply refer to the
container image so in this case I'm
first having a ml file for the console
nervous and then I also have one for the
for the business works a micro service
and in the business works microservice I
once again refer to the console server
URL and in this way then the middle
where is integrated with the other cloud
services like in this case console for
example or you can do the same with
histories or a Rico whatever you want to
use and then you see here in Cuba
natives there a replication controllers
and here you see now my two running
services my console service and my micro
my business work service and the story
unique the other story that the features
of Cuban it is and so let's then the
same for middleware as it is for
anything else and therefore you can also
combine that so what our customers are
doing they are using KU benitez or a
console not just for the middleware but
they are leveraging the same cloud
native frameworks for all for their
application microservices build with
Java or Ruby or any other technology and
they build it use it for the integration
microservices and that's a huge benefit
that you use can use these kind of cloud
native frameworks and services with all
the different applications and that's
how most of our customers want to do it
and do it and here you see constable
exact same configuration and the swagger
is the same test as locally but now it
runs on cuban it is and therefore here
the key value of your return sky on
cuban it is because i configured it that
way and then finally what i also wanted
to show I talk a lot about API
management and then usually what you can
do you can also expose your services no
matter where they're deployed Cloud
Foundry true benitez wherever to an API
management solution to expose them to
add a developer's internal partners
external to use them and the key here
again is that you have a middleware
which is integrated with the API
management and for typical for example
if you build a micro services business
works and deploy to any cloud platform
no matter if it's Cuba natives or cloud
foundry or so it also if you want
generates the configuration that it
automatically also deployed through your
API management solution so that you do
not have to do these steps manually and
that's basically the idea
which I wanted to show your life here
and that's also the live demo I will not
try to get back to back to my laptop so
let's conclude it and finish it up so
the decree I wanted to show you is that
for middleware it's not much different
than for other modern micro servers I
detectors if you have a good middleware
it leverages containers and micro
services and cloud platforms in the same
way and also it integrates with all the
other frameworks like console like Cuban
it is like spring and whatever you want
to use in the same way like with your
custom application so that you can
leverage all of that together and we see
at all our customers they confirm to us
that they build micro service and they
need even more integration now because
they get more microservices a lot of
software as a service from external
cloud providers they still have a lot of
legacy which they need to integrate and
therefore they are really happy that
they can now leverage all these cloud
native concepts also with the middle
verb and that's basically what I wanted
to show you I'm sorry that the lifetime
would it not work you can watch it on
YouTube it's available it's 20 minutes
and you can google as you see I've seen
here in YouTube for Cuban ETS and tip
core something like this and watch it
there and I hope you still press the
green button even without the live demo
okay so thanks a lot and as we are now
also overtime if your questions come to
me or come back by linkedin or so and
thanks a lot for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
