life I'm your host Javed Mohammed here
at open world 2017 and I'm very honored
to have with us today Patrick do-boy who
is known as the godfather of DevOps and
a whole lot more so the Patrick thank
you so much for coming
hi Carla thanks for having me thank you
so I was running how I was gonna kick
off this session I've never done an
interview with The Godfather before and
I was looking for some Godfather quotes
so I think one of them was I'm gonna
make him an offer he can't refuse but I
didn't know if that was a I don't know
if that was relevant but something I
thought that was even more intriguing
was while I was just thinking of how to
kind of open this up was a quote from
Charles Darwin and he said you know it's
not the strongest of this species that
survive all the most intelligent but the
one who's most responsive to change and
when I see the world of dev and ops and
DevOps and just a whole field of AI
there's just so much change so just kind
of rewind the time I guess I've seen
some of your interviews in the past of
this kind of starting off in what 2009
even it may be a little bit before then
so share with me what was the world like
then cuz things move so fast oh well a
trip down memory lane exactly where ops
and death were fighting all the time and
so I guess I was working at the time for
more of the operational systems guys and
I was very jealous of all the agile
developers like getting more productive
working together and so on and I said to
myself like why can't we do this
together with the operational people and
the time at that time was really like ok
developers build the software they send
you a package and then operations have
to run it and have to maintain it but
there was very little dialogue and even
within agile scrum
the the UPS guys weren't really embedded
as part of the team so you know I was a
big fan of things like Kanban and so on
so I started experimenting with the
using Kanban in an operational group so
we will better receive software and have
like a better way of what we would now
call probably the pipeline that gets
delivered into prod and also give them
feedback back into the project so in
2009 I kind of you know said to myself
on Twitter that's how it goes you know
why not do a conference uh-huh
I think about 60 people showed up is
this the devops days that's whatever
update yeah I had like no idea before
what I was doing I was just like seeking
people who had like similar IDs uh-huh
and then we had the first dev updates
like you mentioned and people were so
excited and full of energy and since
then we just kept it going all over the
world but the interesting part was even
now after day one like we didn't call it
really like we had any idea of what
DevOps would become but I think what
really happened at a time so it's more
of its site-geist the the pain was very
clear to everybody when you explain the
problem yeah so that was kind of the
context where we started in okay so I
was actually one of your other
interviews or presentations and I just
found it fascinating because to me it's
much more than just about a technology
or a methodology you know you talked
about you know how this is basically how
society is form you know going from I
think groups two tribes to a
civilization so and then just like how
basically ideas spread through to memes
yes you want to just talk a little bit
about that because I think is a very
fascinating subject trying to just see
how house society is a form and grow
sure well I think I t's very often you
know
they also say it's the tools mimic the
people in IT and a different way but
it's also very predominantly that that
side guys from going to the central
authorities like we would have the
waterfall dictating things or in a
normal regular society you'd have like a
newspaper or a broadcaster bringing you
the news and we we all got used to this
kind of pseudo Authority that we didn't
like so things like Facebook came there
things like that kind of questions the
central authorities and I think we're
started doing the same in IT where we
started with you know kind of a tailor
like model where the group's got divided
and then they could control the
different groups like the dev in the ops
and the testers and so on and then when
you let the people work together you
with without specifically the central
authority you get a totally different
dynamic I must say over the years I have
learned that this is very close to the
belief system of people okay
there's people who don't think you can
do a better job by collaborating it
sounds strange but they would say well
if I write up the spec and I write up
the API it is much more clear than you
know having to collaborate and discuss
what we need to do and I've had it
numerous times where we ended up in a
situation like well you know you should
write everything you want to have versus
like okay let's just sit together and
this is yeah it's it's I think it
changed that society went through and
even though people call me dumb the
godfather of Davos which totally I hate
because you know I understand it's a
tribute but I know it's like I was just
like one of the persons promoting the
IDs and and like I say it's the
site-geist
of the new ideas of collaborating that
you were trying to achieve so
okay all right so in terms of your
vision and obviously you know a lot of
this has happened out there I mean it's
not something you directly control but
are you happy
but the where we are at this point in
2017 so is it grown beyond your
imagination is it going in you what it
is you hope that it'll go in a different
direction I mean I mean is although as
much as you may not be the Godfather but
it's still your baby sure in some ways
so yeah so I'm I'm already have enough
gray hair to have seen a couple of these
trends go on uh-huh
so you're doing much better than I am so
I figure when I look back we promoted a
lot of culture and we really wanted to
push out the cultural model I think when
most people no talk about DevOps even
here at JavaOne or open world it's gonna
be all about the tools but then I tell
myself agile became TDD and the scrum
dance and ITIL became the hell up that
system and so on but like you mentioned
before even though we we have helped to
change the mindset a little bit that
collaboration is important that you know
that will always be there what do you
ask me whether I'm happy with the
current state no I would have wanted to
have it more of the culture part will it
evolve I think you know there's gonna be
a next thing that probably is gonna
build on these IDs we had and just move
it forward but the nice thing is I have
no shares invested in DevOps so for me
it's not that really important but on
his side for me the learning would be
how do we get better at not dismissing
or
the core IDs of things like ITIL had a
very good core IDs but the message got
diluted at all the same DevOps the same
and what fascinates me is that the
industry we don't get better at like
keeping the core better alive so there
is this thirst I don't know how do you
call it but of tools tools and
technology there's this religion that we
believe that tools and everything will
solve our problems which I think you
know it's definitely gonna help but if
if we just continue that path that
everything's gonna be technology what
all vendors would like us to believe I
think that's not gonna be the good
direction for us I want to share with
you a little story I was at a start at
one time I was the community manager so
whenever there'd be a customer issue I
would have to go and talk to the
developers out after go and talk to the
operations and on this one particular
issue the developer is pointing to the
operations and the operation to them
they say no no no it's not our problem
go and talk to a developer and literally
the two people I was talking to were
divided by a partition and they were on
the opposite so I lit a second eye
please and I don't you wield the chair
over just to kind of get them to talk
and but I but when I see that and you
know typically whether it be a physical
wall or a psychological war I think it's
an incredible thing that groups that
have been kind of siloed off and now
communicating and being pretty so let me
ask you something
does that give us hope that the
Democrats and Republicans will also
start communicate Katy and fall in love
and you know is your good luck I think
like one other parts I'm gonna discuss
in my talk is that so we moved on to
collaborating Devon ops inside the same
company uh-huh
but as we're increasingly using a lot of
external services it's gonna be hard to
you know I cannot get the engineer of
Google to sit like next to me so any
service we use how do you go from there
so
we need to start collaborating across
companies so that's where I see DevOps
heading now in a way like how do we do
that
like how do we build a trust not just
only within the same company but then
outside the company and you know the
people from ITIL would say that supplier
management in a way like you keep good
supplier seam keep them happy and so on
so but there's there's gonna be a change
in how we deal with this kind of
collaboration because we don't have the
same boss yeah he cannot tell us to sit
together and that's something that
fascinates me to continue like how that
how will that continue okay well it's a
fascinating subject I know you have a
keynote to go to Patrick I really
appreciate you coming over and sharing
you so stay tuned for more dev live
sessions here at open world 2017 thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
