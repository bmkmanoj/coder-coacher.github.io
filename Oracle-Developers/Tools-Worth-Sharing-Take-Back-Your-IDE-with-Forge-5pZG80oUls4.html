it's 2675 is one of the best sessions
that you will ever see here my name is
Lincoln Baxter and this is George miss
grg we are on the forge team at jboss if
you want to follow us on twitter my
handle is Lincoln three this is what I
look like when I feel weird and this is
George Castaldi je good saldi and that's
George in boston drinking beer but you
kind of cut off the beers because the
presentation yeah so this talks about j
bus forge and are some of our thoughts
about the future of tooling that will be
a little adventurous for just part of
the jboss community which is a whole
variety of projects that are sponsored
by Red Hat so just briefly before we
dive right in I'll just give you guys an
overview of what we're going to cover
today first thing we're going to do is
just give you a very short explanation
of why we're building a new tool a
description of what it does how it works
and knots but not least how we all fit
in how you fit in so brief explanation
of why we're making a new tool necessity
is the mother of innovation and this
crow is going to help us explain I found
this fascinating this crow is this is a
experiment the crow has a piece of wire
in its mouth and it's trying to get a
little bucket out of a tube that has
some seeds in it or some food and it's
trying to reach this thing with a piece
of wire which is impressive in its own
but eventually it's like when this isn't
really working and gets frustrated or
whatever it takes the piece of wire and
bends it and makes it hook
uses the hook grab to the basket and
pulls out the seeds this blew my mind
that a crow a bird is using tools and
inventing tools to do what it needs to
do to survive which really is another
way of saying you need the right tool
for the job we have a lot of tools
already but they may not exactly fit the
niche that you that you need in that
moment and if the right tool doesn't
exist ask your co to make it because
they're apparently really good at it I
will show you how to do that later so
we're does Forge play in forge is a tool
and we have other tools that we're all
probably familiar with you know eclipse
IntelliJ netbeans these are graphical
tools there are more out there this is
just a few that of the most Java EE
tools run in multiple hosts environments
multiple platforms and they use multiple
forms of interaction right we have voice
tools we have click Mouse tools we have
typing tools and we're even starting to
see some more advanced forms of human
interaction where you can wave your hand
magically in the air and have things
move around and control stuff this is an
ad from leap motion where they sort of
showed people using hand gestures to
interact with their devices with you
know this is started to happen with lit
intendo we the PlayStation where you can
hold the controller and actually you
know move a gyroscope in it senses what
you want but this is even beyond that
where you don't even have to hold
anything it just sort of looks at you it
uses infrared it uses sonar and measures
and builds a map and figures out what
you want I'm not really trying to
advertise leap motion but it just shows
a good example of other ways that we're
going to probably start interacting with
computers because I don't imagine that
we're going to be using a keyboard and a
mouse forever at least not and you know
it won't be the only primary way of
interacting with a computer
so today we have graphical interfaces we
have command lines we have magical hand
waving and something else some other
kind of sorcery maybe we'll finally get
that mind-reading working or something
like that but as human input technology
changes how are our tools going to
change to adapt to this we're already
seeing some of this happen in the mobile
technology space we're sitting down at a
computer is now almost cumbersome
because you can't really bring that tool
with you without a big laptop and a
keyboard and a mouse how do we build
tools that work on tablets how do we
build tools that are mobley accessible
so let's talk a little bit about what
Forge does yeah for CH helpless on
automating common development tasks not
only on the basis of code generation
purposes but also in the tasks that are
quite trivial to do while developing
applications that includes performing
set setup of boilerplate code and
configuration and for charge also helps
you to focus on the on your business
rules instead of dealing with
boilerplate code with we find Forge as a
write once run anywhere to so as a to
that could run on any ID or a shell
interface and you can share all the
extensions that you're right for it
right so a lot of this probably sounds
familiar you're thinking this is exactly
what my IDE already does for me and
that's true it is there is there some
duplication there but Forge is also
trying to fill another gap that we'll
talk about in a minute here but mostly
you know out of the box Forge gives you
a rapid application development tool so
you can you can take your business model
and use either a top-down or bottom-up
approach to quickly build out a database
in a web interface that start are like
main selling
from a Java EE development perspective
but more importantly it provides modular
tooling so you can with simple
interfaces so that you can quickly
develop your own extensions and your own
customizations for how the Tool Works
and what it does for you and we also
provide this abstraction between the
interface and the actual functionality
so when you write your your extension
this the behavior that you've added will
be available in your IDE on the command
line and anywhere else that you embed
Forge think of it as writing an eclipse
plugin or netbeans plugging and making
available for all this all the ideas
that you can use like if you if you're
writing an eclipse plugin you're like
dealing only with the Eclipse API and if
you're right with Forge you can make it
available in any ID I can tell EJ or net
beans or rice so before we talk about
extending the tool i just want to show a
couple ways of interacting with it this
is for joining in eclipse and the
primary method or that the fastest
method to just get right in is to press
commit control for which brings up the
forge command menu and it's going to
provide you the same types of features
like creating new projects this is going
to create a maven web application lovely
and import it one important thing that I
want to mention is that it doesn't
actually like there there's no such
thing as a forged project it uses the
same metadata that the other ideas use
it uses literally just the maven pom
file the sources the configurations it
reads that tries to understand what
you're doing and it doesn't in fort it
doesn't restrict you to a certain
development model it tries to be very
flexible and comprehend what you're
doing as opposed to say you know dumping
a project settings file that limits you
and when you build that once you've
configured your project in one ide
eclipses somewhat notoriously bad for
this in the past before maven you know
you have your Eclipse settings file and
then you have to have eclipse in order
to use that project somewhere else or
you would have to reconfigure you all
your paths and scripts and stuff like
that so we basically just say okay
here's your your your project we're
going to read the actual sources to get
the information so just to quickly give
you guys an idea of what we're doing
here I'm actually going to run a script
Forge is also a scriptable can the
people in the back see this okay forge
is a scriptable tool so being that it
provides the command line interface you
can also effectively script up a whole
swath of commands this is a very very
long forged script that's going to build
a CD bookstore application or a simple
front end for one and you know it sets
up the data model it sets up constraints
and all the entities and let's just run
it and see what happens so it's going to
go through and start executing all these
commands here it's creating new jpa
entities it's adding it's creating enum
constants it's creating classes it's
adding fields to these things setting up
constraints for minimum maximum values
and this is a long strip so this is
going to take a little while but it's an
example of how when you abstract the
interface away from the tool you can
start to do things like creating a
script that you could maybe pass around
the team or share on the web that would
perform some task in the IDE for the
user of the script say you have a common
or factoring that you figured out that
helps people move from one technology to
another for instance you can write a
script that would automate that that
refactoring and then share the script
and have people run it so this is
actually going to take quite a while I
think this is like a 400 line
for our line script but while we're
letting this run does anyone have any
questions about what we're showing here
so far the question is what other IDEs
other than Eclipse does it run in we
have currently a plug-in for IntelliJ
and we're working on that beam support
yeah we're show you how to do that in
the next demo one thing that is
important to notice notice is that every
command that is being executed in this
shell interface is available on the GUI
like when you permit when you press
command for on drop or in you see that
there is a pop-up menu you can see the
same commands that were executed here in
a graphical intuitive way
what will I do you mean wow what the
question is can you do rapid deployment
I'm not exactly sure what what didn't
mean
so the question is when I make changes
to the project can it you know pick up
that change automatically and redeploy
that depends in what your deployment
environment is so if Ford isn't actually
providing you a server deployment
environment it's going to use whatever
you your IDE is using so if you're of
rapid deployment in your IDE then it
would be supported there if you use
Eclipse if you use eclipse or jboss
developer studio you already you already
have this set of plugs that do that for
you so here's the application that our
script created it is effectively the
admin interface for this because it's
exposing all of our data to the client
front end but this is what we call
scaffolding which is just giving you a
very I guess a structure of a project
that you would then go in and fill in
the business logic and add security
roles to the different pages or
customize a page to make it do what you
want yeah this is basically crud so it
is kind of a boilerplate code that well
when you have a JP entity all you have
to do is generate it all of that fortune
does generate like a couple of pages to
persist this information and display so
yeah wait that's interesting oh yeah
musicians so this is just showing that
we do have a fully functional
application now that's sort of our main
selling point for the java ee
development crowd but let's say that the
way for generated something is not
actually like we want to change how how
this application was generated how would
we extend it before we show it how to
exactly do that let's just overview how
before just working under the covers
like most modern Java applications that
are extendable and more complex than
just a simple business feature something
that has more multi-purpose
functionality for just built on a module
system similar to osgi except we felt
that osgi was very heavy weight and had
a very large learning curve that we
didn't really want to impose on the
community of people who are going to be
building these extensions so we created
a lightweight module container based on
maven and jboss modules the system
consumes what we call add-ons and
deploys them or you deploy these add-ons
in an add-on repository where it then
loads with jboss modules providing
features like hot swap class loader
isolation dependencies interdependencies
between the add-ons so you can actually
share functionality between them and
reuse functionality that other people
have done so if someone creates an
add-on to send them email you can reuse
that in your ad on that save expose the
service to do that so once you have the
add-ons deployed for just basically
entirely add-ons that if you started it
up without any add-ons you would just
get a blank screen nothing would happen
if you're really boring so out of the
box we bundle a bunch of add-ons that it
gives you that functionality it gives
you the shell it gives you the the
commands the user interface abstraction
the Java EE stuff the java stuff we load
all that up and that gets put into the
add-on registry each add-on can depend
on what's called a container that runs
within the furnace runtime the container
is an interesting piece because it
actually lets you choose not only how
you want to provide services but what
language you build your ad on in so you
could build an add-on in groovy in
JavaScript in any JVM supported language
essentially as long as there's a
container that can provide services to
the furnace
addon registry so the service registry
which is part of the container contains
all of these services exports them to
the addon registry and then you can get
those services simply by asking for
their their type and this is something
that you would do in the application
that you're embedding the furnace
runtime in so in the IDE when we want to
integrate with eclipse with netbeans
with IntelliJ we start furnace it loads
the Autons and we ask it for things like
give me all your commands that are
available and again the add-ons services
can depend on services oops from each
other which is how we get the
functionality reuse so your ad on let's
say you want to build an add-on you
write Java code you can depend on
libraries you can add other files and
resources like code templates or
configurations etc and you can even like
call it to the Internet you could access
the database whatever you just build all
that India right on you depend on other
add-ons and reuse the functionality
there if you want to you install you
right on into the odd own repository
using what's called the add-on manager
and this is how we tie into maven the
add-on manager says sorry let me back up
one step when you build an add-on it is
just a maven project you have a pom file
you have dependencies and the audit
manager reads that figures out which
add-ons you're depending on dynamically
builds the relationship between the
modules dynamically pulls in all the
dependency libraries and bundles that up
for installation and you can install
from get you can install from a local
source code project there are lots of
different ways to get your ad on in to
forge and consequently to share it so
all of that is running within the IDE
within eclipse NetBeans IntelliJ this is
running in the system command line and
also you can embed this system in the
web we haven't tried it on android yet
that probably wouldn't work
without some major changes because
androids not really Java but in theory
you could get it to work in all these
JVM environments and the result is that
you can quickly build and share tools so
as I said before Forge is built entirely
on add-ons without add-ons it does
nothing and these add-ons are built and
supported by jboss and red hat like we
are investing in this our own projects
build add-ons and we publish those other
community projects are building these
islands like Delta spike we have the
what's the digit Java jug in India
Chennai Chennai jug is building a whole
set of add-ons to do like code standards
there's a whole bunch of people who are
building these things as well as like
company partners and everyone else so
let's show how this actually works we've
been saving a lot of words let's see
some code
so we start by creating a new project
this is like the same steps that you can
do to create a java web application
using Forge but instead of choosing the
project type as a java web application
we choose it to be a forge add-on as you
can see we have more options they are
this is where we pick our our container
yeah the two containers that ford ships
with by default are the CDI container so
again using the same job enterprise
standard development model to actually
extend forge as you would use to build a
normal web web application or the simple
container which is just using Java Java
reflection to produce services and
expose commands and you can see a list
of the atoms that are currently stalled
in during forge we have atoms for all
the mostly up most of the things that
you might need like directing with get
interacting with maven yeah and you can
see at the top here we have a twitter at
on installed that lets you come out here
and say twitter tweet message hello from
jboss forge at javaone conf
and now when I go over here to Twitter
my notifications victoria secret awesome
here we have hello from jboss forge at
javaone con seven seconds ago so we have
this Twitter out on it would be nice if
we could reuse some of that
functionality to make our IDE a little
more social and interactive so how about
every time we execute a command we tweet
what we're doing so all of our friends
and see how how our work is going or
maybe our boss wants to check in on this
or something like that so we picked the
Twitter out on this import yeah this is
what you this is what you get for
working on the development branch here's
my tweet listener project add-on okay so
as you can see here and make this a
little bigger we have just a normal
maven project with a couple dependencies
look at me yeah good okay what makes a
maven project of a valid Forge adult
project is the usage of the special
classifier we have a classifier name it
Forge Adam and that that that makes a
possible for us to navigate through the
maven dependency graph in check yeah
it's essentially a hint a forge a ton
tells furnace that hey this thing is
going to declare dependencies so check
to make sure that when you declare
dependency on another ad on you actually
build a module relationship instead of
just slurping up all of the jars and all
the classes from that other add-on and
repackaging it inside your own because
then you have problems like class
duplication classcastexception 'he's if
you have like five different copies of a
class on the class but at the same time
and just to show what this ends up
resulting in you we have a visualization
for this so if I go into my maven
repository here all quick or jboss forge
items add on let's see you I for example
2 11 10 final if I open this dot file
this is a graph representation of the
add-on dependency hierarchy this is for
just comprehension of the user interface
add-on and all the module dependencies
that it has and the EAA stands for
exported like this is from top down you
I requires conversion it requires
environment settings and it requires the
furnace containers to actually produce
the services that represent commands and
listeners on etc as you can see you can
depend on other atoms that use a
different programming model like facets
and environments they use a simple
programming model as a convert uses a
CDI so that's transparent to my UI Adam
yeah it also uses CDI so that no matter
what programming model your extension
uses you can still share those services
with other add-ons and their programming
model
okay so here's our project and we
already have a dependency on our Twitter
add on here yeah here and on the forge
core this is essentially all of the pre
bundled add-ons just as a very easy way
to depend on my cake just let me do
stuff without having to specifically
narrow down I only want to depend on
like the conversion functionality or I
only want to depend on the dependency
resolution functionality you can
actually just slurp it up all at once
and it just makes it the getting started
experience a little bit simpler so let's
go ahead and create our listener a new
class and we'll call this our tweet
everything listener and this is going to
extend the command execution listener
one other thing to note is that because
we went with the CDI container the ford
island is automatically configured with
beans xml and everything that you need
to use the context and dependency
injection specification if we use the
reflection service container we wouldn't
have needed this wouldn't be here so
let's say here we are in our listener ok
first we need the tweeter service yeah
so we're using Twitter for J in the in
our Twitter Adam so since we depend on
that Adam we can easily inject the
service there is a Twitter to E with an
eye
what's it called twitter oh just twitter
it's just weird yes twitter for j
twitter oh yeah yeah yes okay like so
now i'm going to need help because i'm
lost ya know now you just call twitter
update message it's a update I think
that we need the name of the service
no here
sorry yeah it's a big message oh okay
updates that of status gonna be and
let's say the status is going to be the
name of the command dot metadata don't
fix get off it yes the UI context dot
get name and then let's actually print
out the status so that we can see if
we're doing a good job or not result get
message okay so this should when we
install this ad on automatically listen
for command execution events and post
very annoying messages to Twitter so how
do we install this you can use Forge for
that so we can actually just bring up
the forge context menu and say Adam
build installed and install our tweet
listener and click finish this is going
to run the maven build and then packaged
up the add-on calculate the dependencies
install it into the out on the
repository and then essentially hot-swap
it into the runtime environment question
the question is are you are we
generating the script at the same time
that we could use this to share with
friends and the answer is no but if you
want to get scripts out of commands that
you've already executed there's a
history file you can just copy out of
that and I think we're having an
internet issue here no no
up there we go ok so now when I run a
command I'm going to bring this over to
the side and get my browser over there
we should see oops
lots of exceptions oh it's because you
deleted the project all right
yeah okay the words so the result of
this command is apparently no but
because there is no message all right
there's no message but we're now
tweeting every single every single
message that's why we used your bus for
demo not driven yep yes yeah except
something isn't happening here I don't
know if it's the internet or us we
should also get let's say we did a new
project yeah project new sample
two
yeah I think something is oh that's the
important
I don't know there we go okay it's just
taking a while so there we go new
project named example 2 has been created
yeah your roorkee yeah we're working as
proof that we're working so this is sort
of like a trivial example of of taking
Forge functionality and extending it
right yeah I mentioned that you are
talking about human interaction yeah can
we control for CH like using the voice
or something yeah so actually as lock is
sitting over here on the left during one
of his mad fits of insanity decided to
write a voice control plugin for this so
i would have installed the he wrote an
atom that uses the java voice api and
the for short speech out on so if i do
voice on here it's going to throw a nice
exception for some reason I'm that
that's okay yeah well now we're editing
something LS LS speech let's try that
again
oh yeah it's a speech on
and then voice on exception LS
look on your hands LS all right well
that's the Twitter tutor oh we're
getting we're getting forbidden that's
why oh ok yeah it's too too many
requests duplicates statuses build who's
going to build the whole project ok all
right and that's going to build for a
long time that's a huge project I my
sound is off yeah it talks back at you
as well hello Lincoln we have a little
more time so do we have any questions
talk a little we just mentioned it
somebody's but I got the impression for
developer workstation consistency
alright so if you want to enforce coding
standards that was actually the another
demo I kind of wanted to show so we with
the same command listener we can
actually do things like decorate the
output of forged generation so when we
built that whole first application let's
say we didn't like the way it generated
view beans or like jsf backing beans or
something like that which is that the
right listener for that is this okay so
let's say we want to make sure that
everyone in our team is using the same
logging framework or something like that
we can use this same execution listener
and instead of tweeting and throwing
that nice duplicate duplicate status
exception oh it's because i was printing
it actually let's keep tweeting it's
annoy people just not print that we can
actually get the files that were changed
or into a files or output selection
which one we can we can get the current
selection because it would be easy okay
yeah so we can get the current selection
to contact contacts yeah you like
contacts yet selection good initial
selection this is going to return the
resource that the user had selected at
the time the executed the command which
will let us figure out which files have
changed and if anything new was created
actually do we need to add that pre
command executed to add we need to add a
listener and bri command executed
no okay here what do you want to do is
be you George has actually done this
before so I'm going to let him take over
yeah so he's going to get the selection
and use my Mac for the first time so you
I selection right so if we have a
selection we're going to check to see if
it's a Java resource and forge actually
has some basic parsers built in as
add-ons that you can depend on so
similar to eclipse intelligent beings it
has a way of comprehending these files
we call that roaster like a bean rester
and once you have the selection of Java
resources you can make the audience
nauseated and get the Java class source
out of this so this is like a virtual
file system pointer to something on disk
or somewhere some resource on the web or
something like that it's an abstraction
over where the actual project files are
coming from
sorry
yeah so you get the Java type which is
representing the actual source file like
the parsed code and we want to check to
see if it was a jsf backing bean yeah
yeah so or if it's a class then we will
check to see if it has an annotation or
actually in this case let's just do it
for everything so like if it's a Java
class let's just add this logger so that
every single class is going to use the
same thing yeah so get the source file
and then cast it
they're actually I think I can take over
okay now we have the source in the
proper like we've checked to see if it's
a class now we can check to see does it
have a logger so does it have a field
called log you know you can check for a
whole bunch of different things you
could check to make sure that it
actually you could iterate over all of
the fields and see if anything that
looks like a logger is there and you
could either tweet a message to that
person saying that you're you should be
is the right logging framework or
actually just remove the logger and then
add it and replace it with the the one
that you you want them to use so here
we're adding the field making it private
static set the type to the java.util
logger what was that Big Brother yes and
yes at the name of the field and we have
to initialize it so we'll just cheat and
take a shortcut and use a literal string
initialization of this field instead of
doing the whole typesafe api for like
new nuin Stintz of this class
class good name sure
semicolon to end
yeah they even made a he got rid of
static but we could actually just get
the name of the Java we could actually
do that so if we change the field to set
static whoops set static true now we can
say here the type to get qualified name
source dot get qualified name dot class
get name which should give us the actual
name so this I believe should be
functional now we need to see oh yeah we
need to save the source like we're
dealing with the memory structure so now
we need to persist those changes so we
just call the set set contents and pass
the source so actually the question was
now we need to commit it and the answer
is no because the forge resource API
will automatically commit at certain
intervals and you can actually enable or
disable the resource transactions so if
you want to for instance try out a
change in the project you can start a
resource transaction just basically
start a transaction make a bunch of
changes and then either commit or
rollback those changes changes it's a
little bit like having an undue for a
whole set of operations so let's go
ahead
so just build and install the atom yes
should be good build and install
should be a little faster this time yeah
things because you use in a snapshot
version oh snap shot yeah that's right
snapshots make me even go download
everything
so this is very interesting what is it a
little bit more than that I mean what
happens thinking of was just you know
the settings like every time can save
for madness yeah so the the idea is can
I use this so that every time someone
saves a file in the project it formats
it with the source for matter an answer
is yes what you would if you want to
explain sure we have an API on the
resources Adam they can monitor for fire
changes or resources there were there
are changes and you can like use the
code similar to this to execute when
this event happens like you can register
listener too yeah monitor is it yeah so
you just need to get a handle the
resource factory then you can set up a
monitor and what you would do is if you
want this to be sort of automatic just
right the simplest way is probably just
write a command that says you know start
formatting this directory and then every
java file that changes you would just
call romantic formatter roaster from
roaster
matter
you know we have as well p class to do
that yeah there is a social matter and
actually in the latest version of the
java parts that we released we also
released a command-line tool that lets
you format a folder or class or
recursive directory structure using the
gist system command line you can just a
format using this profile it actually
uses the eclipse come in the eclipse
code format configuration to do the
formatting and i can let me just pull it
up on the website here real quick
so here you can see there's a
distribution of the formatter you can
just download it set it to where you
want well set it to your specific code
format profile in and do that or you
could do the whole command thing so
let's see what we've got here we just
installed the add-on that should now add
a logger to all of our Java sources if I
do project new create a new class and
just actually I can soon your class in
here you chop on a new class type name
has logged me
Oh failure
11
no error oh I didn't say that i think i
did safe yeah i'd try not to getting to
the like choose and like pick here we
will endure yeah
I don't think it's a refreshing
refreshing
yeah looks like there's something wrong
with the code soon all we did reinstall
it I think the problem is we may have
made a mistake here Oh think he's
throwing that exception because of the
tweeter yeah oh right yeah sorry about
that just get rid of Twitter for a
minute yeah we don't want to tweet
anymore yeah so let's build and install
if this doesn't work we can actually
show debugging but I think since we're
running up towards the end of time we'll
probably just finish up the slides yeah
well this is well this is running we're
a little low on time so I'll just get
back to the presentation here and then
when we're finished we can come back and
see if we were successful so to recap
Forge provides a way to automate
development tasks it provides the
ability for easy extension so as simple
is just creating a new maven project
programming against some api's your
stuff is all CDI enabled so it
automatically gets picked up there's
really no configuration that you have to
do you just start writing code and forge
picks it up when you install the add-on
yeah the simple programming model so it
the API is that it uses we try to keep
very intuitive and we have documentation
on the website for how to do a lot of
these common tasks and it doesn't we
didn't show this but it doesn't
constrain you to a specific environment
so if you want to use CDI or reflection
or spring or whatever you can pick your
own programming model and you can also
actually showed the abstraction between
the shelf and the IDE actually just to
show a little more that we can also
tweet from eclipse with this add-on so
it's the same command that was running
in the command line
from eclipse oh wells to be some luck
apparently our listener just weren't and
added a logger to our all right on there
you go yeah finally work and we should
have a new tweet from eclipse yeah there
it is leaps
and so just a little one question in the
back the question is what versions of
Java and Java EE does Forge target the
answer is currently Java 7 and 8 and
well I guess from free if you're
building a project java 6 and 7 if
you're building an add-on for forge Java
7 and 8 and if you're building a java ee
application java ee 6 and 7 yes yes we
have a special plugin to do that yep
actually if you come no sorry actually
uh the whole functionality of for july's
on the furnace container so forge itself
is a distribution of the furnace
container with some plugins some add-ons
yeah and we also have another project
that's called wind-up wind-up wind-up
wind-up yeah it's from the migration
Tina yeah you can so another project
that I work on is jboss wind up which is
a migration analyzer so it looks through
project sources and jar files and
figures out if you're going to have
problems running this application on
this application server and we are
delivering that as a furnace setup
furnace add-ons so we just packaged up
the add-ons distribute it with furnace
and then they can just run it from the
command line and yeah any more questions
ok so just a little humor before we wrap
up IDs tend to suck so like a clip sucks
that beans sucks sometimes i D ISA
IntelliJ suck sometimes Forge fixes all
of that as you can see and as you saw
today we don't have any we don't have
any problems but we're we're glad to be
here and we hope that what you've seen
today shows the the niche and the role
that we're trying to fit and how we're
not trying to replace other existing
IDEs we're just really trying to enhance
and cater towards people's different
development styles and different usage
styles and sort of prepare for what
might be coming down the stream with web
IDEs and the more embedded tooling so
please build something and share it the
project is called jboss forge if we
haven't said it enough already yeah and
again I'm Lincoln Baxter I'm the forge
project lead this is George castaldi the
primary developer and add-on development
lead style I'd Peterson who's not here
today is the shell command line
integration ladies the guy that makes
all the ANSI codes work kun Aires is the
Eclipse lead and all of you are our
leads for the future so please try it
out build something and stay in the loop
if you want to check out yeah make sure
make sure to check our project website
because it's really cool yeah so on the
website you can find all the add-ons
documentation news about the project and
where to download it and try it out so
thank you all for coming and if you have
any more questions please feel free to
come up ask us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
