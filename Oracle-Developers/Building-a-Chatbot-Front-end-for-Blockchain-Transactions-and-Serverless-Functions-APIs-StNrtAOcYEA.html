a full house to talk about some stuff
that we are doing in Oracle and thanks
pratik for for taking us through the
that serverless you know bit that was
very inviting and we will be talking
about some of these server less stuff so
let me just get this on alright so we're
going to do some some stuff but before I
do that I have to tell you that there
are some things that I am going to talk
about which are going to happen in the
future okay and therefore whenever you
are deciding or taking a technology
decision you must check what exactly you
know what status that particular service
for example is so in this particular
case I'll be talking about blockchain
which is not yet available but but
that's case in point so you might be
thinking what exactly is Oracle doing
with a developer event I know that some
of you are here in the last code I did
see hands go up but you know everybody
tells us you are a database company
right yes we do build the best database
in the world but we also do a lot of
stuff in the application development
area you may or may not be aware of it
and therefore I just wanted to give you
an idea of the stuff that we've been
doing these are some of the open source
projects that we support that we sponsor
that we contribute to and we invite you
know developers to join in into these
projects and and you know contribute as
well and you know through all this
through all the interactions that we are
having with customers with developers
with partners worldwide we see certain
trends and we want to share that
information with you get feedback from
you and also tell you what we are
building in these areas which can be
helpful or which you could leverage in
your own application development
right so these are the broad trends you
know that serverless there is the
chatbots how everything is moving to no
ops you know pratik talked a little bit
about it and I'll just give you a bit of
more idea on that blockchain how many of
you have heard about Bitcoin oh yeah I
did expect that I should have actually
asked how many of you have not heard of
Bitcoin so bitcoin is powered by this
underlying technology or concept called
blockchain and you know people are
looking at how to implement blockchain
in the context of a business application
and will actually be building something
on that so prety talked about this I
won't talk a lot but serverless to me
looks like Cinderella's fairy tale how
many of you do remember Cinderella's
fairy tale oh well we did go to nursery
together right so in Cinderella's fairy
tale you know the the carriage that
Cinderella is going to be taken to is
created out of the pumpkin right and
then when the party is over
that carriage goes away you know just
like you know it becomes goes back into
pumpkin the serverless looks like that
to me right so you want to invoke a
service and boom the server is created
for you on the fly and as soon as that
execution is done back you know that
particular instances is destroyed that
that's like Cinderella's fairy tale but
let's look at some one other trend what
is the spawning and Prateek talked about
this
this is actually moving developers who
were all the time had moved into DevOps
to look at something called no ops okay
how many things can be automated or how
things are automated so that you do not
spend time or you know your precious CPU
cycles in doing something that probably
should be taken care by automation
right and therefore if you are looking
at service as one of the paradigms what
you're also looking at is this whole
headache goes away of what we have
instance you should pick up you know how
how to run it whether you should know
Linux or not etc etc right so that's the
other trend that we see open source is
the is the third trend that we'd want to
talk about and essentially you would
realize that you know all of us are
consumers of open source but there are
projects that we sponsor FN project is
one of them
Oracle jet is another one which is a
Java Script you know based library that
that's again open source you can build
your applications using oracle jet and
if you are looking at what are the other
projects that we do in containers in
kubernetes etc you could go to our
github page look at the projects and if
you're interested you can join in and
contribute over there
FN project is is today one of you know
one of the most contributed to projects
that we are sponsoring ok all right
let's go ahead now that's the trend from
the perspective of building application
and here's another trend which sort of
you know makes me think
have you really progressed when 4000
years ago Egyptians were communicating
with each other using sign languages or
you know these icons and look what we
are back at right we are back into
emojis so however that's not the lighter
note but on a on a more serious note we
do see trend of applications being built
or front-ends actually changing into
chat bots right so you have this channel
like whatsapp messenger WeChat line
etcetera that people are are more
comfortable conversing with and these
are the channels that then are going and
talking to applications which is a
totally different way of doing
things so generally applications would
mean go to the menu select an item you
know a form comes up enter data and then
you go ahead from there right the the
server processes that particular data
that you've submitted but in case of
chatbot and I'll show you a demo of this
you are conversing with the application
that's a very different paradigm that
defines or that requires different skill
sets different way of thinking how you
are going to design application so this
is another trend that you should you
know you should be aware of I talked a
little earlier about this so a lot of
businesses are not really interested in
you know mining bitcoins or or creating
another currency cryptocurrency but as
the as the frontiers of Commerce and and
you know economy increases as more and
more businesses across borders are
talking to each other without really
knowing whom to trust as a central
authority blockchain becomes a very very
important technology for these parties
to trust each other
okay and I'll illustrate this when we
actually go into the demo that we will
that we'll talk about and then of course
I cannot but not talk about AI nml right
machine learning you know it's not that
it's new if you go back and look at the
whole computing you know whole computing
area ai and ml are something that were
started back in 60s this was one of the
core research area for a lot of computer
programmers that you and I probably know
of but it's not really it hadn't really
gained traction you know beyond the labs
and the reason for that is a you need a
very large data set to actually train B
the machine learning algorithms that was
not available but today that is we are
generating data like tons of you know
tons or gigabits gigabytes every day
and the other thing was this computing
computing power that you need so you
have lot of data you have an algorithm
that needs to run on that data so
obviously you need a lot of computing
power and with cloud coming in that's
exactly what you have available now so
the ml the machine learning is going to
be a trend that you should be aware of
you should look at and you will see more
and more applications more and more
services using them we have an entire
set of you know services that we are
building which we call autonomous
because one part of that autonomous is
to learn from the way services are being
invoked and how it can be optimized so
in fact in our SAS we have something
called adaptive intelligence you
interact with our SAS application it
learns over a period of time runs
algorithms and then gives you a more
optimized way of interacting with that
particular application so this is an
area that is definitely going to grow in
the coming years so what are we going to
do we are going to take some of these
areas so serverless
chat BOTS and blockchain in this
particular case and we are going to
create or show you a demo of how to
create applications in the new world
it's not actually new pratik said that
he has already been running serverless
for quite some time so it's not new we
are still coding we are still writing
applications but what we are going to
show you is a paradigm a different
paradigm of building applications so
what are we what are we going to do we
are going to do a buy and sell cards
application okay and what does that mean
is that we will show you interaction
into this cycle by using chat bots we
are going to show you how this entire
thing can be can be interacted with
serverless
to get you some data about the car being
bought or sold and then where do you
store all this data
in a non reputable way right so here is
here is someone who wants to sell a car
and obviously he does not have time to
you know go into a website and and start
doing finding out you know what's the
what's a good value for his cart so what
he is doing here is he is accessing the
the dealership yr chatbot okay so he's
not going into website typing URL or
doing Google for a dealership a car
dealership he's just using the chat bot
interface to say that he is interested
in selling a car now this is the second
part and the second part is that here is
a developer who is using or who's
created this chat bot interface for
buying and selling cars right and that
that whole development is not really
coding okay so we will talk about how
this particular chat bot is being built
and then this particular chat bot when
you are interacting with it it's going
to make calls into the functions to find
out information about the car is the car
you know what the value of the car is
right so there is a rating agency is the
car involved in some criminal you know
criminal case which you know sort of
brings the value down for the car so
that's that's what the cloud function is
going to do and then all the information
about the actual trading would go into
the blockchain because here there are
two dealerships which are interacting
with each other there is no central
authority that will say oh yeah this
transaction is okay so they are trusting
the technology okay when you sell the
car that's going to make an entry into
blockchain and when someone buys the car
that's going to make another entry into
blockchain and these will be
non-repeatable because the system
ensures that the records cannot be
tampered with okay all right so having
said that this is an overall view okay
and what we are going to do
is show you the the chat interface
remember this interface is very
different than the UI interface that you
usually use that's going to do some
stuff so I'll show you in that demo and
then we have a cloud function that makes
a call and finds out the rating the
information about the car and if the
person is interested it goes makes an
enter into the blockchain and then the
same data is leveraged by the cell
function so with that I will now you
know switch over to to the demo okay so
I'm going to you know change the cable
here give me a second I'm going to hook
up my phone and I also hope that the you
know the demo gods are favorable to me
yeah I should probably say a prayer you
know so this is Facebook Messenger
how many of you are not using facebook
Messenger Wow okay man so what do you
use whatsapp only interesting because if
you are building BOTS whatsapp does not
really allow you to you know make a bot
available it's against their business or
terms of you know terms and conditions
so what we are going to do here is I've
got you know I've already been chatting
trying to sell my car you can see that
so this is Bob's dealership and this is
the chat interface so obviously I'm
going to be very very polite and say hi
okay and well I hope you I hope they're
not okay they're online well it's always
online 24 by 7 so what do I want to do I
want to sell a car okay well obviously
they're happy because you know NAB Achra
and I since they are looking for my
number plate I'm going to yeah you can
say that I've been clicking a lot of
photos
oh yeah they're so send this particular
you know license plate yeah it's it's a
California license plate I do have you
know like moonlighting that I do in the
US can you upload recent picture of your
car yes I can you know I just snagged it
from somewhere one tell where okay that
gets uploaded so if you remember
protects you know presentation he talked
about OCR you know you you upload an
image and OCR happens as a cloud
function so that's that's something
that's happening over here as well so
what you see here is already information
about the card which says it's Alexis
so-and-so and I'm going to go into yes I
want some more detail at this point in
time there's another cloud function
that's being invoked and that is
essentially giving me some details about
the card is this correct yes it is
correct and what's the mileage on the
car so I'm going to give a pretty small
number because this is a new car 1100
well so here is the information against
being being pulled using a function
which says here is what you know a
particular rating agency is telling that
the fair value of the car is but you
know what will give you you know ten
thousand dollars more because it's a new
cards not really used much and do you
want to sell it I'm obviously yes you
know that's has a chadam is why not so
okay so they're happy and they're saying
that you know they'll start off the
documentation so let's now go back
and I hope we have back into
presentation okay probably yeah okay so
how exactly did we create this
particular interface and if you're
thinking that you know we wrote a lot of
code well you are wrong we did not write
a lot of code okay what we did do was we
defined what is called as an intent so a
chatbot is always going to do a certain
set of activities which are called
intents and those intents if you see
over here is written as cell car and by
car those are the intents those are the
things that the bot will understand will
process for you right now
when you when someone says or someone
has the intention of selling car what is
the conversation that they are going to
do with the bot that is what you see in
the examples okay there are certain
utterances that this is what the user is
going to say and by the way we also
support an LP right natural language or
natural language processing which means
that even if you were to give you know
sort of different you know like
different values so instead of cell car
you are saying cell Lexus or by Lexus
Villa it will understand that you
essentially want to sell you know a
Lexus car so that is what's being
written over here and what you see on my
left hand side your right hand side is a
testing panel that allows you to find
out given a conversation is the
intention being correctly found out
right is the bar table to figure out
what the intention is so there is I want
to make dollars of my Lexus now the bot
is confused okay the bot is not sure
whether you want to sell or you want to
buy and what you can do at this point in
time is out of the two intents that are
there which is showing almost same
confidence level
you can select one of them and say add
example and that will become you know
something that the bot learns you know
using the trainers that we have within
this particular bot framework okay so
essentially then whenever you say I want
to make dollars from from my Lexus or
off my Lexus it's going to understand
that you want to sell a car okay so
we've seen the chat bot interaction what
we'll do now is look at the serverless
part and for this I will call upon Shiva
to come and talk about the serval Esprit
Shiva thank you thank you welcome
so a bunch of thanks to pratik for
reducing majority of the introduction
part so FN project as I mentioned put it
back
FN project is a whuppin source project
Apache 2.0 license and it is completely
based line on docker containers and one
good part is you can run on your laptops
you can run on any cloud or any of your
servers and on-premises and another
important thing is working independently
monitors this but we have a
representation in cloud native computing
foundation for a f'n project what is a
function before the Pethick introduced
functions as a service and server less
computing both so less computing I don't
want to give 10,000 definitions as you
mentioned there are a category of cloud
services that abstracts much of the
operations things infrastructure of
operations things deploying the server
provisioning of the servers killing of
the server patching of the server
etcetera so probably from the ops dunno
ops whatever we was mentioning it
what of it and functions as a services
especially the compute portion in the
infrastructure within the service
architecture and function typically in a
mathematical term right we where is a
piece of code which accept multiple
inputs and which can give multiple
outputs probably with a disclaimer over
there that one input at any point in
time maps to one of the outputs now in
FN project couple of components what he
introduced looking typically there will
be a server component FN server which
typically process all the function cards
and within the architecture you could
see multiple other components as well
there will be a queue if you want to
invoke functions in a synchronous
fashion all the function requests will
we uploaded to the queue and there will
be repository which builds here link
between the function versus where the
function curve based or an image is
available is a repository and a registry
where your actual images of your dock
are going to lie there are other
components probably we can dig more and
one of the component that introduced was
FN flow ok we have multiple functions
defined but to build applications out of
the functions we need a different
programming model all together that can
stitch each of these functions and
deliver an application to that so when
we showed a travel application right we
have a booking a car booking a flight
booking a hotel
etcetera everything so indicate any
individual functions they are
self-sufficient functions now I wanted
to need each other to give you a feel of
an application so that is where F and
flow is giving us a opportunity to do
the composition of individual functions
and delivering an application for that
right in this particular use case you
can look at my chart bot interface he is
going to invoke a function to sell a
card so that is going to be one of the
one of the top level functions that
chart what is going to in work but my
composition is something like that
before invoking the blockchain
blockchain service my composition is
splitted with a function flow
architecture in multi dimension here the
initially my root function is going to
call carfax to get more details about
the car if I have multiple cars it has
to image the details for multiple cars
then I want you to do individual
criminal lookup functions means whether
this particular car has any background
of accidents or any kind of illegal
activities that got involved over here
so FBI look up an international lookup
to different functions are there now F
and flow is completely developed with
the Java API
and in especially in Java 8 onwards we
have a complete stage API we can
leverage that FN flow architecture
leverages that come complicities api to
give ase a liar as big a programming
interface for developers so you can see
the invoke function where the future
flow is the route flow is going to be
invoked with a particular thing and that
composes multiple things again it
composes carfax report and criminal luca
lookup and which has a combination of
fpn into International lookup functions
when it completes it goes to blockchain
this is all putting under one code base
you can see the code base here I am just
defining a flow initially that flow is
going to invoke a function called
process a car if I have multiple cars I
am going to process individual course
means I leveraged Java threads over
there then I wanted to compose carfax
and criminal lookup and criminal look up
again it has two different function
International and FBI once everything is
done I'm going to finish the flow or
invoke the other component so I'm going
to give a small demonstration of a
simple hello world function that pratik
has shown in the PowerPoint and later I
will show the demonstration of F and
flow as well okay again small prayer
goes to the demo verse so I just started
events over here I just pressed I just
pre-populated a couple of things to save
the time here so I just pre-populated
the service start part here F in start
then typically what I do here is create
a small function here I'm going to
initiate with a runtime of any
programming language I can go I can use
go language or Java language
language or anything I'm going to give a
name for this button function overkill
code Bangalore function now you can see
it has created a folder called Oracle
code bangla function with a runtime Java
and a complete boilerplate template has
been created now so I'm going to just
going getting into the folder over here
just see this it has a function ml file
and a pom dot XML file especially for
Java if I need to package something I'm
going to leverage here the maven package
manager so form that XML file is been
created here by default and a structure
of your unit test cases with a J unit
and a code base with a simple hello
function has been created now if you
want to see what is mentioned in this
code base now you can just see here what
is it mentioned
hello function which has a method called
handle request which is taking this
particular method is going to be called
when a function is going to invert and I
need to mention about this in the
descriptive file
so whenever a function call comes invoke
this particular function if there is no
input I just get hello world otherwise
I'll get whatever the parameter I am
going to give it and previous previously
mentioned that function retrieves
expects the input in a typical STD in
format and I can pipe any of the STD in
to call the functions and it emits STD
out and any errors that goes to STD
error now another thing is ml file just
see the ml file what it is mentioned he
is my function name version runtime is
this command is invoke handle request
view this is what is going to be invoked
every time I have two different images
here build image and run image typically
when you compile your code base beat any
language hour or go or any language
right you need the complete set of
libraries but during the runtime you can
skim it down to a few libraries
so typically we also follow during the
build of this particular function we use
a different image but when you run it we
load a different image now to run this
function typically I can use FN wrong so
it is going to build an image and invoke
your function now you can see I got the
response here however I'm just in
working locally now if I want to give an
input to this so I can do a simple
piping here Banglore FN wrong
is going to create the image again and
given the response hello gang hello
so what if I want to reach the
dysfunction with my offense server so
that the external component my chart
board can talk to this this pretty
simple a friend deploying I need to map
this function and missed a particular
name one one application can hold
multiple functions together I am going
to give a respect to context path when
I'm invoking it I'm going to give verbal
code Bangalore application and where do
I want to register this I am running my
offence of a locally here so I just keep
local here just to save the time now my
my function image is being mapped and an
entry is created in my repository
whenever I make a call to this I'm going
to get an entry from my repository and
that shows the link to the registry
where my docker image is available okay
Tippie if you want to see how this
particular docker image is being created
I can run this with a verbose you can
see here it is kicking extorting the
creation of the darker and invoking the
function and my daughter goes down
immediately
similarly now I have registered I can
call this with my CLI directly working
code banglar application and with the
context to tears
Oracle code banglar function I can
directly got this I'm getting the
response so similarly piping under the
setter I can do it but if my chart but
wanted to do the invocation typically it
expects a REST API it may not use the
CLI I don't I don't need to install the
CLI or there so in that case I can I can
typically do a curling HTTP colon
localhost this where I have registered
and my FN server is running at 8080 port
and working code bang do application
slash curve bangalore function I can
just make it Paulo I can get that
response this is our chart what is going
to get integrated with my functions here
now let me move to another area and the
where I wanted to show you a bigger
picture of composing multiple functions
and calling this in our use case I have
a code base here you can see it I have a
carfax function I have get our function
probably multiple cars are there for
selling I can fetch it multiple cars and
find CARFAX report for individual
functions right and have a criminal look
up for multiple cause individually so I
can do that
hi how I have a flow component another
function which is going to be my entry
point kick-starting this this flow
component is going to fetch all the cars
and individually execute getting the
perfect report and criminal lookups etc
ok now what I have done is I just
started this within my start script just
started already all four different
functions are running already here what
is there in this start if you want to
have a look at yes
I'm starting individual components
docker images I'm just running it once
all these applications are running now
I'm deploying all the applications each
and every application is nothing but a
function over here it is deployed and an
API is exposed out you can see by car is
a function Carfax is a function criminal
copy is a function and a flow component
is another function this function is
going to call these rest of the three
functions right just to save the time I
just pre-populated ok now if you want to
really see all the functions are running
see here my effing server is running I
have a flow server and these particular
functions have been already registered
now I can call them I'm going to call a
function call I wrapped all these
functions under one application name
work occurred now the flow is the
function that is going to kick-start
rest of the functions now while kicking
this right I have a user interface here
that depicts the invocation of this and
we can see get cars in get cars I'm
going to get multiple cars so two cars
are there the four and seven this is
what Java threads you can see it for
individual function calls a new thread
is coming to cross or cars are there so
individual cars are being processed now
the first car I am getting the Carfax
and criminal look up second car for
Carfax and criminal look up you can see
it so at the end once it is done it is
going to invoke is going to combine all
the reports together and invoke the
appropriate blockchain API now I wanted
to see what happened when I invoked it
let me just zoom down so that I can see
it get cause when I invoke it cause it
written me two different okay it is Jim
I hope you can see it two different
license plate numbers two cars are there
for selling okay and it's going to this
this is being invoked from a main call
now I'll just go up pick up one of the
one of the cars that are being processed
and carfax report of the rest respective
one and you can see the flow here how
this complete stage API is being called
the main call get caused
for the first car then applied then
compose I'm getting into the processing
the car this particular one
okay then compose and generating a
carfax report for this one these are the
functions are being called by F and flow
API okay and respective execution times
etc everything can be seen here this is
pretty much event low
so these resembles you were one of the
design patterns in micro services were
called saga pattern you could count
correlate with the same thing wherever
you can't make a two-phase commit
approach we need within a transaction
right I wanted to book a car hotel and
flight all together if something goes
wrong I want you to cancel entire
itinerary so for that I I have to define
my rollback mechanism or a compensation
ApS so book or cancel car book hotel
cancel hotel so because I can't do a
database transaction of two-phase commit
over there so this saga pattern cause
the respective thing in exceptional
cases is what we are going to do okay so
you want to see the code base of the the
flow you can see here see what I have
done main flow function yes
this is what whatever it is being
depicted in the slides get cars then
iterate over each car and run the
process car so for each car I'm going to
invoke the function here you can see
process car sorry cause this car
for each car okay these are this hope
this is useful oh do you really thank
Shiva thanks for that alright so what
we'll do now is look at you know now
that the server lists has been shown to
you what we are going to see is how this
entire information about transactions is
being managed in the blockchain right so
and we are specifically calling this as
permissioned blockchain because this is
not like Bitcoin where anybody and
everybody who knows how to access you
know the Bitcoin API or used a Bitcoin
API via wallets etcetera can go and look
at all the records right so businesses
do not want other people to come and
look at the records of the transaction
they want to give access to specific
people who can look at these
transactions and then say okay we want
to do a next transaction so that's where
the entire blockchain bit comes in and
what specifically blockchain is all
about if I go next is there are three
things that I wanted to sort of
understand first of all every
participant in a blockchain so you set
up a blockchain network where there are
participants every participants keeps
what is called as their view of the
world which is a ledger and that ledger
has all the transactions right encoded
the other thing is these records are you
know copied over to every ledger in
near-real-time okay and there is a
consents
mechanism by which you order the
transactions okay
so there is no you know proof of work
like in Bitcoin which is done which is
why we talk about Bitcoin mining and in
a lot of computing being put to just
achieve that just achieve the ordering
but here what we do is we use different
consensus mechanisms to get into the to
get the record ordered into the ledger
as quickly as possible and the most
important part that I have been you know
I want to again emphasize on is when
you're building applications which has
parties that do not really trust each
other you know or do not have a central
authority which they can go to so for
example what I mean what I mean by that
you look at the banks in India right the
banks in India have Reserve Bank of
India as a central authority which you
know lays down all the rules regulations
and also enables the banks to trust each
other but let's say you know there is a
shipping company in US and a shipping
company in India how do they trust what
what do they go to yes there is an
International Maritime Organization but
do they really manage you know what's
the reputation of the shipper in India
versus what's the reputation of shipper
in the US so what you do is you set up
as a logistics company you can set up a
blockchain a business Network where
these parties can then do transaction so
we are seeing a lot of use cases and you
might have heard you know off of
blockchain earlier being proof of
concept you know concept that hasn't
really got off the ground but we are
seeing a lot interest now more serious
interest people collaborating and coming
together to build you know various
blockchain networks we are actually
doing some pocs here in India as well
and what exactly are we going to launch
when we launch the blockchain service so
the blockchain service is based on hyper
ledger fabric okay we have joined the
Linux Foundation and special
the hyper ledger fabric project as a
contributor and what we are going to do
when you have the service the managed
service is each of the participants is
essentially called a node and these
nodes are going to have the view of the
world their view of the world which is
the distributed ledger and you will have
an ability to define something called as
the smart contract or chain code now
this is the code that you write to you
know enforce certain rules and
regulations so to say just as RBI does
it for the bank's in India you would use
the smart contract to enforce certain
business rules on the transactions that
are happening and then we have the
ordering service like I talked about
earlier to decide you know how the
records are to be ordered we go a little
closer and then we have an onboarding
service so when you get the participants
a membership service when we you get the
participants now these participants need
to have certain you know security
credentials right at least they need to
give us or give wherever the block the
business network is being set up their
digital certificate so that you know
that that sort of trust can be set up so
there is a membership service to onboard
participants and then there is a rest
proxy so you saw the cloud function in
working blockchain that is why are the
rest proxy that's been made available if
you currently look at hyper ledger
fabric it allows you to interact by a G
RPC so you have to write code which is
you know G RPC compliant but the other
way to do is use the REST proxy so you
can write code in any language that
supports rest you know as as a paradigm
and interact with the blockchain and
then there is an admin console which
gives you an overall view of what
transaction what is the business network
who are the peers who are interacting
with whom etc
okay so let me quickly now jump into so
this is just to tell you you know as a
developer what you would what you would
do which is essentially called the smart
code and this is how the smart code sort
of looks like I won't go into detail
this is golang that is being shown over
here that hyper ledger fabric supports
recently hyper ledger 1.1 has been
released that supports nodejs as the
smart contract language as well right so
so you will have that option I will
quickly show you the you know the okay I
need to go off the let me come out and
switch over to the browser
all right
okay so here is the browser and
essentially I'm looking at the admin
console and I also have to look like
this because I can't really see it over
here right now but if you look at the
dashboard it essentially tells you that
there are three organizations which are
part of this network there are two peers
which are the two dealerships that are
interacting in buying and selling cards
one order
there are channel set up so channels is
how interactions between the parties
happen and what I can do is go into some
of those details so I can show you the
network over here and this is how the
network is those are the three peers or
three you know transacting companies
here are the peers that are working on
behalf of that and we can also see a
list of of those okay these are the
lists right so these are the dealers and
this is the auto company we can
specifically go into channels or rather
into chain code so there is one chain
code that's been installed and that
chain code is essentially running on
over here on the beard so sorry here's
the version and you can see on what it
has been you know it's been installed on
a channel it's also been installed on
the two peers which are interacting in
this particular blockchain just to show
you let's not go here but here so we've
been talking about you know these cards
that are being bought and sold so here
is an example which is essentially
saying that if you want to trace a
record for a particular card you can
just go in so this is using the rest
proxy to invoke details about
transactions what you see over here is
the detail that you saw in the chat bot
when we asked for more details about the
car and what you see on over here is the
detail
of what transactions could have happened
so if I just scroll to this side which
is today you can see there is a transfer
that has happened right so I can also go
so this is right now
five bar or six bar 1 2 3 right no 5 bar
1 2 3 let me just copy that and what I'm
going to do it's currently with John's
dealership I am going to transfer it
so we login as John's dealership ok I
hope I've got that correct yeah ok so
what we are going to do oh no that's
wrong
see this application is pretty finicky
so I have to get that just right so J
ons capital D and we'll login ok so we
are going to put that in over here and
the new owner is Bob's dealership ok and
we transfer the vehicle right so it
shows return code as success let's go
back to trace and do the query again not
even sure yeah so you see the owner is
now Bob's dealership and if I go and
scroll this up I can come right at the
end of this and you will see that there
are two transfers now right so this is
essentially the two records of the
transfer that has been initiated ok so
let's just go back
all right so what you saw is essentially
the blockchain being used for keeping
track of these transactions and you know
how you could have parties which are not
really trusting each other to still do
transactions now this what you saw today
the chat bot you know the the serverless
and the blockchain is all part of the
application development stack that we
have in the Oracle cloud and there are a
lot of other services that you can
leverage to build your application or to
have your application integrate with
other applications or other services and
you can see whether it's the data
management services or the applications
that you want to build host it on
WebLogic in the cloud or run plain Java
PHP Ruby Python etc we have the hosting
platform for all these we can run docker
for you we are coming up with a managed
docker and kubernetes service that will
be soon available you saw the FN fung FN
project we will have a managed service
around FN as well that's coming out soon
as well right so we have been if you've
not heard about Oracle cloud we have
been getting or focused on customers who
have already been our customers on
on-prem and want to move over to cloud
but we are also working with a lot of
startups and you can you know may sort
of meet these startup accelerator folks
that we we have here and with that I
sort of bring close to this presentation
except one thing I did sell the card
right so I'm going to show you the
buying of the card using the chat bot
again and you are going to discover
something that is very interesting so
give me a couple of minutes more
okay yeah so you remember this number
right 385 K right that's what the
dealership told me it will give me and
actually what I'm going to do now is so
I want to buy the car are you okay
so welcome yeah I want to buy car right
so well there are some cars available
here there's an audit as a Cadillac
there's a BMW well I'm not interested in
any one of these I want to buy a Lexus
so remember you know the bot builder
right so now what it's doing here
interestingly is it's telling me that
there are no Lexus's that they have okay
but they will check in the dealer
network and essentially going into the
blockchain and querying why the
functions if there are cars available
which is Alexis and well they do find
one which I had sold earlier so they
show me this Lexus and yes I'm
interested in more details and the same
details are over here so would you like
to purchase yes I'm interested in
purchasing well tell you what you did
see the number right how to you know
parties who are not trusting each other
still come up with a number right I hope
you enjoyed this thank you very much for
being a wonderful audience thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
