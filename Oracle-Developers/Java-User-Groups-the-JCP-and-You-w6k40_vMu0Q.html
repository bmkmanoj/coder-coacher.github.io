okay this stopped uh I'm talking now
okay hey everybody we're back at JavaOne
in Moscone West in the dev lounge I'm
Heather Van Kyra and our interview today
is about java user groups and the JCP
and you how you can get involved and
participated we're gonna hear from our
panel of java user group leaders about
some of the fun things that they've been
doing over the last year in terms of
getting developers and their local
communities involved with the latest
releases so as you know we've had two
major java releases in the last month so
both Java EE 8 and Java SE 9 so all
these user group leaders have made
significant contributions and many have
been recognized as being nominated for
the annual JCP award
so congratulations who are nominees I'm
gonna ask each of you to introduce
yourself quickly quickly introduce
yourself and speak only when spoken to
I'm gonna start with pratik from the
Atlanta jug hi my name's pretty cute o
atlanta joke so I am Mercedes from where
my line represents two communities China
you gong-shil are you I am Jonathan Ross
I'm representing the Chicago Java user
group here
Konstantin something drywall faucet yogi
in Africa broken our fossil bed Bremen
and no jerk but also for Bruno from
Brazil
we got Brazil covered South America's
covered oh oh now forget the best one
Simon maple I represent the London Java
community and the virtual jug virtual
dog was one of the nominations is
absolutely disgraced we wouldn't win
that's all I'll say yeah you definitely
deserve that nomination so that's why as
well just kick it off right there so
virtual jug was nominated for JCP Award
and that was really based on all of the
effort that we put in together over the
last year in the JDK 9 Java SE 9 virtual
hack days so we organized two of those
actually and some of the Java user
groups that are here on our panel
actually participated in those virtually
so Simon why don't you tell us a little
bit about that effort so yes so the
first the first the first session we did
in was in London exactly when that was
it was in 2016 April and we did we did a
six-hour hack day and it was around it
was around Java 9 we did some work
around modules we did some we looked at
j-link
we looked at Jay shell and the idea was
we did a small amount of presentation
but the majority of the time was spent
hacking so we had exercises which are
all open source on github that anyone
can can download and and play with and
the idea was that we actually got the
community to have a look at the the code
the source the samples to play with it
and give that feedback from the
community directly back to the expert
group so we did that with London and we
did that in combination with a whole
bunch of other drugs that actually
joined the virtual drug hangout I think
the first time we did it in London we
actually had quite a few hundred people
online both online and in in various
places around Europe yeah there were
hundreds literally hundreds yeah the
second time we did it we actually went
to in fact Heather was there as well in
London
with with us mani Sark I've deserved a
big shot he's done a lot of work with
this as well in the local user group but
then we also had several Java user
groups join us remotely hmm
yeah they did yeah Iceland was there we
actually had I think c-chug was there
for a little bit of it maybe as well I
want to talk too much about
so what yes so basically you know a lot
of the feedback from the Java user
groups was they really enjoyed that
they'd like to participate it because
the timezone being in GMT time zone that
didn't worked for them so we organized a
second hack day which the Atlanta Judd
graciously hosted so maybe pratik can
share a little bit so we did a java dine
hack day in August and we had our Simon
and Heather there it was pretty good we
had a really good turnout and we had how
many nine other drugs I think that kind
of also we live stream too and we
actually did find a bug or two in the
JDK didn't we assignment at the August
one so it was pretty good everyone
really enjoyed it and and we actually
did something usable by finding some
bugs in the software right yeah that was
cool and actually we also did one in
Chicago Jonathan was there was actually
hosted by IMC so I'll ask you to share
about but the other thing I wanted to
point out about the especially the one
in Atlanta was we were getting so close
to the final release a lot of the focus
on that also was getting ready and how
to use Java 9 right getting ready as a
developer so I think that's also
something that Java user groups can
start to do now since its first coming
out and you could say something in a
minute because we got to move on now to
cuz I already said we're gonna hear from
Jonathan to tell us a little bit about
his hack day well that was back in 2016
or something yeah it was but then you've
kind of followed on with other events in
terms of participating some of these we
had Charlie huntin telling us all about
the changes to the JDK and you were
there 30 people bring in their code and
trying it out in an early this was a
very early release of the ADK 9 we found
a couple of bugs then as well so yeah
it's a useful process yeah well I know
I'm gonna go back to Simon cuz he always
has something to say but at this point I
want to kind of shift to the Java EE
efforts that the Netherlands Doug did as
well so maybe Bert can share with us a
little bit you were nominated for the
jcpoa second year in a row nominee with
the security jsr I believe it was really
the majority of the work that day on
august 11 I thought it was on Friday
while normally on Friday at the end of
the day you're going home for the
weekend right but no they were just
hacking and okay we're working very hard
on it and it was it was a good session
and afterwards we did some events
already in the last few weeks and it was
also very good visiting in the
Netherlands so I wasn't at that once was
my question where were you yeah we're
everywhere but but she will come to the
Netherlands in one month you will come
I'll be there for j4 yeah so that yeah
we are happy now we are now I think busy
now for two years with the HP and roll
it is going growing and it will starting
from or what the heck what the heck did
you do with Jessie P the hack but now
it's changing also in the Netherlands
they want to contribute them on to help
with it and that's the good news
in the Netherlands for DHCP I like this
I'm glad you like it
well so right right as you were talking
about that an idea came by and I see ven
cats in the audience and that kind of
the idea of being everywhere kind of you
know I thought we should highlight here
you know Bank has been doing a
initiative he's calling 5450 so Venkat
come up and do a guest appearance with
her our stage is not full yet thank you
it's definitely a pleasure so I'm
turning and got turned 49 and I'm
approaching my 50th birthday yeah so you
know I mingle with crazy people so my
obviously I came with a crazy thought
and
us to do 50 user groups in the one year
that I'm going to approach my 50th
birthday right and I blogged about it
and within about three weeks I was
overwhelmed God signed about 50 user
groups so I've been traveling in the
world now and as of today I'm done with
16 user groups so we got a really good
schedule going I was in Netherlands a
few weeks ago two weeks ago virtual user
group last week and I looking for
Atlanta in December so I'm thrilled and
I'm just happy to be going around and
speaking right thank you I'm sure that's
a great way for you to be able to visit
so many Java developers maybe that
aren't able to go to conferences and
kind of get them excited and obviously
you're fantastic and amazing speakers so
kudos to you thank you and absolutely
right so I was in Dublin a few weeks ago
and is exactly what they said a lot of
people can't go to these events so
having somebody to come and speak is
definitely touching more lives and
absolutely I'm thrilled to have that
opportunity
thanks again Thanks okay wait wait I
didn't give you that okay now so we have
a couple other Java user groups leaders
and we want to make sure we hear from
them so Constantine why don't you share
with us a little bit about what you've
been doing in Africa in French could you
do in English could you do in English
for me we decision be specification not
last year and it was an informal summit
that we gather some people involve in
our job to make a curtain on this GSR so
it was wonderful for us and has been an
opportunity for us to discover this yes
GCP the GCP is evolving we can and
contribute to Java how we can contribute
to Java's open source and so on all
right now I have not been to visit you
at your jug in Burkina Faso but I have
done a hangout with you and one of the
so virtually we can do that and finally
Mercedes in Guatemala and actually a
guest speaker in the opening keynote of
Java one yesterday why don't you tell us
a little bit about your Java user group
efforts in Guatemala as well
your J touches activities share with us
a little bit about that so I will start
a few it is Duchess yeah Jake gotcha
side are female communities of Java and
it's a way to make a most stronger
participation to females in the java
technology solving that in technologies
and when I said yesterday that is the
way to change the future of our world so
we can make the most the future
generations joined more careers in
science and technology so we are women's
are a role models in our society and we
can inspire people to make things so
this is amazing female power you make
noise make some noise audience okay now
we can first to talk about the JCP so
what a matter now has three Java users
group and I am working with two that I
new ones
I'm we I start to talking then where is
JCP what is that and now in Latin
America with managing Duke and the
equatorial are organizing a hackathon
like that what's happening in Accra
steel rails like this one about our open
JDK right but the idea is the made that
in Spanish right which is amazing and
they're afraid to go because we don't
understand nothing or okay well so we
want to do that in Spanish and make
Morris strongest participation of Latin
America in JCP so I hope that you go
with me I know the chicken pox I'd be
there I'll be there
awesome effort I'm looking forward to
that
alright so we're gonna wrap it up now if
Simon can have 20 seconds to tell us
what he so desperately needed to say
yeah I think this is really important
what I think one thing I will say is
that for a number of years now we've had
communities appear on the EC in the day
CPEC
that's two job and without the OJC and
actually at the hack day that we did in
London the feedback that we got back
from that directly affected the vote
that the ljc provided for the jigsaw
dares ha
in terms of what how communities can
actually impact and and you know provide
information to the JCP it actually
affected the ljc vote so it was an
important data so everybody working
together the java user groups the JCP
the executive committee all the
developers there so I really appreciate
you sharing with us all the efforts that
you put in obviously you dedicate a lot
of your time effort energy attention to
your local java user groups and i think
it really does make a difference and you
can see that from the things that you
shared today so thank you for those
efforts and thanks for joining me on the
interview all right yeah give us some
noise people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
