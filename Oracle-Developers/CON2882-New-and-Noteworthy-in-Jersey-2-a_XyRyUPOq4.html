as in application server group I've work
on project jersey obviously and apart
from that I also work on project tires
which is a reference implementation of
GSR 356 a Java API for web sockets so I
guess you is Wednesday it's Wednesday so
I guess you notice by now by now it
basically says that I might lie and you
shouldn't buy anything based on what i
smite say here so yeah so particular of
this presentation basically Jersey is
quite popular project with quite large
and I hope happy community and this is
sort of a traditional presentation in
which we show what's new what my note
might not be exactly new but is
definitely worth the attention and also
we will have a glance in the future so
just just a short update about Jersey
project for those of you who might not
not know me that well Jersey Jersey is
chuck's RS jax-rs reference
implementation jax-rs the chocolate
jax-rs too is part of Java Enterprise
seven also jersey ships with some Oracle
products like weblogic one two three and
where is a shared library and also as
part of logic 12 12 21 vs. def default
check source implementation apart from
that is also part of class / application
server but this also a default jax-rs
implementation and it runs in on many
servers containers and we also support
some lightweight HTTP servers so you so
you don't do the neck to work you don't
have to run it in java enterprise
container and you don't even have to run
it on its own a servlet container
current version is to dot 22 and just to
put it into perspective last year my
colleagues presented version to just 13
just a little bit of a late about Jersey
as I said jerseys jax-rs implementation
so it it does all the stuff Jack Soloff
says it should do but apart from that it
also has some extra features so just to
just to name a couple of my favorite it
it has integration with some lightweight
containers namely a good jetty HTTP HTTP
server or grizzly HTTP server it also
supports it also provides support for
servers and events which is a protocol
defined in html5 which is used for
sending messages from from the server to
a client which is a opposite direction
that normal HTTP works it has a out it
also has support for mbc templates so if
you like developing applications using
MVC pattern we we provide we provide
support for MVC and some templating
engines and namely freemarker mustache
and JSP but it's quite easy to plug in
your own favorite templating engine we
also have some nice security feature so
if you are unsure z even out of java
enterprise container you are safe we
also have quite nice test framework
which helps for testing and we also
provide some some popular by default
sample libraries for mapping for mapping
java objects to JSON and XML and apart
from that we also have nice up a nice
support for tracing and monitoring
tracing is quite useful if
for in development phase of obligation
if it if something doesn't work as you
expect and monitoring is quite useful in
production environment when you want to
know what your application is doing so
there was just a short update basically
this presentation is not meant as a
introduction introduction to jax-rs or
jersey it's like it's or sort of a
cumulative update what what has happened
in in the project in past year and I
have selected like if the following five
topics which I find interesting and I
also hope you will find them interesting
so we will look at some performance
improvements it will also look at the
veldt I see integration jersey clients
started working on android if you also
we also have a quite nice new sample
which is which shows how to implement
reloading in jersey and also we will
have vivo look in the future what's a
lot of lies ahead in Charles a three so
we take performance very seriously so we
have some performance tests and we are
quite recently v.v constantly work on
performance and we identified some
bottlenecks in Jersey which we managed
to manage to get rid of and so the main
message is that the performance of
jersey is on the rise so this what you
show over the graph shows here is the
performance improvement of jersey in
recent years versions basically it
doesn't show how much a jersey jersey
can scale but it says is a is a graph of
our from our from our testing
environment which we use for this
between to run our performance tests and
it basically the main message is here
that we work on the performance and the
performance is on the rise
as I said a version of jersey presented
here last year was 213 and you can see
that there are some some really
performance improvements in version 215
and 216 and also if you if you compared
with the divide the basic version 2 2
dot oh it's you can see that the
performance improvised are quite
significant but as I said it's not it
doesn't show how much this graph doesn't
show how much a jersey can scale just
like shows that you lay the performances
on the move so if you need a reason to
move a new verse to a new version of New
Jersey I think this is a good argument
for it also we have some real
significant performance improvements in
the era of sub resource locators so just
to for those you who who might not know
sub resource locators just a short
introduction vertical just short
introduction into jax-rs and Jersey
naming basically jax-rs has resources
which is a class annotated with path
annotation it all did this class this
class can have methods annotated wait
get post boot and other method HTTP
method annotations which I'll call which
aisle which are called Tresor methods
and there are also some resource metals
which are basically methods that are in
a resource and apart from HTTP method
annotation they also have path
annotation and apart from that there are
also some resource locators which are
which are methods annotated with pal and
you can notice that there is there is no
HTTP annotation on this method basically
this method doesn't return a result it
just basically returns an object that
will return the result it's not that
obvious why this might be useful on this
hello world example but it's quite nice
future a nice feature if you are having
a larger jax-rs application so I'm kind
of ashamed that this feature had real
little bad performance improve
judge releases and we looked at it and
we fixed it in version 2 216 so
basically what you see here is the graph
from is the previous graph and there is
a new orange column which shows which
shows the performance of of sub resource
locators and you can see that basically
if now it's on par with normal HTML
normal get so if you if you like sub
resource locators and use them you don't
have to get a significant performance it
anymore also there this is what I'm
showing here is not strictly a
performance improvement but it's just
like a something interesting that we
noticed during our performance
measurements if you know Jersey client
it has just asked I canonized fluent api
in client you have you Gareth you have
client and the client you call target on
the target you call reckless or path and
so on and you are basically two types of
configuration you can either configure
you can I drew provide client
configuration forced and some security
configuration or or or some features or
filters and you can also have some
breakfast configuration for sense if the
request should be if the entity should
be chunked or not but also there is the
various configuration on on a target
object which which as I said there is
there's only the two types of
configuration so basically if you use
the configuration methods on a target it
basically Forks a client and and
basically is usages for client with a
modified configuration so it's a nice
feature and it's quite useful that's
five methods are there but you should
definitely not to basically use target
set property 4ever rick fehst because
basically you will that means we will
create a client for every request so
basically what is what this graph shows
is how much how long it takes to
to create five fifty thousand ridiculous
and process corresponding crisp or
corresponding responses and basically
the two large columns are is the case
when you used either target profiter
target property or target register
methods for each york fest so you should
use those methods is quite useful but
you shouldn't do if you use this method
you should catch you you should catch
the result and you shouldn't do it for
every request is just the message of
this slide so there was just about some
performance improvements and like
performance tips and there is quite some
interesting nice new feature in Jersey
which we would like to talk about which
is integration of valdÃ©s see basically
so where's the problem the CD the
current version of cedar is 102 and its
its runtime is a stricter link to a java
enterprise container so some of the
implementations name lame adder france
implement initial dwelt went a little
bit further and they also allow to
bootstrap CDI container outside java and
java enterprise container so basically
that's why i call it the veldt sec
integration because you have to eat some
proprietary code to bootstrap the
container outside java enterprise
container because see I not currently
doesn't support it but if you do that it
actually brings some nice features for
instance types of dependency injection
qualifiers alternatives and so forth and
also you have like a nice features also
interceptors decorators and sir types
also if you know CDI it provides some it
provides some nice it provides some nice
scopes like application scope session
scope and singleton scone cope and also
reckless scope but basically the problem
is that well I see just supports on the
application
the scope and singleton scope because if
you're earning out of Java Enterprise
container it just doesn't know when
we're in the session or requests start
and stop so if you want to use either
reckless scope and our sessions called
outside of Java Enterprise container you
have to you have to basically implement
and manage the life cycle so that's
because request cope is kinda the core
of rest and checks RS we we provided we
provided the implementation of reckless
scope life cycle in Jersey so now you
can use Jersey together with CDI
basically outside java enterprise
content for container for instance on a
graceless server and some grizzly server
and some other servers so just like how
if you don't know how just felt a sieve
works basically you create a valve
container you initialize it and then you
just just you can just use it basically
this this is a basic example of envy
when we annotate just the resource
requests cope which is no that's
tremendously useful because if you know
jerseyville bay by default order all the
resources are request code so just to
just to show that why it might be useful
I create a just a short demo
demonstrating this feature and apart
from the apart from the CDI and felt
integration it also shows some other
nice features like MVC templates and
security and to use the use of grisly
container so even if you are not that
much into CGI you might actually still
find it useful so I just didn't want to
make the demo totally artificial so I
try to make a very small application
that will look a little bit realistic so
I created like an a form form based
authentication sample which is five five
main main classes the decor of the demo
is user class user user beam which is
reckless cope and we have
also to Jersey filters session filter
and application filter basically the
session filter is used to saved say if
the user being into grace recession and
also low basically Lotus user being from
crystallization also we have
authentication filter in this sample
which is which is basically checks if
the user is authenticated and if if they
are not they are directly to our
authentication resource that there is a
basically hello hello resource G which
is just used to basically as a hella
bored sample and the application
authentication resource resource vage
basically when the user is surgically
there it will it will it will serve
multiple serve HTML form using the
Jersey MVC using Jersey MVC support and
also it will it will handle the post of
this form it will check if the if the
user is authenticated if if the
credentials are correct and if the
credentials are correct user is such as
authenticated and the user is redirected
back to the original destination so just
like to to show the basic workflow of
the above this sample we we have a get
request to hello resource then the
session filter comes into play it tries
to load a user basically it injects a
this user bean it tries to fill it then
we go to the altercation filter which
also injects the user bean and it checks
the filter user is authenticated if a
user is not out indicated the dr
undirected do this to our authentication
resource when they are you go to the
authentication resource they are the
direct they are serve it with HTML form
and basically they provided credentials
in the form they post it and we check if
the if the credentials are correct and
then we
go back to the original destination
basically the this demo is not supposed
to show that that how to make make a
form based authentication it basically
shows that it's quite useful to have
Summer Fest cool beans and then we can
inject them into jersey jersey filters
and just the resources and basically it
is the same bin throughout the entire
request lifecycle so just we should show
some code basically this is our model is
not that interesting we have the user
bean they show it which has really holds
a username and the flack office vdr out
indicated we have also a low reckless
scope bean basically which shows which
holds the original destination so we
know where the user can be out there can
be resurrected after the authentication
and also we have some some nice feature
that I also want to show you about
Jersey that basically because we want
the authentication filter to be to be
used only at some resources we can we
can bind some some filters for specific
resource we can use it we can do it
using name by nick annotation basically
in this example we create our own
annotation called from altar dedicated
which is annotated with a metallization
name binding and i'll show it's a used
later basically there's this is how the
this is how to how the session filter
the South obsession filter works its we
have two metals one is called on the way
in which is used to get get a user and
the oil changes changes from from our
grocery session and also we have met
oasis which is called on the way out
which is used to save those two beans
into a session this builds a bit more
interesting BF also authentication
filter we just forks on the way in and
we basically check if the user is
authenticated and if the user is
authenticated
basically do nothing and if the user is
not out indicating they rather than
redirect them to the authentication
resource basically here you can what's
interesting here is that you can see the
use of the form authenticated
authenticated annotation that we defined
on a previous on one of the previous
slides and basically is used to bind
this just filter only to the two-hour
hello resource also basically what
what's this sample is about that we
inject our user that we basically filled
in in the previous filter and it's going
to be the same user is going to be
filled with the data also this is just
basically our hello hello Boris resource
very also in check the user and we have
also here the annotation for
authenticated that means that the
authentication filter will be will be
applied to two to two days to this
resource and this also shows how you can
use the jersey feature basically we we
have we return a viewable which which
points to a free market template and we
use a job a java map to a bind variables
to this template and the end we have
also the the out indication
authentication resource which only
serves the authentication form and also
it processes the submitted data and it
checks if the if the user is is
authenticated and if they are directed
back to the original destination
basically just to show how the
application is bootstrapped it's like ah
it's not it interesting but just
basically show that is so now just like
basically quick demonstration how it
works
so basically you can see that we try to
access the hello resource but we were
resurrected to the application for
because the the user is not
authentication we indicated we can just
submit the object authentication form
and we are basically the credentials are
accepted and we are directly back to the
original destination just just to show
that it actually works basically the
purpose of this demo is new to show that
how to create a forum based out
litigation but it's just I just tries to
show that is quite useful to have a weld
weld sub and CDI support even if you are
running on some a lightweight for Taylor
and it also demonstrates some nice
features which might be interesting for
Jersey users so let's move to a large
topic basically Jersey has if you use
Jersey you know that it has some nice
client which is quite useful it has is
quite powerful and as it uses fluent api
it's basically if you use rest-frame
boards they usually show how something
force on a server but in rest
environment basically having a powerful
client is as important as having a
powerful server library and and Jersey
Jersey client has some nice nice
features like the fluent api you use use
or on the previous slide it has some
security features like the basics that
every kind should have like SSL and as
the basic authentication but also is
like it supports or authentication and
other security features it also has
various data bindings like the server
side it also you can register filters
and what's also interesting that we
support directive we have reactive
extensions which is something that I
want to explain
here but it's it's it's the I've another
presentation in after and about it and
it's nothing is quite interesting so if
you actually if you actually like the
Jersey client you actually know that
some u.s. Jersey users try to run to
Jersey client on Android and quite until
recently it didn't work the reason for
this is a jetta jax-rs is and transit
level jersey are tightly bound to j
sigsbee which is a framework used for
mapping java classes to xml and it's
part of jdk and it's of course not on
the android so basically the judge the
client wouldn't work on Android until
quite recently but quite recently we
will be moved the jig's be into a
separate modules so now the core and the
client are free of jigs be so it's we
are basically we are very close to be
able to run judge the client and on on
Android but the problem is that there
are still some references to some
classes which are not part which are not
on Android namely Jersey has Jersey has
bright writers for different righteously
transform java classes in two different
different binary representations and one
of the one of such a writer you is used
for youth for handling images and it
uses some classes in jdk that are not in
android so basically just there's may
may be something virtual attention if
you actually consider like running
jersey on android there is quite nice
tool which is part of jdk 8 which is
called jaidev's basically shows all the
dependencies of your project its main
purpose is to
because this match is to show if your if
your if your application it can run on
some contact profiles which are part of
the JDK 8 basically GDK have some web
combative profiles like bank compact one
compact to and calm part three which
reached our dirt so you can you can use
Java on smaller devices but basically
how this relates to Android the truth is
that not directly but if you if your
application uses dependencies on compact
one and compact to usually good but if
your application has dependences to full
fuller runtime it means is usually means
that it won't be able to run on Android
and this is the same for the Jersey
client because we have this references
to do image classes from JDK so
basically not everything is lost because
hk2 which is a dependency framework used
by used by Jersey internally has some
nice feature which is which witch is
which can be used to unbind some methods
so basically if if you don't use this
and if when the first response arrives
to the client the client tries to load
all the available writers and a magnum
that'll be the image writer of each
which you won't be able to load because
because there is has some dependencies
which are not on Android but you can
work around it using this feature which
you will basically unbind this this
writer so when if you are on Android
basically yeah and and use this feature
and judge the client I asked for all
available writers of the old writers
except those you you unbind will be
returned so the client will work so this
is just
to show if you actually really want to
run around jersey on android this is
basically how work around how you can
how can do it so also but some some of
the frameworks support dynamic hot
reloading of classes which is quite
useful for instance if you are
developing web applications and like me
you are not you you need 10 goes to to
make a working working of web
application and it saves a lot of time
during development so basically as many
users actually asked if we if we added
this feature did you like hot deployment
in New Jersey and basically the answer
is B we haven't hit p heaven at it is
this feature but we provided a I think
quite useful sample which shows how to
how we can basically create your own
reloading framework just in on a couple
of lines just to just to give you a
suggestion how it can work Jersey has a
standard feature which is called loading
and it is can be used to reload Jersey
application with a bit different
configuration and basically you can you
can is very short step to actually
implement your own working hot reloading
because you can use this feature to to
register register a service develop out
your your sources and and if the sources
change you just reload you just reload
jars application the problem with this
is that if you just load the application
like that Deb
vacations are still use the alt classes
so but you can use a little bit of a
class loader trickery to basically force
Jersey to use a chain to change classes
it's just example basically suggesting
how you can do it and basically what's
left is you if you detect the some
classes change you have to use a
compiler to compile them and provide
them to your to the class loader showed
on a previous slide and yeah just just
to show how it actually works basically
in a sample this is part of just a
project we have we have this
demonstrated on application that shows
like arrivals and departures of flies
and this is one of the resources and
basically I can modify this you know in
a text file and
I can also like a tea new methods
shoot for work hopefully oh yes
sorry oh yeah true it's like I'm merely
a ID user so programming it in tex
territories i just find my using the
text editor basically to show that you
collie balls like that i'm not using any
other plug-in or something like that
yeah basically as I said is the digital
demonstrated actually on this sample
actually demonstrates that on a couple
of lines you can implement your own hot
reloading and it's apart from it being
quite nice toy it is quite useful if you
weren't as I said forces if you if you
use jersey for for web application
development and you constantly the
change are constantly changing the pages
so let's look in the future of Jersey
too yeah sorry yes basically yeah that
the sample I showed it it was using
grizzly so yeah it was it was an
application server but it should work
very similar it as i said the sample
it's like just like do you give you a
suggestion that it's not that hard to
implement and you can just take you the
sample it's like just couple of lines of
code and you can modify to do to your
needs so as I said let's look in the
future quite recently we started working
on jerseys three it's basic basically
what we have now on the master and the
branch of Jersey to one of the one of
the purpose of just the three is to
implement a jax-rs to two dot one which
is still work in progress but it's
supposed to have the following three
features one is non-blocking i/o which
I'll get to in more detail later it also
brings SSE support which is which is not
that interesting in Jersey context
because we already have sse into
implementation so we will just basically
align our implementing ship into api
provide defined in jax-rs but it's also
is well
bring some nice support for rocket
programming and also to adjust the three
will heavily rely on Java 8 features
which equally needs by now because we
integrated into projects which you which
use Java 7 so basically from now on our
API will be more Java 8 friendly and
also just to also just mentioned
relation between Jersey too and just
three the jars of Anna sorry Jersey van
and Jersey to wear two different
projects and the jersey to is not
backwards compatible Avengers Devon but
the relation between Jersey to and
jealousy is going to be different it's a
basically still the same project but and
it's going to be back force compatible
so I just want to focus on one of the
features which is the awesome the
synchronous i/o as I said is it still
work in progress but I just want to want
you to give you the idea what it is
about basically Jersey and chester has
already have some some a synchronous
features as you can see on the example
basically it's you can suspend chargers
the request so it's quite useful for
instance if you have a service a which
calls service be and you don't want to
block a threat on the service on the
surface a until the reply reply from
service via arrives so what you what you
can do is just suspend direct bus on
Jersey a on the server on the service a
and when the vendor vendor reply from
the B arrives you can just resumed the
resume direct vez so the despite useful
but there are stumps adjust to some
strictly synchronous asynchronous API
still in Chuck's RS and transit to the
in Jersey and its name I 0 because the
i/o in jax-rs still is built around good
old input and output streams from JK one
so now just basically the the input and
output stream are quite nice nice
abstractions but the problem is that for
instance on the input stream if you read
into if you read entity you you just
call the person's you get methought and
if they are data available it will just
return immediately but if they are if
the entity is still on the wire it will
block until the until the DAR more data
available the problem is with this is
that threats are quite expensive and
sperrys sparse resource on a server for
sense I think average average linux box
can support life between 5,000 and
10,000 life threads which is threads
that occasionally do something so
basically this means that if you are
using a blocking blocking I owe you can
you can only have like between 5,000 or
10,000 requests requests or responses in
progress that's quite bad for the for
instance if you are if you are using
large entities or if you are streaming
entities so basically a servlet theta 1
answer this problem a solid answer this
probe answer this problem in version 3
dot one where it provided some way how
to how to use i ah synchronously just to
show and just to show this on an example
on the server but you can you can
register a wreath listener which has
method on data available and also on a
thought on illiterate and on Earl but
basically the method on data available
is called then a new data arrive and
also the input stream has a method
Israeli which will return to true if
there are some draw some data available
and for false if they are not so
basically what can you do is when this
when the callback one data available is
called you can just loop until drive
data ready and treat and you are sure
that this read one block and if the the
method is ready returns false just just
leave the method and without blocking
and when more data are ever more data
are available the on data available
metal they will be called again so just
as this is just just for illustration
how servlet servlet handle handle this
problem it doesn't say that jerseyville
handles problem in a similar way is just
like foreign stration and as I said
checks rs2 that one is still work in
progress but it will use probably use
some very similar very similar approach
so why try to use blocking IO
non-blocking i/o basically as i said the
plucking io is perfectly fine as nice
abstraction is much simpler to use but
if you need to need the extra
performance boost its you just have to
just to use the non-blocking i/o and as
i said also quite useful for this is
especially useful for large and streamed
entities and we unfortunately the
Chuck's RS due to that one is still work
in progress so we can still implement
this API but we start at least we
started like preparing for it for
instance we created a new client
connector which will replace our default
which is currently to http royal
connection with from the jdk and already
this connector has even as much better
performance and httpurlconnection well
which is recurrent current
implementation so at least so even did
even though this if you are still not
ready we are we started working on PSP
we are preparing for for it and yeah
basically that's it so that's all do you
have any questions yeah yeah it can
basically the examples I used here they
did it they were run totally out of java
ee container we have the examples use a
project grizzly which is like very nice
and lightweight a HTTP server and
basically yeah the equities answer say
yes you just start the server and you
but you give it to Jersey class and
we'll run it for you ah unfortunately it
depends on the jax-rs two dot one so it
is this is more like the question to the
jax-rs jax-rs talk be army we hope it'll
be soon but we are just basically we are
waiting for for the API we wanted to be
soon and yet yeah
retries no it doesn't because it is i
think it's like quite complicated
problem in the rest general because like
forces are some metal that that you
should i guess you shouldn't retry like
post so yeah you know it currently don't
have video we don't have support for
give me like integration with single
sign-on
yeah wonder if there's a way you know
unfortunately i'm not familiar with this
so yeah I already can't answer this but
yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah basically
what was that you you basically just
obtained a token from from yeah and
basically you just include the token
video video requests so basically we
have support for it in a client that
will basically just at the at the token
automatically so basically you don't
need anything else an especial support
for that i don't i'm not sure if if i
get put your aunt asking but that you
don't need service support for for all
the work or yeah it definitely is you
should check it out we have evolved
model and support and we have also it
documented nice documentation about it
and and also my colleagues last year i
think they here they had talked as the
dicto dedicated to outline in jersey so
i think it's out there on a video so you
can check it out and the documentation
is on jersey website but the video i
think you can find it like in java java
one for the 2014 nose up like that
yeah p.m. we support some you know like
the basic authorization framework from
from the from Java Enterprise if you
know like the the annotations I don't
know admin and stuff like that so yeah
but yeah
I don't know if you'd answer your
question but oh yeah i forgot to talk
about it basically the there is nothing
used in in tracing but we improve the
monitoring mainly in the performance is
really lower much lower in footprint now
but basically jersey monitoring there's
like how to say dislike events that are
or probes which are in in in jersey and
give like some basic implementation that
just collects the basic statistics and
because because of the memory and stuff
like that we can collect all the useful
data but Jersey also supports basically
you can plug in your own listen to
certain events and it's quite it's quite
so it's very easy to do so basically
like that you can get almost like
jerseyville tell you almost anything
about its runtime like that so if you
need to monitor something special or
some some special event you can just
feel like use your own you can implement
your own listener which is very very
easy you can do it like that as I said
we can really like provide all the
statistics because useless gives us like
basically kill the server oh yeah you
get you can check the documentation is
any more questions
library doing
oh yeah vb basically we have we provide
to integration with many libraries worse
than jackson yeah so we basically draw
like there is a jersey core and jersey
client and Jerry server but apart from
that we have like modules for like many
many type many binding too many
frameworks like as I said Jackson one
and two and stuff like that yeah yeah we
be the BU smocks it and basically the
advantage of moxie is that it's
basically implemented but our colleagues
in oracle so we have like very nice
support for it so it forces if there is
a park or something it is fixed
extremely fast so i guess i guess
there's a menu is if you want to use
miss moxley any more questions
okay so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
