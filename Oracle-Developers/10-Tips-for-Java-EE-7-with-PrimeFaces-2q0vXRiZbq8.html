martin today we're going to talk about
the java ee sides jsf to that too and
prior cases we selected third tips for
you guys to show the latest version of
prior cases and the latest version of
GSF i am working as a consultant for
turkish telecom companies located in
Turkey I'm laying in Turkey and Martin
is deep and talk about sphere certified
and I am Nathan's developer and Oracle
and I'm from Czech Republic brown so Joe
e7 released in june with lots of
features like the latest version of GSF
GSF to dot 2 and 4 with jax-rs to that 0
if you are doing rest service
implementation servlet 3 that one and
JPA 20 to that one and lots of stuff so
Joseph to that tree is now shipping with
its lots of cool features that we are
going to show today also like html5
Frank markup or faces flows or or like
file upload components and etc and now
we are releasing VD the candidate lives
on primefaces primefaces for that whole
code names and now and will be releasing
the prime basis for that after jalwa so
i am going to also show you about the
latest features features of parameter
sites and will be domain all of all
these stuff of on NetBeans we put
prepared some sample applications for
you and they will be all working on
glassfish for that oh so II say one is
more focused on the html5 sites to bring
more productivity for developers to meet
the enterprise demands and for yourself
to dot to as I said html5 front America
faces flows and resource library
contacts are
well the big tickets and they're
implanted transshipped with JSF 22 so
how many of you are using privates
couple yeah it's good for those who
haven't heard about the prime faces it's
the GSF component library its supports
the GSF to that X now and GS F 2 dot to
version will be support the practices
for that Oh virgin it's brings it
contains over 100 UI components it uses
jsf to API is on the south side and
jquery paris on the client side and they
work seamlessly it's very lightweight
it's zero configuration you are just
adding your maven dependency for
instance to your project and you are
getting to make primefaces jar it's just
two megabytes it's your lightweight it
doesn't have any required dependencies
so you don't need to add another
dependency for running primefaces it has
optional dependencies like if you want
to do a PDF export you need to use the I
tags or if you want to do an exercise
that exporting to the Jakarta poachers
and etc it's well documented I am also
the author of privacy cookbook we have
three books now we have the user guides
we have the forum forum reached around
at 100,000 post now we have a large and
active community I can say that so we
are using netbeans marketing is doing
netbeans element actually he's the guy
developing the netbeans it's an open
source ID it's also supports PHP c++
groovy and with latest features they're
focused on java ee side java SE side and
you can also do html5 client site
development or you can develop a native
application with html5 and CSS using the
Apache Cordova project that means it is
bundled with lots of features so for all
the
the sample codes we used get up you can
just clone the project for kit it's it's
in the Indies Arab so I am heading out
I'm giving to talk to Martin he will
focus on the JSF 22 site and I'll be
focusing on the private side so we have
around 55 minutes to go over 10 tips it
will be a challenge for us I guess ok
hello again so html5 friendly markup is
the first step first feature we will be
giving here so what is this feature
about it allows you to specify chess
have a tables directly at the plain HTML
elements and also you are able to
specify jsf attributes sorry custom
attributes at Jessup components during a
feature is much cooler than my
explanation we will see it in English
samples it's yeah I i will explain it in
samples for this purpose was created two
new namespaces one is used for the
pastor elements and the second one is
used for pass through attributes the
advantage of this feature will be that
you are able to create custom components
which are missing in the HTML
specification without creation of your
GF components so you will be able to
make your Java scripts and jsf codes
together also you are now taking control
over the rendered HTML source up to now
everything was everything was dependent
on the outer of the jsf component now
you are able to pacify your cost custom
attributes so I am going to switch to
the first example and before showing
them I would like
to remain I would like to say that we
will show just crucial parts of the of
our samples so feel free to clone the
repository and go through 30 tips there
so i will i will show you i will show
you how to new namespaces works so here
ok i will can you see so this is jess at
prefix which is bound with the pass
through pass through elements namespace
this namespace is processed by the tech
decorator which is turning this plane
input element into the GSF component and
then this component is processed by the
jsf lifecycle it means that i am getting
an advantage of the JSF validation in
this example over just simple HTML
element so yeah the validation works the
second namespace I mentioned was passed
through attributes for pass through
other books so it's it's bound with this
prefix with the path prefix and it's
handled by render cake and the render
kit go through these all attributes and
pass them down to do a render at HTML
source so you can see that when i switch
to the HTML source the attribute i
spencified there is pass it down to the
HTML it was not possible before so now
let's show how to use it in real
applications how to leverage this so
actually this select one mental
component is a kind of my custom
component because it's it it uses
javascript / that for turning my texture
option either
to do images so i got jsf components
with the javascript adapted you can feel
it is Jessa and JavaScript
interoperability which was never been
possible before there are in the sample
there are more things to show but I will
move to the next topic and you can take
a look in the into samples in the kill
hub repository so the second tips for us
for you is a resource libraries
contracts contracts are basically
looking few libraries which are which
can be used across your web applications
and you could define in this way
standard the reusable look at your
library their libraries it consists or
it can consist from templates insertion
points and static resources like images
style ship style sheets or JavaScript
and such bundle can be placed as a as a
directory inside the documentation root
of your web application or on the
application class part as a library when
you have this done you can choose a
contract to be used in following three
ways right now there could be only one
options to be chosen there is only one
wallet path for the for the contract for
the template path second option is that
you are able to define it statically or
dynamically into the view element of
your facelet and the third option is URL
mapping inside the faces configuration
file this has one limitation that you
are able to define only statically your
contract you are not able to use
expression language in the faces
configuration file but we can hope and I
believe that this should be broken with
OJ
203 this limitation should be removed
and you will obtain not just this but
also parameters for it for your
contracts and also inheritance of them
so this will this should lead to do more
complete booty templating systems then
already today I would like to show you
that some kind of multi temp I think you
are able to use in the endo jesús to
the tune by the way these slides are
available in the repository as well so
just the link is enough so let's move to
the second sample okay and this is the
simple usage of the resource a library's
contracts i am using in my employ
facelet sorry facelet client i'm using
this parent template this template is
not defined you could see that it's not
defined in my application the
application documentation rule instead
of that it loaded from the contract from
the directory contract / some simple so
this is yeah this is this is real really
simple so how to use it in your
application and sorry and how to how to
leverage this feature this is pretty
straightforward usage of the feature i
am able to switch to completely
different look and feel by by sending
this form it's not just coloring of the
of the template it's completely new
layout and how this could be done you i
have i have defined one simple setup in
this setup in holds an information about
the RLC which was chosen here so you
there can be stored RLC one or are
see to property and this this
information is used in the contract
attribute of the view 11 so the view
element switches before between these
two contracts between contracts / RLC
one and contracts / RLC to need to
mention that contracts is the default
directory for the work you place your
contracts so it's which is just RLC one
or RLC tomb and as you can see the
template has the same naming so I'm
always using RLC dot HTML file but this
view component differs between the
correct contract actually let's imagine
that you have that you have in your
application bundled this contract as a
jar library you are able to bundle your
look and feel across all your
applications and the switching of your
Lucan field is done by switch of the jar
on the on the glass pan so you can do it
birthday quickly yeah and start forward
I think so let's move to the to the next
step called expression language as you
know the specification extend a little
bit which change the possibilities of
this language actually significantly I
could say because yeah this is this is
what about this like special language as
you know it's a mechanism for
communication between presentation liar
between templates and theor logic and
basically it sets that gets data invokes
methods so you probably use it you need
to use it I think so let's let's skip to
the features immediately let's show it
to indy in these samples in the third
our sample application so okay this is
this is
the first big one feature that you are
able to use standalone expression
language processor now it's not
compatible with the 22 API but you are
able to use both this API now as you can
see these strings are defined somewhere
it might be not not important but on the
in the right column you see evaluated
value from the my new expression
language processor this can serve to
test your web applications better
because you are able to evaluate your
expressions expressions in your tests in
example or you can also adapt your
environment as an expression language
and you can register your custom IL
resolver or radial manager into your
expression language processor now let's
speak about operators especially semicon
and assignment operators are pretty
important for us the first one enables
more statements inside one expression so
of course you you will not get written
from all these statements you will
obtain written just from the first last
one and remaining are thrown away but it
can simplify your temples I think and
secondly the assignment operator is able
to hold your values which are which are
evaluated in your template or it can
even hold an a reference for the lambda
expression which I will see you later
now I'm going to skip these two features
which you can find in our repository and
i am going immediately to do lambda
expressions and collection operations
both these features I have to say that
they are fairly aligned with the Java
ACA
it means when you will learn how the
stream API or lambdas works in the Java
CA you are able to use it in the
expression language 300 and vice versa
it's it's great as you can see lambdas
can be resolved immediately or can be as
I mentioned before reference by yell
variable and then called as a metal I am
NOT I don't need to call it immediately
in the same expression I'm able to call
this method / vol face lab the third
option how the lambdas can be used is
the most useful I think because you are
able to pass lambdas as the arguments of
the methods so it's just useful in
collection operations where I am able to
specify my mapping mapping function for
my list or reduction instructions for
for this list yeah and as you can see
the collection operations consists of
most of stream API methods so here are
big help mines which will simplify your
present controller liar or templates a
lot so now let's imagine that you don't
need to wait for the Java CA you are
able to use it already with java SE 7
and especially which filtered Oh takes
care about everything about the
translation that's great you can play
with lambdas already now in the java
applications okay now i would like to
switch to another topic and get back to
it so let's do some prime time with
private companies so we have as a as I
settings in the beginning we now have a
rounded compound
in the brown faces component library you
can find anything for doing adult web to
web application development from complex
data tables 2 333 s the three tables the
charts and etc we are using DJ set to
Ajax API is on the client server side
and on the client side we are using to
jquery we are we have an extensive
teaming capability we have like 40 teams
based on a jQuery UI and you can also
build your own team team roller and with
further at all we are introducing now
cool features like the client side
validation I think it's the first class
support for the Jessup component
libraries you can just enable the client
side relation with a context parameter
in your web.xml and the all the world
nations all the GSF built in both
nations the conversion and validation
will be done on the client side it says
its server sites compatible they are
being connected to process relations and
run the response faces in the pure
JavaScript its support the partial
processing you can just say that these
two components should be validated at
the client site with JavaScript as you
says as you say in the Ajax update like
process these components and updates
components we support the localization
we support the beam validation buying
annotate your beans properties like at
patna or s size it will be one dated at
the client site with pure JavaScript I'm
gonna do a couple of them on that we
have the dialogue framework now we can
just open an XHTML page by specifying a
jsf outcome you don't need to eat in a
dialog box we don't need to define the
dialogue within your page you can just
say that this speaks HTML page should be
open in a dialogue and the debt that
dialogue could be model could be
resizable or not you can just give
parameters we now support the redirect
redirect rock we can just direct nodes
between the trees by putting them in a
in the same scope and we have default
loading if you have a big page you can
just stick it into the pieces and you
can just say that this part should be
loaded after the page gets loaded so
let's go and show some samples
so this is the complex data table with
client side validation I have from here
and this is the complex data table if
you haven't used primefaces before this
table definition you can just let me go
to the code you can you can just say
that enabled pagination enable the
filtering it appeal turd values like
filter by model for the model column and
you can just say that on the row select
update the form show up a dialog box for
the selected for the selection and etc
let me empty this stuff so i have none
ajax comment button here if I click the
it field the class a tradition in gets
invoked and you can just see that all
the validations for the for the tooltip
we are now using a form for forms like
show all the message or let's show it
like a tooltip or you can just chug it
like an icon or show just the text so if
I just input some stuff for a fancy car
it does a postback say none ajax call
and i am here that i am adding the cars
to the to the model open up with the
middle click so what happens here is I
have the input text with a required true
attribute iron input.text with a
well-laid longridge validation and for
the manufacture I also have the required
validation but for color I don't have
anything on the on the page so when I
navigated carvajal you can just see that
it's annotated with the bean validation
and it's yet it gets related on the
client side seamlessly so for having all
these you need to enable the context
parameters prophecies that client side
of volition to true and we did the
release candidate so we can just grab
the latest for that oh sure and you can
just use it I also did that measure up
with autocompletes and maps you can just
use parentheses autocomplete components
and you can look up a place like San
Francisco and you can update the map to
that place by adding a marker primefaces
components works seamlessly you can just
oops say that I am completing the
address from here do an update on the
item select for the map components and
this is the map component
you can do you can use over 100
component and you can integrate all of
them together so the three drag drop now
we can drag and drop oops the nodes of
the tree is between each other like
oops
so to enable this it's in the photo
version now you need to say that this
the first three is draggable and the
second is the first 3 o's also drop a
boot and you are defining a direct drop
scope like demo and when two trees have
the same scope or you can use multiple
trees and if you enable the
drag-and-drop ability you can just drag
drop nodes between the trees no lag and
for the dielectric now I have two
buttons here that execute and managed
bean method if I click the view table I
am getting with me
there's a problem
from the president
from the resolutions
okay so opening the page is just like we
have the request context getting an
instance of it and just saying open
dialogue with this outcome it's said
that data table complex topics HTML it's
doing in this navigation and while
opening the page you can just say that
it should be model it should be
draggable resizable or the content ID
should be this could be a problem should
it should be this so to enable this you
need to define some stuff in your faces
config.xml you need to define the action
inner and negation under and the view
hander coming from the prime basis so
you can have your page now open dialogue
instantly in your inner project and we
have some cosmetics
I should okay let's go to the scroll
tables perhaps now we have the scrolling
tabs now you can jus bottom and top
orientation camera started last two am
reasonably start to class Russia yeah of
course I emptied into okay so these are
all coming with the practices for that
oh we have lots of other stuff
implemented it's all backward compatible
if you can just upgrade from tdot 524
that work the main may a major change is
the new many model you need to do some
extra stuff on the menu module
implementation but all the other stuff
are backward compatible and you can just
upgrade your jar
No
good
there are many applications you know
it's time to be stacked up 13 or maybe
pending applications and we could just a
restart the application yeah we have the
sticky feathers now can just go through
that okay
so these are all from the prime time tip
and project for the teams as I said we
are using jquery UI and team roller CSS
framework we support skinning and
structural stages architectures places
if you're like a comment button on an
accordion and I can say that they have
Dale they both have the dot you I State
forward see a style sheet and if you
just configured that style sheet the
holler about the button the hole for the
button and the home for the accordion
will change so it's the skinning is
based on the jQuery right for the
structural stresses I can say that the
pick list using the dot you are sortable
and it enables the drag and drop on the
picnics items you can just modify the
structural CSS by using jquery I
infrastructure so Tim roller also
provides a visual editor to create a new
teams it will be better if you want to
create a new team you can just grab a
existing team and try to modify it 40
teams are available by you can just add
a maven dependency like primefaces team
and you can find all the teams we
defined all the things image or anything
you can just let that jar and use it and
we are also working on commercial teams
we now have the Metro UI team match it's
been John the material CSS and the team
configuration is done as I said in a you
can just configure it to the context
parameter in the web dot XML
so let's go and show some
I did the mash up a lot of components
here and I can just change the team from
here to please sir to Casablanca or
eggplant and stuff like that all the
things will change here and now we have
the do you have the material ok the
metra lighting and default theme is our
Easter and privacies shipping with our
store you don't need to configure
anything to get the other stuff so for
the configuration you can just grab the
team's as I said in one jar like or
parenthesis teams all teams and you can
just define a specific things you like
and in depth art is a man you need to
configure you can configure like
primefaces that team space RESPs 15 like
bootstrap
and we have some spin-off projects like
prime you I the prime push and the prime
mobile mobile so we are working very
close with the Jean France archons the
leader of atmosphere framework and we
integrate the atmosphere framework into
primefaces with the prime push be named
prime push you can just do it a
synchronous web application
implementation on the server side and on
the client side with just primed push it
supports the web sockets long polling
string and JSONP a prime area is a spoon
of project for our four hours we
gathered G JavaScript's and prod
produced JavaScript widgets from the
prophecies you can just use the widgets
and reading your html5 or css3 project
without using djz I'm going to show you
a data table bind to rest service it's a
prime it will be a primary data table
and prime mobile we have a customized
components for the mobile devices you
can use the prime mobile project we
support iOS android blackberry and all
the other major companies major
operating systems on the browser side
it's powered by jquery mobile so let's
the demo with prime push and prime guy
so
push
the surra
very special
see
chemed Aristotle application which one
go me out five yesterday
so this this application was running
yesterday just fine and so it breaks all
right just for the presentation it's
usually any questions so far I'm going
to go with the brownish button example
so here you have a map and we have our
input I can just say that you just
checks in here so when I click the check
in i'm getting i'm updating two
components with my existing key points
so here let me can we open up in any
browser and another rosary
firefox
I'm going to the same page
I'm not like English by checking here
and my chicken gets pushed to the
browsers that connects to that page so
let's go under the hood in this in this
one so I have a map here sorry I have
map here and i have p circuit components
that creates that connects to a child
named checking and on that man i receive
a match the message on that channel i am
invoking the handle message javascript
so within the javascript i'm just
putting a marker on the on the check in
place by adding a title and saying you
can just check in here so forth on the
beam parts where I on on the client side
so sorry on the external parts i am just
where i clicked it comment button meets
with this action listener I am just been
working to checking and within the
check-in I'm just getting a push context
and I am pushing a torturer an instance
of checking to that channel and checking
is just a dummy project titled latitude
and longitude so you can just push
messages to your web sockets or long
streaming or jsonp whatever the
infrastructure you need to go of it you
can just push that data to the browsers
that connects to your your application
so primefaces seamlessly provides the
prior push using the atmosphere
framework under the hood and atmosphere
to dot all version will be raising I
guess I think it's released on 22 sep
tember and purposes for that all will be
compatible with the prime basis atmos
to doubt over so the for using this you
need to define the option fancy that
much for a long time and for web dot XML
you need to do some configuration on the
push solid size for having for enabling
to prime push and if you are running a
nap on a proxy you might need to define
the prime push server URL it's matt it's
sometimes problems occur on the on the
jet sides this all the commanding the
user light so should we try it just in
again can we try it let's start okay
let's go let's give a redescription okay
come on out stop okay Martin's tricks
from here thank you okay Jeff is Jessica
falling it would be a little bit
different kind of the feature because
it's provided by the NetBeans IDE i
would like to mention in advance that
NetBeans IDE is I think really suck for
prepare for the java ee 7 if you if you
do a survey over the market you will see
that the support from netbeans ide for
the java is 77 it's really thoroughly
huge so about the scaffolding the
initial idea for such feature was to
create scaffolding of an application
from database to illustrate how to use
java ee technologies together this this
feature was politically improved and in
this last version you can of course
generate facelets of course you can
customize them but also it's able to
generate CDI artifacts on places where
it's suitable I would like to show you
that we have in the IDE jsf pages when
your pages vanilla Jesse pages
generation generation but in the plans
for the 80 is generation of the prime
faces pages directly so we will be able
to generate in two or three actions
complete primefaces of the application
from the from the database I will show
you now that such feature is already
available in the older versions of the
NetBeans IDE thanks to the github plugin
from the community from the Kuiper belt
which
is which works well with netbeans 73 and
I think that in the soon will work just
good with the NetBeans 7 dot 4 which
will be releasing soon so let's switch
to the ID and show the creation of the
complete application in few minutes so I
am creating web applications its end
base and i will use j7j SF and of course
i am going to sprain faces it seeks it
seeks it seeks for the prime faces
library which is bundled they denied
NetBeans IDE so this will generate when
you skeleton of empty application and I
will generate the my entity classes
which will be created from the database
it's a kind of reverse engineering in
the advanced ID so ok I i will show it
as a new new artifact i want to create
and it's called in the persistence
category entity classes from database
but the simple wizard which i will i
will choose my datasource i'm going to
use glassfish sample database ok and i
will i will choose the tables to be
engineer reverse engineered to the two
entities so i'll specify some package oh
and this creates me all entities i need
for controlling my tables i selected
before so if you need just entities you
are done you are able to use them you
have prepared some named Clarice I think
that just cool and you can now create in
example session beans for your for your
entities or you can create
when you are just have pages as I
mentioned before and as i promised i
have already installed the prime faces
code generator cardigan a generator
which is able to generate primefaces
from the entities so I'll choose
entities to to protest and okay i'll
keep defaults probably some packages
will be nice to have here okay and this
creates me complete application which i
am able to deploy and run over the glass
fish or i think also another service but
i am using glass fish right now so let's
start the application and you yeah you
can see that it's a primefaces you can
feel i'm using primefaces component on
the feature is using parentheses
component and i am able to manage my
data in my database using this component
its end you you saw that it didn't take
much time and you are ready to update
this skeleton for your needs so of
course this is just culliton you need to
update the business logic or the
application logic or the template but
the this coding is already done for you
I think that's great Jared netbeans
feature okay so let's move to the to the
java ee 7 back and to the jsf to the two
and to the feature faces flow as is
written on the screen on the slides it's
about the collections of screens they
define start and with one's define start
and one or more exit points of of this
flow but of course it can much more than
just simple navigation through the
screens it is able to
invoke method for the particular action
or when you are entering or leaving your
faces from it can also even call another
flow and share parameters with it so
yeah for just for our information this
is one of places where the jss
specification is a bounded to CGI
because the because it defines flow
scope scope which is a cgi scope and
when you leave some flow the or beans
which are annotated with the flow scope
annotation with with the relevant ID of
the flow will be disintegrated so this
is new scope and it's provided by CDI
but works in the GS a-- the definition
of such flows can be done as usual in
phases configuration files and also we
are able to build such flows using the
flow builder which is available at the
java methods which are producing flow
definitions so i would like to show you
some navigation elements of the flows
how they work together flow scope define
bin and also i have prepared a sister is
a rugged rely bright as a jar so let's
move through samples again this is not
the one and okay i am going to some
sample registration sample of
registration and this is my first page
of the of the flow i'm going to specify
my name here and invoke action choose
avatar in the source you can see it
calls action choose avatar and my flow
definition in the credentials flow beam
says yeah he is
produces problem finishing and he is the
flow builder which I can I use here and
says okay I am going to action choose
avatar what is good is it direction for
uh-huh I should call flow core not so i
will call flow called avatar chooser and
i will pass these parameters there
basically it's my name so let's in going
invoke it and yeah my name my name was
was shared with the with the second
floor this is already second floor which
is called avatar chooser and it serves
just for choosing my avatar so after
saving my my second flow it goes back to
the first fall for to the credentials
flow and send back the avatar volume so
let's do it and well it's there so I'm
going to finish my my registration form
and oh it's probable person okay and
this is this is summary of my
registration and now when I invoke this
button it could store my data into the
database but and but it will release the
flow and all data will be gone because
all my data are defined in the person
beam which is flow scoped to this flow
ID so let's do it and you can see that
all my data are gone because our bins
represent disintegrated fortunately my
credentials flow has a finalizer node
which is doing to call this expression
language for the by exiting the phone so
it called store data method of the
storage bin and the storage bin says
okay for this method I'm going to save
all my data into the session scope in in
this bin and it also defines restore
data method which is loading the data
back from the session scope into the
fluoroscope been again from the yet into
the person beam which is from scope I
will load my data from the session scope
beam so when I invoke this section i'm
getting all my data back so yeah now you
can imagine that you will use these
flows as such a reverence because i
forgot to mention that the Avatar
chooser that that the author chooser is
defined in the jar library you are able
to create parts of your application
which can be shared over an across all
your web application you are using or
you are developing so you define
snippets for your application you
prepare it ok and let's move to do
something a little bit simpler which is
called annotation based component
registration as you know Jessa custom
components is a big feature because you
are able to generate huge source and
functionality using some your custom
component and let's take a look how this
new component registration can be done
using the newest jsf specification to
the tomb it actually eliminates or
remain removes the needs for the tag
library definition file everything what
you need is to annotate your component
with the faces component is it was
before but there are there were added
arguments like great tech flag just this
just this argument set to true means
that there will be in the
runtime-created tag tag handler for this
component and will be processed in the
runtime also you can specify namespace
or pet name parameters but these
parameters can be defined implicitly
namespace can be the default component
namespace and pack name can be derived
from the class name so I'm going to show
you how to how to how can you use it and
also that the faces component is became
in the JSF 22 CGI capable so you are
able to inject your classes into it
directly you don't need any workarounds
over the faces context Tessera so let's
show it in a sample okay so there is
primefaces core component and my to
elevate terrible-looking a good
component I didn't buy much I didn't
give it much time so the this is the
component which is defined locally in my
web application and you can see if I go
check the file that the registration is
done just by this this statement sorry
this statement so this that's the only
need you need to specify for the
registration of this component my second
component shows how to use it in the in
the library again so how to bundle it as
a jar and also defines explicitly tag
name for the for the component and for
the namespace so in my first place lat I
can show you that i am using some local
namespace by bound to this standard
namespace and this is my custom
namespace which i created by the
annotation and this is name of the
component which i specified in in this
in this class and as i promised i am
using CDI i am injecting
HTML content builder which is just a
helper class with utility methods for
building my HTML source by the jsf
component okay so I'm moving back to the
last epic format now so Charlotte 3000
introduced multi-part architecture at
with gzip to that too we now have the
input file components which is long
awaited I guess it's it's the standard
component and you can just do a upload
normal or you can just use an ajax for
the file upload for lower EGF versions
you can also use the prophecies
component you need to use the multi-part
form that on your formats sorted3 that
all should be on board for using the
input file at least i perfer RGS f-22 so
let me show me a sample
so this is file upload bit none ajax i'm
just selecting a file uploading it and
this is the component the h input file
its bind to the file upload bin that
file and it's the it's coming from
georges seurat HTTP part upload is just
you can just get the file content with
it need a new scanner piled up get input
stream and next and the comment button
is just buying to do to that upload
methods and i'm just getting for
instance here submitted file name so i
go back you can also use the ajax file
upload upload happens without the pass
back and here we can say that to the
comment button with the fa jack stack
just execute the file component and
render file and file main components
often up to the upload the input
component is the same it's just bind to
the drugs servlet HT parts which is an
interface and you can just do the same
for the upload you can also do the
validation on the file upload you can
just say that well get my file with the
validator attribute to the input file
component and here i am just saying that
the file should be at lee should should
not be over one kilobytes i'm just
adding a faces message to a list and i'm
just throwing annual data exception show
a validation exception to the user so
with prime pieces for that oh we are
ripped we haven't reimplemented the file
upload component is now etched more
enhanced its html5 file applause
we can just select from here and it will
do a preview on the on the for instance
in on the image you can just click and
upload the file it's the same use which
is the same it's like p file uploads you
can just bind any action listener the
file a petition to get the data you can
upload multiple files you can just
direct drop files from your desktop to
the to the browser yeah and for-profits
for that all this component is already
being shipped with the release candidate
and it's used uploaded file model like
javax.servlet.http.httpservletrequest
parameter and you don't need to define
it it's using you said to dot to under
the hood if you have the geocell to that
too it will use the internals for the
file uploads but you can just go native
with GF 2 dot or you can just go to come
as file upload if you like or you can
just lead its outer and primefaces will
decide if it's been using the GSF to dot
2 or commerce file upload so that's all
for the file uploads I think we are done
yeah and for the last night's and as I
said in the beginning I'm daughter of
primefaces cookbook and I put it out of
discounts for the session on me and the
use of the links that we used for
producing this session you can just grab
on the links also from through the get
up
I think we are down here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
