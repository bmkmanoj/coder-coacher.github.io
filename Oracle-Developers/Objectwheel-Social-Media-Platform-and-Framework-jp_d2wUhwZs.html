started object wheel started in the
summer of 2010 it's basically written in
javafx we started with version 1.3 I
guess you could probably turn that off
or are you going to need it on for the
show okay leave it on turn it down some
okay we started with the summer in the
summer of 2010 with javafx 1.3 and the
actual original idea for the software
startup changed pretty drastically we
then were one of the very early testers
of javafx even before it was beta don't
know exactly when that was but we were
involved with that and then now we're in
jdk 8 so all the stuff that you're going
to see today is using the very latest
build that's both good and bad and we're
able to take advantage of a lot of the
good stuff we have a very small team we
have basically one full-time programmer
a part-time programmer and then several
mentors and advisors my role is the
founder and project manager and the
overall vision I'm a big dreamer on
Twitter and that's my email address and
my name is Mike talent and i'm the CEO
potential users of the software is it's
a rad tool for drag and drop app
building it's a branding tool to publish
content from many different places and
then take that content and create a jnlp
link and be able to pull that content up
so you're basically able to take a link
that the application creates drop it on
an email a facebook a tweet whatever you
want and then that content comes up it's
also a social media platform an
aggregator a desktop sharing app and
it's very user definable we could end up
using it for full-blown development
platform for making apps faster it's
certainly not ready for that right now
but it's the draw
action where we were very interested in
going and then the entire framework and
backbone of it all uses semantic
technology so that the information is
being stored in these templates or
dashboards actually contains some
intelligence my background is I've been
in software since 1986 I've wrote a lot
of legacy software for many companies
all written in visual foxpro clipper so
forth a lot of fleet tracking stuff a
lot of GPS stuff I've extensive software
background and knowledge and I'm a very
heavy social media user and this
particular application I was the project
lead so this is all pretty much my idea
in my vision and I'm other other
developers are creating the creating the
program we're using JavaFX 8 we're using
an object database called DB 40 a lot of
you've never heard of it but it's a very
powerful Java pure object database it
also allows for embedded an embedded
database it has a very small footprint
we're using Nettie which is a socket
library we're using the cloud amazon ec2
we're not using any swing everything
you're going to see is pure JavaFX we're
using a search engine called black oh
and of course we're using web kit which
is part of JavaFX and various api's we
have some peer-to-peer pieces of the
software that they're not completed
there in various levels of completion
our future roadmap is integrating a lot
of third party AAP is getting enveloped
involvement from developers having
developers work on third-party widgets
possibly creating an app store we plan
on doing beta testing with users very
soon and beta testing with the designer
part of the application a little bit
later and we need a lot of feedback and
a lot of development developer
involvement this is a brain story map
probably very possible you can't read
any of that stuff but this gives you an
idea of
some of the things that people do when
they try to start a startup they try to
figure out what it is that they really
want to accomplish and this kind of
shows the various API is that we want to
link in and and kind of everything how
everything fit in and this was created
some time in 2011 this diagram this is a
mind map based on a central portion of
the software which is part of where it
gets its name object wheel some of the
stuff that relates to the product you
guys will not see today because we're in
various levels of patent creation and so
forth so we can't show everything but
there is a central thing called a
carousel which a lot of the things all
work off of and you can see from this
mind map a lot of different pieces to
the puzzle and some of this stuff isn't
used anymore but this is pretty much
brainstorming these are very early
screenshots of the application before it
was a rad tool all the stuff was
basically hand coded in javafx you can
see the wheel on the far left which is
the very very first thing that we did
that wheel turns and it goes to various
categories and the idea was these
categories would pull up a template
based on those types of categories and
that was the very early hour early
thoughts and then you see the very first
version of our screen designer it had
some elements that I like but it wasn't
wasn't very good so that was pretty much
thrown away and we started over and
these are some of the parts of the
program that make up the wheel the
wheels part of the user interface you
really won't see that much today but
this kind of shows you this different
parts of how to get to Twitter and how
to get to Amazon how to get to various
pieces on the search engine is built
into the actual app so you can choose to
do searches for blogs and do searches
for templates on vacations that relate
to Maui when you actually use the
application you'll start to understand
little bit more this is another early
screenshot of a template this is javafx
one of the things about the program is
its record based meaning DB 40 and not
this object database is embedded inside
the tool so there isn't the need to have
to have all this linking with the
database however we are in the process
of linking with other types of databases
such as sales force this is a very ugly
you probably can't even read it data
model um it's basically a data model of
of the object database and even though
it looks extremely small there's a lot
of really cool things going on there and
this is part of the brainstorming this
is an early you I creation of something
like that a mobile application might
look like and how it would interact with
the users taking the the same thing the
wheel into consideration how that would
all interface so this would be on a
phone this is another early drawing
shows various pieces of the puzzle we
were extremely into doing things
peer-to-peer at this point in time and
we've we haven't moved away from
peer-to-peer but we have put it on the
back burner this is our lead javafx
programmer his name's david binding he
was been working full time in this
project for more than two years and he's
in his early 30s and very talented guy
and he's in England this is another
familiar face he's a part time with us
and very active in the JavaFX community
he's in nepal here's a couple links for
you there's quite a few screenshots on
Quora I actually have a blog on Korra um
and you can see a lot of the screenshots
I i also have a blog at a big dreamer
wordpress com and then there's the
website object wheel
we have mentors and advisors Tim who's
well-known Java guy been around for a
lot of years has been involved for a
couple years with this project we have a
designer her name's Ella she's been more
of a consultant than actually doing a
lot of the designing gentleman by the
name Chris humble who's an architect for
DVD empire had a programmer gentleman by
the name of Daniel Albert who's an
executive at IBM is helping us a lot of
the testing and a lot of the database
design stuff and we have a gentleman by
the name of tom simpson which is a CTO
of cincinnati bell so he basically
handles all of the infrastructure for
cincinnati bell these affect the text
controls that you're going to see we
have a label a field a text area and a
date field the media controls that we
have is an embedded YouTube video which
is actually part of the web view we have
a web view browser we have a google map
view we have a template-based image view
and we have a field-based image view and
we also have a google maps interface our
general controls are a boolean button a
radio button hyperlink just a regular
everyday button a slider which is
actually a control it can be linked to
other objects without programming we
have a tab view which can contain lots
and lots of stuff including templates
themselves we have a data list our
shapes are circles squares polygons and
lines with arrows and you'll get to see
all that stuff soon I'm just kind of
running through these slides are extra
bonus features is we are templates are
shareable one to one or one too many so
if you have a template on your screen
you're able to share it with multiple
people at the same time or to share it
with one person the browser inside the
product has web scraping so you can drag
pictures and text and other things from
a web browser into the actual tool
everything
drag-and-drop we have grouping and
saving so you can actually create
objects on the screen and save them to a
group name the menu has its own internal
search you can freeze objects and it
creates a jnlp which can then be used to
pull up this content our custom controls
is a bleak Oh search control and a
microphone control things that are not
obvious is data defining the data that
defines a templates really small so
you'd think that it would be complicated
and really big or the file would be
bigger it's actually really really small
just a text file or it's an embedded
database file doesn't take up much room
at all sharing could be real time we
wanted it to there's a slight delay
we've done some experience experience
with a webcam and it's works pretty good
everything is record based so when you
see things you have to understand
there's depth to what you're seeing each
template or dashboard has can have one
or multiple records associated with it
connections between objects are all
drag-and-drop there's a semantics part
of the data model and security is part
of the data model as well and we have
encryption included there's going to be
a time for questions at the end of
course so I'll encourage that and we are
using JDK 8 bill 108 which is a pretty
bleeding edge I think it's been out just
a few days things that you can't see
right now is integration with Facebook
and Twitter and SoundCloud and other
other things you can tweet or email or
post a jnlp link which is basically a
URL link we have controls that are
specific to iPhone the reason why it's
called object wheel isn't really obvious
right now we have cookies inside the
webview it which saves the sites doesn't
work with all sites but it does work
with quite a few of them this is
something brand-new we have GPS and
camera pull from mobile we have a chat
with widget and video
conference widget Salesforce integration
how semantics all fit in encryption and
peer-to-peer stuff so these are things
that aren't done or in various levels of
completion that I won't be showing we
have built some things that are really
bugging we have a grid control to
arrange things we have the ability align
objects it's got lots of different
problems because we keep adding new
features and add new controls and we
probably should do alignment towards the
end we have a listview we're able to
play music and mp4 videos and we have a
slide view and we have a thing called a
carousel and a collage this is the files
so you can see that the main two jars
one is for megs and the other ones five
megs and this is the other jar files
that we're currently using you can see
controls FX in there and nettie DB 40 a
few other important jars so what I'm
going to do next is um answer some
questions if you have any on the slides
or I'm just going to go right into the
presentation of the product itself yes
sure got it so the the one sweet spot
that we're going to be targeting very
much so is the ability to make a
dashboard and typical person uses
Facebook uses Gmail uses Pinterest uses
a few different things and they want to
then sit in front of that dashboard all
day long and browse the Internet be able
to get to their various sites easily and
then be able to post things on those
various sites like an aggregator without
having to leave so that's one sweet spot
that we're very interested in there are
people that are maybe a soccer mom that
wants to see their dashboard look a
certain way there's another person that
might be a stock trader or somebody
that's involved in investment stuff they
would want theirs to look another way
and then there might be the the old lady
that just cares about a few things like
being able to get to their their
daughters or their own Facebook fade
without thinking about anything it's
just all there also that dashboard you
can pull up on a Linux box a Mac or a
Windows machine and in the future
hopefully a tablet and everything scales
automatically so you don't really have
to worry about the platform or the or
the screen size that you're running on
because everything in the entire program
scales everything down from every object
to every formed every button every
picture everything so it will be very
easy to you know go walk over to a
screen at work that happens to be a lot
bigger maybe two screens or a laptop at
home with a very small screen or ideally
if javafx ends up running on other
platforms a tablet or even a phone so
that's one sweet spot that we're
interested in the other sweet spot would
be people that want to create
applications that are the same type of
people that are using Microsoft Access
and other rad tools today people that
love products like that but are not able
to run them on multiple platforms
because it's only supported with one
platform being able to create an
application and then in the future as
they become a much more skilled
programmer be able to do more things or
maybe prototype an application that
really does work for an enterprise or
for somebody and then be able to then
say hey this is what job FX can do and
here and then hey let's create this and
it's much more powerful than a mock-up
tool because you're using real real
controls in the language so those are
probably our first two sweet spots we
have had a lot of interest with people
that have brands that want to take their
their content that's available on the
internet on YouTube videos on websites
and then put it on one place as a
package this electronic content give us
somebody a URL on their on their
business card and then hand it to them
and then they'll have all that content
come to them that pulls from lots of
different places and then when people
are looking at this content to be able
to chat to them to be able to talk to
them kirkwood ski resorts is one of our
customers that's really interested in
being able to have a changing content
very log that was created by a non
programmer so hopefully that answered
your question any more questions all
right so the screen resolution isn't
really good so I'm having a little bit
of problem seeing this one thing to keep
in mind is our user interface is not
super pretty we know that we focus more
on what the application can do then we
have making it pretty so here we have
two controls we have a basically a
microphone control and these objects can
be moved around and we have a map so we
can go ahead and go in and change the
city in in here if we want it to
and it will go to a different city and
we can scale in and out and this also
can be moved various places and so forth
this is a recorder testing 123 testing
testing testing 123 captioning half
think a thing ah we could hear it hello
there is anybody there hello hello there
anybody there yeah okay so basically
this is a custom control that was made
using the same object so this is in fact
a button this is a label and they're
there this particular these controls was
built from a group of controls so we're
going to go ahead and go into another
one this is a an iphone obviously a
bigger one and a small one so we're
going to go ahead and we're going to go
into our controls in here and I'm going
to find my shapes and we're going to go
ahead and drag this over we're going to
try to drag this over
alright so we're going to change that
and then we're going to go into the
properties of this and we're going to
change the background to white alright
so we got a white background very good
and we're going to also find a text
field put that right there and we're
going to find a kind of hard with the
way the screen is laid out a label okay
so we have a text box and we have a
label so I'm going to go ahead and type
something in here and i'm going to add
another record okay so as you can go if
i go previous record it's mike if i add
a new record we're going to put in Tom
I'm then going to take and add a browser
over here
very good okay and this browser window
is not going to size exactly the way I
want it to
it
let's move this outside make it bigger
so I can see what I'm doing I think we
have internet here so this should be
working yay something's working okay
good alright now we're going to resize
this and we're going to make it much
smaller actually we're going to go ahead
and add a second we're going to go back
to this record some mouse is driving me
nuts okay so now we have two URLs stored
inside of a web view and this is a
record number one and this is record
number two so one is running msn and
runs running CNN by then click on this
is actually a browser running can go
backwards and forwards if I wanted to so
let's go ahead and take a control here
and let's add a an image control alright
so there's an image control we're going
to put that right there and then we're
going to go ahead and look on the
computer for Duke oh we got Duke very
good let's go ahead and go back a record
and we're going to find another picture
there's a picture of beds so now I'm
going to go forward a record there's
Duke and I'm going to go back a record
and you can see everything is changing
for us if I resize this everything can
get really small and certainly a lot
bigger and all the fonts and all the
buttons and everything are all resizing
I can then take this object if I wanted
to and that there's things like
brightness and saturation and hue and I
can
like a slider over here if I wanted to
there's a slider and I'm going to take
this and I'm going to link it to that
and now my um my basically my picture
inside my that actually works changing
our brightness and go forward ok so it's
changing the brightness for that one so
we can then take this a little bit
further we're going to go ahead and go
to a pull up another template let's find
our templates now remember also these
are shareable so we're going to go ahead
and pull up this one so here's a YouTube
control when we set out to build a line
me we try to envision on as a giant
sandbox we just love our giant sandbox
we just go out there and build whatever
we can think of now I'm going to pull up
my browser we're going to go into
YouTube
okay and we're going to put in mountain
biking and we're going to find one and
theoretically we'd have more screens
we're going to drag it over there and
now we're playing so we basically
dragged a YouTube video from a browser
dropped it into a control it's a webview
browser yep yep so we're not using the
API right now for YouTube this is
actually a webview browser inside so go
ahead and pull up another template we
already had that one on the screen all
right so now we have right here is we
have a tap pain with three websites in
it and this last tab pain has a template
that's actually part of another another
template so we've embedded a template
inside tapping that's why you have extra
next records and add records which these
buttons we obviously could delete but
this is showing you that a templates
been put inside of a template which is
pretty cool this also is resizable
everything's resizing so here's our
template inside of a template now if I'm
in this particular template and I add
another record it's going to add a
record related to this template but if
I'm in the tab pain template I had a
record it's going to add another one so
it's kind of confusing to keep and make
sense in your head now we've just
created a blank tab pain and i'm going
to go ahead and go to google
alright now we're going to scrape google
and put it in our tab paint and now
we're going to do the same thing with
CNN so we've just added two URLs to a
tap pain and we go back a record we've
got our three URLs which are three tabs
in this tab pain this particular one has
only two let's find another template
alright so this one is showing a
basically a an image that has reflection
turned on and this one is showing an
image which is attempting to do some
some cool things that we have like
special effects so here we have drop
shadow effect this is reflection let's
go back over to this one let's change
our reflection off there's a reflection
off here's our drop shadow this is our
color for our background we're going to
make it red we're going to add another
color we're going to make this one white
so now we've basically have gradients
going from red to white behind this
particular image
alright so let's find another one here
alright so now we have three different
videos all playing at the same time
we had another record down here
well they
the videos but that's what it's should
be doing so we could have multiple
records with multiple videos on them and
so forth we've added search to our menu
bar so if i put in button in here it's
going to go to the first button we've
got this button and this button and that
button these are all buttons should have
more information about what they are but
this is taking the controls and
searching from inside of it and yes
we're aware that our user interface is
not very pretty right now so what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to go to a
different template and this particular
template we're going to get a little bit
of help from somebody else hopefully now
this is a template that he created all
right are you there David yeah great
okay well I'm going to have you tried to
change the template that you created
from from Europe there okay you gave me
this template but we're going to see if
some ghosts will run it so I'm going to
minimize this you're kind of being put
here on the spot so if you could just
move anything around on the first record
that would be great change the picture
if you wanted to of that fish on the
right change some of the wording do
something anything okay so he's
basically using the design or moving
things around and then he'll push a
button called upload and since I have
been given a sharing right to this
particular template at some point soon
tell us when you do that David ok this
is David binding he's in Wales and he's
my lead programmer on this project
yeah he's right there
you need to do something fairly fast
this is a live demo David have you
updated a picture no I swapped the
picture to fish and the fish description
around you did what I swap the positions
of the the two main pieces they fish
description on the picture of fish I'm
not just moved something I have oh you
have moved something no it doesn't look
like it's working let's go ahead and
close it and I'm going to go ahead and
re-launched it
and things don't always work in a real
demo but we'll see here
so what did you change David the picture
to fish should now be on the left and
the fish inscription should now be on
the right it doesn't look like it worked
but we believe oh well this one didn't
have a picture on on the second record
before so that's new we want something
to change in front of our eyes you've
got about two more minutes David make
something change maybe the text or the
or change the size of a box what if that
didn't would have to be surprised if
anything else did we've been changing
the app so much sharing I think we're
going to give up on sharing right now
but just rest assured the charing is
working it's just very buggy right now
thank you David all right yes go ahead
it's the it's this the object database
is being shared and when you're when you
get an invite from somebody basically
anything that they change will change in
front for you yes correct correct
correct right you don't have to really
do anything as long so the use case
would be multiple people involved in a
group that are working on a soccer mom
that's working on pictures of their son
at a certain game and they're arranging
pictures and adding pictures and
changing things around and people go in
throughout the day and want to see you
know if it needs change it's like a
website changes but instead it's the
soccer mom changing the stuff and then
maybe at five o'clock they all decide to
chat with each other and all ten of them
are talking about the game that just
happened what they liked about it you
know what the kids did wrong about it
everybody's chatting because they belong
to this group and they're all sharing
this individual template so that's the
use case
and one person has this Tiger Claw
right right they're sharing the template
they could correct correct or they could
just click a button it would launch this
new dashboard they could just launched
the new dashboard or they could just see
a piece of this dashboard maybe the
pictures so if a widget was created that
was a shared image widget and everybody
started using the shared image wits to
post pictures of a game that that shared
image widget could be on multiple
templates on multiple dashboards but it
would still get pictures from everybody
that was using that that particular
object and they could use that to post
pictures on facebook at the same time
because if the object was smart enough
to know these pictures need to arrive on
Facebook then by default when any new
object went into this container it would
automatically go to Facebook
automatically tweet whatever if that if
that intelligence was put in there more
questions okay
what we're going to do now is I'm going
to show you scraping so we're going to
go ahead and create a brand new template
and we're going to go in and put a web
browser right here okay now we're going
to add a image
we're going to go to Google now if all
this was set up by somebody else they
wouldn't be doing any of this you just
be loading their template so until the
user interface gets a lot better we
don't anticipate people using this
designer so I typed in panda and then I
clicked on images
and I'm going to push this scraper and
I'm going to drag this image from a
website into it only looks like it like
me to do one so if i added another
record i could have had my template stay
frog pictures
err ok all right so we have a web view
that has a frog on one picture or on one
record and a panda on the other that
were scraped out we're going to go ahead
and go into a thing that we have called
cookies and we're going to load up this
screen and this is something new that we
recently got
okay so we just lick loaded the cookies
template
and what's supposed to happen actually
did happen as a miracle all right so we
got Facebook loaded I didn't have to put
my username and password in or anything
it automatically loaded on this next
record it's loading amazon is having
problems with Amazon this is Twitter we
have ebay note Lotus that's logged in as
Mike so we're right now working on the
Ajax part of the cookies the sites that
use Ajax don't seem to work as good so
what we're completing is there is no if
nothing internal right now for a webview
to be able to store your username and
passwords so when you go to a website
and you put in your facebook login and
password a normal Chrome browser or
normal internet explorer browser saves
your cookies and it knows your login
stuff so when you go to your desktop
down the road and you go into Facebook
you don't have to put all that stuff in
so one of the things that will prevent
people from using a browser that's not
Chrome or Internet Explorer is they
don't want to put all that stuff in over
and over and over again so by using a
javafx webview component with cookies
built in with the stuff stored in a
database you basically could log in as
your username and password take that
information and walk to any machine any
tablet anything that was running that
template and all your stuff would be
there and you just be able to get into
it that's what I basically just
demonstrated right well yeah basically
what I did was I loaded the template the
template went to the database found the
cookies it associated with that website
and then launched the website so i
didn't have to do any login or whatever
so that's really good because once you
get your environment setup on the web
you don't constantly want to be doing
that over and over again but one extra
added benefit is being able to have this
dashboard work on all these different
platforms without hafen to remember
that stuff so when you go to Amazon you
want to buy something it automatically
knows all your stuff and when you click
on purchase now it's going to buy that
product you didn't have to log all that
stuff in and you're not using Chrome or
Internet Explorer you're using a
dashboard that has amazon on it to do
some shopping you're going to show your
your girlfriend some new shoes that she
needs to get you're going to show your
wife where they need to stay on a
vacation or whatever so you could share
that web view of that browser yeah yeah
so basically that as it relates to
security is that we thought of two
different ways one is you're going to
look at the CPU that that particular
login and password was done the first
time around and then we're going to
remember that machine as a valid machine
that can get into this website and use
these cookies the other way would just
be the username and password of the
actual object wheel platform would be
tied to that so if somebody gets your
dashboard they're not automatically
going to be able to get your gmail your
facebook because the system knows that
it's a different computer that's never
been done before so it's going to
require you the first time to put that
information in and then once you've done
at that first time then just like
Facebook it recognizes that device and
says okay this is a good device and and
so forth so that's kind of how that how
that would be done we could even use the
serial number of the CPU or something or
the IP address or something even more
specifically we wanted to but yeah we
don't want to be able to hand a
dashboard to somebody that has a hundred
websites that you go to all day long
with all your personal stuff in there
and you know and so forth that would be
would be really bad
what we have found is that I know that
we're one of the people using Java FX's
webview more than anybody else so we've
really been involved with submitting a
lot of bug reports and a lot of the
javascript stuff has been broken and
they've been fixing a lot of it so I've
probably sent tech support more than 100
bug requests that relate to various
websites that do or don't work yeah yeah
yeah so pretty much that was one of the
reasons why we went to jdk 8 is because
nothing was being fixed in javafx 222
for a lot of that stuff we also found
that JDK runs significantly faster so we
were very happy by the speed
improvements of it so that's that's
really good so I'm going to go ahead and
just do a little bit of goofing around
now I'm going to move this over so that
I can actually sit down so I'll be a lot
more gonna sit down right here and I'm
just gonna goof around last 10 minutes
and make some stuff i'll still be
plugged in it's really hard for me to
actually make stuff that turning leaned
okay all right so what we're going to do
first is we are going to create a new
template all right so we get a basically
an empty screen if you resize any size
that we want when you run the screen you
are not getting all this extra garbage
up here okay you would just get the raw
string and everything else will be
removed that you didn't want so you're
still seeing the designer mode so when
you actually ran a screen or you ran an
applet all that stuff would be gone so
we're going to go ahead and go in the
designer and we're going to put some
controls on here so first we're going to
put a button right here and we can
resize the button click in the button
different size if we wanted to and we
can go out to my
I need two screens all right make the
best of it though so here's Duke
all right Duke is going to end up being
in a button I hope is not going in the
button there we go all right so dukes in
my button now we're going to go ahead
and go in here and change the background
and we're going to resize this buttons
still a button by the way now we're
going to take our hover over and see if
that does anything oh sure what's the
end of mine um well it's pretty much
trying to show you some of the controls
and what you could do without
programming that's the primary thing so
you notice I haven't wrote it in code
and when I put my mouse over the top
it's actually doing something so um
that's the primary well you really
haven't seen any of that so we're going
to go ahead and put a reflection in here
and so now we have reflection don't
quite know what that B is all about but
we're going to go ahead and get rid of
that here's drop shadow and we're going
to add a red with a white hover style so
now when I put my mouse over the top of
it I've got a gradient going from red to
white so one other buttons what other
things we're going to do let's go ahead
and take a hyperlink and put that right
there all right what are we going to use
with that well let's go ahead and take
our fish and we're going to drag our
fish which right now
put it right here so now when I click on
this button it's loading fish I go back
to this talk to another template yes it
did all right so now we're going to go
ahead and so go ahead new problem for
all it's okay you could theoretically
change the name of that bunch into
something else such as whatever and then
when you click on that button to load
another template so these templates can
have lots and lots of templates we're
giving them ability to customize their
dashboard and ideally this would be a
development frame book similar to seem
builder bought would be for novice
intermediate programmers you had ideas
there's no reason why we can't put Java
code under a button that does something
similar to what some of the other guys
have done some of the other rad tools
there's if somebody has a show here at
booth that does that so you should
relate to I was that
so you create a dashboard you create a
dashboard and you type in the word tow
truck companies and then you make a
button somebody made a button a
third-party developer made about or we'd
made of the button and the word tow
truck companies or the word salons that
button goes out and finds all of the
salons on yellow book and pulls all
those names up and fills in the template
now you got a sales transaction we will
actually start making phone calls with
that off or that button could make a
skype phone call if you wanted it to
that that button could send out an email
of the template for the picture on it
could pose to another platform there's a
lot of things that it could be done and
it's very hard to wrap your head around
what this is because it's a lot of
things sure sure
sure got it yeah sure so right now there
is this new there's these there's these
people that believe that your content
you create all day long and social media
you'll own nobody else will on it you'll
own it it'll be on your hard drive
you'll own it nobody else will have
access to it it'll be private it'll be
encrypted you're going to then decide
what people get to see and don't get see
you're going to decide what you share
with people what you don't share with
people and you're not going to
constantly be going just to Facebook
doing all your stuff yeah it's both it's
both GUI building and it's both a
dashboard for for creating content
a rad tool GUI builder so first of all
let's say that I wanted to make a
dashboard for my mom who's in her 70s
okay she only cares about pictures of
her grandkids sending an email to her
daughter and maybe three websites that's
all she cares about that's all she'll
ever do that's all she ever wants so in
an afternoon I could make a dashboard
drop it through her email she could
click on one button and she would have
this thing that I created for her okay
it would go to these sites for her it
would allow her to still talk to her
grandkids she could write to her grant
you could see these pictures of her over
chant and she'd have to do anything
because somebody made this very simple
dashboard now the nice thing about it is
it pulled content from multiple places
it didn't require if she was not a
Facebook user that's okay if she was
only a Twitter user it's okay if she
only like Pinterest were only like email
it could be very tailored to what she
wanted so that's the dashboard
aggregator tool that's private that's
private so when she took a picture and
dragged it from the internet or she took
a picture with her camera or whatever
they could be running a nap on it that
would create content and store it on
this dashboard everybody could see it so
I don't I believe personally that social
media the future is going to be a client
it is not going to be a website it's
going to be a client and it's also going
to be user definable so you're going to
be able to define your dashboard any way
you want I also believe that when you
create content that face pic where
somebody's going to have to know this
is about a vacation in maui this is
about fall boots that I really want it
can't be just 70 characters of
information in a in a in a textbox there
needs to be intelligence involved so
these templates have this intelligence
and that's one of the thing yep yep
no problem yes it was thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
