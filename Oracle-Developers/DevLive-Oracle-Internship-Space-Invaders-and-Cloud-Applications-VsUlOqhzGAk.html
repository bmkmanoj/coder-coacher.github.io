session of the day here at Oracle code
London and I'm very excited we got the
very young entrepreneurs interns and a
whole lot more so to my left here I got
Daniel to go so I apologize Benjamin
Scott and then the fella eager did I get
that kind of approximately right okay
all right then so guys you've come out
with some very interesting new apps
using the cloud can we just start off
with yourself Daniel talk a little bit
about what you've come up with yeah
basically I've made a space invaders
game using Java cloud service and we are
coded in myself using Java and NetBeans
and connect it to Java cloud service so
that people these appeal so have the
service can ease it on the water okay
Benjamin you want to talk a little bit
about Europe yes so we we took Anki
overdrive star Turkish which is basic
kids toy and basically integrated
articles cloud so we wanted to show how
you can integrate our cups clouds with
either a small toy or an enterprise
system it's what we've done it sucked it
up to Oracle's IOT clouds and we're
looking for outliers and anomalies as
the cards go around and as soon as they
do it sends an alert to an emergency
drone to take off and reacts to the
event okay Leslie you want to just talk
a little bit about I know you've been
working with Benjamin and the LuthorCorp
where they helped them as much as I can
with the Yankee card mo trying to make
sure it all works which isn't always the
case okay
which school do you go to by the way so
I'm at the University of Liverpool but
I'm currently on placement here at
Oracle for a year like rest of the guys
and I apologize I've used the temps cool
side I didn't need to under 8 what
you're doing we in the u.s. school
college and university get all merged
into one so the unit Liverpool rul
Liverpool
soccer fan also wish I could say I was
I'm not that much into soccer liberal
craftiness about the Beatles as well
uh-huh they're know by study business
management so I don't actually have much
of a technical background although it's
instinct to come in and work with bed
and learn about the Yankee cars and
Heidi right so Benjamin which school are
you I mean which university are you a so
I'm studying at Cardiff Metropolitan
University uh-huh but again I'm based
the fellows based in reading at in the
Oracle headquarters I'm based here in
London Daniel's also based in London a
little bit change to me from Cardiff
demanding burger and a good experience
what I mean sounds like a very
interesting application what's been the
highlight of your internship I think
probably getting to work across a lot of
different lines of business I've been
lucky that my managers expose me to
loads of different technologies that
previously I hadn't have much experience
do but having done the internship it's
really led to expand my
technological knowledge and that's it
definitely I forgot actually ask you
this what's been so far the highlight of
your internship I hate the coffee what
been said by fingers the flexibility you
get working at Oracle as I see coming in
as interns we get such a high level
inside and society into all the business
operations and the IC and we get to work
on some really cool projects like that's
why we're here and getting to spend days
outside of the office and doing all
these cool things really how have you
found Oracle code interesting like that
I don't know much about it been
interesting to learn okay
so Danielle about you tell us a little
bit about your school and your
university I'll get it right on you yeah
I'm from the University of Greenwich how
do you compare science I learn it as in
Greenwich medium time yeah okay thinking
time yet okay um yeah the computer
science which is a bit district for
mostly interned a lot of them are
business whereas I'm seeing
a lot more technical so I've been trying
to kind of fit my toes in as many
technical areas as I possibly can but
then in contrast for these two they're
looking for the technical side of things
I'm looking at the business side of
things because I'm not used to that kind
of stuff so it's been good to be in such
a big company and actually see what it's
like well I think you come to a great
where the way I described article is
it's like a company of companies because
it started off in one place and then you
know they've assimilated so many other
companies and they're kind of grown with
that but what's been kind of the
highlight of your internship yes I would
say I just want to say exactly the same
G oh girl you should have copyrighted
with what you said I know it's working
for such a big company really and just
getting that insight into so many
different areas while Internet of Things
I don't know about any idea about us and
now that's what I want to do but in my
final year project and it's been good
just to inspire me to do lots of
different things
okay all right so so Daniel Benjamin
Leslie thank you so much for coming by
wishing you all the best balls with your
internship and then your future careers
and I hope you'll come back to article
thank you all right thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
