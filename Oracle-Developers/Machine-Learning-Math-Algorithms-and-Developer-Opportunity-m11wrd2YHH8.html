Code 2018 in New York City,
I'm Bob Rhubart with the Oracle developer
community and my guest for this segment
is Heli Helskyhao. Good to talk to you
again.
Likewise.
Your session is titled &quot;Machine Learning in Action.&quot;
We hear so much about machine learning and artificial intelligence,
but the terms, from my perspective, are used almost interchangeably.
What's the difference between the two?
Machine learning is part of artificial intelligence, which is a larger thing.
And machine learning is part of it.
OK.
That's how I would describe it.
But they're both equally interesting to me
and I think they should be interesting
to every developer because that
artificial intelligence machine learning
it's here now today and in the future so
that's something we should all know and learn.
So,  major opportunities for developers.
Totally!
What are some of the obstacles?
I know you and I have talked in the past on a similar subject and you
had mentioned once that some people are put off from machine learning because of
the expectation that there's gonna be a
lot of math.
Yes. So a lot of people say
&quot;When I was in school I was so bad
in math, and I never learned anything and
and I I just can't do this machine
learning. It's about algorithms and math
and so it's definitely not my thing.&quot;
But it's about a lot of other things, as  well.
It's not just about math. There are
so many different areas that you can you
can use your skills. So if you don't like
math -- by the way accidentally you might
end up liking it,  too -- when you do machine learning you might learn it actually.
For example, my elder son was
building a computer game and he realized
that using algorithms and the math
skills that he had actually reduced the
code to very short code.
So originally the program was very long,  but when he understood that he could actually use that
piece of math and that algorithm to do
the whole job, it was suddenly very small.
Your background is in database
management and performance.
What drew you into machine learning?
Data!
OK! It's all about the data.
It's all about data, understanding more about your data.
Getting knowledge from your data is done by machine learning.
So I always think that data is the thing.
And that's why I started with databases and database management and that kind of thing.
And now the same thing is here, because I understand data is the power.
So knowing machine learning will give
you even more power over your data.
Can you describe a typical use case for
machine learning?
Oh, there are so many!
In my presentation I talk about Facebook as an example.
So when we go to Facebook, even though we have exactly the same friends and so on,
we see different things, which are specialized or personalized for our needs,
taking into consideration the that fact that I'm a woman, you're a man,
this is my age, this is your age, this is the situation in my life and so on.
So they have general algorithms they use, and they personalize it to your data.
So we will see different things in the stream.
So Facebook is a very classic example.
Chatbots are certainly a very popular topic.
You can't open a browser without seeing something about chatbots.
One of the things that I've learned in talking with people who have
expertise in that particular field is
that chatbot development is very
much a language-oriented thing, which 
makes obvious sense.
But that can be somewhat of a tough challenge for developers in that you're
not just thinking in terms of code. In developing  chatbots you have to be
thinking in terms of language.
Is there a there a similar aspect to machine learning?
A similar sort of hurdle that developers would have to overcome?
There's a lot of new things they need to
learn,  and to my surprise that's a problem for some people.
For me, it's strange, because why would you come to IT if
you're not interested in learning?
Right.
Yes, I think this is a great opportunity to learn new things.
And chatbots, the MOOC that Oracle has, it's beautiful.
I took it and I got so excited about it. It was fantastic.
So everybody go and take that MOOC. It's really great.
I think there are a lot of businesses who could make use of those chatbots,
because there's a lot of customer service work that could be done with just chatbots.
You don't have to have anybody, really,
like ordering a pizza, or, well actually,
actually the first time I ordered a pizza using a chatbot I got the wrong pizza.
But whatever.  I'm sure they have improved it already.
Then I tried to give them feedback and the feedback form didn't work.
After all, I gave them so much feedback using Twitter...
Just think, it won't be too much longer before not only will you be
ordering from a chatbot,  but some sort of android will be delivering the pizza.
Yes! And I think that would be great, too.
You don't have to give tips to a robot.
I was just wondering, as a customer, can you stiff a robot?
Can you tell me about any projects you're currently working on that involve machine learning?
In Finland we are quite cautious with machine learning yet.
There are projects going on,  but people are very quiet with them because you never
know if there's gonna be a success or
not.
So it's better be quiet until it's a good success.
So I think most of the projects like that, not allowed to talk about it yet.
But what I'm working on now is my PhD, which is related to machine learning.
That's another driver for me to learn it.
So I'm building an API to understand my data better before saving it to the database.
So I understand what I have before I save it,
so I will be able to use it better when I finally need it.
One of the problem now is we have those silos,
people are saving all kinds of different data in different places and
then when they try to use the data it's
impossible because it's so fragmented in different silos.
I'm interested in learning about your evolution in your career.
When you first entered IT what sort of work were you doing?
First of all, when I came to IT,  that's a long story because quite a lot of people were shocked.
Because that was the last thing people were expecting me to do.
A lot of people said &quot;you're gonna be a medical doctor, you're gonna be a lawyer, you're gonna be...&quot;
Then I became an IT nerd! So that was the first shock.
Why was there that gap between the expectations and what you actually wanted to do?
Yeah, that's a good question.
Well, when I went to university I actually didn't even know about computer science.
So I wasn't even thinking about that.
I was thinking to go to economics, but I
missed that,  I can't remember,
0.00 whatever points that was the
the minimum that you can actually miss
getting your your place in the school,
and instead I went to study mathematics.
Afterwards I realized it would have been
a big mistake to really go to economics
because that is not my thing, but I went
to study mathematics and people told me
that you should take some computer
science because that's the future.
That's ok, why not? Studying has always been easy for me.
So I took the computer science, and I didn't understand anything.
I was sitting in a class and I just had no idea what the teacher is saying.
So I took the next course, same thing.
It was a different teacher, so it could not have been a bad teacher.
It was probably a bad student.
And I took all the the sub courses you can take as a student,
because I was a math major,  and the same for every course.
I was thinking that there must be something I don't understand.
And I went to the professor and I said, &quot;I want to change my major to computer science,&quot;
and he was like, &quot;What? You are so good in math, but you are no good in computer science.&quot;
&quot;Why do you want to change?&quot;
I said, &quot;Exactly! That's why I want to change!&quot;
&quot;I want to learn it. There must be something.&quot;
What was the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment for you?
Databases.
OK.
When I got the first real database course I was, &quot;Ah! This is what I'm here for!&quot;
&quot;This is my thing!&quot; So it was databases
that actually brought me here.
My first job, I don't know how I got the job.
There were  like 500 applicants for the job,
and they took me and I wasn't even
graduated yet .
I was just a student with low grades, and they took me, and I started as a developer,
and that's actually when I first saw Oracle in real life. I saw it in University, of course.
We were using Oracle in university.
But in real life this employer was using Oracle and Forms, a very, very long time ago.
Forms and Reports.
And then I started as a developer, but I
knew that I would like to be a DBA.
So I kind of changed that quite fast. And I was always doing database designing
because I kind of find it natural to my
brain.
It's something, my training choice, and ever since it's been database designing, developing, DBA
all kind of different kind of things. But as long as it's with data,
because I find it very fascinating to have data.
You're pursuing your PhD in what field?
Data.
Data. Imagine that.
It's about big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning,  that kind of area.
How much farther you have to go?
Two more years to go. I'm done with my studies,
but I have my research and my articles to do, my writing.
Very fun.
It's always good to talk to you.
One of the nicest people in IT!
And she comes from Finland, where the
winters are, compared to what we had
yesterday, it was actually worse in New
York than in Finland.
Yes, yesterday was bad.
But that's all in the past now.
Yeah.
Again, thank you for stopping by and talking to me.
Good luck with your with your PhD.
